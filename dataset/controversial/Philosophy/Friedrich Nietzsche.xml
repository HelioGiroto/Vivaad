He wrote [[critic]]al texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy, and science, displaying a fondness for [[metaphor]], [[irony]], and [[aphorism]]. 

Nietzsche's key ideas include the &quot;[[death of God]]&quot;, the ''[[Übermensch]]'', the [[eternal recurrence]], the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] dichotomy, [[perspectivism]], and the [[Will to Power|will to power]]. Central to his philosophy is the idea of &quot;life-affirmation&quot;, which involves questioning of all doctrines that drain life's expansive energies, however socially prevalent and radical those views might be.&lt;ref&gt;Wicks, R.

Retrieved on: 2011-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence remains substantial within philosophy, notably in [[existentialism]], [[Postmodernism|post-modernism]], and [[post-structuralism]], as well as outside it. His radical questioning of the value and objectivity of truth has been the focus of extensive commentary, especially in the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] tradition.

Nietzsche began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. In 1869, at the age of twenty-four he was appointed to the Chair of Classical [[Philology]] at the [[University of Basel]] (the youngest individual to have held this position), but resigned in the summer of 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Brobjer, Thomas. &quot;Nietzsche's philosophical context: an intellectual biography&quot;, p. 42 University of Illinois Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of forty-five in 1889 he suffered a collapse and a complete loss of his mental faculties. The breakdown had been ascribed to atypical general [[paralysis]] attributed to [[tertiary syphilis]], but this diagnosis has since come into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernd|first=Magnus|title=Nietzsche, Friedrich|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414670/Friedrich-Nietzsche|work=Encyclopedia Britannica Online|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897, then under the care of his sister until his death in 1900. 

His sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], acted as [[curator]] and editor of Nietzsche's manuscripts during his illness. She was married to a prominent [[German nationalism#1871 to World War I, 1914–1918|German nationalist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemite]], [[Bernhard Förster]], and she reworked some of Nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her husband's ideology, often in ways contrary to Nietzsche's opinions, which were strongly and explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism (see [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism|Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism]]). Through Förster-Nietzsche's editions, Nietzsche's name became associated with [[Militarism#Germany|German militarism]] and [[Nazism]], but twentieth century scholars have worked hard to counteract the abuse of Nietzsche's philosophy by this ideology and rediscover the original writings of Nietzsche, unedited by his sister.

==Life==

===Youth (1844–1869)===
Born on October 15, 1844, Nietzsche grew up in the small town of [[Röcken]], near [[Leipzig]], in the [[Prussia]]n [[Province of Saxony]]. He was named after King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]], who turned forty-nine on the day of Nietzsche's birth. (Nietzsche later dropped his given middle name, &quot;Wilhelm&quot;.){{Sfn | Kaufmann | 1974 | p = 22}}  Nietzsche's parents, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche (1813–49), a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]] and former teacher, and Franziska Oehler (1826–97), married in 1843, the year before their son's birth, and had two other children: a daughter, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], born in 1846, and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848. Nietzsche's father died from a brain ailment in 1849; Ludwig Joseph died the next year, at age two. The family then moved to [[Naumburg]], where they lived with Nietzsche's paternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters. After the death of Nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own [[Nietzsche-Haus, Naumburg|house]], now a museum and Nietzsche study centre.

[[File:Nietzsche1861.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Nietzsche, 1861]]
Nietzsche attended a boys school and then, later, a private school, where he became friends with Gustav Krug, [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Wilhelm Pinder, all of whom came from very respected families.

In 1854, he began to attend ''Pforta'' in Naumburg, but after he showed particular talents in music and language, the internationally recognised [[Pforta|Schulpforta]] admitted him as a pupil, and there he continued his studies from 1858 to 1864. Here he became friends with [[Paul Deussen]] and Carl von Gersdorff. He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions. At Schulpforta, Nietzsche received an important introduction to literature, particularly that of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and for the first time experienced a distance from his family life in a small-town Christian environment. His end of semester exams in March 1864 showed a 1 in Religion and German, a 2a in Greek and Latin, 2b in French, History and Physics, and a &quot;lackluster&quot; 3 in Hebrew and Mathematics.{{Sfn | Cate | 2005 | p = 37}}

[[File:1864c.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Nietzsche, 1864]]
After graduation in 1864 Nietzsche commenced studies in [[theology]] and classical philology at the [[University of Bonn]]. For a short time he and Deussen became members of the [[Burschenschaft]] ''Frankonia''. After one semester (and to the anger of his mother) he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith.&lt;ref name=Schaberg&gt;{{Citation | last = Schaberg | first = William | title = The Nietzsche Canon | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1996 | page = 32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, at the age of 20, Nietzsche wrote to his sister, Elisabeth Nietzsche, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. This letter ended with a following sentence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Hence the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://babbledom.com/2011/02/17/intermission/|title= Nietzsche, Letter to His Sister (1865)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche's disbelief may have happened in part of his reading of [[David Strauss]]'s book ''Life of Jesus'', which has had a profound effect on the young Nietzsche,&lt;ref name= Schaberg/&gt; though in an essay entitled ''Fate and History'' written in 1862, Nietzsche had already argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jörg | last = Salaquarda | contribution = Nietzsche and the Judaeo-Christian tradition | title = The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche | place = Cambridge | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1996 | page = 99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche then concentrated on studying philology under Professor [[Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl]], whom he followed to the [[University of Leipzig]] the next year. There he became close friends with fellow-student [[Erwin Rohde]]. Nietzsche's first philological publications appeared soon after.

In 1865 Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading his ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung'' (The World as Will and Representation) and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay ''Schopenhauer als Erzieher'' (''[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]''), one of his ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''.

In 1866 he read [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus|History of Materialism]]''. Lange's descriptions of Kant's anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European Materialism, Europe's increased concern with science, [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory, and the general rebellion against tradition and authority greatly intrigued Nietzsche.  The cultural environment encouraged him to expand his horizons beyond philology and to continue his study of philosophy.

In 1867 Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg.  However, a riding accident in March 1868 left him unfit for service.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#To Freiherr Karl Von Gersdorff - June, 1868|Letter of Friedrich Nietzsche to Karl Von Gersdorff – June, 1868]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently Nietzsche turned his attention to his studies again, completing them and first meeting with [[Richard Wagner]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = [s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#To Rohde — November, 1868] | title = Letter to Rohde | year = 1868 | month = November | last = Nietzsche | first = Friedrich}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor at Basel (1869–1879)===
[[File:Rohde Gersdorff Nietzsche.JPG|thumb|Mid-October 1871. From left: [[Erwin Rohde]], Karl von Gersdorff, Nietzsche]]
In part because of Ritschl's support, Nietzsche received a remarkable offer to become professor of [[classical philology]] at the [[University of Basel]] in Switzerland.  He was only 24 years old and had neither completed his doctorate nor received his teaching certificate. Despite the fact that the offer came at a time when he was considering giving up philology for science, he accepted.{{Sfn | Kaufmann | 1974 | p = 25}}  To this day, Nietzsche is still among the youngest of the tenured Classics professors on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Paul | last = Bishop | title = Nietzsche and Antiquity | year = 2004 | page = 117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before moving to Basel, Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially [[Stateless person|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, Hellmuth: &quot;Nietzsches Staatsangehörigkeit als Rechtsfrage&quot;, ''Neue Juristische Wochenschrift'', Jg. 40, 1987, nr. 23, pp. 1388–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His, Eduard: &quot;Friedrich Nietzsches Heimatlosigkeit&quot;, ''Basler Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Altertumskunde'', vol. 40, 1941, p. 159–86. Note that some authors (among them Deussen and [[Mazzino Montinari|Montinari]]) mistakenly claim that Nietzsche became a Swiss citizen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Nietzsche served in the Prussian forces during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 to 1871 as a medical [[orderly]]. In his short time in the military he experienced much, and witnessed the traumatic effects of battle. He also contracted [[diphtheria]] and [[dysentery]].  [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] speculates that he might also have contracted [[syphilis]] along with his other infections at this time, and some biographers speculate that syphilis caused his eventual dementia, though there is some disagreement on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12522502 | publisher = NIH | location = USA | title=What was the cause of Nietzsche's dementia?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Richard | last = Schain | title = The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis | place = Westwood | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 2001}}.{{full}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning to Basel in 1870 Nietzsche observed the establishment of the [[German Empire]] and the following era of [[Otto von Bismarck]] as an outsider and with a degree of skepticism regarding its genuineness. At the University, he delivered his inaugural lecture, &quot;[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]&quot;. Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of [[theology]], who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher and author of ''Denken und Wirklichkeit'' (1873), and Nietzsche's colleague the historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Green, M.S. (2002) ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press.{{full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche had already met [[Richard Wagner]] in Leipzig in 1868, and (some time later) Wagner's wife [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly, and during his time at Basel frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in the [[Canton of Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle, and enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival Theatre]]. In 1870 he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of 'The Genesis of the Tragic Idea' as a birthday gift. In 1872 Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues in the field of classical philology, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work, in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In a [[polemic]], ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (by now a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted to attain a position in philosophy at Basel, though unsuccessfully.

Between 1873 and 1876, Nietzsche published separately four long essays: ''David Strauss: the Confessor and the Writer'', ''On the Use and Abuse of History for Life'', ''Schopenhauer as Educator'', and ''Richard Wagner in Bayreuth''.  These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''.  The four essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner.  In 1873, Nietzsche also began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. During this time, in the circle of the Wagners, Nietzsche met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von Bülow]], and also began a friendship with [[Paul Rée]], who in 1876 influenced him in dismissing the pessimism in his early writings.  However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and the baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of 'German culture', which Nietzsche thought a contradiction in terms, as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to Nietzsche's subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.

With the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]''  (a book of [[aphorisms]] on subjects ranging from metaphysics to morality and from religion to the sexes) Nietzsche's reaction against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer became evident, as well as the influence of Afrikan Spir's ''Denken und Wirklichkeit''.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Safranski, ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'' (trans. Shelley Frisch), W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2003, p. 161: &quot;This work [''Denken und Wirklichkeit''] had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a &quot;proposition by an outstanding logician&quot; (2,38; HH I §18)&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well.  In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. (Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, migraine headaches, and violent indigestion.  The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.)

===Independent philosopher (1879–1888)===
Because his illness drove him to find climates more conducive to his health, Nietzsche traveled frequently, and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]], near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland, and many winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]] and [[Turin]] and in the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French occupation of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside, but later abandoned that idea (probably for health reasons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Stephan | last = Güntzel | url = http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 | title = Nietzsche's Geophilosophy | page = 85 | journal = Journal of Nietzsche Studies | volume = 25 | month = Spring | publisher = The [[Pennsylvania State University Press]] | place = University Park (Penn State) | date = 2003-10-15 | language = English, German}}; republished on HyperNietzsche.&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Nietzsche's Hansen Writing Ball|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device.

Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation. He lived on his pension from Basel, but also received aid from friends.

A past student of his, [[Peter Gast]] (born Heinrich Köselitz), became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Koselitz transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn | Cate | 2005 | p = 221}}  He would go on to both transcribe and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from there on.  On at least one occasion, February 23, 1880, the usually broke Koselitz received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée.{{Sfn | Cate | 2005 | p = 297}}  Koselitz was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him.  In responding most enthusiastically to ''Zarathustra'', Koselitz did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as &quot;superfluous&quot; people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people Epicurus, for example, had to rely on—even with his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn | Cate | 2005 | p = 415}}

To the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. Malwida von Meysenbug remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche would publish one book (or major section of a book) each year until 1888, his last year of writing, during which he completed five.

[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lou Andreas-Salomé|Lou Salomé]], [[Paul Rée]] and Nietzsche, 1882.]]
In 1882 Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas Salomé]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm | contribution = Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé | title = F Nietzsche | place = DE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; through Malwida von Meysenbug and Paul Rée. Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in [[Thuringia]], often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Nietzsche, however, regarded Salomé less as an equal partner than as a gifted student. Salomé reports that he asked her to marry him and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn | Kaufmann | p = 49}}  Nietzsche's relationship with Rée and Salomé broke up in the winter of 1882/1883, partially because of intrigues conducted by Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth. Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near isolation after a falling-out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo. Here he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' in only ten days.

By 1882, Nietzsche was taking huge doses of opium, but was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn | Cate | 2005 | p = 389}}  In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them 'Dr Nietzsche'.{{Sfn | Cate | 2005 | p = 453}}

After severing his philosophical ties with Schopenhauer and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885 he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'', and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].

In 1883 he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of the attitude towards Christianity and the concept of God expressed in ''Zarathustra'', he had become in effect unemployable at any German University. The subsequent &quot;feelings of revenge and resentment&quot; embittered him. &quot;And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast – August 1883]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Nietzsche broke with his editor, Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his anti-Semitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as &quot;completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump&quot; of Schmeitzner — associating the editor with a movement that should be &quot;utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenietzschechannel.fws1.com/corresp.htm The Nietzsche Channel], Correspondences&lt;/ref&gt; He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense, and issued in 1886–1887 second editions of his earlier works (''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''Dawn'', and ''The Gay Science''), accompanied by new prefaces in which he reconsidered his earlier works. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and in a way hardly perceived by him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Barbara Margaretha von Salis-Marschlins|Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and also [[Gottfried Keller]]. Nietzsche had acquired the publication-rights for his earlier works in 1886 and began a process of editing and re-formulation that placed the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. In the same year, his sister Elisabeth married the [[Anti-Semitic|anti-Semite]] [[Bernhard Förster]] and traveled to [[Paraguay]] to found [[Nueva Germania]], a &quot;Germanic&quot; colony—a plan to which Nietzsche responded with mocking laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition = online | contribution = Förster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth | url = http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 | date = October 10, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued on the path of conflict and reconciliation, but they would meet again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible. In 1887 Nietzsche wrote the [[polemic]] ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]''.

During the same year Nietzsche encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], with whom he felt an immediate kinship.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast - March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast, March 1887]].&lt;/ref&gt; He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]], and then also with [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[Kierkegaard and Nietzsche comparisons#Relation to Søren Kierkegaard|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to Copenhagen and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this undertaking, he slipped too far into sickness. In the beginning of 1888, in Copenhagen, Brandes delivered one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.

Although Nietzsche had in 1886 announced (at the end of ''On The Genealogy of Morality'') a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of all values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this particular approach and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' (both written in 1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Mazzino | last = Montinari | title = Friedrich Nietzsche | year = 1974}} translated as {{Citation | language = German | year = 1991 | title = Friedrich Nietzsche. Eine Einführung | place = Berlin-New York | publisher = De Gruyter}}; and {{Citation | language = French | title = Friedrich Nietzsche | publisher = [[PUF]] | year = 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His health seemed to improve, and he spent the summer in high spirits. In the fall of 1888 his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and &quot;fate&quot;. He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, especially to the recent polemic, ''[[The Case of Wagner]]''. On his 44th birthday, after completing ''Twilight of the Idols'' and ''The Antichrist'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (Nietzsche)|Ecce Homo]]''. In the preface to this work—which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, &quot;Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else.&quot;{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 2000 | loc = Preface, section 1}}  In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]], and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche Contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that composed his collection ''Dionysian-[[Dithyramb]]s''.

===Mental breakdown and death (1889–1900)===

[[File:NietzscheHouseTurin.jpg|right|thumb | The house Nietzsche stayed in while in [[Turin]] (background, right), as seen from across Piazza Carlo Alberto, where he is said to have had his breakdown. To the left is the rear façade of the [[Palazzo Carignano]]]]
On January 3, 1889, Nietzsche suffered a mental collapse.  Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin, Italy|Turin]]. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale states that Nietzsche witnessed the [[flogging]] of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.{{Sfn | Kaufmann | 1974 | p = 67}}&lt;!--The first dream-sequence from [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' has just such a scene in which [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov| Raskolnikov]] witnesses the whipping of a horse around the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paolo d'Iorio]]'s discussion of whipping in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' and in Schopenhauer's ''[[Parerga und Paralipomena]]'', II, chap XXX: ''Über Lärm und Geräusch'': [http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=pdiorio-1 &quot;Genèse, parodie et modernité dans ''Ainsi parlait Zarathoustra''&quot;], published on the ''HyperNietzsche'' website {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Crime and Punishment/Part I/Chapter V|Crime and Punishment, I, 5.]]&lt;/ref&gt;){{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Ed. note – for restoration criteria see comment here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Friedrich_Nietzsche&amp;diff=231451308&amp;oldid=231346346]--&gt;

In the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the ''Wahnbriefe'' (&quot;Madness Letters&quot;)—to a number of friends (including [[Cosima Wagner]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]]). To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: &quot;I have had [[Caiaphas]] put in [[fetters]]. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], and all anti-Semites abolished.&quot;{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1977}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=March 2012}}  Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot, and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Zweig|Zweig, Stefan]] (1939) ''Master Builders [trilogy], The Struggle with the Daimon'', Viking Press, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 1889, Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day Overbeck received a similarly revealing letter, and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck traveled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in [[Jena]] under the direction of [[Otto Binswanger]]. From November 1889 to February 1890 the art historian [[Julius Langbehn]] attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890 Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic, and in May 1890 brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In January 1889 they proceeded with the planned release of ''Twilight of the Idols'', by that time already printed and bound. In February they ordered a fifty copy private edition of ''Nietzsche contra Wagner'', but the publisher [[C. G. Naumann]] secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing ''The Antichrist'' and ''Ecce Homo'' because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.

In 1893 Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from [[Nueva Germania]] (in Paraguay) following the suicide of her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works, and piece by piece took control of them and of their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal, and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in [[Weimar]], where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed people, including [[Rudolf Steiner]] (who in 1895 had written one of the first books praising Nietzsche)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rudolf | last = Steiner | title = Friedrich Nietzsche, ein Kämpfer gegen seine Zeit | place = Weimar | year = 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}} to visit her uncommunicative brother. Elisabeth at one point went so far as to employ Steiner – at a time when he was still an ardent fighter against any mysticism – as a tutor to help her to understand her brother's philosophy. Steiner abandoned the attempt after only a few months, declaring that it was impossible to teach her anything about philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Andrew | last = Bailey | title = First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy | publisher = Broadview Press | year = 2002 | page =704}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eh-dm-27.JPG|thumb|[[Peter Gast]] would &quot;correct&quot; Nietzsche's writings even after the philosopher's breakdown and did so without his approval—an action severely criticized by {{As of| 2007|alt=contemporary}} Nietzsche scholars.]]
Nietzsche's mental illness was originally diagnosed as [[Tertiary_syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]], in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time.

In 1898 and 1899 Nietzsche suffered at least two strokes, which partially paralysed him and left him unable to speak or walk. After contracting pneumonia in mid-August 1900 he had another stroke during the night of August 24–25, and died about noon on August 25.&lt;ref&gt;Concurring reports in Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche's biography (1904) and a letter by Mathilde Schenk-Nietzsche to [[Meta von Salis]], August 30, 1900, quoted in Janz (1981) p. 221. Cf. Volz (1990), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth had him buried beside his father at the church in [[Röcken]] bei [[Lützen]]. His friend, Gast, gave his funeral oration, proclaiming: &quot;Holy be your name to all future generations!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.philosophos.com/philosophy_article_31.html | last = Schain | first = Richard | title = Nietzsche's Visionary Values — Genius or Dementia? | publisher = Philosophos}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche had written in ''Ecce Homo'' (at the time of the funeral still unpublished) of his fear that one day his name would be regarded as &quot;holy&quot;.

Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche compiled ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' from Nietzsche's unpublished notebooks, and published it posthumously. Because his sister arranged the book based on her own conflation of several of Nietzsche's early outlines, and took great liberties with the material, the consensus holds that it does not reflect Nietzsche's intent.  Indeed, [[Mazzino Montinari]], the editor of Nietzsche's ''[[Nachlass]]'', called it a forgery in ''The 'Will to Power' Does Not Exist''. For example, Elisabeth removed aphorism 35 of ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche rewrote a passage of the Bible.

===Citizenship, nationality, ethnicity===
General commentators and Nietzsche scholars, whether emphasizing his cultural background or his language, overwhelmingly label Nietzsche as a &quot;German philosopher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/ | title = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | contribution = Nietzsche}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/0192854143 | title = Nietzsche: A Very Short Introduction | at = preview}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9108765/Friedrich-Nietzsche#387226.hook | title = Britannica | contribution = Friedrich Nietzsche}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Xeb80itrlRIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22German+philosopher%22+Nietzsche&amp;lr=&amp;sig=TGo0nlA9H07fxr4GbfMlDcFRgrQ | title = The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche | page = 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others do not assign him a [[nationalism|national]] category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Craid | title = The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of philosophy | place = Abingdon | publisher = Routledge | year = 2005 | pages = 726–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Simon | last = Blackburn | title = The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy | place = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2005 | pages = 252–53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Most scholars dispute Nietzsche's account of his family's origins.  Hans von Müller debunked the genealogy put forward by Nietzsche's sister in favor of a Polish noble heritage.&lt;ref&gt;von Müller, &quot;Nietzsches Vorfahren&quot;, reprinted ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 31 (2002): 253–75.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Max Oehler]], the curator of the [[Nietzsche Archive]] at [[Weimar]], argued that all of Nietzsche's ancestors bore German names, even the wives' families.&lt;ref name= hollingdalep6/&gt; Oehler claims that Nietzsche came from a long line of German [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] clergymen on both sides of his family, and modern scholars regard the claim of Nietzsche's Polish ancestry as a &quot;pure invention&quot;.&lt;ref name=mencken&gt;{{Citation | first = Henry Louis | last = Mencken | title = The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche | others = introd. &amp; comm.

The name derives from the forename ''Nikolaus'', abbreviated to ''Nick''; assimilated with the Slavic ''Nitz'', it first became ''Nitsche'' and then ''Nietzsche''.&lt;ref name = hollingdalep6 /&gt;

It is not known why Nietzsche wanted to be thought of as Polish nobility. According to biographer [[R. J. Hollingdale]], Nietzsche's propagation of the Polish ancestry myth may have been part of the latter's &quot;campaign against Germany&quot;.&lt;ref name=hollingdalep6/&gt;

===Relationships and sexuality===
Despite a proposal to Lou Salomé, Nietzsche never married. The Nietzsche scholar [[Joachim Köhler]] has attempted to explain Nietzsche's life history and philosophy by claiming that Nietzsche was a [[homosexuality|homosexual]]. Köhler argues that Nietzsche's syphilis is &quot;usually considered to be the product of his encounter with a prostitute in a brothel in Cologne or Leipzig, is equally likely, it is now held, to have been contracted in a male brothel in Genoa&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Köhler|first=Joachim|title=Zarathustra's secret: the interior life of Friedrich Nietzsche|year=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300092784|pages=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köhler also suggests Nietzsche may have had a romantic relationship as well as a friendship with Paul Rée. Köhler's views have not found wide acceptance among Nietzsche scholars and commentators: in ''The Journal of Modern History'', Allan Megill argues that &quot;Köhler does establish that the claim that Nietzsche was a man in confrontation with homosexual desire cannot simply be dismissed&quot; but notes that &quot;the evidence is very weak&quot; and argues that Köhler may be projecting twentieth-century understandings of sexuality on nineteenth-century notions of friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite jstor|2124335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have noted that Köhler's sexuality-based interpretation isn't fruitful in understanding Nietzsche's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite jstor|1408799}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23249-zarathustra-s-secret-the-interior-life-of-friedrich-nietzsche/|title=Zarathustra's Secret.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Nietzsche187c.jpg|thumb|175px|Friedrich Nietzsche in 1869.]]
{{Main|Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche}}

Nietzsche is known for his use of poetry and prose (sometimes together in [[Prose poetry|poetic prose]] style) in his writings. This, combined with the fact that he disdained any kind of system, has made several aspects of his philosophy seemingly lacking [[Coherence (linguistics)|coherent]] meaning or being [[paradox]]ical. Because of Nietzsche's [[evocative]] style and his often outrageous claims, his philosophy generates passionate reactions running from love to disgust, and it has drawn amateurs of all kinds to be heavily involved in the project of interpretation as well. His works remain controversial, due to interpretations and misinterpretations of his work. 

In ''[[The Dawn (book)|The Dawn]]'' Nietzsche begins his &quot;Campaign against Morality&quot;.{{Sfn | Kaufmann | 1974 | p = 187}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1888d | loc = M I}} He calls himself an &quot;immoralist&quot; and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: Christianity, [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Nietzsche is also known for being very critical of the [[Western culture|Western]] belief in [[egalitarianism]] and [[rationality]]. Nietzsche's concept &quot;God is dead&quot; applies to the doctrines of Christendom, though not to all other faiths: he claimed that [[Buddhism]] is a successful religion that he compliments for fostering critical thought.{{Sfn | Sedgwick | 2009 | p = 26}} Still, Nietzsche saw his philosophy as a counter-movement to nihilism through appreciation of [[art]]:

{{bquote|Art as the single superior counterforce against all will to negation of life, art as the anti-Christian, anti-Buddhist, anti-Nihilist par excellence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html|title= Art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nietzsche claimed that the Christian faith as practiced was not a proper representation of Jesus' teachings, as it forced people merely to believe in the way of Jesus but not to act as Jesus did, in particular his example of refusing to judge people, something that Christians had constantly done the opposite of.{{Sfn | Sedgwick | 2009 | p = 26}} He condemned institutionalized Christianity for emphasizing a morality of [[pity]], which assumes an inherent illness in society{{Sfn | Sedgwick | 2009 | p = 27}}:
{{bquote|Christianity is called the religion of pity. Pity stands opposed to the tonic emotions which heighten our vitality: it has a depressing effect. We are deprived of strength when we feel pity. That loss of strength which suffering as such inflicts on life is still further increased and multiplied by pity. Pity makes suffering contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/travis_denneson/antichrist.html|title= The Antichrist}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' Nietzsche called the establishment of moral systems based on a dichotomy of [[good and evil]] a &quot;calamitous error&quot;,{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1888d | loc = Why I Am a Destiny, §3}} and wished to initiate a [[transvaluation of all values|re-evaluation]] of the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of the Judeo-Christian world.{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 2004 | pp = 4, 8, 18, 29, 37, 40, 51, 57, 59}} He indicates his desire to bring about a new, more naturalistic source of value in the vital impulses of life itself. While Nietzsche attacked the principles of [[Judaism]], he was not anti-Semitic: in his work ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', he explicitly condemns anti-Semitism, and pointed out that his attack on Judaism was not an attack on Jews as a people but specifically an attack upon the ancient Jewish priesthood whom he claims anti-Semitic Christians paradoxically based their views upon.{{Sfn | Sedgwick | 2009 | p = 69}}

===Master–slave morality===
{{Main|Master–slave morality}}
In ''[[Beyond Good And Evil]]'' and ''On the Genealogy of Morality'', Nietzsche's [[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogical]] account of the development of master-slave morality occupies a central place.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He begins by examining dualistic morality and belief that there are good and evil forces in constant conflict with each other. For Nietzsche, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations held a form of dual preference for what they considered to be &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil.&quot; These were not moral laws ''per se'', but values that coincided with their relationship to lower castes such as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anus.com/zine/db/friedrich_nietzsche/|title= Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche presents master-morality as the original system of morality—perhaps best associated with Homeric Greece. Here, value arises as a contrast between good and bad, or between 'life-affirming' and 'life-denying': wealth, strength, health, and power counts as good while bad is associated with the poor, weak, sick, and pathetic: the sort of traits conventionally associated with slaves in ancient times.

Slave-morality comes about as a reaction to master-morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And to deny the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence) slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Ressentiment|title= Ressentiment}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to be a matter of choice, by, e.g., relabelling it as &quot;meekness.&quot;

Nietzsche sees the slave-morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are ''[[motley]]''). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own &quot;inner law.&quot;  A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: &quot;Become what you are.&quot;

A long standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were only used in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense, they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Kaufmann+Master+slave+morality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=42IDUKvaI47Zsgajt6zVBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Kaufmann%20Master%20slave%20morality&amp;f=false|title= From Shakespeare to existentialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of God and Nihilism===
{{Main|God is dead|Nihilism}}
The statement ''God is dead'', occurring in several of Nietzsche's works (notably in ''[[The Gay Science]]''), has become one of his best-known remarks. On the basis of it, most commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morgan|first=George Allen|title=What Nietzsche Means|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location = Cambridge, MA, USA |year=1941|page=36|isbn= 0-8371-7404-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the Abrahamic God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote against a primal form of nihilism, against the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, &quot;If [[God]] as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself.&quot;{{Sfn | Heidegger | p = 61}}

One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls 'passive nihilism', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine, which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Western_Buddhism#Buddhism_and_Western_Intellectuals|Western Buddhism]], advocates a separating oneself of will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a &quot;will to nothingness,&quot; whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent&lt;ref&gt;This &quot;will to nothingness&quot; is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' as pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{quote|&quot;A nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought ''not'' to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, [[suffering]], willing, feeling) has no meaning: the [[pathos]] of 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos — at the same time, as pathos, an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.&quot;|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power,'' section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}

Nietzsche approaches the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has &quot;become conscious&quot; in him.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he emphasises both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that &quot;I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation upon which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement ''God is dead''.

===Apollonian and Dionysian===
{{Main|Apollonian and Dionysian}}
The ''Apollonian and Dionysian'' is a philosophical concept, or [[dichotomy]], based on certain features of ancient Greek mythology, in this case [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. While the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] spoke of them before, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled On Music and Words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm|title= On Music and words}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and [[drama]], which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from [[music]].

Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism and nihilism of a fundamentally meaningless world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the meaning of their own existence. His major premise in ''The Birth of Tragedy'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian &quot;''Kunsttrieben''&quot; (&quot;artistic impulses&quot;) forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on other formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/dio_apollo.html|title= Nietzsche, Dionysus and Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Jim+Morrison+Apollonian+and+Dionysian&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ISrBT7vsOsyE-waM7PyICg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Jim%20Morrison%20Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian&amp;f=false|title= Ideas About Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the [[satyr]]. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of [[individuation|individuality]] and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.bachelorandmaster.com/creationofknowledge/apollonianism-dyonysianisism.html|title= The Apollonianism and Dionysiansism by Friedrich Nietzsche}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these principles are meant to represent [[Cognition|cognitive]] states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx|title= Dionysus in Nietzsche and Greek Myth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions is apparent, in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order (in the Apollonian sense) of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category – he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche|title= Procrastination in Shakespeare's Hamlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html|title= Nietzsche on Hamlet(Commonplace Book)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity'', which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables making of any art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html|title= The role of art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated by this state, person's artistic will is enhanced: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, [[wikt:taut#Adjective|taut]], strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power - until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is - art.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Nietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its &quot;''Untergang''&quot; (literally &quot;going under&quot;, meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued with this path in his dialogues and modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian and thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/|title= Dionysus versus Apollo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion. Only the beautiful middle; the interplay of these two forces brought together as an art represented real Greek tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/nietzsche/section1.html|title= The Birth of Tragedy Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the impact of this idea can be seen in the book ''Patterns of Culture'', where [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ruth Benedict]] uses Nietzschean opposites of &quot;Apollonian&quot; and &quot;Dionysian&quot; as the stimulus for her thoughts about Native American cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://classes.yale.edu/03-04/anth500b/projects/project_sites/02_alexy/ruthpatterns.html Ruth Benedict Patterns of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Jung]] has written extensively on the dichotomy in ''[[Psychological Types]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://pkdreligion.blogspot.com/2011/11/influence-of-cg-jung-on-pkd-by-frank.html|title= Influence of C.G. Jung on PKD -- notes by Frank Bertrand, excerpt Umland}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] has commented that his book ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' should be read &quot;under the sun of the great Nietzschean inquiry&quot;. Here Foucault references Nietzsche's description of the birth and death of tragedy and his explanation that the subsequent tragedy of the Western world was the refusal of tragic and, with that, refusal of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4aNoFpNfYeMC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=foucault+genealogy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2VADUJvvK43MtAafwpydBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=foucault%20genealogy&amp;f=false|title= Foucault's Nietzschean Genealogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Painter [[Mark Rothko]] was influenced by Nietzsche's view of tragedy, which were presented in ''The Birth of Tragedy''.

===Perspectivism===
{{Main|Perspectivism}}

Nietzsche claimed the death of God would eventually lead to the loss of any universal perspective on things, and along with it any coherent sense of objective truth.{{Sfn | Lampert | 1986 | pp = 17–18}}{{Sfn | Heidegger}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=March 2012}} Nietzsche himself rejected the idea of objective reality arguing that knowledge is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?hl=hr&amp;id=TxlMccAak4wC&amp;q=Objective#v=snippet&amp;q=Objective&amp;f=false |title= Nietzsche: Naturalism and Interpretation | first = Cox | last = Cristoph}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) according to the circumstances of individual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Schacht, Richard, ''Nietzsche'', p 61.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has acquired the name ''[[perspectivism]]''. 

In ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Nietzsche proclaims that a table of values hangs above every great people. He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. &quot;A thousand goals have there been so far,&quot; says Zarathustra, &quot;for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.&quot; Hence, the title of the aphorism, &quot;On The Thousand And One Goals&quot;. The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html|title= Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science | first = Hoenisch | last = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S1518-44712006000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext|title= Culture and perspectivism in Nietzsche's and Weber's view}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among his critique of traditional philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Plato]] in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche attacked ''[[thing in itself]]'' and ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' (''I think, therefore I am'') as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and [[fallacy|fallacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.monomorphic.org/wordpress/objective-and-subjective-reality-perspectivism/ |title= Objective and subjective reality; perspectivism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] puts Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy. While criticizing nihilism and Nietzsche together as a sign of general decay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=3JA3vyj4slsC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OfDsT_XBAsmGhQfF05WMDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Alasdair%20MacIntyre%20Nietzsche%20Kant&amp;f=false|title= From Hegel to Existentialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; he still commends him for recognizing psychological motives behind Kant and [[David Hume|Hume]]'s moral philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=TN7sop-yILMC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OfDsT_XBAsmGhQfF05WMDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Alasdair MacIntyre}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For it was Nietzsche's historic achievement to understand more clearly than any other philosopher...not only that what purported to be appeals of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] were in fact expressions of subjective will, but also the nature of the problems that this posed for philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9RaG9ccs44C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Alasdair+MacIntyre+Nietzsche+Kant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OfDsT_XBAsmGhQfF05WMDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Alasdair%20MacIntyre%20Nietzsche%20Kant&amp;f=false|title= Tradition in the ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Will to power===
{{Main|Will to power}}
A basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the ''[[will to power]]'' (''der Wille zur Macht''), which provides a basis for understanding human behavior — more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1886 | p = 13}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1882 | p = 349}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1887 | p = II:12}}  As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence'.{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1888b| loc = Skirmishes of an untimely man, §14}}  More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.

In presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarianists claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives.  But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim per se — it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions — in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1888c | loc = §2}}

Related to his theory of the will to power, is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1886 | loc = I, §36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter — that what holds true for man's affections and impulses, may also apply to the external world.  At the core of his theory is a rejection of ''[[atomism]]'' — the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ruđer Bošković]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, &quot;Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story&quot;, ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996 p 207.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1886 | loc = I, §12}}  One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as &quot;the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation&quot; revealing the will to power as &quot;the principle of the synthesis of forces.&quot;{{Sfn | Deleuze | 2006 | p = 46}}  Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will.  Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1886 | loc = I, §22}}

===Eternal return===
{{Main|Eternal return}}
Eternal return (also known as &quot;eternal recurrence&quot;) is a concept which posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies. The idea of [[eternal return]] occurs in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter &quot;Of the Vision and the Riddle&quot; in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', among other places.{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1961 | pp = 176–80}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially &quot;horrifying and paralyzing&quot;, and says that its burden is the &quot;heaviest weight&quot; imaginable (&quot;''das schwerste Gewicht''&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kundera | first = Milan | title = The Unbearable Lightness of Being | year = 1999 | page = 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s praise of denying the will‐to‐live.  To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', &quot;love of fate&quot;.&lt;ref name = dudl&gt;{{Citation | last = Dudley | first = Will | title = Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom | year = 2002 | page = 201}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Nehamas]] writes in ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' of three ways of seeing the eternal recurrence: &quot;(A) My life will recur in exactly identical fashion.&quot; This expresses a totally fatalistic approach to the idea. &quot;(B) My life may recur in exactly identical fashion.&quot; This second view conditionally asserts cosmology, but fails to capture what Nietzsche refers to in ''The Gay Science'', 341. Finally, &quot;(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion.&quot; Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas 153).

===Übermensch===
{{Main|Übermensch}}
Another concept important to an understanding of Nietzsche's thought is the ''[[Übermensch]]'' (translated variously as &quot;overman&quot;, &quot;superman&quot;, or &quot;super-human&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=The Portable Nietzsche|others=trans. Walter Kaufmann|location=New York|publisher=Penguin|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|others=ed. Adrian Del Caro and Robert Pippin|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lampert|first=Laurence|title=Nietzsche's Teaching|location=New Haven, CT|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the idea of nihilism, Nietzsche wrote ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', therein introducing the concept of a value-creating Übermensch. According to Lampert, &quot;the death of God must be followed by a long twilight of piety and nihilism (II. 19; III. 8). [...] Zarathustra's gift of the overman is given to a mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution.&quot;{{Sfn | Lampert | 1986 | p = 18}} Zarathustra presents the overman as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The overman does not follow morality of common people since it favors mediocrity but instead rises above the notion of [[good and evil]] and above the ''[[Herd behavior|herd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html|title= Philosophy 302: Ethics Nietzsche, &quot;Slave and Master Morality&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of overman. He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the [[superstition]] beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thus-spoke-zarathustra/study-guide/major-themes/|title= Thus Spoke Zarathustra themes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While interpretations of Nietzsche's overman vary wildly, here is one of his quotations from ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (Prologue, §§3–4):

{{bquote |I teach you the overman.  Man is something that shall be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him?...  All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man?  What is ape to man?  A laughing stock or painful embarrassment.  And man shall be that to overman: a laughingstock or painful embarrassment.  You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape...  The overman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth...  Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.}}

Zarathustra contrasts the overman with the [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being [[democracy]]), an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html|title= Nietzsche and Heidegger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence of the same; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.

==Reading and influence==
[[File:Nietzsche Archives in Weimar.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The residence of Nietzsche's last three years, along with archive in [[Weimar]], Germany, which holds many of Nietzsche's papers]]
{{Main|Library of Friedrich Nietzsche}}
As a [[philologist]], Nietzsche had a thorough knowledge of [[Greek philosophy]]. He read [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Plato]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[African Spir]],&lt;ref&gt;Brobjer, Thomas. ''Nietzsche's Reading and Private Library, 1885–1889.'' Published in ''Journal of History of Ideas.'' Accessed via JSTOR on May 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who became his main opponents in his philosophy, and later [[Spinoza]], whom he saw as his &quot;precursor&quot; in some respects&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Franz Overbeck, July 30, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; but as a personification of the &quot;ascetic ideal&quot; in others. However, Nietzsche referred to Kant as a &quot;moral fanatic&quot;, Plato as &quot;boring&quot;, Mill as a &quot;blockhead&quot;, and of Spinoza he said: &quot;How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?&quot;{{Sfn | Russell | 2004 | pp = 693–97}} 

Nietzsche's philosophy, while highly innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on the &quot;Pre-Platonic Philosophers&quot; for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a &quot;lost link&quot; in the development of his thought.  &quot;In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche.&quot;{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 2001 | p = xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] Greek thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of &quot;flux&quot; and incessant change.  His symbolism of the world as &quot;child play&quot; marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn | Roochnik | 2004 | pp = 37–39}}  From his Heraclitean sympathy Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn | Roochnik | 2004 | p = 48}} 

In his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was &quot;an emendation of that of Schopenhauer.  The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong.  These points of difference from Schopenhauer cover the whole philosophy of Nietzsche.&quot;{{Sfn | Santayana | 1916 | p = 114}}

Nietzsche's works did not reach a wide readership during his active writing career. However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic [[Georg Brandes]] aroused considerable excitement about Nietzsche through a series of lectures he gave at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/672/mode/1up 1910 article from the Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater [[individualism]] and personality development in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894–1895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as [[subversive]]. During the late 19th century [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements]] and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;O.

[[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Arthur Symons]] described Nietzsche as the intellectual heir to [[William Blake]]. Symons went on to compare the ideas of the two thinkers in ''[[The Symbolist Movement in Literature]]'' while Yeats tried to raise awareness of Nietzsche in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The First Moderns | last = Everdell | first= William | year= 1998 | publisher= U Chicago Press | location= Chicago | isbn=0-226-22481-3| page= 508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fathom.com/feature/61007/|title= Joyce and Nietzsche}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N9H1vjyOMswC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=Arthur+Symons+Nietzsche&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkWgKBxXwy&amp;sig=sz80-tykKJOgxpdTxuS7tAnocpc&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1RTmT7-1N5D64QSl8OygAQ&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Arthur%20Symons%20Nietzsche&amp;f=false|title= Nietzsche:Imagery and thoughts}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar notion was espoused by [[W.

Writer on music [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] notes that [[Gustav Mahler]] was &quot;attracted to the poetic fire of Zarathustra, but repelled by the intellectual core of it's writings&quot;. He also quotes Gustav himself, and adds that he was influenced by Nietzsche's conception and affirmative approach to nature, which Mahler presented in [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] using [[Zarathustra's roundelay]]. [[Frederick Delius]] has produced a piece of choral music [[A Mass of Life]] based on a text of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', while [[Richard Strauss]] (who also based his [[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]] on the same book), was only interested in finishing &quot;another chapter of symphonic autobiography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yKCq909vSpwC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=Mahler+Nietzsche+influence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1lB73LZgAT&amp;sig=hsciG0WxQTiflEyvyV5l-3lJ8TE&amp;hl=hr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VZvOT4PIJY7LtAak9pDSCg&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Mahler%20Nietzsche%20influence&amp;f=false|title=Gustav Mahler: The Early Years | first = Mitchell| last = Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous writers and poets influenced by Nietzsche include [[André Gide]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Robinson Jeffers]], [[Pío Baroja]], [[D.

Nietzsche's growing prominence suffered a severe setback when his works became closely associated with [[Adolf Hitler]] and the German Reich. Many political leaders of the twentieth century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche's ideas, although it is not always possible to determine whether they actually read his work. Hitler, for example, probably never read Nietzsche and, if he did, his reading was not extensive,&lt;ref&gt;Weaver Santaniello, ''Nietzsche, God, and the Jews,'' [[SUNY Press]], 1994, p 41: &quot;Hitler probably never read a word of Nietzsche&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berel Lang, ''Post-Holocaust: Interpretation, Misinterpretation, and the Claims of History,'' Indiana University Press, 2005, p 162: &quot;Arguably, Hitler himself never read a word of Nietzsche; certainly, if he did read him, it was not extensively&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Golomb | 1997 | p = 9}}: &quot;To be sure, it is almost certain that Hitler either never read Nietzsche directly or read very little.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C. Janos, ''East Central Europe in the Modern World,'' [[Stanford University Press]], 2002, p 184: &quot;By all indications, Hitler never read Nietzsche. Neither ''Mein Kampf'' nor Hitler's ''Table Talk'' (''Tischgesprache'') mentions his name. Nietzschean ideas reached him through the filter of Alfred Rosenberg's ''Myth of the Twentieth Century,'' and, more simply, through what was coffeehouse ''Quatsch'' in Vienna and Munich. This at least is the impression he gives in his published conversations with Dietrich Eckart.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; although he was a frequent visitor to the Nietzsche museum in Weimar and did use expressions of Nietzsche's, such as &quot;lords of the earth&quot; in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, a History of Nazi Germany,'' Touchstone, 1959, pp 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nazis made selective use of Nietzsche's philosophy. [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]],&lt;ref&gt;Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi, ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy'', University of California Press, 2000, p 44: &quot;In 1908 he presented his conception of the superman's role in modern society in a writing on Nietzsche titled &quot;The Philosophy of Force.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Morgan, ''Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945,'' Routledge, 2003, p 21: &quot;We know that Mussolini had read Nietzsche&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles de Gaulle]]&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Gaddis, P. H. Gordon, E. R. May, J. Rosenberg, ''Cold War Statesmen Confront the Bomb'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p 217: &quot;The son of a history teacher, de Gaulle read voraciously as a boy and young man—Jacques Bainville, Henri Bergson, Friederich {{sic}} Nietzsche, Maurice Barres—and was steeped in conservative French historical and philosophical traditions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huey P.

[[Richard Nixon]] read Nietzsche with &quot;curious interest,&quot; and his book ''Beyond Peace'' might have taken its title from Nietzsche's book ''Beyond Good and Evil'' which Nixon read beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Monica | last = Crowley | title = Nixon in Winter | publisher = IB Tauris | year = 1998 | page = 351 | quote = He read with curious interest the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche [...] Nixon asked to borrow my copy of ''Beyond Good and Evil,'' a title that inspired the title of his final book, ''Beyond Peace''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that Nietzsche had exerted great influence on philosophers and on people of literary and artistic culture, but warned that the attempt to put Nietzsche's philosophy of aristocracy into practice could only be done by an organization similar to the Fascist or the Nazi party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Russell, Bertrand |title=A History of Western Philosophy |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |year=not given |pages=766, 770 |isbn=0-671-20158-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade after World War II, there was a revival of Nietzsche's philosophical writings thanks to exhaustive translations and analyses by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and [[R.J. Hollingdale]]. Others, well known philosophers in their own right, wrote commentaries on Nietzsche's philosophy, including [[Martin Heidegger]], who produced a four-volume study and [[Lev Shestov]] who wrote a book called ''Dostoyevski, Tolstoy and Nietzsche'' where he portrays Nietzsche and Dostoyevski as the &quot;thinkers of tragedy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.amazon.com/Dostoevsky-Tolstoy-Nietzsche-Good-Teaching/dp/0821400533|title= Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Nietzsche | first = Shestov | last = Lev}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]] compares Nietzsche's importance to ethics to that of [[Copernicus]] for [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.philosophynow.org/issues/29/Nietzsche_and_Germany|title= Nietzsche &amp; Germany | first = Sorgner | last = Stefan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] read Nietzsche avidly from his early life, and later frequently discussed many of his concepts in his own works.
