[[File:Time Saving Truth from Falsehood and Envy.jpg|right|thumb|295px|''[[Time]] Saving Truth from [[Falsehood]] and [[Envy]]'', [[François Lemoyne]], 1737]]
[[File:Truth-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|Truth, holding a [[mirror]] and a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] (1896). [[Olin Levi Warner]], Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
'''Truth''' is most often used to mean in accord with [[fact]] or [[reality]]&lt;ref name = Merriam-Webster-def&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, [http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth truth], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; or fidelity to an original or to a standard or ideal.&lt;ref name = Merriam-Webster-def/&gt;

The [[principle of bivalence|opposite]] of truth is [[False (logic)|falsehood]], which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and [[debate]]d in several contexts, including [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]. Many human activities depend upon the concept, which is assumed rather than a subject of discussion, including [[science]], [[law]], and everyday life.

Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars and philosophers. Language and words are a means by which humans convey [[information]] to one another and the method used to recognize a &quot;truth&quot; is termed a [[criteria of truth|criterion of truth]]. There are differing claims on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are [[truthbearer]]s capable of being true or false; how to define and identify truth; the roles that revealed and acquired [[knowledge]] play; and whether truth is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] or [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], [[knowledge relativity|relative]] or [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]].

Many religions consider perfect knowledge of all truth about all things ([[omniscience]]) to be an attribute of a [[divine being|divine]] or [[supernatural]] being.

==Nomenclature, orthography, and etymology==
{{Further|Veritas|Aletheia|Tryggvi}}
{{anchor|treowe}}
The English word ''[[:wikt:truth|truth]]'' is from [[Old English]] ''tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ'', [[Middle English]] ''trewþe'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''triuwida'', [[Old Norse]] ''tryggð''. Like ''[[Troth (disambiguation)|troth]]'', it is a ''[[:wikt:-th|-th]]'' nominalisation of the adjective ''true'' (Old English ''tréowe'').

The English word ''[[:wikt:true|true]]'' is from Old English ([[West Sexaon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]]) ''(ge)tríewe, [[:wikt:treowe|tréowe]]'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''(gi)trûui'', [[Old High German]] ''(ga)triuwu'' ([[Modern German]] ''treu'' &quot;faithful&quot;), [[Old Norse]] ''tryggr'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''triggws'',&lt;ref&gt;see [[Holtzmann's law]] for the ''-ww-'' : ''-gg-'' alternation.&lt;/ref&gt; all from a [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*trewwj-'' &quot;having [[good faith]]&quot;.
Old Norse ''{{lang|is|trú}}'', &quot;faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h442.php A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic]'', Geir T. Zoëga (1910), Northvegr.org&lt;/ref&gt; (archaic English ''[[:wikt:troth|troth]]'' &quot;loyalty, honesty, good faith&quot;, compare ''{{lang|is|[[Ásatrú]]}}'').

Thus, 'truth' involves both the quality of &quot;faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] on ''true'' has &quot;Steadfast in adherence to a commander or friend, to a principle or cause, to one's promises, faith, etc.; firm in allegiance; faithful, loyal, constant, trusty; Honest, honourable, upright, virtuous, trustworthy; free from deceit, sincere, truthful &quot; besides &quot;Conformity with fact; agreement with reality; accuracy, correctness, verity; Consistent with fact; agreeing with the reality; representing the thing as it is; Real, genuine; rightly answering to the description; properly so called; not counterfeit, spurious, or imaginary.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and that of &quot;agreement with [[fact]] or [[reality]]&quot;, in Anglo-Saxon expressed by ''[[:wikt:sōþ|sōþ]]'' (Modern English ''[[:wikt:sooth|sooth]]'').

All Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth &quot;fidelity&quot; and truth &quot;factuality&quot;. To express &quot;factuality&quot;, [[North Germanic]] opted for nouns derived from ''sanna'' &quot;to assert, affirm&quot;, while continental [[West Germanic]] (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of ''wâra'' &quot;faith, trust, pact&quot; (cognate to Slavic ''věra'' &quot;(religious) faith&quot;, but influenced by Latin ''[[veritas|verus]]''). [[Romance language]]s use terms following the Latin ''[[veritas]]'', while the Greek ''[[aletheia]]'', Russian ''[[:wikt:pravda|pravda]]'' and Serbian ''istina'' have separate etymological origins.

==Major theories of truth==

The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is  dealt with by the five major substantive theories introduced below.  Each theory presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPT&quot;&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., &quot;Truth&quot;, auth: Michael Williams, p572-573 (Macmillan, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1111/b.9780631213260.1999.00015.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There also have more recently arisen &quot;[[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]]&quot; or &quot;minimalist&quot; theories of truth based on the idea that the application of a term like ''true'' to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its ''nature'', but that the label ''truth'' is a tool of discourse used to express agreement, to emphasize claims, or to form certain types of generalizations.&lt;ref name = EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive theories===

====Correspondence theory====
{{Main|Correspondence theory of truth}}
Correspondence theories state that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Correspondence Theory of Truth&quot;, auth: Arthur N. Prior, p223 (Macmillan, 1969) Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] wording in defining correspondence theory.  According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory posits a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other.  It is a traditional model which goes back at least to some of the classical Greek philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Correspondence Theory of Truth&quot;, auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223-224 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle solely by how it relates to &quot;things&quot;, by whether it accurately describes those &quot;things&quot;.  An example of correspondence theory is the statement by the Thirteenth Century philosopher/theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: ''Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus'' (&quot;Truth is the equation [or adequation] of things and intellect&quot;), a statement which Aquinas attributed to the Ninth Century [[neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Correspondence Theory of Truth&quot;, auth: Arthur N. Prior, p224, Macmillan, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence &quot;Correspondence Theory of Truth&quot;, in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also restated the theory as: &quot;A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence &quot;Correspondence Theory of Truth&quot;, in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], (citing De Veritate Q.1, A.1&amp;3; cf. Summa Theologiae Q.16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory practically operates on the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what was much later called &quot;[[objective reality]]&quot; and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., &quot;On Truth and Copying&quot;, in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved independently of some analysis of additional factors.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Correspondence Theory of Truth&quot;, auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on &quot;Moore's Correspondence Theory&quot;, 225-226, &quot;Russell's Correspondence Theory&quot;, 226-227, &quot;Remsey and Later Wittgenstein&quot;, 228-229, &quot;Tarski's Semantic Theory&quot;, 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words that are not easily translatable into another.  The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may &quot;know&quot; what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]].  Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Correspondence Theory of Truth&quot;, auth: Arthur N. Prior, p. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969). See the section on &quot;Tarski's Semantic Theory&quot;, 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth.

====Coherence theory====
{{Main|Coherence theory of truth}}
[[File:Statue of Truth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Veritas'' (Truth) outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]

For coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other.  So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity and usefulness continues to be debated even today.  Similarly, the systems of [[Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to characterize the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Coherence Theory of Truth&quot;, auth: Alan R. White, p130-131 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]].  On the whole, coherence theories have been criticized as lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Coherence Theory of Truth&quot;, auth: Alan R. White, p131-133, ''see'' esp., section on &quot;Epistemological assumptions&quot; (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Spinoza]], [[Leibniz]], and [[G.W.F. Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F.H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Coherence Theory of Truth&quot;, auth: Alan R. White, p130&lt;/ref&gt;  They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].

====Constructivist theory====
{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}

[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community.  Constructivism views all of our knowledge as &quot;constructed,&quot; because it does not reflect any external &quot;transcendent&quot; realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]] are socially constructed.

[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom{{spaced ndash}}''verum ipsum factum''{{spaced ndash}}&quot;truth itself is constructed&quot;. [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like  many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx scientific and true knowledge is 'in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history' and ideological knowledge 'an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement'.&lt;ref&gt;May, Todd, 1993, Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, politics in the thought of Michel Foucault' with reference to Althusser and Balibar, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus theory====
{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}

[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of &quot;truth&quot; is  the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. PART III, pp 187 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragmatic theory====
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

The three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.5, &quot;Pragmatic Theory of Truth&quot;, 427 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  &quot;Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peirce Truth and Falsity&quot;&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), &quot;Truth and Falsity and Error&quot; (in part), pp. 716–720 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled &quot;''Logical''&quot;, beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials &quot;(C.S.P.)&quot;, see Google Books [http://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–573.&lt;/ref&gt;  This statement emphasizes Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and &quot;reference to the future&quot;, are essential to a proper conception of truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

[[William James|William James's]] version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that &quot;the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving.&quot;&lt;ref name=WJP&gt;James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, &quot;pragmatic&quot;).

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but  more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, &quot;Dewey, John&quot;, auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not widely publicized, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward.  Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as &quot;negative pragmatism&quot;.  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, W.S. &amp; Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, NEW YORK: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966, LCCCN 66-23155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Feynman]] also ascribed to it: &quot;We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FeynmanThe&quot;&gt;Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, NEW YORK: Random House, 1994, ISBN 0-679-60127-9.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey.  For Peirce, the idea of &quot;... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ...&quot; fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing.  As Feynman noted, an idea or theory &quot;... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FeynmanThe&quot; /&gt;  Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe to repeated testing which is &quot;self-corrective&quot; over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should recognize and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, &quot;... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist (deflationary) theories===
{{Main|Deflationary theory of truth}}

Some philosophers reject the thesis that the concept or term ''truth'' refers to a real property of sentences or propositions.  These philosophers are responding, in part, to the common use of ''truth predicates'' (e.g., that some particular thing &quot;...is true&quot;) which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century.  From this point of view, to assert the proposition &quot;'2 + 2 = 4' is true&quot; is logically equivalent to asserting the proposition &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;, and the phrase &quot;is true&quot; is completely dispensable in this and every other context.  These positions are broadly described
*as ''deflationary'' theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words &quot;true&quot; or ''truth'',
*as ''disquotational'' theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or
*as ''minimalist'' theories of truth.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'' in the Introductory section of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that &quot;[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis.&quot;&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt; Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it ''does'' appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., [[Semantic paradox]]es, and below.)

In addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate &quot;is true&quot;, some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:
:''Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc.''
This assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: ''What Michael says is true''.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkham, Theories of Truth, MIT Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performative theory of truth====
Attributed to [[P. F. Strawson]] is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say &quot;'Snow is white' is true&quot; is to perform the [[speech act]] of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the bride says &quot;I do&quot; at the appropriate time in a wedding, she is performing the act of taking this man to be her lawful wedded husband. She is not ''describing'' herself as taking this man, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such &quot;illocutionary acts&quot; is [[J. L. Austin]], &quot;[[How to Do Things With Words]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Austin, &quot;How to Do Things With Words&quot;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;).

Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: &quot;To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement.  When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.'  The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.6: ''Performative Theory of Truth'', auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redundancy and related theories====
{{Main|Redundancy theory of truth}}

According to the [[redundancy theory of truth]], asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself.  For example, making the assertion that &quot;&amp;nbsp;'Snow is white' is true&quot; is equivalent to asserting &quot;Snow is white&quot;.  Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality.  This theory is commonly attributed to [[Frank P. Ramsey]], who held that the use of words like ''fact'' and ''truth'' was nothing but a [[periphrasis|roundabout]] way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a &quot;linguistic muddle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, F.P. (1927), &quot;Facts and Propositions&quot;, Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 7, 153–170. Reprinted, pp. 34–51 in F.P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, David Hugh Mellor (ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Morvan, Pierre. (2004) &quot;Ramsey on Truth and Truth on Ramsey&quot;, ''The British Journal for the History of Philosophy'' 12(4), pp. 705-718.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of [[Tarski]]'s [[Truth#Semantic theory of truth|schema]]: To say that '&quot;P&quot; is true' is to say that P.  A version of this theory was defended by [[C. J. F. Williams]] in his book ''What is Truth?''.  Yet another version of deflationism is the [[prosentential theory of truth]], first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and [[Nuel Belnap]] as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims.  They argue that sentences like &quot;That's true&quot;, when said in response to &quot;It's raining&quot;, are [[prosentence]]s, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions.  In the same way that ''it'' means the same as ''my dog'' in the sentence ''My dog was hungry, so I fed it'', ''That's true'' is supposed to mean the same as ''It's raining'' &amp;mdash; if you say the latter and I then say the former.  These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is ''not'' a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion &quot;P&quot; may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimalizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as &quot;that's true.&quot;&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;

Deflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise.  Consider the analogy between the sentence &quot;Snow is white&quot; and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense.  To a minimalist,
saying &quot;Snow is white is true&quot; is the same as saying &quot;Snow is white,&quot; but to say &quot;Snow White is true&quot; is ''not'' the same as saying &quot;Snow White.&quot;

===Pluralist theories===
{{Main|Pluralist theories of truth}}
Several of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.

Some of the pragmatic theories, such as those by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] and [[William James]], included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peirce Truth and Falsity&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=WJP/&gt; [[Crispin Wright]] argued in his 1992 book ''Truth and Objectivity'' that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility.&lt;ref&gt;Truth and Objectivity, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Lynch (philosopher)|Michael Lynch]], in a 2009 book ''Truth as One and Many'', argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.&lt;ref&gt;Truth as One and Many (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most believed theories===
According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 44.9% of respondents accept or lean towards correspondence theories, 20.7% accept or lean towards deflationary theories and 13.8% epistemic theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=All+respondents&amp;areas0=0&amp;areas_max=1&amp;grain=medium |title=Philpapers.org |publisher=Philpapers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal theories==

===Truth in logic===
{{Main|Logical truth|Criteria of truth|Truth value}}

[[Logic]] is concerned with the patterns in [[reason]] that can help tell us if a [[proposition]] is true or not. However, logic does not deal with truth in the absolute sense, as for instance a [[metaphysics|metaphysician]] does. Logicians use [[formal language]]s to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or truth within some [[logical system]].

A logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement which is true in all possible worlds&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]&lt;/ref&gt; or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a ''[[fact]]'' (also called a ''[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic claim]]'' or a ''[[Necessary and sufficient condition|contingency]]'') which is only true in this [[World (philosophy)|world]] as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as &quot;If p and q, then p.&quot; is considered to be logical truth because it is true because of the meaning of the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[well-formed formula|words]] in it and not because of any facts of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue.

===Truth in mathematics===
{{Main|Model theory|Proof theory}}

There are two main approaches to truth in mathematics.  They are the ''[[model theory|model theory of truth]]'' and the ''[[proof theory|proof theory of truth]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.

Historically, with the nineteenth century development of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] mathematical models of logic began to treat &quot;truth&quot;, also represented as &quot;T&quot; or &quot;1&quot;, as an arbitrary constant.  &quot;Falsity&quot; is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as &quot;F&quot; or &quot;0&quot;.  In [[propositional logic]], these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of [[axioms]] and [[rules of inference]], often given in the form of [[truth table]]s.

In addition, from at least the time of [[Hilbert's program]] at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and the development of the [[Church-Turing thesis]] in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were generally assumed to be those statements which are provable in a formal axiomatic system.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The works of [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) esp. 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of the latter can be found in [[Hilbert's problems]]. Work on [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific [[Diophantine equations]] for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution,&lt;ref&gt;M. Davis. &quot;Hilbert's Tenth Problem is Unsolvable.&quot; ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 80, pp. 233-269, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; or even if they do, whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, [[Hilbert's first problem]] was on the [[continuum hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Benjamin H.. ''The Honors Class. Hilbert's Problems and Their Solvers'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard [[axiom]]s of [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) 1-28, 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.

===Semantic theory of truth===
{{main|Semantic theory of truth}}

The [[semantic theory of truth]] has as its general case for a given language:
:'P' is true if and only if P
where 'P' is a reference to the sentence (the sentence's name), and P is just the sentence itself.

Logician and philosopher [[Alfred Tarski]] developed the theory for formal languages (such as [[formal logic]]). Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression ''is true'' could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an ''object language'', the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain paradoxical sentences like the Liar: ''This sentence is not true''. See [[Liar paradox|The Liar paradox]]. As a result Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] used it as the foundation of his [[truth-conditional semantics]] and linked it to [[radical interpretation]] in a form of [[coherentism]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formalizations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, [[Russell's paradox]].  Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] attempted to solve these problems in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by putting statements into a hierarchy of [[type theory|types]], wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy.  This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible [[type system]]s that have yet to be resolved to this day.

===Kripke's theory of truth===
[[Saul Kripke]] contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:
* Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression &quot;is true&quot; (or &quot;is false&quot;). So ''The barn is big'' is included in the subset, but not &quot; ''The barn is big'' is true&quot;, nor problematic sentences such as &quot;''This sentence'' is false&quot;.
* Define truth just for the sentences in that subset.
* Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So &quot;''The barn is big'' is true&quot; is now included, but not either &quot;''This sentence'' is false&quot; nor &quot;'''The barn is big'' is true' is true&quot;.
* Next, define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for ''The barn is big''; then for &quot;''The barn is big'' is true&quot;; then for &quot;'''The barn is big'' is true' is true&quot;, and so on.

Notice that truth never gets defined for sentences like ''This sentence is false'', since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are &quot;ungrounded.&quot; Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the [[Principle of bivalence]]: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the Liar paradox, the paradox is dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. &quot;Outline of a Theory of Truth&quot;, Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 690-716&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable views==
[[File:Truth.jpg|thumb|''La Vérité'' &quot;Truth&quot; by [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre]]]]

===Ancient history===
The ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] origins of the words &quot;true&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; have some consistent definitions throughout great spans of history that were often associated with topics of [[logic]], [[geometry]], [[mathematics]], [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[natural philosophy]].

[[Socrates|Socrates']], [[Plato|Plato's]] and [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ideas about truth are commonly seen as consistent with correspondence theory.  In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle stated:  &quot;To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true&quot;.&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr&gt;David, Marion (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#1 &quot;Correspondence Theory of Truth&quot;] in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] proceeds to say of Aristotle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;(...) Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the ''Categories'' (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of &quot;underlying things&quot; that make statements true and implies that these &quot;things&quot; (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in ''De Interpretatione'' (16a3) that thoughts are &quot;likenessess&quot; (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. (...)&quot;''&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very similar statements can also be found in Plato (Cratylus 385b2, Sophist 263b).&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], Truth is defined as &quot;unchangeable&quot;, &quot;that which has no distortion&quot;, &quot;that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person&quot;, &quot;that which pervades the universe in all its constancy&quot;. Human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as &quot;Satyam eva jayate&quot; (Truth alone wins), &quot;Satyam muktaye&quot; (Truth liberates), &quot;Satya' is&lt;!--something must be wrong here &quot;is&quot; is english and Satya' is different from &quot;Satyam&quot; used before--&gt; 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam&quot; (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), &quot;When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him ( patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36 ), &quot;The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. ''Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!''&quot; (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1-4 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15-18), Truth is superior to silence (Manusmriti), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like &quot;'''ultra'''&quot; or &quot;'''highest''',&quot; or more literally &quot;'''truest''',&quot; connoting '''purity and excellence'''. For example, satyaloka is the &quot;highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the &quot;golden age&quot; or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on.

===Medieval age===

====Avicenna====
In [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his Metaphysics of Healing, Book I, Chapter 8, as:

''{{quote|&quot;What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Osman Amin (2007), &quot;Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West&quot;, ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

[[Avicenna]] elaborated on his definition of truth in his ''[[Metaphysics]]'' Book Eight, Chapter 6:

''{{Quote|&quot;The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Aertsen&gt;Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152. BRILL, ISBN 90-04-08451-7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

However, this definition is merely a translation of the Latin translation from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Simone van Riet
| title = Liber de philosophia prima, sive Scientia divina
| page = 413
| language = Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:

''{{quote|&quot;Truth is also said of the veridical belief in the existence [of something]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Avicenna: The Metaphysics of The Healing
| publisher = Brigham Young University Press
| year = 2005
| page = 284
| others = Michael E. Marmura
| isbn = 0-934893-77-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

====Aquinas====
Reevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated in his ''Disputed Questions on Truth'':

{{quote|A natural thing, being placed between two intellects, is called ''true'' insofar as it conforms to either. It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 1, 2, c, reply to Obj. 1. Trans. Mulligan, McGlynn, Schmidt, ''Truth'', vol. I, pp. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Veritas supra ens fundatur&quot; (Truth is founded on being). ''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Summa I.16.1]:

{{quote|Veritas est adæquatio intellectus et rei. &lt;br&gt; (Truth is the conformity of the intellect to the things.)}}  Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the [[God|Creator God]] who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; [[reality]]) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the [[sense]]s, then through the [[understanding]] and the [[judgement]] done by [[reason]]. For Aquinas, human [[intelligence]] (&quot;intus&quot;, within and &quot;legere&quot;, to read) has the capability to reach the [[essence]] and [[existence]] of things because it has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.

===Modern age===

====Kant====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth.&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt; Kant writes in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'': &quot;The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kant-1781&quot;&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1781/1787), ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), A58/B82.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;:''&quot;(...) Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only ''by cognizing it''&lt;!-- I wonder if the original had this cursive... --&gt;. Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object. 
''The ancients called such a circle in explanation a ''diallelon''. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man. (...)&quot;''&lt;ref name = &quot;Kant-1801&quot;&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1801), ''The Jäsche Logic'', in ''Lectures on Logic''. Translated and edited by J. Michael Young (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 557-558.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain objects and enable us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition.&lt;ref name = &quot;Vanzo-Kant&quot;&gt;Alberto Vanzo, &quot;Kant on the Nominal Definition of Truth&quot;, ''Kant-Studien'', 101 (2010), pp. 147-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics criticized the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is &quot;impossible without qualification and for every man&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kant-1801&quot; /&gt;

====Hegel====
[[Georg Hegel]] distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self&amp;ndash;moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the [[mechanics]] of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. &quot;Truth is its own self&amp;ndash;movement within itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst.&quot; ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', Preface, ¶ 48&lt;/ref&gt; Teleological truth moves itself in the three&amp;ndash;step form of [[Dialectic|dialectical triplicity]] toward the final goal of  perfect, final, absolute truth. For Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations to absolute truth. [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus|Chalybäus]] used the terms &quot;[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]]&quot;, &quot;[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]&quot; to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity.  The &quot;thesis&quot; consists of an incomplete  historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an &quot;antithesis&quot; occurs which opposes the &quot;thesis.&quot; In turn, the &quot;synthesis&quot; appears when the &quot;thesis&quot; and &quot;antithesis&quot; become [[Sublation|reconciled]] and a higher level of truth is obtained. This &quot;synthesis&quot; thereby becomes a &quot;thesis,&quot; which will again necessitate an &quot;antithesis,&quot; requiring a new &quot;synthesis&quot; until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Spirit]] moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite [[God]].

====Schopenhauer====
For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref&gt;''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', §§ 29&amp;ndash;33&lt;/ref&gt; a [[judgment]] is a combination or separation of two or more [[concept]]s.  If a judgment is to be an expression of [[knowledge]], it must have a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] or ground by which the judgment could be called true. ''Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)''. Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has ''material'' truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or ''formal''. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has ''transcendental'' truth.

====Kierkegaard====
When [[Søren Kierkegaard]], as his character ''Johannes Climacus'', ends his writings: ''My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth'', he does not advocate for [[subjectivism]] in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

While objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'', Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nietzsche====
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed the search for truth or 'the will to truth' was a consequence of the ''[[will to power]]'' of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the will to power, and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', &quot;''The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding...''&quot; (aphorism 4). He proposed the ''will to power'' as a truth only because according to him it was the most life affirming and sincere perspective one could have.

Robert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;(...) Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, &quot;On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense&quot; (&quot;Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn&quot;) as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call &quot;truth&quot; is only &quot;a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.&quot; His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; &quot;truth&quot; is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence. (...)&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wicks, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#EarWri187187 Friedrich Nietzsche - Early Writings: 1872-1876], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Spring 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Whitehead====
[[Alfred North Whitehead]], a British mathematician who became an American philosopher{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}, said: ''&quot;There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that play the devil&quot;.''

The logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since [[half-truth]]s are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.

====Nishida====
According to [[Kitaro Nishida]], &quot;knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Maraldo, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nishida-kitaro/#2.2 Nishida Kitarô - Self-Awareness], in: ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fromm====
[[Erich Fromm]] finds that trying to discuss truth as &quot;absolute truth&quot; is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on &quot;optimal truth&quot;. He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in &quot;a strange and powerful world&quot;. The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in &quot;Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics&quot; (1947), from which excerpts are included below.

: the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where &quot;it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles&quot;.

: In that respect, &quot;a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result&quot;. The history of science is &quot;a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation.&quot;

: As a result &quot;the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period.&quot; Fromm furthermore notes that &quot;different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth&quot; and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth.

====Foucault====
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|right|''[[John 18:38|Quod Est Veritas?]]'' [[Christ]] and [[Pilate]], by [[Nikolai Ge]]]]
Truth, says [[Michel Foucault]], is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an &quot;objective&quot; quality.  He prefers not to use the term truth itself but &quot;Regimes of Truth&quot;.  In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure.  Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of [[Truth#Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].  Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various [[episteme]] throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. &quot;The Order of Things&quot;, London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baudrillard====
[[Jean Baudrillard]] considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something.  He took his cue from [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]]s who he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist.&lt;ref name = &quot;Baudrillard&quot;&gt;Jean Baudrillard. Simulacra and Simulation. Michigan: Michigan University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard wrote in &quot;Precession of the Simulacra&quot;:
::The [[simulacrum]] is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none.  The simulacrum is true.
::—Ecclesiastes&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. [http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html &quot;Simulacra and Simulations&quot;, in ''Selected Writings''], ed. [[Mark Poster]], [[Stanford University Press]], 1988) 166 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard's attribution of this quote to [[Ecclesiastes]] is deliberately fictional. &quot;Baudrillard attributes this quote to Ecclesiastes.  However, the quote is a fabrication (see Jean Baudrillard.  Cool Memories III, 1991-95.   London:   Verso, 1997). Editor's note: In Fragments: Conversations With François L'Yvonnet.   New York: Routledge, 2004:11, Baudrillard acknowledges this 'Borges-like' fabrication.&quot; Cited in footnote #4 in Smith, Richard G., [http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 &quot;Lights, Camera, Action: Baudrillard and the Performance of Representations&quot;], International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 2, Number 1 (January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the &quot;truth&quot; that society is free; scandals (e.g., [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and institutionalised power structures are largely legitimate.&lt;ref name = &quot;Baudrillard&quot;/&gt;

== In medicine and psychiatry ==
There is controversy as to the truth value of a proposition made in [[bad faith]] self-deception, such as when a [[hypochondriac]] has a complaint with no physical symptom.&lt;ref name=PMREN&gt;&quot;Absent a lesion or a physiological disturbance to account readily for the complaint, the complaint was likely to be regarded as male fide&quot;, Post-Modern Reflections on the Ethics of Naming, The Ethics of Diagnosis Philosophy and Medicine, 1992, Volume 40, Section V, 275-300, George Khushf, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r6735871m3782056/ springerlink.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion: omniscience==
{{Main|Omniscience}}
In a religious context, perfect knowledge of all truth about all things (omniscience) is regarded by some [[religion]]s, particularly [[Omniscience#Omniscience in Buddhist India|Buddhism]] and the [[Abrahamic religion]]s ([[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]]), as an attribute of a [[divine being]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] &quot;The Nature and Attributes of God&quot; http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06612a.htm#IID&lt;/ref&gt; In the Abrahamic view, [[God]] can exercise [[divine judgment]], judging the dead on the basis of perfect knowledge of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], &quot;Particular judgment&quot; http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians thought that there was a last judgement by the gods similar in many ways to the Abrahamic one, but instead of omniscient knowledge of truth, the life of the dead person was evaluated by [[Weighing of the Heart]], which would record good and bad deeds.&lt;/ref&gt;
