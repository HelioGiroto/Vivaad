In [[conspiracy theory]], the term '''''New World Order''''' or '''''NWO''''' refers to the emergence of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] one-[[world government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Camp 1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Camp, Gregory S. | title = Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia | publisher = Commish Walsh | year = 1997 | asin = B000J0N8NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet and Lyons 2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Chip Berlet|Berlet Chip]]; Lyons, Matthew N. | title = Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort  | url = http://www.publiceye.org/tooclose/index.html | publisher = Guilford Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-57230-562-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg 2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Goldberg, Robert Alan | title = Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-300-09000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Barkun, Michael | title = [[A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America]] | publisher = University of California Press; 1 edition | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-520-23805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenster 2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Fenster, Mark | title = Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture | publisher = University of Minnesota Press; 2nd edition | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-8166-5494-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secretive [[power elite]] with a [[globalism|globalist]] agenda is [[list of conspiracies (political)|conspiring]] to eventually rule the world through an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] world government—which replaces [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[nation state|nation-states]]—and an all-encompassing [[propaganda]] that [[ideology|ideologizes]] its establishment as the [[Philosophy of history#Social evolutionism|culmination of history's progress]]. Significant occurrences in [[politics]] and [[financial capitalism|finance]] are speculated to be orchestrated by an unduly influential [[cabal]] operating through many [[front organization]]s. Numerous historical and current events are seen as steps in an on-going plot to achieve world domination through [[smoke-filled room|secret political gatherings]] and decision-making processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camp 1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet and Lyons 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenster 2008&quot;/&gt;

Prior to the early 1990s, New World Order [[conspiracism]] was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the [[Patriot movement|militantly anti-government right]], and secondarily [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] concerned with [[end time|end-time]] emergence of the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist 1 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Berlet, Chip | title = Interview: Michael Barkun |date = September 2004| url = http://www.publiceye.org/antisemitism/nw_barkun.html | accessdate = 2009-10-01| authorlink = Chip Berlet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics, such as [[Michael Barkun]] and [[Chip Berlet]], have observed that [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] conspiracy theories about a New World Order have now not only been embraced by many seekers of [[stigmatized knowledge]] but have seeped into [[popular culture]], thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism|millenarian]] scenarios in the [[United States]] of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet and Lyons 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; These political scientists are concerned that this [[mass hysteria]] could have what they judge to be devastating effects on American political life, ranging from widespread [[political alienation]] to escalating [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf terrorism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet and Lyons 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

==History of the term==
During the 20th century, many [[politician|statesmen]], such as [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Winston Churchill]], used the term &quot;[[new world order (politics)|new world order]]&quot; to refer to a new period of history evidencing a dramatic change in world political thought and the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] after [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. They all saw these periods as opportunities to implement [[idealism (international relations)|idealistic]] proposals for [[global governance]] in the sense of new collective efforts to address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual [[nation state|nation-states]] to solve, while always respecting the [[self-determination|right of nations to self-determination]]. These proposals led to the creation of international organizations, such as the [[United Nations]] and [[NATO]], and international regimes, such as the [[Bretton Woods system]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], which were calculated both to maintain a balance of power in favor of the [[United States]] as well as regularize cooperation between nations, in order to achieve a [[ultra-imperialism|peaceful phase of capitalism]]. These creations in particular and [[International relations theory#Liberalism|liberal internationalism]] in general, however, would always be criticized and opposed by American ultraconservative [[business nationalism|business nationalists]] from the 1930s on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buchanan 1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Buchanan, Patrick J. | title = A Republic, Not an Empire: Reclaiming America's Destiny | publisher = Regnery Publishing, Inc. | year = 1999 | asin = B001NHW8GI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[progressivism|Progressives]] welcomed these new international organizations and regimes in the aftermath of the two World Wars, but argued they suffered from a [[democratic deficit]] and therefore were inadequate to not only prevent another [[global war]] but also foster [[global justice]]. The United Nations was designed in 1945 by U.S. bankers and [[United States Department of State|State Department]] planners, and was always intended to remain a free association of sovereign nation-states, not a transition to democratic world government. Thus, activists around the globe formed a [[world federalist movement]] hoping in vain to create a &quot;real&quot; new world order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 1991&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Hughes, James | title =  Better Living Through World Government:: Transnationalism as 21st Century Socialism | year = 1991 | url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/hughes1991worgov/| accessdate = 2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer and futurist [[H. G. Wells]] would go further than progressives in the 1940s by appropriating and redefining the term &quot;new world order&quot; as a synonym for the establishment of a technocratic [[world state]] and [[planned economy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wells 1940&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Wells, H. G. | title = [[The New World Order (Wells)|The New World Order]] | publisher = Hesperides Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4067-2262-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the popularity of his ideas in some [[state socialism|state socialist]] circles, Wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to [[intelligentsia]]s who would, ultimately, have to coordinate a Wellsian new world order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagar 1977&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Wagar, W. Warren | title = H. G. Wells and the World State | publisher = Ayer Co Pub | year = 1977 | isbn = 0-8369-5915-9 | authorlink = W. Warren Wagar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare of 1947–1957]], agitators of the American secular and [[Christian right]], influenced by the work of Canadian conspiracy theorist [[William Guy Carr]], increasingly embraced and spread unfounded fears of [[Freemasons]], [[Illuminati]], and [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jews]] being the driving force behind an &quot;[[comintern|international communist]] conspiracy&quot;. The threat of &quot;Godless communism&quot; in the form of a [[state atheism|state atheistic]] and [[bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic collectivist]] world government, [[demonization|demonized]] as a &quot;Red Menace&quot;, therefore became the main focus of [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[conspiracism]]. The Red Scare would shape one of the core ideas of the political right in the United States which is that [[liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[progressivism in the United States|progressives]] with their [[welfare state|welfare-state]] policies and international cooperation programs such as [[United States foreign aid|foreign aid]] supposedly contribute to a gradual process of [[collectivism]] that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a [[world communism|communist one-world government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Berlet, Chip | title = Dances with Devils: How Apocalyptic and Millennialist Themes Influence Right Wing Scapegoating and Conspiracism | date = Fall 1998, revised 4/15/99 | url = http://www.publiceye.org/apocalyptic/Dances_with_Devils_TOC.html | accessdate = 2009-07-23 | authorlink = Chip Berlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Right-wing populist]] advocacy groups with a [[producerism|producerist]] worldview, such as the [[John Birch Society]], disseminated a multitude of conspiracy theories in the 1960s claiming that the governments of both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] were controlled by a [[cabal]] of [[neoliberalism|corporate internationalists]], greedy bankers and corrupt politicians intent on using the [[United Nations]] as the vehicle to create the &quot;One World Government&quot;. This right-wing [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalist]] conspiracism would fuel the Bircher campaign for [[United States withdrawal from the United Nations|U.S. withdrawal from the U.N.]]. American writer Mary M. Davison, in her 1966 booklet ''The Profound Revolution'', traced the alleged New World Order conspiracy to the creation of the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913 by international bankers, who she claimed later formed the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in 1921 as the [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]]. At the time the booklet was published, &quot;international bankers&quot; would have been interpreted by many readers as a reference to a postulated &quot;international Jewish banking conspiracy&quot; masterminded by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;

Claiming that the term &quot;New World Order&quot; is used by a secretive elite dedicated to the destruction of all national sovereignties, American writer [[Gary Allen]], in his 1971 book ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'', 1974 book ''Rockefeller: Campaigning for the New World Order'' and 1987 book '' Say &quot;No!&quot; to the New World Order'', articulated the anti-globalist theme of much current right-wing populist conspiracism in the U.S.. Thus, after the [[revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in the early 1990s, the main demonized [[scapegoat]] of the American [[far right]] shifted seamlessly from [[crypto-communism|crypto-communists]] who plotted on behalf of the Red Menace to globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order. The relatively painless nature of the shift was due to growing right-wing populist [[business nationalism|opposition to corporate internationalism]] but also in part to the basic underlying apocalyptic millenarian paradigm, which fed the [[Cold War]] and the [[witch-hunts]] of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy period]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;

In his 11 September 1990 ''[[wikisource:Toward a New World Order|Toward a New World Order]]'' speech to a joint session of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], President [[George H. W. Bush]] described [[New world order (politics)#The Gulf War and Bush's formulation|his objectives for post-Cold-War global governance]] in cooperation with [[post-Soviet states]]:

{{quotation|Until now, the world we’ve known has been a world divided—a world of barbed wire and concrete block, conflict and cold war. Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. In the words of Winston Churchill, a &quot;world order&quot; in which &quot;the principles of justice and fair play ... protect the weak against the strong ...&quot; A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.}}

''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that progressives were denouncing this new world order as a rationalization for [[American imperialism|American imperial]] ambitions in the [[Middle East]], while [[conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] rejected new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of U.N. revival.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;&quot;George Bush Meet Woodrow Wilson&quot;, ''New York Times'', November 20, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Chip Berlet]], an American investigative reporter specializing in the study of [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] movements in the U.S., writes:

{{quotation|When President Bush announced his new foreign policy would help build a New World Order, his phrasing surged through the Christian and secular hard right like an electric shock, since the phrase had been used to represent the dreaded collectivist One World Government for decades. Some Christians saw Bush as signaling the End Times betrayal by a world leader. Secular anticommunists saw a bold attempt to smash US sovereignty and impose a tyrannical collectivist system run by the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;}}

American televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] with his 1991 best-selling book ''[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]'' became the most prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history as a theater in which [[Wall Street]], the Federal Reserve System, Council on Foreign Relations, [[Bilderberg Group]], and [[Trilateral Commission]] control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging us constantly and covertly in the direction of world government for the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

Observers note that the galvanization of right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, such as [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson]], [[Mark Koernke]] and Robert K. Spear, into militancy led to the rise of the [[militia movement]], which spread its [[anti-government]] ideology through speeches at rallies and meetings, through books and videotapes sold at [[gun show]]s, through shortwave and satellite radio, and through fax networks and computer bulletin boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt; However, overnight AM radio shows and [[viral marketing|viral propaganda]] on the Internet is what most effectively contributed to their [[extremism|extremist]] political ideas about the New World Order finding their way into the previously apolitical literature of many [[Kennedy assassinologist]]s, [[ufologist]]s, [[lost lands|lost land theorists]], and, most recently, [[occultist]]s. The worldwide appeal of these subcultures then transmitted New World Order conspiracism like a &quot;[[Viruses of the Mind|mind virus]]&quot; to a large new audience of seekers of [[stigmatized knowledge]] from the mid-1990s on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; Hollywood [[conspiracy fiction|conspiracy-thriller]] televisions shows and films also played a role in introducing a vast popular audience to various [[fringe theory|fringe theories]] related to New World Order conspiracism ([[black helicopter]], [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] “concentration camps”, etc.), which were previously confined to [[Radical Right|radical right-wing]] subcultures for decades. The 1993-2002 television series ''[[X-Files]]'', the 1997 film ''[[Conspiracy Theory (film)|Conspiracy Theory]]'' and the 1998 film ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files: Fight the Future]]'' are often cited as notable examples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- Please do not add further examples unless they are noted as such by a reliable source (e.g., author, review, article [no blogs], etc.). Otherwise, they will be removed; Wikipedia cannot designate something as having introduced the public to various fringe theories related to New World Order conspiracism if reliable sources have not already done so. --&gt;

Following the turn of the 20th to 21st century, specifically during the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], many politicians and pundits, such as [[Gordon Brown]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Grice 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Grice, Andrew | title = This was the Bretton Woods of our times | date = 12 January 2009 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/andrew-grice/andrew-grice-this-was-the-bretton-woods-of-our-times-1662231.html | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Kissinger]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kissinger 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Kissinger, Henry A. | title = The chance for a new world order | date = Monday, January 12, 2009 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/opinion/12iht-edkissinger.1.19281915.html | accessdate = 2009-07-23 | authorlink = Henry Kissinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the term &quot;[[new world order (politics)#Recent political usage|new world order]]&quot; in their advocacy for a comprehensive reform of the [[global financial system]] and their [[International monetary systems#Calls for a &quot;New Bretton Woods&quot;|calls for a &quot;New Bretton Woods&quot;]], which takes into account [[emerging markets]] such as [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[India]]. These declarations had the unintended consequence of providing fresh fodder for New World Order conspiracism, and culminated in talk show host [[Sean Hannity]] stating on his [[Fox News Channel]] program ''[[Hannity]]'' that &quot;conspiracy theorists were right&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hannity&gt;{{Cite book |last=Romero |first=George |title=The Rescue |year=2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fHZStF5WgTEC&amp;pg=PA246 |page=246 |isbn=1-4564-9962-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News in general, and its opinion show ''[[Glenn Beck (TV program)|Glenn Beck]]'' in particular, have been repeatedly criticized by progressive [[media watchdog]] groups for not only mainstreaming the New World Order conspiracy theories of the [[Radical Right|radical right]] but possibly agitating its [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolves]] into action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Media Matters for America 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = [[Media Matters for America]] | title = Black helicopter alert!

American film directors Luke Meyer and [[Andrew Neel]] released ''[[New World Order (film)|New World Order]]'' in 2009, a critically acclaimed documentary film which explores the world of conspiracy theorists, such as American radio host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]], who are committed to exposing and vigorously opposing what they perceive to be an emerging New World Order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.ign.com/articles/963/963022p1.html IGN] &quot;SXSW 09: New World Order Review: A fascinating documentary about conspiracy theorists,&quot; by Christoper Monfette (March 16th, 2009; retrieved on May 11th, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators, such as Alex Jones, and [[hip hop music]]’s left-wing populist rappers, such as [[KRS-One]], [[Professor Griff]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], and [[Immortal Technique]], which illustrates how [[anti-elitism|anti-elitist]] conspiracism creates unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose the political system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gosa 2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Counterknowledge, racial paranoia, and the cultic milieu: Decoding hip hop conspiracy theory | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | year = 2011 | author = Gosa, Travis L. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X11000167 | accessdate = 2011-07-11 | doi=10.1016/j.poetic.2011.03.003 | pages = 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
There are numerous [[Conspiracy theory#Types|systemic conspiracy theories]] through which the concept of a New World Order is viewed. The following is a list of the major ones in relatively chronological order:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Johnson | first = George | year = 1983 | title = Architects of Fear: Conspiracy Theories and Paranoia in American Politics | publisher = Jeremy P.

===End Time===
Since the 19th century, many [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millennialism|millennial]] [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatologists]], starting with [[John Nelson Darby]], have feared a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical New World Order as the fulfillment of [[prophecies]] about the &quot;[[end time]]&quot; in the [[Bible]], specifically in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], the [[Book of Daniel]], the [[Olivet discourse]] found in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], and the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Hughes, Richard T. | title =  Revelation, Revolutions, and the Tyrannical New World Order | year = 2011 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-t-hughes/revolutions-in-the-middle_b_827201.html | accessdate = 2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that people who have made a [[deal with the Devil]] to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a [[utopia]]n world government, which rests on the spiritual foundations of a [[syncretism|syncretic]]-[[messianism|messianic]] world religion, that will later reveal itself to be a [[dystopia]]n world empire, which imposes the [[imperial cult]] of an “Unholy Trinity” — [[Satan]], the [[Antichrist]] and the [[False Prophet]]. In many contemporary Christian conspiracy theories, the False Prophet will either be the last [[pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]] (groomed and installed by an [[Alta Vendita]] or [[Jesuit conspiracy theories|Jesuit conspiracy]]) or a [[guru]] from the [[New Age movement]] or even the leader of an elite [[fundamentalist Christian]] organization like [[The Fellowship (Christian organization)|the Fellowship]], while the Antichrist will either be the [[president of the European Union]] or the [[secretary-general of the United Nations]] or even the [[caliph]] of a [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2011&quot;/&gt;

Some of the most vocal critics of end-time conspiracy theories come from within Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt; In 1993, historian Bruce Barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic Christian conspiracism in the ''Christian Research Journal'', when reviewing [[Pat Robertson|Robertson]]'s 1991 book ''[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barron 1993&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = Bruce, Barron | title = A Summary Critique.

Hughes argues that &quot;New World Order&quot; rhetoric libels the Christian faith since the &quot;New World Order&quot;, as defined by Christian conspiracy theorists, has no basis in the Bible whatsoever and that, in fact, this idea is not only unbiblical; it is anti-biblical and fundamentally [[anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] because, by misinterpreting key passages in the Book of Revelation, it turns a comforting message about the coming [[kingdom of God]] into one of fear, panic and despair in the face of an allegedly approaching one-world government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2011&quot;/&gt; [[Progressive Christianity|Progressive Christians]], such as preacher-theologian [[Peter J.

===Freemasonry===
{{Main|Masonic conspiracy theories}}
[[Freemasonry]] is one of the world's oldest secular [[fraternity|fraternal organization]]s, which arose in late 16th- to early 17th-century Britain. Over the years a number of allegations and conspiracy theories have been directed towards Freemasonry, including the allegation that Freemasons have a hidden political agenda and are conspiring to bring about a New World Order, a world government organized according to Masonic principles and/or governed only by Freemasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;

The [[esotericism|esoteric]] nature of [[Masonic symbolism]] and [[Masonic rites|rites]] led to Freemasons being first accused of secretly practicing [[Satanism]] in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt; The original allegation of a [[Masonic conspiracy theories|conspiracy within Freemasonry]] to subvert religions and governments in order to take over the world traces back to Scottish author [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]], whose [[reactionary]] conspiracy theories crossed the Atlantic, and during the 19th century influenced outbreaks of Protestant [[anti-Masonry]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt; In the 1890s, French writer [[Léo Taxil]] wrote a series of pamphlets and books, denouncing Freemasonry, charging their lodges with worshiping [[Lucifer]] as the [[Supreme Being]]. Despite the fact that Taxil admitted that [[Taxil hoax|his claims were all a hoax]], they were and are believed and repeated by numerous conspiracy theorists, and had a huge influence on subsequent anti-Masonic claims about Freemasonry.&lt;ref name=&quot;De Hoyos 2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = De Hoyos, Arturo | title = As it True What They Say About Freemasonry? | publisher = M. Evans and Company, revided edition | year = 2011 | isbn = 1-59077-153-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conspiracy theorists eventually speculated that some of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], such as [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], of having Masonic [[sacred geometry|sacred geometric]] designs interwoven into American society, particularly in the [[Great Seal of the United States]], the [[United States one-dollar bill]], the architecture of [[National Mall#Landmarks, museums and other features|National Mall landmarks]], and the [[streets and highways of Washington, D.C.]], as part of a master plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;  Accordingly, colonial American Freemasons are portrayed as having embraced [[Illuminati|Bavarian Illuminism]] and used the power of the [[occult]] to bind their planning of a government in conformity with the plan of the &quot;Masonic God&quot; because of their belief that the &quot;[[Great Architect of the Universe]]&quot; has given the United States the task of eventually establishing the &quot;[[immanentize the eschaton|Kingdom of God on Earth]]&quot; — a Masonic world government with [[New Jerusalem]] as its capital city and the [[Third Temple]] as its holiest site — the initially utopian New World Order presided over by a Masonic [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aho on Masonry 1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = Aho, Barbara | title = The Masonic Foundations of the United States | year = 1997 | url = http://watch.pair.com/mason.html | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masonic lodge room, Salt Lake Masonic Temple.JPG|thumb|right|220 px|A [[Masonic Lodge]] room]]

Freemasons rebut these claims of Masonic conspiracy. Freemasonry, which promotes [[rationalism]], places no power in occult symbols themselves, and it is not a part of its principles to view the drawing of symbols, no matter how large, as an act of consolidating or controlling power.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMFAQ 6.8&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author = McKeown, Trevor W. | date = 5 May 2004 | url = http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry06.html#68 | title = Doesn't the satanic design of Washington, DC’s street plan prove that there’s a masonic conspiracy? | work = Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. &amp; A.

Although the [[Continental Freemasonry|European continental branch of Freemasonry]] has organizations that allow political discussion within their [[Masonic Lodge]]s and a few operate as active political lobbies for [[secularism|secularist]] causes, as exemplified by the [[Grand Orient de France|Grand Orient of France]], Masonic researcher Trevor W. McKeown argues: 

{{quotation|The accusation that Freemasonry has a hidden agenda to establish a Masonic government ignores several facts. While agreeing on certain Masonic Landmarks, the many independent and sovereign Grand Lodges act as such, and do not agree on many other points of belief and practice. Also, as can be seen from a [[List of Freemasons|survey of famous Freemasons]], individual Freemasons hold beliefs that span the spectrum of politics. The term &quot;Masonic government&quot; has no meaning since individual Freemasons hold many different opinions on what constitutes a good government.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM FAQ 4.8&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author = McKeown, Trevor W. | date = 5 May 2004 | url = http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry04.html#politics | title = Does Freemasonry have a secret political agenda? | work = Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. &amp; A. M. | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Illuminati===
The Order of the [[Illuminati]] was an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment-age]] secret society founded by university professor [[Adam Weishaupt]] on 1 May 1776, in [[Upper Bavaria]], Germany. The movement consisted of advocates of [[freethought]], [[secularism]], [[liberalism]], [[republicanism]] and [[gender equality]], recruited in the German [[Masonic Lodge]]s, who sought to teach [[rationalism]] through [[mystery school]]s. In 1785, the order was infiltrated, broken up and suppressed by the government agents of [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria]], in his preemptive campaign to neutralize the threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the Bavarian [[monarchy]] and its [[state religion]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stauffer 1918&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = Stauffer, Vernon L. | title = The European Illuminati | work = New England and the Bavarian Illuminati | publisher = Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. &amp; A. M.| year = 1918 | url = http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/stauffer.html | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, [[reactionary]] conspiracy theorists, such as Scottish physicist [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]] and French [[Jesuit]] priest [[Augustin Barruel]], began speculating that the Illuminati survived their suppression and became the masterminds behind the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Illuminati were accused of being [[subversion|subversives]] who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a [[revolutionary wave]] in [[Europe]] and the rest of the world in order to spread the most [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] ideas and movements of the Enlightenment — [[anti-clericalism]], [[anti-monarchism]], and [[protofeminism|anti-patriarchalism]] —  and create a world [[noocracy]] and [[Cult of Reason|cult of reason]]. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of European [[ruling class]]es, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 [[revolutions of 1848|the very revolutions they sought to prevent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McKeown&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = McKeown, Trevor W. | title = A Bavarian Illuminati primer | year = 2004 | url = http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/illuminati.html | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[interwar period]] of the 20th century, [[fascism|fascist]] propagandists, such as British revisionist historian [[Nesta Helen Webster]] and American socialite [[Edith Starr Miller]], not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which serves the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both [[finance capitalism]] and [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]] in order to [[divide and rule]] the world. American evangelist [[Gerald Burton Winrod]] and other conspiracy theorists within the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] movement in the United States — which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment [[secular humanism]], [[modernism]], and liberalism — became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S. [[right-wing populism|Right-wing populists]], such as members of the [[John Birch Society]], subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities ([[Skull and Bones]]), gentlemen's clubs ([[Bohemian Club]]) and think tanks ([[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Trilateral Commission]]) of the [[American upper class]] are [[front organization]]s of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

Skeptics argue that evidence would suggest that the Bavarian Illuminati was nothing more than a curious historical footnote since there is no evidence that the Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKeown&quot;/&gt;

===''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion''===
''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' is an [[antisemitic canard]], originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1903, alleging a [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]] to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a [[cabal]] of Jewish masterminds, which has coopted [[Freemasonry]] and is plotting to rule the world on behalf of all Jews because they believe themselves to be the [[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Soviet Jewry: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations, United States Congress. House. Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 1984. p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Protocols'' incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the [[John Robison (physicist)|Robison]] and [[Augustin Barruel|Barruel]] attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-[[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist]] movements in Russia. ''The Protocols'' reflect themes similar to more general [[Counter-Enlightenment|critiques of Enlightenment]] liberalism by [[traditionalist conservatism|conservative]] aristocrats who support [[monarchy|monarchies]] and [[state religion]]s. The interpretation intended by the publication of ''The Protocols'' is that if one peels away the layers of the [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Masonic conspiracy]], past the [[Illuminati]], one finds the rotten Jewish core.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;

[[File:1920 The Jewish Peril - Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode Ltd - 1st ed..jpg|upright|thumb|Cover of a 1920 copy of ''[[The Jewish Peril]]'']]

Multiple polemicists, such as Irish journalist [[Philip Graves]] in a 1921 ''[[The Times]]'' article, and British academic [[Norman Cohn]] in his 1967 book ''[[Warrant for Genocide]]'', have proven ''The Protocols'' to be both a [[hoax]] and a clear case of plagiarism. There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist [[Matvei Golovinski]] fabricated the text for [[Okhrana]], the [[secret police]] of the [[Russian Empire]], as a work of [[counter-revolutionary]] [[propaganda]] prior to the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], by plagiarizing it, almost word for word in some passages, from ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'', a 19th century satire against [[Napoleon III of France]] written by French political satirist and [[Legitimism|Legitimist]] militant [[Maurice Joly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spargo 1921&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Spargo, John | title = The Jew and American Ideals | publisher = Harper &amp; Brothers | year = 1921 | isbn = | authorlink = John Spargo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsible for feeding many [[antisemetism|antisemitic]] and [[anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] mass hysterias of the 20th century, ''The Protocols'' has been influential in the development of some conspiracy theories, including some New World Order theories, and appears repeatedly in certain contemporary conspiracy literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; For example, the authors of the 1982 controversial book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' concluded that ''The Protocols'' was the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the [[Priory of Sion]]. They speculated that this secret society was working behind the scenes to establish a [[theocracy|theocratic]] &quot;[[United States of Europe]]&quot;. Politically and religiously unified through the [[imperial cult]] of a [[Merovingian]] [[Great Catholic Monarch|Great Monarch]] — supposedly descended from a [[Jesus bloodline]] — who occupies both the throne of Europe and the [[Holy See]], this &quot;Holy European Empire&quot; would become the [[hyperpower]] of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982&quot;&gt;Henry Lincoln, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', Corgi, 1982. ISBN 0-552-12138-X.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Priory of Sion, itself, has been exhaustively [[debunker|debunked]] by journalists and scholars as a hoax,&lt;ref name =CBS&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1552009.shtml ''The Secret of the Priory of Sion'', '60 Minutes', 30 April 2006, presented by Ed Bradley, produced by Jeanne Langley, CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt; some [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatologists]] who believe ''The Protocols'' is authentic became convinced that the Priory of Sion was a fulfillment of [[prophecies]] found in the [[Book of Revelation]] and further proof of an [[Antichrist|anti-Christian]] conspiracy of epic proportions signaling the imminence of a New World Order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aho on the Merovigians 1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = Aho, Barbara | title = The Merovingian Dynasty: Satanic Bloodline of the AntiChrist &amp; False Prophet | year = 1997 | url = http://watch.pair.com/merovingian.html | accessdate = 2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that the current gambit of contemporary conspiracy theorists who use ''The Protocols'' is to claim that they &quot;really&quot; come from some group other than the Jews such as [[fallen angel]]s or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Alien invasion|alien invaders]]. Although it is hard to determine whether the conspiracy-minded actually believe this or are simply trying to sanitize a discredited text, skeptics argue that it doesn't make much difference, since they leave the actual, antisemitic text unchanged. The result is to give ''The Protocols'' credibility and circulation when it deserves neither.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist 1 2004&quot;/&gt;

===Round Table===
During the second half of [[Britain's Imperial Century|Britain's &quot;imperial century&quot; between 1815 and 1914]], English-born South African businessman, mining magnate, and politician [[Cecil Rhodes]] advocated the [[British Empire]] reannexing the [[United States|United States of America]] and reforming itself into an &quot;[[Imperial Federation]]&quot; to bring about a [[hyperpower]] and lasting [[world peace]]. In his first will, of 1877, written at the age of 23, he expressed his wish to fund a [[secret society]] (known as the [[Society of the Elect]]) that would advance this goal:

{{quotation|To and for the establishment, promotion and development of a Secret Society, the true aim and object whereof shall be for the extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom, and of colonisation by British subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise, and especially the occupation by British settlers of the entire Continent of Africa, the Holy Land, the Valley of the Euphrates, the Islands of Cyprus and Candia, the whole of South America, the Islands of the Pacific not heretofore possessed by Great Britain, the whole of the Malay Archipelago, the seaboard of China and Japan, the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members of the Empire and, finally, the foundation of so great a Power as to render wars impossible, and promote the best interests of humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flint 1976&quot;/&gt;}}

In his later wills, a more mature Rhodes abandoned the idea and instead concentrated on what became the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], which had British statesman [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]] as one of its trustees. Established in 1902, the original goal of the trust fund was to foster peace among the [[great powers]] by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future British, American, and German leaders by having enabled them to study for free at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Flint 1976&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Flint, John E. | title = Cecil Rhodes | publisher = Little Brown &amp; Company; 1st edition | year = 1976 | isbn = 0-316-28630-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner and British official [[Lionel George Curtis]] were the architects of the [[Round Table movement]], a network of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its [[Self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]]. To this end, Curtis founded the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book ''The Commonwealth of God'', began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to [[Protestant churches]] as being the work of the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] to elicit their support.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Lionel. ''Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God'' London (1938). MacMillan &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner and Curtis.

The [[Council on Foreign Relations]] began in 1917 with a group of New York academics who were asked by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to offer options for the [[foreign policy of the United States]] in the [[interwar period]]. Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state, [[Elihu Root]], that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council’s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/about/history/cfr/index.html History of CFR – Council on Foreign Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trilateral Commission]] was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker [[David Rockefeller]], who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the [[United States]], [[European Union|Europe]] and [[Japan]]. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.

In the 1960s, [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] individuals and groups with a [[producerism|producerist]] worldview, such as members of the [[John Birch Society]], were the first to combine and spread an ultraconservative [[business nationalism|business nationalist]] critique of [[neoliberalism|corporate internationalists]] networked through think tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations with a grand conspiracy theory casting them as [[front organization]]s for the Round Table of the &quot;Anglo-American [[the Establishment|Establishment]]&quot;, which are financed by an &quot;international banking cabal&quot; that has supposedly been plotting from the late 19th century on to impose an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] new world order through a [[global financial system]]. Anti-[[globalism|globalist]] conspiracy theorists therefore fear that international bankers are planning to eventually subvert the independence of the U.S. by subordinating national [[sovereignty]] to a strengthened [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scienta Press&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = Scienta Press staff | title = Carroll Quigley: Theorist of Civilizations | year =  | url = http://www.scientiapress.com/findings/quigley.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research findings of historian [[Carroll Quigley]], author of the 1966 book ''[[Tragedy and Hope]]'', are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] ([[Cleon Skousen]]) and [[New Left]] ([[Carl Oglesby]]) to substantiate this view, even though he argued that the Establishment is not involved in a plot to implement a one-world government but rather British and American [[American imperialism|benevolent imperialism]] driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United Kingdom and the United States. Quigley also argued that, although the [[Round Table movement#Current organisation and membership|Round Table still exists today]], its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during [[World War I]] and slowly waned after the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Today the Round Table is largely a [[ginger group]], designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scienta Press&quot;/&gt;

[[Larry McDonald]], the 2nd president of the [[John Birch Society]] and a [[conservative Democrat]]ic member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who represented the 7th congressional district of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], wrote a forward for [[Gary Allen|Allen]]'s 1976 book ''The Rockefeller File'', wherein he stated:

{{quotation|The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government, combining super-capitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control&amp;nbsp;... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lawrence P. Introduction. [http://www.mega.nu:8080/ampp/gary_allen_rocker/ ''The Rockefeller File'']. By [[Gary Allen]]. Seal Beach, CA: '76 Press, 1976. ISBN 0-89245-001-0.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his 2002 autobiography ''Memoirs'', Rockefeller wrote:

{{quotation|For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents ... to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rockefeller 1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Rockefeller, David | title = Memoirs | publisher = Random House | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-679-40588-7 | authorlink = David Rockefeller}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Barkun argues that this statement is partly facetious (the claim of &quot;conspiracy&quot; and &quot;[[treason]]&quot;) and partly serious — the desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Europe, and Japan, for example — an ideal that used to be a hallmark of the [[neoliberalism|internationalist]] wing of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] — known as &quot;[[Rockefeller Republican]]s&quot; in honor of [[Nelson Rockefeller]] — when there was an internationalist wing. The statement, however, is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations uses its role as the [[brain trust]] of American presidents, senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World Order in the form of a one-world government.

In a 13 November 2007 interview with Canadian journalist [[Benjamin Fulford]], Rockefeller countered:

{{quotation|I don't think that I really feel that we need a world government. We need governments of the world that work together and collaborate. But, I can't imagine that there would be any likelihood or even that it would be desirable to have a single government elected by the people of the world ... There have been people, ever since I've had any kind of position in the world, who have accused me of being ruler of the world. I have to say that I think for the large part, I would have to decide to describe them as crackpots.

Some American [[social criticism|social critics]], such as Laurence H. Shoup, argue that the Council on Foreign Relations is an &quot;[[American imperialism#Marxist–Leninist|imperial]] brain trust&quot;, which has, for decades, played a central behind-the-scenes role in shaping U.S. foreign policy choices for the post-WWII international order and the [[Cold War]], by determining what options show up on the [[political agenda|agenda]] and what options do not even make it to the table;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoup &amp; Minter 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author =  Shoup, Laurence H.; Minter, William | title = Imperial Brain Trust: The Council on Foreign Relations and United States Foreign Policy | publisher = Authors Choice Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-595-32426-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as [[G. William Domhoff]], argue that it is in fact a mere policy discussion forum,&lt;ref name=&quot;Domhoff 2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Domhoff | first = G. William | authorlink = G.

===''The Open Conspiracy''===
In his 1928 book ''[[The Open Conspiracy]]'' British writer and futurist [[H. G. Wells]] promoted [[cosmopolitanism]] and offered blueprints for a [[world revolution]] and [[World Brain|world brain]] to establish a technocratic [[world state]] and [[planned economy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wells 1928&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Wells, H. G. | title = [[The Open Conspiracy]] | publisher = Book Tree | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-58509-275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells warned, however, in his 1940 book ''[[The New World Order (Wells)|The New World Order]]'' that:

{{quotation|... when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. Countless people ... will hate the new world order, be rendered unhappy by the frustration of their passions and ambitions through its advent and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wells 1940&quot;/&gt;}}

Wells' books were influential in giving a second meaning to the term &quot;[[new world order (politics)|new world order]]&quot;, which would only be used by both [[state socialism|state socialist]] supporters and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] opponents for generations to come. However, despite the popularity and notoriety of his ideas, Wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to [[intelligentsia]]s who would, ultimately, have to coordinate the Wellsian new world order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2009188 H. G. Wells, British Patriot in Search of a World State]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Age===
British [[Neo-Theosophy|neo-Theosophical]] occultist [[Alice Bailey]], one of the founders of the so-called [[New Age]] movement, prophesied in 1940 the eventual victory of the [[Allies of World War II]] over the [[Axis powers]] (which occurred in 1945) and the establishment by the Allies of a political and religious New World Order. She saw a federal world government as the culmination of [[The Open Conspiracy|Wells' Open Conspiracy]] but favorably argued that it would be [[synarchist]] because it was guided by the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], intent on preparing humanity for the [[Second Coming of Christ#Theosophy|mystical second coming]] of [[Christ]], and the dawning of the [[Age of Aquarius]]. According to Bailey, a group of ascended masters called the [[Great White Brotherhood]] works on the &quot;[[plane (esotericism)|inner plane]]s&quot; to oversee the transition to the New World Order but, for now, the members of this [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] are only known to a few [[occult science|occult scientists]], with whom they communicate [[telepathy|telepathically]], but as the need for their personal involvement in the plan increases, there will be an &quot;Externalization of the Hierarchy&quot; and everyone will know of their presence on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Bailey, Alice A. | year = 1957 | url = http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/externalisation/contents.html | title = The Externalization of the Hierarchy | work = | publisher = USNISA | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey's writings, along with American writer [[Marilyn Ferguson]]'s 1980 book ''[[Marilyn Ferguson#The Aquarian Conspiracy|The Aquarian Conspiracy]]'', contributed to conspiracy theorists of the [[Christian right]] viewing the New Age movement as the &quot;[[pseudoreligion|false religion]]&quot; that would [[supersessionism|supersede]] Christianity in a New World Order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cumbey 1985&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Cumbey, Constance | title = The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow: The New Age Movement and our Coming Age of Barbarism | publisher = Huntington House Publishers; Revised edition | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-910311-03-X | authorlink = Constance Cumbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics argue that the term &quot;New Age movement&quot; is a misnomer, generally used by conspiracy theorists as a catch-all rubric for any [[new religious movement]] that is not [[fundamentalist Christian]]. By their lights, anything that is not Christian is by definition actively and willfully [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = McKeown, Trevor W. | date = 5 May 2004 | url = http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry08.html#new | title = Has Freemasonry become part of the New Age movement? | work = Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. &amp; A. M. | accessdate = 2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, since the 2000s (decade), New World Order conspiracism is increasingly being embraced and propagandized by New Age [[occultists]], who are people bored by [[rationalism]] and drawn to [[stigmatized knowledge]] — such as [[alternative medicine]], [[astrology]], [[quantum mysticism]], [[spiritualism]], and [[Theosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like ''Esoteric Agenda'', claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order in order to take advantage of the growing [[2012 phenomenon]], which has its origins in the fringe [[Mayanism|Mayanist]] theories of New Age writers [[José Argüelles]], [[Terence McKenna]], and [[Daniel Pinchbeck]].

Skeptics argue that the connection of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge — what [[the Establishment]] spurns — must be true. The result is a large, self-referential network in which, for example, some [[UFO religion]]ists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian [[shamanism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

===Fourth Reich===
Conspiracy theorists often use the term &quot;[[Fourth Reich]]&quot; simply as a pejorative synonym for the &quot;New World Order&quot; to imply that its state ideology and government will be similar to Germany's [[Third Reich]]. However, some conspiracy theorists use the research findings of American journalist [[Edwin Black]], author of the 2009 book ''Nazi Nexus'', to claim that some American corporations and philanthropic foundations — whose complicity was pivotal to the Third Reich's war effort, [[Nazi eugenics]] and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] — are now conspiring to build a Fourth Reich.

Conspiracy theorists, such as American writer [[Jim Marrs]], claim that some [[list of former Nazi Party members|ex-Nazis]], who survived the fall of the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]], along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere, given safe haven by organizations like [[ODESSA]] and [[Die Spinne]], have been working behind the scenes since the end of [[World War II]] to enact at least some of the principles of [[Nazism]] (e.g., [[militarism]], [[imperialism]], [[surveillance abuse|widespread spying on citizens]], [[corporatism]], the use of [[propaganda model|propaganda to manufacture a national consensus]]) into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S.. They cite the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under [[Operation Paperclip]] to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from [[Nazi UFOs]], and the acquisition and creation of [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both [[Europe]] and the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marrs 2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Marrs, Jim | title = The Rise of the Fourth Reich: The Secret Societies That Threaten to Take Over America | publisher = William Morrow | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-06-124558-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[neo-Nazi]] conspiracy is said to be animated by an &quot;Iron Dream&quot; in which the [[American imperialism|American Empire]], having thwarted the [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]] and overthrown its [[Zionist Occupation Government]], gradually establishes a Fourth Reich formally known as the &quot;Western Imperium&quot; — a [[pan-nationalism|pan]]-[[Aryan race|Aryan]] world empire modeled after [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] — which reverses the &quot;[[The Decline of the West|decline of the West]]&quot; and ushers a golden age of [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeskind 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Zeskind, Leonard | title = Blood and Politics: The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-374-10903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that conspiracy theorists grossly overestimate the influence of ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that [[political repression]] at home and [[imperialism]] abroad have a long history in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as [[Sheldon Wolin]], have expressed concern that the twin forces of [[democratic deficit]] and [[superpower]] status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an [[inverted totalitarianism]] which contradicts many principles of Nazism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolin 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Pipes, Daniel | title = Inverted Totalitarianism | date = 1 May 2003 | url = http://www.thenation.com/article/inverted-totalitarianism | accessdate = 2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alien invasion===
Since the late 1970s, [[extraterrestrials]] from other [[planetary habitability|habitable planets]] or [[interdimensional hypothesis|parallel dimensions]] (such as &quot;[[Grey alien|Greys]]&quot;) and intraterrestrials from [[Hollow Earth]] (such as &quot;[[Reptilians]]&quot;) have been included in the New World Order conspiracy, in more or less dominant roles, as in the theories put forward by American writers Stan Deyo and [[Milton William Cooper]], and British writer [[David Icke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140296 The Ten Most Popular Conspiracy Theories]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frel 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Frel, January | title = Inside the Great Reptilian Conspiracy: From Queen Elizabeth to Barack Obama – They Live! | date = 1 September 2010 | url = http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/147967 | accessdate = 2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common theme in these conspiracy theories is that aliens have been among us for decades, centuries or millennia, but a government [[cover-up]] enforced by “[[Men in Black]]” has shielded the public from knowledge of a secret [[alien invasion]]. Motivated by [[speciesism]] and [[imperialism]], these aliens have been and are secretly manipulating developments and changes in [[human]] society in order to more efficiently control and exploit human beings. In some theories, alien infiltrators have [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into human form and [[cryptoterrestrial hypothesis|move freely throughout human society]], even to the point of taking control of command positions in governmental, corporate, and religious institutions, and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frel 2010&quot;/&gt; A mythical covert government agency of the United States code-named [[Majestic 12]] is often imagined to be the [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]] which [[collaborationism|collaborates]] with the alien occupation and permits [[alien abduction]]s, in exchange for assistance in the development and testing of [[military disc-shaped aircraft|military &quot;flying saucers&quot;]] at [[Area 51]], in order for [[United States armed forces|U.S. armed forces]] to achieve [[full-spectrum dominance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

Skeptics, who adhere to the [[psychosocial hypothesis]] for [[unidentified flying objects]], argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and [[UFO conspiracy theory]] is a product of not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]] for UFOs but of the [[far right]] and [[ufologist]]s actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human [[scapegoating|scapegoats]] ([[Freemasons]], [[Illuminati]], [[Jews]], etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

===''Brave New World''===
[[Antiscience]] and [[neo-Luddism|neo-Luddite]] conspiracy theorists emphasize [[technology forecasting]] in their New World Order conspiracy theories. They speculate that the global power elite are [[reactionary modernism|reactionary modernists]] pursuing a [[transhumanist]] agenda to develop and use [[human enhancement technologies]] in order to become a &quot;[[Posthuman#Posthuman in transhumanism|posthuman]] ruling [[caste]]&quot;, while [[accelerating change|change accelerates]] toward a [[technological singularity]] — a theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal unenhanced humans will be unable to predict or even understand the rapid changes occurring in the world around them. Conspiracy theorists fear the outcome will either be the emergence of a ''[[Brave New World]]''-like [[dystopia]] — a &quot;Brave New World Order&quot; — or the [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins 2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Collins, Phillip D. | title = The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship: An Examination of Epistemic Autocracy, From the 19th to the 21st Century | publisher = BookSurge Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4196-3932-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[democratic transhumanism|Democratic transhumanists]], such as American sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]], counter that many influential members of the American Establishment are [[bioconservatism|bioconservatives]] strongly opposed to [[human enhancement]], as demonstrated by [[The President's Council on Bioethics|President Bush's Council on Bioethics]]'s proposed international treaty prohibiting [[human cloning]] and [[germline engineering]]. Furthermore, he argues that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hughes, James | title = [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postulated implementations==
Just as there are several overlapping or conflicting theories among conspiracists about the nature of the New World Order, so are there several beliefs about how its architects and planners will implement it:

===Gradualism===
Conspiracy theorists generally speculate that the New World Order is being implemented [[Gradualism#Politics and society|gradually]], citing the formation of the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913; the [[League of Nations]] in 1919; the [[International Monetary Fund]] in 1944; the [[United Nations]] in 1945; the [[World Bank]] in 1945; the [[World Health Organization]] in 1948; the [[European Union]] and the [[euro]] currency in 1993; the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1998; the [[African Union]] in 2002; and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008 as major milestones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

An increasingly popular conspiracy theory among American [[right-wing populism|right-wing populists]] is that the hypothetical [[North American Union]] and the [[amero]] currency, proposed by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and its counterparts in [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]], will be the next milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the [[federal government of the United States]] with a [[transnationality|transnational]] government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States are in the process of being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland 2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Holland, Joshua | title = Debunking the North American Union Conspiracy Theory | date = June 15, 2007 | url = http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/54184/ | accessdate = 2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that the North American Union exists only as a proposal contained in one of a thousand academic and/or policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic and political problems. Most of these get passed around in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices. Some of these papers, however, become touchstones for the conspiracy-minded and form the basis of all kinds of unfounded [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] fears especially during times of economic anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland 2007&quot;/&gt;

For example, in March 2009, as a result of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Russian Federation]] pressed for urgent consideration of a new international [[reserve currency]] and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] proposed greatly expanding the [[International Monetary Fund|I.M.F.]]'s [[special drawing rights]]. Conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a [[world currency#Single world currency|single global currency]] for a New World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/41919847.html?page=1&amp;c=y|title=Bachmann: No foreign currency|date=March 26, 2009|publisher=''Star Tribune''|accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/2009/03/25/from-drudge-to-fox/ The Right-Wing Echo Chamber In Action: How A Conspiracy Travels From Drudge To Obama, Via Fox News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging that both national governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual [[nation-state]]s to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that [[regionalism (international relations)|regionalism]] will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: [[Western Europe]] around [[Brussels]], the [[Western Hemisphere]] around [[Washington, D.C.]], [[East Asia]] around [[Beijing]], and [[Eastern Europe]] around [[Moscow]]. As such, the E.U., the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], and the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether [[global governance]] is gradually emerging, but rather how will these [[regional powers]] interact with one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partridge 2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Partridge, Mark C. | title = One World Government: Conspiracy Theory or Inevitable Future? | date = December 14, 2008 | url = http://www.diplomaticourier.org/kmitan/articleback.php?newsid=259 | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coup d'état===
American [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] conspiracy theorists, especially those who joined the [[militia movement]] in the United States, speculate that the New World Order will be implemented through a dramatic [[coup d'état]] by a &quot;[[Secret Team|secret team]]&quot;, using [[black helicopter]]s, in the U.S. and other nation-states to bring about a [[totalitarian]] world government controlled by the [[United Nations]] and enforced by troops of foreign [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations|U.N. peacekeepers]]. Following the [[Rex 84]] and [[Operation Garden Plot]] plans, this military coup would involve the suspension of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], the imposition of [[martial law]], and the appointment of [[military dictatorship|military commanders to head state and local governments]] and to detain [[dissident]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levitas 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Levitas, Daniel | title = The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | date = January 20, 2004 | isbn = 0-312-32041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conspiracy theorists, who are all strong believers in a [[right to keep and bear arms]], are extremely fearful that the passing of any [[gun control]] legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the [[refugee camp]]s of emergency management agencies such as [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|F.E.M.A.]] will be used for the [[internment]] of suspected [[subversives]], making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anti-Defamation League&quot;/&gt;

Before year 2000 some [[survivalist]]s wrongly believed this process would be set in motion by the predicted [[Y2K problem]] causing [[societal collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/09/98/conspiracy_-_radio_5_live/185161.stm | title = Death to the New World Order | accessdate = 2006-06-24 | author = BBC News Special Report |date=1998-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the [[9/11 conspiracy theories|September 11 attacks were a false flag operation]] carried out by the [[United States intelligence community]], as part of a [[strategy of tension]] to justify [[political repression]] at home and  [[preemptive war]] abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic [[terrorist incident]] will be responsible for triggering [[Executive Directive 51]] in order to complete the transition to a [[police state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.slate.com/id/2176185/pagenum/all/#p2 | title = Who Will Rule Us After the Next 9/11? | accessdate = 2009-04-04 | author = Ron Rosenbaum | date = 2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that unfounded fears about an imminent or eventual gun ban, military coup, internment, or U.N. invasion and occupation are rooted in the [[siege mentality]] of the American militia movement but also an [[apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism]] which provides a basic narrative within the political right in the U.S., claiming that the idealized society (i.e., constitutional republic, [[Jeffersonian democracy]], &quot;[[Christian nation]]&quot;, &quot;[[white nationalism|white nation]]&quot;) is thwarted by subversive conspiracies of [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[secular humanism|secular humanists]] who want &quot;[[Big Government]]&quot; and globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;

===Mass surveillance===
Conspiracy theorists concerned with [[surveillance abuse]] believe that the New World Order is being implemented by the [[cult of intelligence]] at the core of the [[surveillance-industrial complex]] through [[mass surveillance]] and the use of [[Social Security number]]s, the [[barcode|bar-coding]] of retail goods with [[Universal Product Code]] markings, and, most recently, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID tagging]] via [[microchip implant (human)|microchip implants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:IAO-logo.png|thumb|200px|right|Original seal of the now defunct DARPA [[Information Awareness Office]].]]

Claiming that corporations and government are planning to track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]''-like [[surveillance state]], consumer privacy advocates, such as [[Katherine Albrecht]] and [[Liz McIntyre (writer)|Liz McIntyre]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Albrecht &amp; McIntyre 2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Katherine Albrecht|Albrecht, Katherine]]; [[Liz McIntyre (writer)|McIntyre, Liz]] | title = The Spychips Threat: Why Christians Should Resist RFID and Electronic Surveillance | publisher = Nelson Current | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-59555-021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe [[spychip]]s must be resisted because they argue that modern [[database]] and [[information and communication technologies|communications technologies]], coupled with [[point of sale]] [[automatic identification and data capture|data-capture]] equipment and sophisticated ID and [[authentication]] systems, now make it possible to require a [[biometrics|biometrically]] associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the [[Number of the Beast]] prophesied in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

In January 2002, the [[Information Awareness Office]] (IAO) was established by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) to bring together several DARPA projects focused on applying information technology to counter [[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric threats]] to [[national security]]. Following public criticism that the development and deployment of these technologies could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system, the IAO was defunded by the United States Congress in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;eff-tia-funding&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php | title= Total/Terrorism Information Awareness (TIA): Is It Truly Dead? | year = 2003 | work = Electronic Frontier Foundation (official website)| accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second source of controversy involved IAO’s original logo, which depicted the &quot;all-seeing&quot; [[Eye of Providence]] atop of a pyramid looking down over the globe, accompanied by the Latin phrase ''[[scientia potentia est|scientia est potentia]]'' (knowledge is power).

American historian [[Richard Landes]], who specializes in the history of [[apocalypticism]] and was co-founder and director of the [[Center for Millennial Studies]] at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger [[alarmism]] among [[millenarianism|millenarian]]s and even the introduction of [[printing press|Gutenberg's printing press]] in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The [[Year 2000 problem]], bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered [[end time|end-time]] warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Baard, Mark | title = RFID: Sign of the (End) Times? | work = Wired.com | url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,70308-0.html | accessdate=2006-12-18 | date=2006-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance and the rise of the surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of [[privacy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLU 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Stanley, Jay | title = The Surveillance-Industrial Complex: How the American Government is Enlisting Private Parties in the Construction of a Surveillance Society |date = June 2004| url = http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/surveillance_report.pdf | accessdate = 2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] or religious hysteria about the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

===Occultism===
Conspiracy theorists of the [[Christian right]], starting with British revisionist historian [[Nesta Helen Webster]], believe there is an ancient [[occult]] conspiracy — started by the first [[mystagogue]]s of [[Gnosticism]] and perpetuated by their alleged [[esotericism|esoteric]] successors, such as the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]], [[Cathars]], [[Knights Templar]], [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]], [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]], [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], and, ultimately, the [[Illuminati]] — which seeks to subvert the [[Judeo-Christian]] foundations of the [[Western world]] and implement the New World Order through a one-world religion that prepares the masses to embrace the [[imperial cult]] of the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; More broadly, they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a New World Order are directed by occult agencies of some sort: [[Rite of Strict Observance|unknown superiors]], [[Spiritual Hierarchy|spiritual hierarchies]], [[demon]]s, [[fallen angel]]s and/or [[Lucifer#Occult beliefs|Lucifer]]. They believe that these conspirators use the power of [[occult science]]s ([[numerology]]), symbols ([[Eye of Providence]]), rituals ([[Master Mason|Masonic degrees]]), monuments ([[National Mall#Landmarks, museums and other features|National Mall landmarks]]), buildings ([[Manitoba Legislative Building]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Albo 2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Albo | first = Frank | title = The Hermetic Code | publisher = Winnipeg Free Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-9682575-3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and facilities ([[Denver International Airport]]) to advance their plot to rule the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

For example, in June 1979, an unknown benefactor under the pseudonym &quot;[[Christian Rosenkreuz|R. C. Christian]]&quot; had a huge granite [[megalith]] built in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which acts like a compass, calendar, and clock. A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the occult structure in many languages to serve as instructions for survivors of a [[doomsday event]] to establish a more enlightened and sustainable civilization than the one which was destroyed. The &quot;[[Georgia Guidestones]]&quot; have subsequently become a spiritual and political [[Rorschach test]] onto which any number of ideas can be imposed. Some New Agers and [[neo-pagan]]s revere it as a [[ley line|ley-line]] power nexus while a few conspiracy theorists are convinced that they are engraved with the New World Order's anti-Christian &quot;[[Ten Commandments]].&quot; Should the Guidestones survive for centuries as their creators intended, many more meanings could arise, equally unrelated to the designer’s original intention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laycock 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = Laycock, Joseph | title = 10 Commandments of the Anti-Christ: Mysterious &quot;Guidestones&quot; Madden Conspiracy Theorists and Christian Fundamentalists | year = 2009 | url = http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/141107 | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that the [[demonization]] of [[Western esotericism]] by conspiracy theorists is rooted in [[religious intolerance]] but also in the same [[moral panic]]s that have fueled [[witch trials in the Early Modern period]], and [[satanic ritual abuse]] allegations in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

===Population control===
Conspiracy theorists believe that the New World Order will also be implemented through the use of [[human population control]] in order to more easily monitor and control the movement of individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt; The means range from stopping the growth of human societies through [[reproductive health]] and [[family planning]] programs, which promote [[abstinence]], [[contraception]] and [[abortion]], or intentionally reducing the bulk of the [[world population]] through [[genocides]] by mongering unnecessary wars, through [[plague (disease)|plagues]] by engineering [[emergent virus]]es and tainting [[vaccine]]s, and through [[environmental disasters]] by [[weather control|controlling the weather]] ([[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program|HAARP]], [[chemtrail conspiracy theory|chemtrails]]), etc. Conspiracy theorists argue that globalists plotting on behalf of a New World Order are [[Neo-Malthusianism|neo-Malthusians]] who engage in [[overpopulation]] and [[climate change]] alarmism in order to create public support for coercive population control and ultimately world government.

Skeptics argue that fears of population control can be traced back to the traumatic legacy of the [[eugenics]] movement's &quot;war against the weak&quot; in the United States during the first decades of the 20th century but also the [[Second Red Scare]] in the U.S. during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, when activists on the [[far right]] of American politics routinely opposed [[public health]] programs, notably [[water fluoridation]], mass [[vaccination]] and [[mental health]] services, by asserting they were all part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henig&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Henig | first = Robin Marantz | title = The People's Health | publisher = Joseph Henry Press| year = 1997 | isbn = 0-309-05492-3 | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], particularly the [[United Nations]] and its programs; the introduction of social [[welfare]] provisions, particularly the various programs established by the [[New Deal]]; and government efforts to reduce inequalities in the [[social class in the United States|social structure of the U.S.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rovere&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rovere | first = Richard H. | title = Senator Joe McCarthy | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1959 | pages = 21–22| isbn = 0-520-20472-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind control===
Social critics accuse governments, corporations, and the [[mass media]] of being involved in the [[propaganda model|manufacturing of a national consensus]] and, paradoxically, a [[culture of fear]] due to the potential for increased [[social control]] that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of [[mind control]]—a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control of his or her own thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from [[The Manchurian Candidate|Manchurian candidate]]-style [[brainwashing]] of [[sleeper agent]]s ([[Project MKULTRA]], &quot;[[Project Monarch]]&quot;) to engineering [[psychological operations]] ([[water fluoridation]], [[subliminal message|subliminal advertising]], &quot;[[microwave auditory effect|Silent Sound Spread Spectrum]]&quot;, [[MEDUSA (weapon)|MEDUSA]]) and [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] operations ([[Stargate Project]]) to influence the masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrington 1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = Harrington, Evan | title = Conspiracy Theories and Paranoia: Notes from a Mind-Control Conference | year = 1996 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/9609/conspiracy.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080317115600/http://csicop.org/si/9609/conspiracy.html | archivedate = 2008-03-17 | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of wearing a [[tin foil hat]] for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for [[paranoia]] and is associated with conspiracy theorists.

Skeptics argue that the paranoia behind a conspiracy theorist's obsession with [[mind control]], [[population control]], [[occultism]], [[surveillance abuse]], [[Big Business]], [[Big Government]], and [[globalization]] arises from a combination of two factors, when he or she: 1) holds strong [[individualist]] values and 2) lacks [[power (philosophy)|power]]. The first attribute refers to people who care deeply about an individual's right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system (like the government), but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one's own life, and one gets what some psychologists call &quot;[[agency (philosophy)|agency]] panic,&quot; intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators. When fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence, they experience a crisis and assume that larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shrira 2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| name = Shrira, Ilan |title = Paranoia, 9/11, and the roots of conspiracy theories | year = 2008 | url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-narcissus-in-all-us/200809/paranoia-911-and-the-roots-conspiracy-theories | accessdate = 2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cornell University Press | isbn = 0-8014-8606-8 | last = Melley | first = Timothy | title = Empire of Conspiracy: The Culture of Paranoia in Postwar America | date = 1999-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged conspirators==
According to Domhoff, many people seem to believe that the United States is [[cryptocracy|ruled from behind the scenes]] by a [[cabal|conspiratorial elite]] with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the government system or put the country under the control of a [[world government]]. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be [[crypto-communism|crypto-communists]] who were intent upon bringing the [[United States]] under a common world government with the [[Soviet Union]], but the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution of the U.S.S.R.]] in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the [[United Nations]] as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American [[The Establishment|Establishment]] to give it anything but a limited role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domhoff 2005&quot;/&gt;

Although skeptical of New World Order conspiracism, political scientist [[David Rothkopf]] argues, in the 2008 book ''[[Superclass (book)|Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making]]'', that the world population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the [[great power]]s provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]) and entrepreneurs ([[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]], [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]]). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication—rules; the [[nation-state]]'s power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority [[power broker (term)|power broker]] status; leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Rothkopf, David J. | title = Superclass: the global power elite and the world they are making | publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-374-27210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing the history of the world as the history of warfare between [[secret society|secret societies]], conspiracy theorists go further than Rothkopf, and other scholars who have studied the global [[power elite]], by claiming that established upper-class families with &quot;[[old money]]&quot; who founded and finance the [[Bilderberg Group]], [[Bohemian Club]], [[Club of Rome]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Rhodes House#The Rhodes Trust|Rhodes Trust]], [[Skull and Bones]], [[Trilateral Commission]], and similar think tanks and private clubs, are [[Illuminati|illuminated]] conspirators plotting to impose a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] New World Order — the implementation of an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] world government controlled by the United Nations and a [[Bank for International Settlements|global central bank]], which maintains political power through the [[finance capitalism|financialization of the economy]], regulation and restriction of [[freedom of speech|speech]] through the [[concentration of media ownership]], [[mass surveillance]], widespread use of [[state terrorism]], and an all-encompassing [[propaganda]] that creates a [[cult of personality]] around a puppet world leader and [[ideology|ideologizes]] world government as the [[Philosophy of history#Social evolutionism|culmination of history's progress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

[[Marxism|Marxists]], who are skeptical of [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] conspiracy theories, also accuse the global power elite of not having the best interests of all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a [[democratic deficit]], but they argue that the superclass are [[plutocracy|plutocrats]] only interested in brazenly imposing a [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] or [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] new world order — the implementation of [[global capitalism]] through [[hard power|economic and military coercion]] to protect the interests of [[transnational corporation]]s — which systematically undermines the possibility of a [[international socialism|socialist]] one-world government.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLSweb.org 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Party for Socialism and Liberation]] | title = Daniel Estulin and the phony 'Bilderberg conspiracy' | date = 1 September 2010 | url = http://www.pslweb.org/site/News2/2021559999?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=14431&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1261 | accessdate = 7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that the world is in the middle of a transition from the [[American imperialism|American Empire]] to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their [[anti-communism]], fail to see is that what they demonize as the &quot;New World Order&quot; is, ironically, the highest stage of the very [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system they defend.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLSweb.org 2010&quot;/&gt; 

American intellectual [[Noam Chomsky]], author of the 1994 book ''[[World Orders Old and New]]'', often describes the [[new world order (politics)|new world order]] as a post-Cold-War era in which &quot;the [[New World]] gives the orders&quot;. Commenting on the [[Kosovo War|1999 US-NATO bombing of Serbia]], he writes:

{{quotation|The aim of these assaults is to establish the role of the major imperialist powers—above all, the United States—as the unchallengeable arbiters of world affairs. The &quot;New World Order&quot; is precisely this: an international regime of unrelenting pressure and intimidation by the most powerful capitalist states against the weakest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomsky 1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Chomsky | first = Noam | authorlink = Noam Chomsky |title =  US-NATO bombs fall on Serbia: the &quot;New World Order&quot; takes shape | year = 1999 | url = http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/mar1999/nato-m25.shtml | accessdate = 2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms==
Skeptics of New World Order conspiracy theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the [[furtive fallacy]], a belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; [[conspiracism]], a world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and [[fusion paranoia]], a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;

Domhoff, a research professor in psychology and sociology who studies theories of [[power (philosophy)|power]], writes in a March 2005 essay entitled ''There Are No Conspiracies'':

{{quotation|There are several problems with a conspiratorial view that don't fit with what we know about power structures. First, it assumes that a small handful of wealthy and highly educated people somehow develop an extreme psychological desire for power that leads them to do things that don't fit with the roles they seem to have. For example, that rich capitalists are no longer out to make a profit, but to create a one-world government. Or that elected officials are trying to get the constitution suspended so they can assume dictatorial powers. These kinds of claims go back many decades now, and it is always said that it is really going to happen this time, but it never does. Since these claims have proved wrong dozens of times by now, it makes more sense to assume that leaders act for their usual reasons, such as profit-seeking motives and institutionalized roles as elected officials. Of course they want to make as much money as they can, and be elected by huge margins every time, and that can lead them to do many unsavory things, but nothing in the ballpark of creating a one-world government or suspending the constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domhoff 2005&quot;/&gt;}}

Partridge, a contributing editor to the global affairs magazine ''Diplomatic Courier'', writes in a December 2008 article entitled ''One World Government: Conspiracy Theory or Inevitable Future?'':

{{quotation|I am skeptical that “global governance” could “come much sooner than that [200 years],” as [journalist Gideon Rachman] posits. For one thing, nationalism—the natural counterpoint to global government—is rising. Some leaders and peoples around the world have resented Washington’s chiding and hubris over the past two decade of American unipolarity. Russia has been re-establishing itself as a “great power”; few could miss the national pride on display when China hosted the Beijing Olympics this summer; while Hugo Chavez and his ilk have stoked the national flames with their anti-American rhetoric. The departing of the Bush Administration could cause this nationalism to abate, but economic uncertainty usually has the opposite effect. [...] Another point is that attempts at global government and global agreements have been categorical failures. The WTO’s Doha Round is dead in the water, Kyoto excluded many of the leading polluters and a conference to establish a deal was a failure, and there is a race to the bottom in terms of corporate taxes—rather than an existing global framework. And, where supranational governance structures exist, they are noted for their bureaucracy and inefficiency: The UN has been unable to stop an American-led invasion of Iraq, genocide in Darfur, the slow collapse of Zimbabwe, or Iran’s continued uranium enrichment. That is not to belittle the structure, as I deem it essential, but the system’s flaws are there for all to see.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partridge 2008&quot;/&gt;}}

Although some cultural critics see [[conspiracy theory#Types|superconspiracy theories]] about a New World Order as &quot;[[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[metanarrative]]s&quot; that may be politically empowering, a way of giving ordinary people a narrative structure with which to question what they see around them,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyson and Kahn 2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Lewis, Tyson; Kahn, Richard | title = The Reptoid Hypothesis: Utopian and Dystopian Representational Motifs in David Icke's Alien Conspiracy Theory | year = 2005 | url = http://richardkahn.org/writings/culturalstudies/reptoidhypothesis.pdf | accessdate = 2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; skeptics argue that conspiracism leads people into cynicism, convoluted thinking, and a tendency to feel it is hopeless even as they denounce the alleged conspirators.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist 2 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Berlet, Chip | title = Interview: G.

The activities of conspiracy theorists (talk radio shows, books, websites, documentary videos, conferences, etc.) unwittingly draw enormous amounts of energy and effort away from serious criticism and activism directed to real and ongoing [[state crime|crimes of state]], and their institutional background. That is why conspiracy-focused movements ([[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|JFK]], [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO]], [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 Truth]]) are treated far more tolerantly by centers of power than is the norm for serious critical and activist work of truly [[Progressivism in the United States#Contemporary progressivism|left-wing progressives]] who are marginalized from mainstream public discourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;

[[Marxism|Marxists]], such as the members of the U.S. [[Party for Socialism and Liberation]], reject conspiracy theories in general and New World Order conspiracism in particular because it produces [[false consciousness]] and [[cult]]ism.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLSweb.org 2010&quot;/&gt; They argue:

{{quotation|Conspiracy “theories” lack any true analysis of the systemic class forces at work that oppress billions of people each day. They do not point to imperialism and capitalism as the main problems, instead ascribing society's ills to a few leaders from imperialist countries that are somehow above the class systems under which we live. Such “theories” are not only false, anti-Marxist and truly reductive of history—they are dangerous diversions that keep people from aiming their anger and hatred toward the system that actually causes oppression throughout the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLSweb.org 2010&quot;/&gt;}}

Marxists conclude that the real solution is something [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] conspiracy theorists would never advocate or contemplate: [[democratic socialism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PLSweb.org 2010&quot;/&gt;

Concerned that the [[improvisational millennialism]] of most conspiracy theories about a New World Order might motivate [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolves]] to engage in [[leaderless resistance]] leading to [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|domestic terrorist incidents]] like the [[Oklahoma City bombing]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Boyer, Paul S. | title = The Strange World of Conspiracy Theories | date = July 27, 2004 | url = http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3075 | accessdate = 2009-10-01 | authorlink = Paul S. Boyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun writes:

{{quotation|The danger lies less in such beliefs themselves ... than in the behavior they might stimulate or justify. As long as the New World Order appeared to be almost but not quite a reality, devotees of conspiracy theories could be expected to confine their activities to propagandizing. On the other hand, should they believe that the prophesied evil day had in fact arrived, their behavior would become far more difficult to predict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;}}

Warning of the threat to American democracy posed by [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] movements led by [[demagogy|demagogues]] who mobilize support for [[ochlocracy|mob rule]] or even a [[fascism|fascist]] revolution by exploiting the fear of conspiracies, Berlet writes:

{{quotation|Right-wing populist movements can cause serious damage to a society because they often popularize xenophobia, authoritarianism, scapegoating, and conspiracism. This can lure mainstream politicians to adopt these themes to attract voters, legitimize acts of discrimination (or even violence), and open the door for revolutionary right-wing populist movements, such as fascism, to recruit from the reformist populist movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;}}

Hughes, a professor of religion, warns that no religious idea has greater potential for shaping global politics in profoundly negative ways than &quot;the new world order&quot;. He writes in a February 2011 article entitled ''Revelation, Revolutions, and the Tyrannical New World Order'':

{{quotation|The crucial piece of this puzzle is the identity of the Antichrist, the tyrannical figure who both leads and inspires the new world order. [...] for many years, rapture theologians identified the Soviet Union as the Antichrist. But after Sept. 11, they became quite certain that the Antichrist was closely connected with the Arab world and the Muslim religion. This means, quite simply, that for rapture theologians, Islam stands at the heart of the tyrannical &quot;new world order.&quot; Precisely here we discover why the idea of a &quot;new world order&quot; has such potential to move global politics in profoundly negative directions, for rapture theologians typically welcome war with the Islamic world. As Bill Moyers wrote of the rapture theologians, &quot;A war with Islam in the Middle East is not something to be feared but welcomed -- an essential conflagration on the road to redemption.&quot; Further, rapture theologians co-opt the United States as a tool in their cosmic vision -- a tool God will use to smite the Antichrist and the enemies of righteousness. This is why Tim LaHaye, co-author of the best-selling series of end-times books, could lend such strong support to the American invasion and occupation of Iraq. By virtue of that war, LaHaye believed, Iraq would become &quot;a focal point of end-times events.&quot; Even more disturbing is the fact that rapture theologians blissfully open the door to nuclear holocaust. Rapture theologians have always held that God will destroy his enemies at the end of time in the Great Battle of Armageddon. But since World War II, they have increasingly identified Armageddon with nuclear weaponry, thereby lending biblical inevitability to the prospects of nuclear annihilation. As one prophecy writer put it, &quot;The holocaust of atomic war would fulfill the prophecies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2011&quot;/&gt;}}

Criticisms of New World Order conspiracy theorists also come from within their own community. Despite believing themselves to be &quot;[[freedom fighter]]s&quot;, many right-wing populist conspiracy theorists hold views that are incompatible with their professed [[libertarianism]], such as [[dominionism]], [[white supremacy|white supremacism]], and even [[eliminationism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlet 1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland 2009&quot;/&gt; This paradox has led [[David Icke|Icke]], who argues that [[Christian Patriot movement|Christian Patriots]] are the only Americans who understand the truth about the New World Order (which he believes is controlled by a race of [[reptilians]] known as the &quot;Babylonian Brotherhood&quot;), to reportedly tell a Christian Patriot group:

{{quotation|I don't know which I dislike more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the one you want to replace it with.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;/&gt;}}
