Detroit and the surrounding region constitute a major center of commerce and global trade. The Detroit area emerged as a metropolitan region with construction of an extensive [[Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit|freeway system]] in the 1950s and 1960s which has expanded in ensuing decades. Freeways and [[Transportation in metropolitan Detroit|transit systems]] have facilitated movement throughout the region with millions of people taking up residence in the suburbs. Between 2000 and 2010, the city's population fell by 25%, from the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#2000|nation's 10th largest city]] to 18th.&lt;ref name=Wisely/&gt; Commensurate with the shift of population and jobs to its suburbs, the city has had to adjust its role within the larger metropolitan area. [[Downtown Detroit]] has seen an increased role as an entertainment hub in the 21st century with the opening of three casino resort hotels, new stadiums, and a revitalized riverfront. The metropolitan region currently holds roughly one-half of the state's population.&lt;ref name=CensusCity/&gt;&lt;ref name=CensusMSA/&gt;

{{Main|History of Detroit}}
The city's name originates from the [[Detroit River]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|le détroit du Lac Érié}}, meaning ''the strait of Lake Erie''), linking [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]]; in the historical context, the strait included [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] and the [[St. Clair River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RivièreduDétroit&quot;&gt;{{cite web

There, in 1701, the French officer [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac|Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac]], along with fifty-one additional [[French-Canadians]], founded a settlement called [[Fort Detroit|Fort Ponchartrain du ''Détroit'']], naming it after the [[comte de Pontchartrain]], Minister of Marine under [[Louis XIV]]. France offered free land in order to attract families to Detroit, which grew to 800 people in 1765, the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm French Ontario in the 17th and 18th centuries – Detroit].

Anne de Détroit]], founded in 1701, is the second oldest continuously operating [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit|Roman Catholic]] parish in the United States. The present church was completed in 1887.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt;]]
François Marie Picoté, sieur de Belestre ([[Montreal]] 1719–1793) was the last French military commander at Fort Detroit (1758–1760), surrendering the fort on November 29, 1760 to the British. The region's fur trade was an important economic activity. Detroit's city flag reflects this French heritage. (See [[Flag of Detroit, Michigan]]).&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt;

During the French and Indian War (1760), [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops gained control and shortened the name to ''Detroit''. Several tribes led by [[Chief Pontiac]], an [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] leader, launched [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] (1763), including a [[siege of Fort Detroit]]. Partially in response to this, the British [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] included restrictions on white settlement in unceded Indian territories. Detroit passed to the United States under the [[Jay Treaty]] (1796). In 1805, fire destroyed most of the settlement. A river warehouse and brick chimneys of the wooden homes were the sole structures to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ste-anne.org/dempsey.html Ste. Anne of Detroit] ''St. Anne Church''. Retrieved on April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital of Michigan. As the city expanded, the street layout plan developed by [[Augustus B. Woodward]], Chief Justice of the [[Michigan Territory]] was followed. Detroit fell to British troops during the [[War of 1812]] in the [[Siege of Detroit]], was recaptured by the United States in 1813 and incorporated as a city in 1815.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt;

Prior to the [[American Civil War]], the city's access to the Canadian border made it a key stop along the [[underground railroad]].&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt;
Then a Lieutenant, the future president [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was stationed in the city. His dwelling is still at the [[Michigan State Fairgrounds]]. Because of this local sentiment, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War, including the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment (part of the legendary [[Iron Brigade]]) which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at Gettysburg in 1863. At the arrival of the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment in Washington, Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying &quot;Thank God for Michigan!&quot; Following the death of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Armstrong Custer]] delivered a eulogy to the thousands gathered near [[Campus Martius Park]]. Custer led the [[Michigan Brigade]] during the American Civil War and called them the ''Wolverines''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosentreter, Roger (July/August 1998). &quot;Come on you Wolverines, Michigan at Gettysburg.&quot; ''[[Michigan History magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many of the city's [[Gilded Age]] mansions and buildings arose. Detroit was referred to as the ''Paris of the West'' for its architecture, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by [[Thomas Edison]].&lt;ref name=Woodford&gt;Woodford, Arthur M. (2001). ''This is Detroit: 1701–2001''. Wayne State University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Strategically located along the [[Great Lakes]] waterway, Detroit emerged as a transportation hub. The city had grown steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. In 1896, a thriving carriage trade prompted [[Henry Ford]] to build his first automobile in a rented workshop on Mack Avenue.  During this period, Detroit expanded its borders annexing all or part of several surrounding villages and townships.

[[File:Fordpiquetteplant.jpg|thumb|left|[[Piquette Plant|Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]] (1904), a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Michigan|National Historic Landmark]].]]
In 1903 Ford founded the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Ford's manufacturing—and those of automotive pioneers [[William C. Durant]], the [[Dodge]] brothers, [[Packard]], and [[Walter Chrysler]]—reinforced Detroit's status as the world's automotive capital; it also served to encourage truck manufacturers such as Rapid and [[GMC (automobile)|Grabowsky]].&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt;

With the introduction of [[Prohibition]], smugglers used the river as a major conduit for Canadian spirits, organized in large part by the notorious [[The Purple Gang|Purple Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Jenny (June 15, 1999).[http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=181 How Prohibition made Detroit a bootlegger's dream town].

With the factories came high-profile labor unions in the 1930s such as the [[United Auto Workers]] which initiated disputes with manufacturers. The labor activism during those years increased influence of union leaders in the city such as [[Jimmy Hoffa]] of the Teamsters and [[Walter Reuther]] of the autoworkers.
The 1940s saw the construction of the world's first urban freeway system below ground level, [[M-8 (Michigan highway)|the Davison]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys01-09.html#M-008 Michigan Highways].

Retrieved on November 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[USS Detroit|six ships]] of the [[United States Navy]] named after the city, including [[USS Detroit (LCS-7)|USS ''Detroit'' (LCS-7)]].

Industry spurred growth during the first half of the 20th century as the city drew tens of thousands of new residents, particularly workers from the Southern United States, to become the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade|United States' fourth largest]]. At the same time, tens of thousands of European immigrants located in the city. Social tensions rose with the rapid pace of growth. The ''color blind'' promotion policies of the auto plants resulted in racial tension that erupted into [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|a full-scale riot in 1943]].&lt;ref&gt;Baulch, Vivian M. and Patricia Zacharias (February 11, 1999).

Consolidation during the 1950s, especially in the automobile sector, streamlined the supply chain. An extensive freeway system constructed in the 1950s and 1960s had facilitated [[commuting]].  In 1940, the city held about one-third of the state's population, while the metropolitan region currently holds roughly one-half.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; Commensurate with the shift of population and jobs to its suburbs, the city's tax base eroded.
[[File:Broadway Avenue Historic District 2.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway Avenue Historic District (Detroit, Michigan)|Broadway Avenue Historic District]] built in the 1890s adjoins the [[Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District]] which dates from the 1840s.]]
During the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, Detroit witnessed social unrest, culminating in the [[12th Street Riot|Twelfth Street riot]] in July 1967. The gasoline crises of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] impacted the U.S. auto industry as small cars from foreign makers made inroads.

''Renaissance'' has been a common theme among city leaders, reinforced by the construction of the [[Renaissance Center]] in the late 1970s. This complex of skyscrapers, designed as a ''city within a city,'' together with other developments, slowed and eventually began to reverse the trend of businesses leaving [[Downtown Detroit]] by the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt;&lt;ref name=partnership/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

In 1980, Detroit hosted the [[Republican National Convention]] which nominated [[Ronald Reagan]] to a successful bid for President of the United States.  During the 1980s, vacant structures were demolished to make way for new development and revitalization.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt;

In the 1990s, the city began to receive a revival with much of it centered in the [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]], [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]], and [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] areas.  [[One Detroit Center]] (1993) arose on the city skyline. In the ensuing years, three casinos opened: [[MGM Grand Detroit]], [[MotorCity Casino Hotel|Motor City Casino]], and [[Greektown Casino Hotel|Greektown Casino]] which debuted as resort hotels in 2007–08. New downtown stadiums were constructed for the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Detroit Lions]] in 2000 and 2002, respectively; this put the Lions' home stadium in the city proper for the first time since 1974. The city also saw the historic [[Book Cadillac Hotel]] and the [[Fort Shelby Hotel]] reopen for the first time in over 20 years.&lt;ref name=partnership/&gt; The city hosted the 2005 [[MLB All-Star Game]], 2006 [[Super Bowl XL]], [[2006 World Series]], [[WrestleMania 23]] in 2007, and the [[NCAA]] Final Four in April 2009 all of which prompted many improvements to the downtown area. In 2011, [[Detroit Medical Center]] and [[Henry Ford Health System]] substantially increased investments in medical research facilities and hospitals in the city's [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]] and [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt;

The city's [[Detroit International Riverfront|riverfront]] is the focus of much development following the example of [[Windsor, Ontario]] which began its waterfront parkland conversion in the 1990s. In 2001, the first portion (stretching from Joe Louis Arena through Hart Plaza) of the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]] was completed as a part of the city's 300th anniversary celebration. In succeeding years, the waterfront gained miles of parks and fountains. In 2011, the Port Authority Passenger Terminal opened with the river walk connecting Hart Plaza to the Renaissance Center. This development is a mainstay in the city's plan to enhance its economy through tourism.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey, Ruby L.(August 22, 2007). The D is a draw: Most suburbanites are repeat visitors.''Detroit Free Press''. New Detroit Free Press-Local 4 poll conducted by Selzer and Co., finds, &quot;nearly two-thirds of residents of suburban Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties say they at least occasionally dine, attend cultural events or take in professional games in Detroit.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Along the river, developers are constructing upscale condominiums such as [[Watermark Detroit]]. Some city limit signs, particularly on the Dearborn border say &quot;Welcome to Detroit, The Renaissance City Founded 1701.&quot;&lt;ref name=Almanac2/&gt;&lt;ref name=partnership/&gt;

=== Topography ===

[[File:Large Detroit Landsat.jpg|thumb|A simulated-color [[satellite]] image of the Detroit metro area, including Windsor across the river, taken on [[NASA]]'s [[Landsat 7]] satellite]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|143.0|sqmi|km2}}; of this, {{convert|138.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|4.2|sqmi|km2}} is water. Detroit is the principal city in [[Metro Detroit]] and [[Southeast Michigan]] situated in the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]].

The highest elevation in the city is in the [[University District, Detroit|University District]] neighborhood in northwestern Detroit, west of Palmer Park, sitting at a height of {{convert|670|ft|m}}. Detroit's lowest elevation is along its riverfront, sitting at a height of {{convert|579|ft|m}}. On its northeast border are the communities of [[Grosse Pointe]].
[[File:James Scott Fountain - Detroit skyline.jpg|thumb|left || A view of the city from [[Belle Isle Park]]]]
The [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]] is the only international [[wildlife preserve]] in North America, uniquely located in the heart of a major metropolitan area. The Refuge includes islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along {{convert|48|mi|km|0}} of the [[Detroit River]] and [[Western Lake Erie]] shoreline. [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile]] is the largest island in the Detroit River and the most populated island in Michigan. [[Belle Isle Park]] is a {{convert|982|acre|sqmi ha|adj=on}} island park in the [[Detroit River]], between the Detroit and [[Windsor, Ontario]]. It is connected to the mainland by the [[MacArthur Bridge (Detroit)|MacArthur Bridge]] in Detroit. Belle Isle Park contains many sites of interest including the [[James Scott Memorial Fountain]], the [[Belle Isle Park|Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory]], the [[Detroit Yacht Club]] on an adjacent island, a half-mile (800 m) beach, a golf course, a nature center, monuments, and gardens. The city skyline may be viewed from the island.

Three road systems cross the city: the original French template, radial avenues from a Washington, D.C.-inspired system, and true [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|north–south roads]] from the [[Northwest Ordinance]] township system. The city is north of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Detroit is the only major city along the U.S.–Canadian border in which one travels south in order to cross into Canada.

Detroit has four border crossings: the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]] provide motor vehicle thoroughfares, with the [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]] providing railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border crossing is the [[Detroit–Windsor Truck Ferry]], located near the Windsor Salt Mine and [[Zug Island]]. Near Zug Island, the southwest part of the city sits atop a {{convert|1500|acre|ha|sing=on}} salt mine that is {{convert|1100|ft|m|-1}} below the surface. The Detroit Salt Company mine has over {{convert|100|mi|km|}} of roads within.&lt;ref&gt;Zacharias, Patricia (January 23, 2000).

Seen in panorama, Detroit's waterfront shows a variety of architectural styles. The [[Post-modern architecture|post modern]] neogothic spires of the [[One Detroit Center]] (1993) were designed to blend with the city’s [[Art Deco]] skyscrapers. Together with the [[Renaissance Center]], they form a distinctive and recognizable skyline. Examples of the [[Art Deco]] style include the [[Guardian Building]] and [[Penobscot Building]] downtown, as well as the [[Fisher Building]] and [[Cadillac Place]] in the [[New Center]] area near [[Wayne State University]]. Among the city's prominent structures are United States' largest [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]], the [[Detroit Opera House]], and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].&lt;ref name=AIADetroit&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hill, Eric J. and John Gallagher | title= AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture| year=2002 | publisher=Wayne State University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DetArch&gt;{{Cite book | author=[[Robert Sharoff|Sharoff, Robert]] | title=American City: Detroit Architecture| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=2005| isbn=0-8143-3270-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Downtown Detroit|downtown]] and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings, the majority of the surrounding city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Outside of the city's core, residential high-rises are found in neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront extending toward [[Grosse Pointe]] and the [[Palmer Park Apartment Building Historic District|Palmer Park]] neighborhood just west of Woodward. The University Commons-Palmer Park district in northwest Detroit is near the [[University of Detroit Mercy]] and [[Marygrove College]] which anchors historic neighborhoods including [[Palmer Woods Historic District|Palmer Woods]], [[Sherwood Forest Historic District|Sherwood Forest]], and the [[University District, Detroit|University District]].

The [[List of Registered Historic Places in Detroit, Michigan|National Register of Historic Places]] lists several area neighborhoods and districts. Neighborhoods constructed prior to World War II feature the architecture of the times, with wood-frame and brick houses in the working-class neighborhoods, larger brick homes in middle-class neighborhoods, and ornate mansions in upper-class neighborhoods such as [[Brush Park Historic District|Brush Park]], [[Woodbridge Historic District|Woodbridge]], [[Indian Village Historic District (Detroit, Michigan)|Indian Village]], [[Palmer Woods Historic District|Palmer Woods]], [[Boston-Edison Historic District|Boston-Edison]], and others.

The second phase is a two mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) extension from Hart Plaza to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] for a total of five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) of parkway from bridge to bridge. Civic planners envision that the riverfront properties condemned under [[eminent domain]], with their pedestrian parks, will spur more residential development.

In the 1940s, [[Detroit blues]] artist [[John Lee Hooker]] became a long-term resident in the city's southwest Delray neighborhood. Hooker, among other important [[blues]] musicians migrated from his home in [[Mississippi]] bringing the [[Delta Blues]] to northern cities like Detroit. Hooker recorded for [[Fortune Records]], the biggest pre-Motown blues/soul label. During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing in the [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Woodford/&gt; Prominent emerging [[Jazz]] musicians of the 1960s included: trumpet player [[Donald Byrd]] who attended Cass Tech and performed with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers early in his career and Saxophonist [[Pepper Adams]] who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied Byrd on several albums.

Other, prominent Motor City R&amp;B stars in the 1950s and early 1960s was [[Nolan Strong]], [[Andre Williams]] and [[Nathaniel Mayer]] – who all scored local and national hits on the Fortune Records label. According to Smokey Robinson, Strong was a primary influence on his voice as a teenager. The Fortune label was a family-operated label located on Third Avenue in Detroit, and was owned by the husband and wife team of Jack Brown and Devora Brown. Fortune, which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs and 45s, laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit's most legendary record label.&lt;ref name=Carson&gt;{{Cite book |first= David A. |last= Carson |title= Noise, and Revolution: The Birth of Detroit Rock 'n' Roll |publisher= University of Michigan Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-472-11503-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists were backed by the [[Funk Brothers]], the Motown house band that was featured in Paul Justman's 2002 documentary film [[Standing in the Shadows of Motown]], based on Allan Slutsky's book of the same name. [[The Motown Sound]] played an important role in the crossover appeal with popular music, since it was the first African American owned record label to primarily feature African-American artists. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit. [[Aretha Franklin]], another Detroit R&amp;B star, carried the Motown Sound; however, she did not record with Berry's Motown Label.&lt;ref name=Almanac2/&gt;

The city government is run by a mayor and nine-member city council and clerk elected on an at-large nonpartisan ballot. Since voters approved the city's charter in 1974, Detroit has had a &quot;[[Mayor-council government|strong mayoral]]&quot; system, with the mayor approving departmental appointments. The council approves budgets but the mayor is not obligated to adhere to any earmarking. City ordinances and substantially large contracts must be approved by the council. The city clerk supervises elections and is formally charged with the maintenance of municipal records. Municipal elections for mayor, city council and city clerk are held at four-year intervals, in the year after presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, George E. (July 1993).

==== Freeways ====
{{Main|Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit}}

Metro Detroit has an extensive toll-free network of [[freeway]]s administered by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]]. Four major [[Interstate Highway]]s surround the city. Detroit is connected via [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate&amp;nbsp;75]] (I-75) and [[Interstate 96|I-96]] to [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Kings Highway 401]] and to major [[Southern Ontario]] cities such as [[London, Ontario]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. I-75 (Chrysler and Fisher freeways) is the region's main north–south route, serving [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Detroit–Toledo and Seaway Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantor&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last= Cantor |first= George |title= Detroit: An Insiders Guide to Michigan |year= 2005 |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-03092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] (Edsel Ford Freeway) runs east–west through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor to the west (where it continues to Chicago) and Port Huron to the northeast. The stretch of the current I-94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of America's earlier limited-access highways. [[Henry Ford]] built it to link the factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. A portion was known as the Willow Run Expressway. I-96 runs northwest–southeast through Livingston, Oakland and Wayne counties and (as the Jeffries Freeway through Wayne County) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantor&quot;/&gt;

[[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] runs north–south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and [[Interstate 696|I-696]] in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit. [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] is a short spur route in downtown Detroit, an extension of the Chrysler Freeway. I-696 (Reuther Freeway) runs east–west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit. Michigan state highways designated with the letter M serve to connect major freeways.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantor&quot;/&gt;
