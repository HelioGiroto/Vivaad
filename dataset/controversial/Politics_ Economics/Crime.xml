{{Criminal law}}
{{CriminTheo}}

'''Crime''' is the breaking of rules or [[law]]s for which some [[government|governing authority]] (via mechanisms such as [[legal system]]s) can ultimately prescribe a [[conviction]]. Crimes may also result in [[Police caution|cautions]], [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] or be [[unenforced]]. Individual human societies may each define crime and crimes differently, in different localities (state, local, international), at different time stages of the so-called &quot;crime&quot;, from planning, disclosure, supposedly intended, supposedly prepared, incomplete, complete or future proclaimed after the &quot;crime&quot;.{{cn|date=May 2012}}

While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime; for example: [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]] and of other [[Private law|civil law]] may rank as &quot;[[Offence (law)|offence]]s&quot; or as &quot;[[infraction]]s&quot;. Modern societies generally regard crimes as offences against the public or the state, as distinguished from ''[[tort]]s'' (wrongs against private parties that can give rise to a civil cause of action).

'''Crime''' in the social and legal framework is the set of facts or assumptions (causes, consequences and objectives) that are part of a case in which they were committed acts punishable under criminal law, and the application of which depends on the agent of a sentence or security measure criminal. Usually includes a felony violation of a criminal rule or act against law, in particular at the expense of people or moral. A crime may be illegal (as is the cause of evil or injury) or perfectly legal (when the act done is not a necessary consequence of the conduct of the agent but determined by others). '''Illegal and punishable crime''' is the violation of any rule of administrative, fiscal or criminal liability on the part of agents of the state or practice of any wrongdoing and notoriously harmful to self or against third parties, provided for in criminal law, since they practiced with guilt (the first act that causes injury criminal actions or omissions to produce adequate evidence also illegal). '''Legal and not punishable crime''' are all acts in self-defense or otherwise determined by the illegal or criminal conduct of others that happened in the first place (or omission adequate to protect the staff member who is a victim of illegal crime).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.scribd.com/doc/51664315/O-Diagrama-do-Conhecimento-inclui-a-Piramide-Forense O Diagrama do Conhecimento, da Partição Económica e da História]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.scribd.com/doc/98081841/A-Revolucao-das-Letras-Definicoes-certas-de-Direito A Revolução das Letras]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
When informal relationships and sanctions prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired [[social order]], a [[government]] or a [[state (polity)|state]] may impose more formalized or stricter systems of [[social control]]. With institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the [[State (polity)|State]] can compel [[populations]] to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform. HARMAN SADHRA

Authorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviors in general. Governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices that legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or [[crime prevention|preventing crime]]. In addition, authorities provide [[Legal remedy|remedies]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], and collectively these constitute a [[criminal justice]] system. Legal sanctions vary widely in their severity, they may include (for example) incarceration of temporary character aimed at reforming the convict. Some jurisdictions have penal codes written to inflict permanent harsh punishments: legal [[mutilation]], [[capital punishment]] or [[life without parole]].

Usually a [[natural person]] perpetrates a crime, but [[legal person]]s may also commit crimes. Conversely, at least under U.S. Law, nonpersons such as animals cannot commit crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Frazier'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/173CA4t613.htm 173 Cal. App. 4th 613] (2009). In this case, the California Court of Appeal explained: &quot;Despite the physical ability to commit vicious and violent acts, dogs do not possess the legal ability to commit crimes. Ayush Jain, Ayush Mall, Devang, Janil, Vidit, Madhav all are Criminals and kidnapped Harry Potter and caught Dumbledore hooking up with Voldemort. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologist [[Richard Quinney]] has written about the relationship between society and crime. When Quinney states &quot;crime is a social phenomenon&quot; he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how populations perceive it, based on societal norms.&lt;ref&gt;Quinney, Richard, &quot;Structural Characteristics, Population Areas, and Crime Rates in the United States,&quot; ''The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and Police Science'', 57(1), p. 45-52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''crime'' is derived from the [[latin]] root ''cernō'', meaning &quot;I decide, I give judgment&quot;. Originally the Latin word ''crīmen'' meant &quot;[[criminal charge|charge]]&quot; or &quot;cry of distress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Klein, [http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Etymological-Dictionary-English-Language/dp/0444409300 A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek]] word ''krima'' (κρίμα), from which the Latin cognate derives, typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, rather than a private or moral wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Bakaoukas, Michael. &quot;The conceptualisation of 'Crime' in Classical Greek Antiquity: From the ancient Greek 'crime' (krima) as an intellectual error to the christian 'crime' (crimen) as a moral sin.&quot; ERCES ( European and International research group on crime, Social Philosophy and Ethics). 2005. [http://www.erces.com/journal/articles/archives/volume2/v02/v02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 13th century [[English language|English]] ''crime'' meant &quot;sinfulness&quot;, according to [[etymonline.com]]. The glossing was probably brought to England as Old French ''crimne'' (12th century form of [[Modern French]] ''crime''), from Latin ''crimen'' (in the genitive case: ''criminis''). In Latin, ''crimen'' could have signified any one of the following: &quot;[[Criminal charge|charge]], [[indictment]], [[Criminal accusation|accusation]]; crime, [[fault (legal)|fault]], [[offence (law)|offense]]&quot;.

The word may derive from the Latin ''cernere'' - &quot;to decide, to sift&quot; (see [[crisis]], mapped on [[Kairos]] and [[Kronos]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2012}}). But [[Ernest Klein]] (citing [[Karl Brugmann]]) rejects this and suggests *cri-men, which originally would have meant &quot;cry of distress&quot;. Thomas G. Tucker suggests a root in &quot;[[cry]]&quot; words and refers to English [[plaint]], [[plaintiff]], and so on. The meaning &quot;offense punishable by law&quot; dates from the late 14th century. The Latin word is [[gloss]]ed in Old English by ''facen'', also &quot;deceit, fraud, treachery, [cf. fake]. ''Crime wave'' first attested in 1893 in [[American English]].

==Definition==
===England and Wales===
Whether a given act or omission constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission. It depends on the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it.&lt;ref&gt;Seaman v Burley [1896] 2 QB, per Lord Esher MR at 346&lt;/ref&gt; An act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by what are called [[criminal proceedings]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], Learning the Law, Eleventh Edition, Stevens, 1982, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History'''

The following definition of &quot;crime&quot; was provided by the [[Prevention of Crimes Act 1871]], and applied&lt;ref&gt;The [[Prevention of Crime Act 1908]], section 10(6) and Schedule&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of section 10 of the [[Prevention of Crime Act 1908]]:

{{Blockquote|The expression &quot;crime&quot; means, in [[England]] and [[Ireland]], any [[felony]] or the offence of [[uttering]] false or counterfeit coin, or of possessing counterfeit gold or silver coin, or the offence of obtaining goods or money by [[false pretences]], or the offence of [[conspiracy to defraud]], or any [[misdemeanour]] under the fifty-eighth section of the [[Larceny Act 1861|Larceny Act, 1861]].}}

===Scotland===
For the purpose of section 243 of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], a crime means an [[offence (law)|offence]] punishable on [[indictment]], or an offence punishable on [[summary conviction]], and for the commission of which the offender is liable under the [[statute]] making the offence punishable to be imprisoned either absolutely or at the discretion of the court as an alternative for some other punishment.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/243 section 243(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
A [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[definition]] views crime as [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] that violates prevailing [[norm (sociology)|norms]]{{spaced ndash}}[[culture|cultural]] standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economics|economic]] conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, [[Police|law-enforcement]], and penal responses made by society.

These [[structuralism|structural]] realities remain fluid and often contentious. For example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may [[criminalisation|criminalise]] or [[decriminalisation|decriminalise]] certain behaviours, which directly affects the [[statistics|statistical]] [[crime rate]]s, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of [[laws]], and (re-)influence the general [[public opinion]].

Similarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given &quot;crime problem&quot;. All such adjustments to [[crime statistics]], allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the State should use law or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to enforce or encourage any particular [[social norm]]. Behaviour can be controlled and influenced{{By whom|date=April 2010}} in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.

Indeed, in those cases where no clear [[consensus]] exists on a given norm, the drafting of [[criminal law]] by the group in [[power (sociology)|power]] to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group's [[Political freedom|freedom]], and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in general — whether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.

===Other definitions===
[[Legislature]]s can pass laws (called ''[[mala prohibita]]'') that define crimes against social norms. These laws vary from time to time and from place to place: note variations in [[gambling]] laws, for example, and the prohibition or encouragement of [[duelling]] in history. Other crimes, called ''[[mala in se]]'', count as outlawed in almost all societies, ([[murder]], [[theft]] and [[rape]], for example).

[[English criminal law]] and the related criminal law of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years, without any actual legislation: [[common law offences]]. The courts used the concept of ''[[malum in se]]'' to develop various common law offences.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Law Dictionary, John A. Yogis, Q.C., Barrons: 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminalization==
{{Main| Criminalization}}

One can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a pre-emptive, harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm. The State becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual [[liberty]], for example, to minimize harm to others).

Criminalization may provide future harm-reduction at least to the outside population, assuming those shamed or incarcerated or otherwise restrained for committing crimes start out more prone to criminal behaviour. Likewise, one might assume{{Or|date=July 2009}} that criminalize acts that in themselves do not harm other people (&quot;[[victimless crime]]s&quot;) may prevent subsequent harmful acts (assuming that people &quot;prone&quot; to commit these acts may tend to commit harmful actions in general). Some{{Who|date=July 2009}} see the criminalization of &quot;victimless crimes&quot; as a pretext for imposing personal, religious or moral convictions on otherwise productive citizens or taxpayers.

Some commentators{{Who|date=May 2009}} may{{Or|date=June 2009}} see criminalization as a way to make potential criminals [[payment|pay]] or suffer for their prospective crimes. In this case, criminalization becomes a way to set the price that one must pay to society for certain actions considered detrimental to society as a whole. An extreme view might see criminalization as State-sanctioned [[revenge]].

States control the process of criminalization because:

* Even if [[victimology|victim]]s recognize their own role as victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered: the enforcers formally appointed by the State often have better access to expertise and resources.
* The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrence]].&lt;ref&gt;See Polinsky &amp; Shavell (1997) on the fundamental divergence between the private and the social motivation for using the legal system.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fear]] of [[retaliate|retaliation]] may deter victims or witnesses of crimes from taking any action. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit from reporting incidents or from co-operating in a [[Trial (law)|trial]].
* Victims, on their own, may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system, let alone to collect any fines levied by a court.&lt;ref&gt;See Polinsky (1980) on the enforcement of fines&lt;/ref&gt; Garoupa &amp; Klerman (2002) warn that a [[rent-seeking]] government has as its primary motivation to maximize revenue and so, if offenders have sufficient wealth, a rent-seeking government will act more aggressively than a [[social welfare function|social-welfare]]-maximizing government in enforcing laws against minor crimes (usually with a fixed penalty such as parking and routine traffic violations), but more laxly in enforcing laws against major crimes.
* As a result of the crime, victims may die or become incapacitated.

==Labelling theory==

See [[Labeling theory#The &quot;criminal&quot;|The &quot;criminal&quot;]]

The [[Labeling theory|label]] of &quot;crime&quot; and the accompanying [[social stigma]] normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the State, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. Those who apply the labels of &quot;crime&quot; or &quot;criminal&quot; intend to assert the [[hegemony]] of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the State (in the event that [[due process|standard processing]] [[trial (law)|tries]] and [[conviction (law)|convicts]] an accused person of a crime).

==Natural-law theory==
Justifying the State's use of [[coercion|force]] to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of [[natural law]]. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of [[morality]] or constructs them. [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote in the 13th century: &quot;the rule and measure of human acts is the [[reason]], which is the first principle of human acts&quot; (Aquinas, ST I-II, Q.90, A.I). He regarded people as by nature [[rationality|rational]] beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. In the 1760s [[William Blackstone]] (1979: 41) described the thesis:

:&quot;This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.&quot;

But [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]] (1790–1859), an early [[Legal positivism|positivist]], applied [[utilitarianism]] in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. He denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. Thus in Austinian terms a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility, but every individual remains free to choose what to do. Similarly, [[H.L.A. Hart|Hart]] (1961) saw the law as an aspect of [[sovereignty]], with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.

Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal [[logic]] and [[consistency]], and that the state's agents used state power with [[Social responsibility|responsibility]]. [[Ronald Dworkin]] (2005) rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of [[deference]] (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.

Indeed, despite everything, the majority{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} of natural-law theorists have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law. This view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as morally just. Thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.{{Clarify|date=December 2009|reason=see talk page 'Natural-law theory P5'}}

One can solve this problem by granting some degree of [[moral relativism]] and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. People may find such law acceptable, but the use of State power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks moral justification. More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of [[individual rights]].

Since society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term &quot;[[right]]&quot;) rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made). [[Adam Smith]] illustrates this view, saying that a [[smuggling|smuggler]] would be an excellent citizen, &quot;...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so.&quot;

Natural-law theory therefore distinguishes between &quot;criminality&quot; (which derives from human nature) and &quot;illegality&quot; (which originates with the interests of those in [[power (sociology)|power]]). Lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases ''[[malum in se]]'' and ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' respectively. They regard a &quot;crime ''malum in se''&quot; as inherently criminal; whereas a &quot;crime ''malum prohibitum''&quot; (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.

This view leads to a seeming [[paradox]]: one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. Many [[the Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers (such as Adam Smith and the American [[Founding Fathers]]) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called [[Liberalism#Classical_and_modern|classical liberals]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

==History==
Some religious communities regard [[sin]] as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of origins — note the tale of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theory of [[original sin]]. What one group considers a crime may cause or ignite [[war]] or conflict. However, the earliest known [[civilization]]s had codes of [[law]], containing both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and penal rules mixed together, though not always in recorded form.

The [[Sumer]]ians produced the earliest surviving written codes.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urukagina]] (reigned c .2380 BC–2360 BC, [[short chronology]]) had an early code that has not survived; a later king, [[Ur-Nammu]], left the earliest extant written law-system, the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] (c .2100-2050 BC), which prescribed a formal system of penalties for specific cases in 57 articles. The Sumerians later issued other codes, including the &quot;code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]]&quot;. This code, from the 20th century BCE, contains some fifty articles, and scholars have reconstructed it by comparing several sources. {{quote|The Sumerian was deeply conscious of his personal rights and resented any encroachment on them, whether by his King, his superior, or his equal. No wonder that the Sumerians were the first to compile laws and law codes.| Kramer&lt;ref&gt;
Kramer (1971: 4)
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Successive legal codes in [[Babylon]], including the [[code of Hammurabi]] (c. 1790 BC), reflected [[Mesopotamian]] society's belief that law derived from the will of the [[gods]] (see [[Babylonian law]]).&lt;ref&gt;
Driver and Mills (1952-55) and Skaist (1994)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Many states at this time functioned as [[theocracy|theocracies]], with codes of conduct largely religious in origin or reference.

[[Sir Henry Maine]] (1861) studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the &quot;modern&quot; sense of the word. While modern systems distinguish between offences against the &quot;State&quot; or &quot;Community&quot;, and offences against the &quot;Individual&quot;, the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with &quot;crimes&quot; (Latin: ''crimina''), but with &quot;wrongs&quot; (Latin: ''delicta''). Thus the Hellenic laws&lt;ref&gt;Gagarin: 1986; and Garner: 1987&lt;/ref&gt; treated all forms of [[theft]], [[assault]], [[rape]], and murder as private wrongs, and left action for enforcement up to the victims or their survivors. The earliest systems seem to have lacked formal courts.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] systematized law and applied their system across the [[Roman Empire]]. Again, the initial rules of [[Roman Law]] regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation. The most significant Roman Law concept involved ''dominion''.&lt;ref&gt;Daube: 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[pater familias]]'' owned all the family and its property (including slaves); the ''pater'' enforced matters involving interference with any property. The ''Commentaries'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (written between 130 and 180 AD) on the [[Twelve Tables]] treated ''furtum'' (in modern parlance: &quot;theft&quot;) as a [[tort]].

Similarly, assault and violent [[robbery]] involved [[trespass]] as to the ''pater's'' property (so, for example, the rape of a slave could become the subject of compensation to the ''pater'' as having trespassed on his &quot;property&quot;), and breach of such laws created a ''vinculum juris'' (an obligation of law) that only the payment of monetary compensation (modern &quot;[[damages]]&quot;) could discharge. Similarly, the consolidated [[Germanic law|Teutonic laws]] of the [[Germanic tribes]],&lt;ref&gt;Guterman: 1990&lt;/ref&gt; included a complex system of monetary compensations for what courts would {{As of| 2008 | alt = now}} consider the complete{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down.

Even though Rome abandoned its [[Roman Britain|Britannic provinces]] around 400 AD, the Germanic mercenaries{{spaced ndash}}who had largely become instrumental in enforcing Roman rule in Britannia{{spaced ndash}}acquired ownership of land there and continued to use a mixture of Roman and Teutonic Law, with much written down under the early [[Anglo-Saxon Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough: 1963&lt;/ref&gt; But only when a more centralized English monarchy emerged following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], and when the kings of England attempted to assert power over the land and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the &quot;individual&quot;, but also as a wrong against the &quot;State&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Kern: 1948; Blythe: 1992; and Pennington: 1993
&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea came from [[common law]], and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the &quot;State&quot; had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or ''privilegium'' against the perpetrator. All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a [[King]] wanted to raise money by selling a new form of [[writ]]). The development of the idea that the &quot;State&quot; dispenses [[justice]] in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of [[sovereignty]].

In continental Europe, Roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;Vinogradoff (1909); Tierney: 1964, 1979
&lt;/ref&gt;
Coupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller feudal units, various legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman [[jurisprudence]], but modified to meet the prevailing [[political climate]].

In Scandinavia the effect of Roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the ''[[thing (assembly)|thing]]s'' — the assemblies of the people. The people decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). This system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most esteemed men of the parish as his board, fulfilling the function of &quot;the people&quot; of yore.

From the [[Hellenic world|Hellenic]] system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of [[feud]]ing between [[clan]]s and [[family|families]].&lt;ref&gt;
The concept of the ''pater familias'' acted as a unifying factor in extended kin-groups, and the later practice of ''[[wergild]]'' functioned in this context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
If compensation could mollify families' feelings, this would help to keep the peace. On the other hand, the institution of oaths also played down the threat of [[endemic warfare|feudal warfare]]. Both in archaic Greece and in [[Middle Age|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male relatives to swear him unguilty. (Compare the [[United Nations Security Council]], in which the [[veto]] power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.)

These means of restraining private [[feuds]] did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfillment of justice. But in the earliest times the &quot;state&quot; did not always provide an independent policing force. Thus criminal law grew out what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.

The development of [[sociology|sociological]] thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of [[criminology]] as a study of crime in society. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted a link between crime and [[creativity]]{{spaced ndash}}in ''[[Birth of Tragedy|The Birth of Tragedy]]'' he asserted&lt;!-- in what context? --&gt;: &quot;The best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime&quot;. In the 20th century [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' made a study of [[criminalization]] as a coercive method of state control.

==Classification and categorisation==
{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}

===Categorisation by type===
The following classes of offences are used, or have been used, as legal terms of art:
*[[Offence against the person]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;For example, by the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Violent offence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;For example, by section 31(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]], and by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sexual offence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;
*[[Offence against property]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Researchers and commentators have classified crimes into the following categories, in addition to those above:

*Forgery, personation and cheating&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;
*Firearms and offensive weapons&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offences against the State/Offences against the Crown and Government&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;/Political offences&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;E.g. Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
*Harmful or dangerous drugs&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offences against [[religion]] and public worship&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offences against public justice&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 28&lt;/ref&gt;/Offences against the administration of public justice&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;
*[[Public order offence]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 29&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Commerce]], [[financial market]]s and [[insolvency]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 30&lt;/ref&gt;
*Offences against [[public morals]] and [[public policy]]&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 31&lt;/ref&gt;
*Motor vehicle offences&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 32&lt;/ref&gt;
*Conspiracy, incitement and attempt to commit crime&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Inchoate offence]]
*[[Juvenile Delinquency]]

===Categorisation by penalty===
One can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] [[tariff]]s prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence. Thus [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) [[capital punishment]] reserved for the most serious.

===Common law===
Under the common law of [[England]], crimes were classified as either [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[misdemeanour]], with treason sometimes being included with the felonies. This system was based on the perceived seriousness of the offence. It is still used in the [[United States]] but the distinction between felony and misdemeanour is abolished in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

===Classification by mode of trial===
The following classes of offence are based on [[mode of trial]]:
* [[Indictable-only offence]]
* [[Indictable offence]]
* [[Hybrid offence]], aka either-way offence in England and Wales
* [[Summary offence]], aka [[infraction]] in the US

===Classification by origin===
In common law countries, crimes may be categorised into [[common law offences]] and [[statutory]] offences. In the US, Australia and Canada (in particular), they are divided into [[federal crime]]s and under state crimes.

===Other classifications===
*[[Arrestable offence]]

===U.S. classification===
In the [[United States]] since 1930, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has tabulated [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) annually from crime data submitted by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies across the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm FBI: Uniform Crime Reports]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Officials compile this data at the city, county, and [[U.S. state|state]] levels into the UCR. They classify violations of laws based on [[common law]] as Part I (index) crimes in UCR data. These are further categorised as violent or property crimes. Part I violent crimes include murder and criminal homicide (voluntary manslaughter), forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery; while Part I property crimes include burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft. All other crimes count come under Part II.

For convenience, such lists usually include [[infraction]]s although, in the U.S., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]]. Compare [[tort]]feasance.

Booking-[[arrest]]s require detention for a time-frame ranging 1 to 24 hours.

==Causes and correlates of crime==
{{main|Causes and correlates of crime}}
Many different [[causes and correlates of crime]] have been proposed with varying degree of empirical support. They include socioeconomic, psychological, biological, and behavioral factors. Controversial topics include [[media violence research]] and effects of [[gun politics]].

==Crimes in international law==
{{Main|International criminal law}}
Crimes defined by [[treaty]] as crimes against international law include:
* [[Crime against peace|Crimes against peace]]
* [[Crime of apartheid|Crimes of apartheid]]
* [[Forced disappearance]]
* [[Genocide]]
* [[Piracy]]
* [[Sexual slavery]]
* [[Slavery]]
* Waging a [[war of aggression]]
* [[War crime]]s

From the point of view of State-centric law, extraordinary procedures (usually [[international court]]s) may prosecute such crimes. Note the role of the [[International Criminal Court]] at [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]].

Popular opinion in the [[Western world|Western]] World and [[Former Soviet Union]] often{{When|date=March 2009}} associates international law with the concept of opposing terrorism{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} — seen as a crime as distinct from warfare.

==Religion and crime==
[[Image:Hep-hep riots.jpg|thumb|280px|Religion|[[Religious]] sentiment often becomes a contributory factor of crime. 1819 anti-Jewish riots in Frankfurt where rioters attacked Jewish businesses and destroyed property]]

Different religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the perceived interests of a state. Socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience. Activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for example) [[alcohol]]-consumption ([[prohibition]]), [[abortion]] and [[stem cell|stem-cell]] research. In various historical and present-day societies, institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice that punish crimes against the divine will and against specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as Roman Catholic [[canon law]].

==Military jurisdictions and states of emergency==
In the [[military]] sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as [[mutiny]] or [[desertion]]) under [[martial law|martial-law]] codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.

Many constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a [[state of emergency]] in the event of war, natural disaster or civil unrest. Undesired activities at such times may include [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]] in the streets, violation of [[curfew]], or [[Gun possession|possession of firearms]].

==Employee crime==
{{Main| Occupational crime}}
Two common types of [[employee]] crime exist: [[embezzlement]] and [[sabotage]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their operations. The victims of the most costly [[scam]]s include banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies, and other large financial institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computing1&quot;&gt;
Sara Baase, &quot;A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and The Internet. Third Ed. 'Employee Crime'&quot; (2008)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people guilty of embezzlement do not have [[criminal history|criminal histories]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Embezzlers tend to have a gripe against their [[employer]], have financial problems, or simply an inability to resist the temptation of a loophole they have found.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Screening and [[background checks]] on perspective employees can help in prevention; however, many laws make some types of screening difficult or even illegal. Fired or disgruntled employees sometimes sabotage their company's computer system as a form of &quot;[[revenge|pay back]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computing1&quot;/&gt; This sabotage may take the form of a [[logic bomb]], a [[computer virus]], or creating general havoc.

Some [[employer|places of employment]] have developed measures in an attempt to combat and prevent employee crime. Places of employment sometimes implement security measures such as cameras, fingerprint records of employees, and background checks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Although privacy-advocates have questioned such methods, they appear to serve the interests of the organisations using them. Not only do these methods help prevent employee crime, but they protect the company from punishment and/or lawsuits for negligent hiring.&lt;ref name=negligenthiring&gt;
