Tibet emerged in the 7th century as a [[Tibetan Empire|unified empire]], but it soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet were often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in [[Lhasa]], [[Shigatse]], or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. The eastern regions of [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of [[Sichuan]] and [[Qinghai]]. Following [[Xinhai revolution|the collapse]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet. The region declared its [[:wikisource:Proclamation of Independence of Tibet|independence]] in 1913. The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following a [[Battle of Chamdo|military conflict]], Tibet was incorporated into the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the previous Tibetan government was abolished in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7299221.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Q&amp;A: China and Tibet | date=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the PRC governs western and central Tibet as the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] while eastern areas are mostly within [[Sichuan]] and [[Qinghai]] provinces. There are [[Tibetan independence movement|tensions regarding Tibet's political status]]&lt;ref name=&quot;lee&quot;&gt;{{cite web

But local Tibetans had not organized themselves. 'They are very angry at the Chinese government and the Chinese people,' Robin said. 'But they have no idea what to do. There is no leader. When a leader appears and somebody helps out they will all join.' We ... heard tale after tale of civil disobedience in outlying hamlets. In one village, Tibetans burned their Chinese flags and hoisted the banned Tibetan Snow Lion flag instead. Authorities ... detained nine villagers ...

The economy of Tibet is dominated by [[subsistence agriculture]], though tourism has become a growing industry in Tibet in recent decades.
The dominant religion in Tibet is [[Tibetan Buddhism]], in addition there is [[Bön]] which was the indigenous religion of Tibet before the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th century CE (Bön is now similar to Tibetan Buddhism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/a-z-religion-index/bon.htm |title=Bön |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;) though there are also [[Tibetan Muslims|Muslim]] and Christian minorities. Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the [[Tibetan art|art]], [[Tibetan Music|music]], and [[Tibetan festivals|festivals]] of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] and [[Architecture of India|Indian]] influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted [[barley]], [[yak]] meat, and [[butter tea]].

== Names ==
{{Main|Definitions of Tibet}}

The [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] name for their land,  ''Bod'' {{Bo-textonly|བོད་}}, means &quot;Tibet&quot; or &quot;[[Tibetan Plateau]]&quot;, although it originally meant the central region around [[Lhasa]], now known in Tibetan as [[Ü (region)|Ü]]. The [[Standard Tibetan]] pronunciation of ''Bod'', {{IPA-bo|pʰøʔ˨˧˨|}}, is transcribed ''Bhö'' in [[Tournadre Phonetic Transcription]], ''Bö'' in the [[THL Phonetic Transcription|THDL system]], and ''Poi'' in [[Tibetan Pinyin]]. Some scholars believe the first written reference to ''Bod'' &quot;Tibet&quot; was the ancient ''Bautai'' people recorded in the Egyptian Greek works ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (A.D. 1st cent.) and ''[[Geographia]]'' ([[Ptolemy]], A.D. 2nd cent.),&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (1987), pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; itself from the [[Sanskrit]] form ''Bhauṭṭa'' of the Indian geographical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne de la Vaissière, &quot;The Triple System of Orography in Ptolemy's Xinjiang&quot;, ''Exegisti Monumenta: Festschrif in Honour of Nicholas Sims-Williams'', eds. Werner Sundermann, Almut Hintze &amp; François de Blois (Wiesbaden, Germany: Harrassowitz, 2009), 532.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] [[exonym]] for &quot;Tibet&quot; is ''Zàngqū'' ([[Wikt:藏区|藏区]]), which derives by [[metonymy]] from the [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] region around [[Shigatse]], plus a prefix meaning &quot;western&quot;. Tibetan people, language, and culture regardless of where they are from are referred to as ''Zàng'' ([[Wikt:藏|藏]]), although the geographical term ''Xīzàng'' is often limited to the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The term ''Xīzàng'' was coined during the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the reign of the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] (1796–1820).

The best-known medieval Chinese name for Tibet is [[Wikt:吐蕃|吐蕃]] (also [[Wikt:土蕃|土蕃]] or [[Wikt:土番|土番]]); in modern Mandarin, this is pronounced ''Tǔfān'' or ''Tǔbō''. Whether ''Tǔbō'' is a valid pronunciation is the subject of debate, enjoying strong support in [[Mainland China]], but with some experts arguing that it is promoted purely for political reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tubote&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lovetibet.ti-da.net/e3505684.html |title=Tubote, Tibet, and the Power of Naming |last1=Sperling |first1=Elliot |last2=謝 |first2=惟敏 |accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This name first appears [[Transliteration into Chinese characters|in Chinese characters]] as 土番 in the 7th-century ([[Li Tai]]) and as 吐蕃 in the 10th-century (''[[Book of Tang]]'' describing 608–609 emissaries from Tibetan King [[Namri Songtsen]] to [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]). In the [[Middle Chinese]] spoken during that period, as reconstructed by [[William H. Baxter]], 土番 was pronounced ''thu{{Smallcaps|x}}-phjon'' and 吐蕃 was pronounced ''thu{{Smallcaps|x}}-pjon'' (with the {{Smallcaps|x}} representing [[phonemic tone|tone]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Baxter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wbaxter/etymdict.html |title=An Etymological Dictionary of Common Chinese Characters |last1=Baxter |first1=William H. |date= 2001-03-30 |accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include 烏斯國 (''wūsīguó'', cf. Tibetan ''dbus'', [[Ü (region)|Ü]], {{IPA-bo|wyʔ˨˧˨|}}), 烏斯藏 (''wūsīzàng'', cf. Tibetan ''dbus-gtsang'', [[Ü-Tsang]]), 圖伯特 (''túbótè''), and 唐古忒 (''tánggǔtè'', cf. [[Tangut people|Tangut]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tubote&quot; /&gt; American Tibetologist [[Elliot Sperling]] has argued in favor of a recent tendency by some authors writing in Chinese to revive the term ''Túbótè'' ({{zh|s=图伯特|t=圖伯特}}) for modern use in place of ''Xīzàng'', on the grounds that ''Túbótè'' more clearly includes the entire Tibetan plateau rather than simply the Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tubote&quot; /&gt;''

The English word ''Tibet'' or ''Thibet'' dates back to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The word &quot;Tibet&quot; was used in the context of the first British mission to this country under George Bogle in 1774. See Clements R. Markham (ede.): ''Narratives of the Mission of George Bogle to Tibet and the Journey of Thomas Manning to Lhasa'', reprinted by Manjushri Publishing House, New Delhi, 1971 (first published in 1876)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] generally agree that &quot;Tibet&quot; names in European languages are [[loanwords]] from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] طيبة، توبات (''Ṭībat'' or ''Tūbātt''), itself deriving from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] ''Töbäd'' &quot;The Heights&quot; (plural of ''töbän'').&lt;ref&gt;Behr, Wolfgang, (1994). &quot;Stephan V. Beyer ''The Classical Tibetan Language'' (book review)&quot;, ''Oriens'' 34, [http://books.google.com/books?id=NHN6KTAVR28C&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=t%C3%B6p%C3%BCt&amp;lr=&amp;hl=tr&amp;sig=x1RLRVdRn9zBxkX84i5X45GZh84 pp. 558–559]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
{{Main|Standard Tibetan}}

Linguists generally classify the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] as a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language of the [[Sino-Tibetan language]] family although the boundaries between 'Tibetan' and certain other [[Himalaya]]n languages can be unclear. According to [[Matthew Kapstein]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the perspective of historical linguistics, Tibetan most closely resembles [[Burmese language|Burmese]] among the major languages of Asia. Grouping these two together with other apparently related languages spoken in the [[Himalaya]]n lands, as well as in the highlands of Southeast Asia and the Sino-Tibetan frontier regions, linguists have generally concluded that there exists a Tibeto-Burman family of languages. More controversial is the theory that the Tibeto-Burman family is itself part of a larger language family, called [[Sino-Tibetan language family|Sino-Tibetan]], and that through it Tibetan and Burmese are distant cousins of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The language has numerous regional dialects which are generally not mutually intelligible. It is employed throughout the Tibetan plateau and [[Bhutan]] and is also spoken in parts of [[Nepal]] and northern India, such as [[Sikkim]]. In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), [[Kham]], [[Amdo]] and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly [[Dzongkha]], [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]], [[Sherpa language|Sherpa]], and [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]], are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages are included in the calculation then 'greater Tibetan' is spoken by approximately 6 million people across the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have fled from modern-day Tibet to India and other countries.

Although spoken Tibetan varies according to the region, the written language, based on [[Classical Tibetan]], is consistent throughout. This is probably due to the long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire, whose rule embraced (and extended at times far beyond) the present Tibetan linguistic area, which runs from northern [[Pakistan]] in the west to [[Yunnan]] and [[Sichuan]] in the east, and from north of [[Qinghai Lake]] south as far as Bhutan. The Tibetan language has its [[Tibetan script|own script]] which it shares with [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] and [[Dzongkha language|Dzongkha]], and which is derived from the ancient Indian [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]] script.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tibetan Empire ===
{{main|Tibetan Empire}}
The history of a unified Tibet begins with the rule of [[Songtsän Gampo]] (604–650 CE) who united parts of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung River]] Valley and founded the [[Tibetan Empire]]. He also brought in many reforms and Tibetan power spread rapidly creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, [[Bhrikuti]], and that she played a great role in establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. In 640 he married [[Princess Wencheng]], the niece of the powerful Chinese emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang China|Taizong of Tang China]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). 'The First Tibetan Empire' in: ''China's Ancient Tea Horse Road''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next few Tibetan kings, Buddhism became established as the state religion and Tibetan power increased even further over large areas of Central Asia, while major inroads were made into Chinese territory, even reaching the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]]'s capital [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]) in late 763.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith 1987, pg. 146&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Tibetan occupation of Chang'an only lasted for fifteen days, after which they were defeated by Tang and its ally, the Turkic [[Uyghur Khaganate]].

The [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]] (in [[Yunnan]] and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Thomas A. (1978). &quot;Nanchao and Tibet in South-western China and Central Asia.&quot; ''The Tibet Journal''. Vol. 3, No. 4. Winter 1978, pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general [[Gao Xianzhi]], who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and [[Kashmir]]. By 750 the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the [[Tang dynasty|Chinese]]. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] and [[Karluks|Qarluqs]] at the [[Battle of Talas]] (751) and the subsequent [[civil war]] (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.
In 821/822 CE Tibet and China signed a peace treaty. A bilingual account of this treaty, including details of the borders between the two countries, is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the [[Jokhang]] temple in Lhasa.&lt;ref&gt;'A Corpus of Early Tibetan Inscriptions''. H. E. Richardson. Royal Asiatic Society (1985), pp. 106–43. ISBN 0-947593-00-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Tibet continued as a Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century, when a civil war over succession led to the collapse of imperial Tibet. The period that followed is known traditionally as the [[Era of Fragmentation]], when political control over Tibet became divided between regional warlords and tribes with no dominant centralized authority.

=== Yuan Dynasty ===
{{main|Mongol invasions of Tibet}}

The Mongolian [[Yuan Dynasty]], through the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, or [[Tibet under Yuan administrative rule|Xuanzheng Yuan]] ({{zh|c=宣政院}}), ruled Tibet through a top-level administrative department. One of the department's purposes was to select a [[dpon-chen]], usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing.&lt;ref name=&quot;China's Tibet Policy&quot;&gt;Dawa Norbu. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=kD8gTL6IIDYC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=Xuanzheng+Yuan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wMA6Te6OLcGBlAf4kOCFBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Xuanzheng%20Yuan&amp;f=false China's Tibet Policy]'', pp. 139. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sakya]] lama retained a degree of autonomy, acting as the political authority of the region, while the dpon-chen held administrative and military power. Mongol rule of Tibet remained separate from the main provinces of China, but the region existed under the administration of the Yuan Dynasty. If the Sakya lama ever came into conflict with the dpon-chen, the dpon-chen had the authority to send Chinese troops into the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;China's Tibet Policy&quot;/&gt;

Tibet retained nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative&lt;ref&gt;Wylie. p.104: 'To counterbalance the political power of the lama, Khubilai appointed civil administrators at the Sa-skya to supervise the mongol regency.'&lt;/ref&gt; rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a &quot;[[diarchy|diarchic]] structure&quot; under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols.&lt;ref name=&quot;China's Tibet Policy&quot;/&gt; Mongolian prince [[Khuden]] gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored [[Sakya Pandita]], whose seat became the capital of Tibet.

Yuan control over the region ended with the Ming overthrow of the Yuan and [[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]]'s revolt against the Mongols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rossabi194&quot;&gt;Rossabi 1983, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Following the uprising, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen founded the [[Phagmodrupa dynasty]], and sought to reduce Yuan influences over Tibetan culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Norbu, Dawa (2001) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phagmodrupa Dynasty and the Dalai Lamas ===
{{main|Phagmodrupa Dynasty}}

Between 1346 and 1354, [[Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen]] toppled the Sakya and founded the [[Phagmodrupa dynasty]].
The following 80 years saw the founding of the [[Gelug]] school (also known as Yellow Hats) by the disciples of [[Je Tsongkhapa]],
and the founding of the important [[Ganden monastery|Ganden]], [[Ganden monastery|Drepung]], and [[Sera Monastery|Sera]] monasteries near Lhasa.

In 1578, [[Altan Khan]] of the [[Tümed]] Mongols gave [[Sonam Gyatso]], a high lama of the Gelugpa school, the name ''Dalai Lama''; ''Dalai'' being the Mongolian translation of the Tibetan name Gyatso, or &quot;Ocean&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Europeans to arrive in Tibet were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] missionaries [[António de Andrade]] and Manuel Marques in 1624. They were welcomed by the King and Queen of [[Guge]], and were allowed to build a church and to introduce Christian belief. The king of Guge eagerly accepted Christianity as an offsetting religious influence to dilute the thriving [[Gelugpa]] and to counterbalance his potential rivals and consolidate his position. All missionaries were expelled in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Lettera del P. Antonio de Andrade. Giov de Oliveira.

=== Qing Dynasty ===
The [[Qing Dynasty]] put [[Amdo]] under their control in 1724, and incorporated eastern [[Kham]] into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang 162-6&quot;&gt;Wang Jiawei, &quot;The Historical Status of China's Tibet&quot;, 2000, pp. 162–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Qing government sent a resident commissioner, called an ''[[Amban]]'', to Lhasa. In 1750 the Ambans and majority of the [[Han Chinese]] and [[Manchus]] living in Lhasa were killed in [[Lhasa riot of 1750|a riot]], and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels, and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. The Qing now restored the Dalai Lama as ruler leading government called ''[[Kashag]]''&lt;ref&gt;Kychanov, E.I. and Melnichenko, B.I. Istoriya Tibeta s drevneishikh vremen do nashikh dnei [History of Tibet sine Ancient Times to Present]. Moscow: Russian Acad. Sci. Publ., p.89-92&lt;/ref&gt; but elevated the role of ''Amban'' to include more direct involvement in Tibetan internal affairs. At the same time the Qing took steps to counterbalance the power of the aristocracy by adding officials recruited from the clergy to key posts.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades, peace reigned in Tibet, but in 1792 the Qing emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet to push the invading Nepalese out. This prompted yet another Qing reorganization of the Tibetan government, this time through a written plan called the &quot;Twenty-Nine Regulations for Better Government in Tibet&quot;. Qing military garrisons staffed with Qing troops were now also established near the Nepalese border.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Tibet was dominated by the Manchus in various stages in the 18th century, and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the Qing imperial commissioners' authority; but there was no attempt to make Tibet a Chinese province.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834 the [[Sikh Empire]] invaded and annexed [[Ladakh]], a culturally Tibetan region that was an independent kingdom at the time.  Seven years later a Sikh army led by [[General Zorawar Singh]] invaded western Tibet from Ladakh, starting the [[Sino-Sikh War]].  A Qing-Tibetan army repelled the invaders but was in turn defeated when it chased the Sikhs into Ladakh.  The war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Chushul]] between the Chinese and Sikh empires.&lt;ref&gt;The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P. Rubin, The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 1. (Jan., 1960), pp. 96-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Qing Dynasty weakened, its authority over Tibet also gradually weakened; by the mid 19th century, its influence was minuscule. Qing authority over Tibet had become more symbolic than real in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1989, pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1997, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunnert, H.

This period also saw some contacts with [[Jesuits]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] from Europe, and in 1774 a Scottish nobleman, [[George Bogle (diplomat)|George Bogle]], came to [[Shigatse]] to investigate trade for the [[British East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Teltscher 2006, pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 19th century the situation of foreigners in Tibet grew more tenuous. The [[British Empire]] was encroaching from northern [[India]] into the [[Himalayas]], the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and the [[Russian Empire]] were expanding into Central Asia and each power became suspicious of the others' intentions in Tibet.

In 1904, a [[British expedition to Tibet]], spurred in part by a fear that [[Russia]] was extending its power into Tibet, invaded Tibet, hoping that negotiations with the [[13th Dalai Lama]] would be more effective than with Chinese representatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith154-6&quot;&gt;Smith 1996, pp. 154–6&lt;/ref&gt; When the mission reached Lhasa, Younghusband imposed a treaty which was subsequently repudiated, and was succeeded by a 1906 treaty&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Convention Between Great Britain and China|Convention Between Great Britain and China]]&lt;/ref&gt; signed between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and China.

In 1910, the Qing government sent a military expedition of its own under [[Zhao Erfeng]] to establish direct Chinese rule and deposed the Dalai Lama in an imperial edict, who fled to British India. [[Zhao Erfeng]] defeated the Tibetan military conclusively and expelled the Dalai Lama's forces from the province. However, his actions were unpopular, and there was much animosity against him for his mistreatment of civilians and disregard for local culture.

=== Post-Qing period ===
{{Main|Tibet (1912–1951)}}
After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] (1911–12) toppled the Qing Dynasty and the last Qing troops were escorted out of Tibet, the new [[Republic of China]] apologized for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama's title.&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Bradley and Michael Kohn. (2005). ''Tibet'', p. 32. Lonely Planet Publications.

For the next 36 years, the 13th Dalai Lama and the [[politics in Tibet|regents who succeeded him]] governed Tibet. During this time, Tibet fought Chinese warlords for control of the ethnically Tibetan areas in [[Xikang]] and [[Qinghai]] (parts of [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]]) along the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang 162-6&quot;&gt;Wang Jiawei, &quot;The Historical Status of China's Tibet&quot;, 2000, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1914 the Tibetan government signed the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord]] with Britain, ceding the [[South Tibet]] region to [[British India]].

{{Main|History of Tibet (1950–present)}}

Emerging with control over most of [[mainland China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[People's Republic of China]] [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|incorporated Tibet]] in 1950 and negotiated the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet|Seventeen Point Agreement]] with the newly enthroned [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s government, affirming the People's Republic of China's sovereignty but granting the area autonomy. Subsequently, on his journey into exile, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] completely repudiated the agreement, which he has repeated on many occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibet.net/en/print.php?id=183 &quot;The 17-Point Agreement&quot; The full story as revealed by the Tibetans and Chinese who were involved] The Official Website of the Central Tibetan Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]], ''[[Freedom in Exile]]'' Harper San Francisco, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Dalai Lama government fled to [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]], India, during the [[1959 Tibetan Rebellion]], it established a [[Central Tibetan Administration|rival government-in-exile]]. Afterwards, the [[Central People's Government]] in Beijing renounced the agreement and began implementation of the halted social and political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The Indus and Brahmaputra rivers originate from a lake (Tib: Tso Mapham) in Western Tibet, near [[Mount Kailash]]. The mountain is a holy pilgrimage site for both [[Hindu]]s and Tibetans. The Hindus consider the mountain to be the abode of Lord Shiva. The Tibetan name for Mt. Kailash is Khang Rinpoche. Tibet has numerous high-altitude lakes referred to in Tibetan as ''tso'' or ''co''. These include [[Qinghai Lake]], [[Lake Manasarovar]], [[Namtso]], [[Pangong Tso]], [[Yamdrok Lake]], [[Siling Co]], [[Lhamo La-tso]], [[Lumajangdong Co]], [[Lake Puma Yumco]], [[Lake Paiku]], [[Lake Rakshastal]], [[Dagze Co]] and [[Dong Co]]. The Qinghai Lake (Koko Nor) is the largest lake in the People's Republic of China.

The atmosphere is severely dry nine months of the year, and average annual snowfall is only {{convert|18|inch|cm}}, due to the [[rain shadow|rain shadow effect]]. Western passes receive small amounts of fresh snow each year but remain traversable all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation bigger than a low bush, and where wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian [[monsoon]] exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures in the summer and intense cold in the winter.

Cultural Tibet consists of several regions. These include [[Amdo]] (''A mdo'') in the northeast, which is administratively part of the provinces of [[Qinghai]], Gansu and [[Sichuan]]. [[Kham]] (''Khams'') in the southeast encompasses parts of western Sichuan, northern [[Yunnan]], southern Qinghai and the eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. [[Ü-Tsang]] (''dBus gTsang'') (Ü in the center, Tsang in the center-west, and Ngari (''mNga' ris'') in the far west) covered the central and western portion of Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref&gt;Petech, L., [http://books.google.com/books?id=V1GkmBOQLkAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;sig=6eAnf2zWcz7L113XKhOc8cCv8MI ''China and Tibet in the Early XVIIIth Century: History of the Establishment of Chinese Protectorate in Tibet''], p51 &amp; p98&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan cultural influences extend to the neighboring states of [[Bhutan]], Nepal, regions of India such as [[Sikkim]], [[Ladakh]], [[Lahaul]], and [[Spiti]], in addition to designated Tibetan [[autonomous area]]s in adjacent Chinese provinces.

=== Cities, towns and villages ===
{{See|List of populated places in the Tibet Autonomous Region}}

[[Image:Jokhang Square, the first destination or drop-off for most tourists.jpg|thumb|Looking across the square at [[Jokhang]] temple, [[Lhasa]]]]

There are over 800 settlements in Tibet. [[Lhasa]] is Tibet's traditional capital and the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. It contains two world heritage sites – the [[Potala Palace]] and [[Norbulingka]], which were the residences of the [[Dalai Lama]]. Lhasa contains a number of significant temples and monasteries, including [[Jokhang]] and [[Ramoche Temple]].

[[Shigatse]] is the second largest city in the Tibet AR, west of Lhasa. [[Gyantse]] and [[Qamdo]] are also amongst the largest.

Other cities and towns in cultural Tibet include [[Shiquanhe]] (Ali), [[Nagchu Town|Nagchu]], [[Bamda]], [[Rutog Town|Rutog]], [[Nyingchi Town|Nyingchi]], [[Nêdong (village)|Nedong]], [[Coqên (village)|Coqên]], [[Barkam Town|Barkam]], [[Sakya, Tibet|Sakya]], [[Gartse]], [[Pelbar]], [[Lhatse]], and [[Tingri Town|Tingri]]; in Sichuan, [[Kangding]] (Dartsedo); in Qinghai, [[Jyekundo]] (Yushu), [[Machen, Qinghai|Machen]], and [[Golmud]]; in India, [[Tawang]], [[Leh]], and [[Gangtok]].

In January 2007, the Chinese government issued a report outlining the discovery of a large mineral deposit under the [[Tibetan Plateau]].&lt;ref name=Tibet12345&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/25/yourmoney/mine.php|title=Valuable mineral deposits found along Tibet railroad route|agency=Reuters  |date=2007-01-25|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deposit has an estimated value of $128&amp;nbsp;billion and may double Chinese reserves of zinc, copper, and lead. The Chinese government sees this as a way to alleviate the nation's dependence on foreign mineral imports for its growing economy. However, critics worry that mining these vast resources will harm Tibet's fragile ecosystem and undermine Tibetan culture.&lt;ref name=Tibet12345/&gt;

On January 15, 2009, China announced the construction of Tibet’s first expressway, a 37.9-kilometre stretch of [[controlled-access highway]] in southwestern Lhasa. The project will cost 1.55&amp;nbsp;billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] (US$227&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=a_Tg57.MXpcY&amp;refer=asia|title=China Says ‘Sabotage’ by Dalai Lama Supporters Set Back Tibet |last=Peng|first=James |date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 18–20, 2010 a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a substantial plan to improve development of the areas was announced. The conference was attended by General secretary [[Hu Jintao]], [[Wu Bangguo]], [[Wen Jiabao]], [[Jia Qinglin]], [[Li Changchun]], [[Xi Jinping]], [[Li Keqiang]], [[He Guoqiang]] and [[Zhou Yongkang]], all members of [[CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] signaling the commitment of senior Chinese leaders to development of Tibet and ethnic Tibetan areas. The plan calls for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children. China has invested 310&amp;nbsp;billion yuan (about 45.6&amp;nbsp;billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001. &quot;Tibet's GDP was expected to reach 43.7&amp;nbsp;billion yuan in 2009, up 170 percent from that in 2000 and posting an annual growth of 12.3 percent over the past nine years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-01/22/c_13147500.htm &quot;China to achieve leapfrog development, lasting stability in Tibet&quot;] news.xinhuanet.com/english&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development Zone ===
The State Council approved Tibet Lhasa Economic and Technological Development Zone as a state-level development zone in 2001. It is located in the western suburbs of Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It is 50&amp;nbsp;km away from the [[Gonggar Airport]], and 2&amp;nbsp;km away from Lhasa Railway Station and 2&amp;nbsp;km away from 318 national highway.

The zone has a planned area of 5.46 square kilometers and is divided into two zones. Zone A developed a land area of 2.51 square kilometers for construction purposes. It is a flat zone, and has the natural conditions for good drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/lasa-economic-technology-development-zone/ |title=Lhasa Economic &amp; Technology Development Zone |publisher=RightSite.asia |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] and some other ethnic groups. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the [[Tibetan flag]], are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group reside in Tibet (excluding [[Sino-Indian War|disputed area with India]]) include [[Bai people]], [[Blang]], [[Bonan]], [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Hui people]], [[Lhoba]], [[Lisu people]], [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Mongols]], [[Monguor|Monguor (Tu people)]], [[Monpa people|Menba (Monpa)]], [[Mosuo]], [[Nakhi]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], [[Nu people]], [[Pumi people|Pumi]], [[Salar people|Salar]], and [[Yi people]].

The proportion of the non-Tibetan population in Tibet is disputed. On the one hand, the Central Tibetan Administration of the Dalai Lama, accuses China of actively swamping Tibet with migrants in order to alter Tibet's demographic makeup.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tibet.net/en/print.php?id=236&amp;articletype=articale |publisher=[[Central Tibetan Administration]]| title=Population Transfer Programmes|year=2003|accessdate=2010-07-29 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5rbC9I6bP| archivedate = 2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, according to the [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 Chinese census]] ethnic Tibetans comprise 90% of a total population of 3 million in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-05/04/c_13858686.htm |title=Tibet's population tops 3 million; 90% are Tibetans |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact population numbers probably depend on how temporary migrants are counted.

[[Image:Young monks of Drepung.jpg|right|thumb|Buddhist monks in [[Drepung]] Monastery]]

Religion is extremely important to the Tibetans and has a strong influence over all aspects of their lives. Bön is the ancient religion of Tibet, but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism, a distinctive form of [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]], which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Conze |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Conze |editor= |others= |title= A Short History of Buddhism |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |edition= |series= |year=1993 |publisher=Oneworld |isbn=1-85168-066-7 |oclc= |id= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in [[Mongolia]], parts of northern India, the [[Buryat Republic]], the [[Tuva Republic]], and in the [[Republic of Kalmykia]] and some other parts of China. During China's [[Cultural Revolution]], nearly all Tibet's [[List of Tibetan monasteries|monasteries]] were ransacked and destroyed by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tibetan monks: A controlled life&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7307495.stm Tibetan monks: A controlled life].

Tibetan Buddhism has four main traditions (the suffix ''pa'' is comparable to &quot;er&quot; in English):

* '''[[Gelug|Gelug(pa)]]''', ''Way of Virtue'', also known casually as ''Yellow Hat'', whose spiritual head is the [[Ganden Tripa]] and whose temporal head is the [[Dalai Lama]]. Successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries. This order was founded in the 14th to 15th centuries by [[Je Tsongkhapa]], based on the foundations of the [[Kadampa]] tradition. Tsongkhapa was renowned for both his scholasticism and his virtue. The Dalai Lama belongs to the Gelugpa school, and is regarded as the embodiment of the Bodhisattva of Compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avalokitesvara]], [[Chenrezig]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Kagyu|Kagyu(pa)]]''', ''Oral Lineage''. This contains one major subsect and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to [[Gampopa]]. In turn, the Dagpo Kagyu consists of four major sub-sects: the [[Karma Kagyu]], headed by a [[Karmapa]], the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. The once-obscure [[Shangpa Kagyu]], which was famously represented by the 20th century teacher [[Kalu Rinpoche]], traces its history back to the Indian master Niguma, sister of Kagyu lineage holder [[Naropa]]. This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th century mystic.

* '''[[Nyingma|Nyingma(pa)]]''', ''The Ancient Ones''. This is the oldest, the original order founded by [[Padmasambhava]].

* '''[[Sakya|Sakya(pa)]]''', ''Grey Earth'', headed by the [[Sakya Trizin]], founded by Khon Konchog Gyalpo, a disciple of the great translator Drokmi Lotsawa. [[Sakya Pandita]] 1182–1251CE was the great grandson of Khon Konchog Gyalpo. This school emphasizes scholarship.

==== Islam ====
{{Main|Islam in Tibet}}
[[Image:Lhasa mosque.JPG‎|thumb|upright|Tibetan mosque in Lhasa]]
Muslims have been living in Tibet since as early as the 8th or 9th century. In Tibetan cities, there are small communities of [[Tibetan Muslim|Muslims]], known as Kachee (Kache), who trace their origin to immigrants from three main regions: [[Kashmir]] (Kachee Yul in ancient Tibetan), Ladakh and the Central Asian Turkic countries. Islamic influence in Tibet also came from Persia. After 1959 a group of Tibetan Muslims made a case for Indian nationality based on their historic roots to Kashmir and the Indian government declared all Tibetan Muslims Indian citizens later on that year.&lt;ref&gt;Masood Butt, [http://www.tibet.com/Muslim/tibetan-muslim.html 'Muslims of Tibet'], The Office of Tibet, January/February 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Other Muslim ethnic groups who have long inhabited Tibet include [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Salar people|Salar]], [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]] and [[Bonan]]. There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the [[Hui people|Hui]] ethnic group of China.

==== Christianity ====
The first Christians documented to have reached Tibet were the [[Nestorian Christians|Nestorians]], of whom various remains and inscriptions have been found in Tibet. They were also present at the imperial camp of [[Möngke Khan]] at Shira Ordo, where they debated in 1256 with [[Karma Pakshi]] (1204/6-83), head of the [[Karma Kagyu]] order.&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, pp. 31, 71, 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1972, pp. 36, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; Desideri, who reached Lhasa in 1716, encountered Armenian and Russian merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Pommaret, Françoise Pommaret-Imaeda (2003). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=WhzF0N_X5KwC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Lhasa in the seventeenth century: the capital of the Dalai Lamas]''&quot;. BRILL. p.159. ISBN 90-04-12866-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic [[Jesuits]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] arrived from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Portuguese missionaries Jesuit Father [[Antonio de Andrade]] and Brother Manuel Marques first reached the kingdom of [[Gelu, Nepal|Gelu]] in western Tibet in 1624 and was welcomed by the royal family who allowed them to build a church later on.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Sanderg, The Exploration of Tibet: History and Particulars (Delhi: Cosmo Publications, 1973), pp. 23–26; Thomas Holdich, Tibet, The Mysterious (London: [[Alston Rivers]], 1906), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Maclagan, The Jesuits and The Great Mogul (London: Burns, Oates &amp; Washbourne Ltd., 1932), pp. 344–345.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1627, there were about a hundred local converts in the Guge kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Lettera del P. Alano Dos Anjos al Provinciale di Goa, 10 Novembre 1627, quoted from Wu Kunming, Zaoqi Chuanjiaoshi jin Zang Huodongshi (Beijing: Zhongguo Zangxue chubanshe, 1992), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Christianity was introduced to [[Rudok]], [[Ladakh]] and Tsang and was welcomed by the ruler of the [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang kingdom]], where Andrade and his fellows established a Jesuit outpost at Shigatse in 1626.&lt;ref&gt;Extensively using Italian and Portuguese archival materials, Wu's work gives a detailed account of Cacella's activities in Tsang. See Zaoqi Chuanjiaoshi jin Zang Huodongshi, esp. chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1661 another Jesuit, [[Johann Grueber]], crossed Tibet from [[Sining]] to Lhasa (where he spent a month), before heading on to Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;''Narratives of the Mission of George Bogle to Tibet, and of the Journey of Thomas Manning to Lhasa'', pp. 295–302. Clements R. Markham. (1876). Reprint Cosmo Publications, New Delhi. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa. These included the Jesuit Father [[Ippolito Desideri]], 1716–1721, who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture, language and Buddhism, and various Capuchins in 1707–1711, 1716–1733 and 1741–1745,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein 1972, p. 85&quot;&gt;Stein 1972, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the [[Karmapa]] sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the [[Gelugpa]] sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama's insistence.&lt;ref name=&quot;pacificrim.usfca.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/6299565.stm|title=BBC News Country Profiles Timeline: Tibet|accessdate=2009-03-11 | date=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lettera del P.

In 1877, the Protestant James Cameron from the [[China Inland Mission]] walked from [[Chongqing]] to [[Batang County|Batang]] in [[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]], Sichuan province, and &quot;brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people.&quot;  Beginning in the 20th century, in [[Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] in Yunnan, a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity. Famous earlier missionaries include [[James O. Fraser]], [[Alfred James Broomhall]] and [[Isobel Kuhn]] of the China Inland Mission, among others who were active in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Yunnan Province of China Government Web | url= http://www.eng.yn.gov.cn/yunnanEnglish/145529160029175808/20050623/378813.html | accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapstein 2006, pp. 31, 206&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tibetan art ===
{{Main|Tibetan art}}
[[Image:thanka.jpg|thumb|A [[thangka]] painting in [[Sikkim]]]]

Tibetan representations of art are intrinsically bound with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and commonly depict [[deities]] or variations of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in various forms from bronze Buddhist statues and shrines, to highly colorful [[thangka]] paintings and [[mandala]]s.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Tibetan culture#Architecture}}

Tibetan architecture contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply [[Buddhist]] approach. The [[Dharmacakra|Buddhist wheel]], along with two dragons, can be seen on nearly every [[Gompa]] in Tibet. The design of the Tibetan [[Chörten]]s can vary, from roundish walls in [[Kham]] to squarish, four-sided walls in [[Ladakh]].

The most distinctive feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.

[[Image:Potala from SW.jpg|thumb|The [[Potala Palace]]]]

Standing at 117 meters in height and 360 meters in width, the [[Potala Palace]] is the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the [[Dalai Lama]], it contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures. The Potala Palace is a [[World Heritage Site]], as is [[Norbulingka]], the former summer residence of the Dalai Lama.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Tibet}}

The music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region, centered in Tibet but also known wherever ethnic [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] groups are found in India, [[Bhutan]], Nepal and further abroad. First and foremost Tibetan music is [[religious music]], reflecting the profound influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on the culture.

Tibetan music often involves [[chanting]] in [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]]{{dn|date=October 2012}} or [[Sanskrit]], as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of [[sacred text]]s or in celebration of various festivals. [[Yang]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular [[Gelugpa]] school, and the romantic music of the [[Nyingmapa]], [[Sakyapa]] and [[Kagyupa]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;Crossley-Holland, Peter. (1976). &quot;The Ritual Music of Tibet.&quot; ''The Tibet Journal''. Vol. 1, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, Autumn 1976, pp. 47–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nangma]] dance music is especially popular in the [[karaoke]] bars of the urban center of Tibet, [[Lhasa]]. Another form of popular music is the classical [[gar (music)|gar]] style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. [[Lu (music)|Lu]] are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches. There are also epic bards who sing of [[Gesar]], who is a hero to ethnic Tibetans.

=== Festivals ===
{{Main|Tibetan festivals}}

[[Image:IMG 1016 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|The [[Monlam Prayer Festival]]]]
[[Image:Sand mandala tibet 1.JPG|thumb|Tibetan sand mandala]]

Tibet has various festivals which are commonly performed to worship the Buddha{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} throughout the year. [[Losar]] is the Tibetan New Year Festival. Preparations for the festive event are manifested by special offerings to family shrine deities, painted doors with religious symbols, and other painstaking jobs done to prepare for the event. Tibetans eat Guthuk (barley crumb food with filling) on New Year's Eve with their families. The [[Monlam Prayer Festival]] follows it in the first month of the [[Tibetan calendar]], falling between the fourth and the eleventh days of the first Tibetan month. It involves dancing and participating in sports events, as well as sharing picnics. The event was established in 1049 by Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama's order.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Tibetan cuisine}}

The most important crop in Tibet is [[barley]], and dough made from barley flour—called [[tsampa]]—is the [[staple food]] of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called [[momo (food)|momos]]. Meat dishes are likely to be [[yak]], goat, or [[Lamb (food)|mutton]], often dried, or cooked into a spicy [[stew]] with potatoes. [[Mustard seed]] is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak [[yogurt]], butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. [[Butter tea]] is very popular to drink.
