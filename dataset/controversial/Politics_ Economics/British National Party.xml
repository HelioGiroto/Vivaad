The '''British National Party''' ('''BNP''') is a [[far-right]] political party formed as a splinter group from the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] by [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] in 1982. It restricted membership to &quot;indigenous British&quot; people until a 2010 legal challenge to its constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7026702.ece ''BNP changes all-white constitution and ejects Times reporter from meeting'', The Times]{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP advocates &quot;firm but voluntary incentives for immigrants and their descendants to return home&quot;,&lt;ref name = &quot;BBC-Rebuilding&quot;&gt;British National Party: ''Rebuilding British Democracy'' (general election manifesto 2005 online at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/BNP_uk_manifesto.pdf BNP UK Manifesto]. ''BBC News'')&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the repeal of anti-discrimination legislation.

The BNP finished fifth in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 London mayoral election]] with 5.2% of the vote, winning a seat in the [[London Assembly]]. In 2009 it won its first county council seats and two seats in the [[European Parliament]], with leader [[Nick Griffin]] and [[Andrew Brons]] being elected as MEPs. Since Brons' defection, Griffin is the BNP's only MEP.

During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], the BNP received 1.9% of the vote and failed to win any seats. The party's current leader, [[Nick Griffin]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23845056-bnp-leader-nick-griffin-to-attend-buckingham-palace-garden-party.do&lt;/ref&gt; is a former national organiser of the National Front.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4670574.stm Profile: Nick Griffin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===National Front===

The British National Party{{#tag:ref|The name British National Party had been used in politics previously by four organisations, most notably by the [[British National Party (1942)|a Mosleyite party]] which became the [[English National Association]] and by [[British National Party (1960s)|a 1960s party]] initiated by [[John Bean]], which became part of the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]]. Tyndall was a leading member of the 1960s BNP and a founder of the present party.|group=note}} was founded in 1982 following a split within the [[British National Front|National Front]] (NF) two years before.&lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|2000|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor showing at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], internal factional division heightened within the National Front. This culminated in chairman [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] leaving the party in 1980,&lt;ref name=&quot;betz&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Betz|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; founding the New National Front, which became the BNP two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barberis|2005|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Spearhead (magazine)|Spearhead]]'', a magazine produced by Tyndall, the split within the NNF was not initially intended to be permanent.&lt;ref name=&quot;betz&quot;/&gt; The National Front had organised marches in an attempt to further raise its profile. These sometimes led to violent clashes with political opponents such as the [[Anti-Nazi League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;twotwoseven&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Robin|1989|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Tyndall's New National Front, wished to modernise and move away from fascist ideology, blaming the old National Front for its lack of popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell. Roger. Western Democracies and the New Extreme Right Challenge, (New York, 2004), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Tyndall's newly formed British National Party therefore absorbed the membership of the [[British Democratic Party]], a small [[British nationalism|British nationalist]] party led by [[Anthony Reed Herbert]] which attempted to distance itself from [[neo-nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; A. Bell, The Other Face of Terror- Inside Europe’s Neo-Nazi Network, London: Collins, 1988, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Democratic Party had itself earlier split from the National Front.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Routledge dictionary of modern British history&quot;, John Plowright, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2 August 2006, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[Constitutional Movement]], another splinter group, who had distanced themselves from fascism and violent subcultures such as [[football hooliganism]], also joined.&lt;ref&gt; Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th century, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; These smaller nationalist parties attempting to modernise their image, joined Tyndall's New National Front through the Committee for Nationalist Unity (1981), which acted as a front to draw members from similar modernising nationalist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations&quot;, Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;  However despite Tyndall's attempt to distance the newly formed British National Party from fascism, several individuals of the disintegrating [[British Movement]] were allowed to join.&lt;ref&gt; Hill &amp; Bell, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyndall leadership, early years===

At its formation in 1982, the British National Party had 2500 members, most of whom had joined from the [[Constitutional Movement]] through the Committee for Nationalist Unity.&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell, p. 66; Hill &amp; Bell, p. 163; Copsey, 2004, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eddy Morrison]] and his minor Leeds based nationalist party, merged with the British National Party later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Tyndall sought to make an electoral impact by fielding 53 candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], which guaranteed a free party broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;eightthree&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1979.stm|title=BNP: under the skin, 1979–1983|author=BBC |date=25 November 2001|accessdate=4 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broadcast featured Tyndall, flanked by two British flags, and footage of the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riot]], a violent riot between predominantly black local residents and the police.&lt;ref name=&quot;harri&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1983|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to academic Martin Harrison in ''The British General Election of 1983'', the BNP broadcast &quot;was less heavily anti-black than the National Front's&quot;.|group=note}} All candidates combined, which included Tyndall himself and his wife Valerie, the British National Party achieved only 14,621 votes and lost all its deposits.&lt;ref name=&quot;butler&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|1983|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed afterwards that the BNP Deputy Chairman [[Ray Hill]] had been working as a mole on behalf of the anti-fascist magazine ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bnpbarb&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barberis|2005|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1980s, the British National Party under Tyndall absorbed numerous existing National Front [[Flag Group]]{{#tag:ref|There were overtures at a possible BNP and NF Flag Group reunification as the ''Nationalist Alliance''. It was [[Andrew Brons]] of the NF Flag Group who attempted to engineer this.&lt;ref name=&quot;copsey&quot;/&gt; It came to nothing after [[Martin Wingfield]], one of the NF Flag Group leaders, rejected the possibility in ''The Flag'' magazine. Wingfield had a long-standing grudge with BNP chairman Tyndall.&lt;ref name=&quot;copsey&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} branches including Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The party also began to develop friendly relations with the [[Federation of Conservative Students]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bnpbarb&quot;/&gt; The British National Party also made contacts on the continent, particularly with [[Flemish nationalism|Flemish nationalists]] of the radical Odal Group, which succeeded the [[Order of Flemish Militants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bnpbarb&quot;/&gt; John Peacock, a regional organiser for the British National Party was the British representative of the Odal Ring.&lt;ref&gt;The far right in western and eastern Europe, Luciano Cheles, Ronnie Ferguson, Michalina Vaughan - 1995, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyndall claimed after the 1983 general election, that the parties more moderate image had been sufficiently attractive to invite 3,000 enquiries in joining the party.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He also attempted to distance the party from neo-nazism and skinheads.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eatwell, ‘Continuity and Metamorphosis: Fascism in Britain since 1945’, in S.U. Larsen (ed.), Modern Europe After Fascism (Boulder: Social Science Monographs, 1998), p. 1207.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite however an increase in membership, and increase in media exposure, the British National Party continued to poll very low in council elections, ranging from 1 - 3%, the sole exception being a council by-election in [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] in 1984, where the party polled 11.7%.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey,2004, p. 39 cf. British National Party Members’ Bulletin, Jan. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Tyndall and [[John Morse (British politician)|John Morse]] were imprisoned for inciting racial hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szajkowski|2004|p=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in prison, Tyndall wrote the part-autobiographical, part-political ''The Eleventh Hour'', making [[Richard Edmonds]] the ''de facto'' leader of the BNP during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eriksen|2006|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Tyndall was imprisoned, the British National Party ceased in electoral activity - only one candidate stood in the London Borough council elections.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey,2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; While Tyndall and Morse served short 4 month prison sentences, membership of the party had shrunk, and with little financial income, Tyndall decided not to stand candidates in the 1987 general election.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey,2004, pp. 39-43.&lt;/ref&gt; However two party regional organisers, Alf Waite in Bromley and Michael Easter from the BNP’s West Kent branch, defied his wishes and declared their intention to stand as BNP candidates. Both stood in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]] polling poorly. Both were subsequently expelled by Tyndall.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The party was further damaged, by the fact a 1988 ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' report revealed that BNP Deputy Chairman Richard Edmonds was once involved with a newspaper called the ''&quot;Holocaust&quot; News'', published by the Centre for Historical Review.&lt;ref name=Times1988&gt;{{Cite news|title=Holocaust hate sheet alarms British Jews|author=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]|date= 6 March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication claimed that the [[Holocaust]], as presented in state-sponsored accounts, was an elaborate, politically motivated hoax. It promoted instead the ''[[Leuchter Report]]'', the ''Ball Report'' and the ''[[Rudolf Expertise]]''. In 1989, the BNP had 800 members.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey,2004, p. 45 cf. Searchlight, no. 170, Aug. 1989, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gains at local level, 1990s===

The British National Party in the early 1990's picked up in its membership and support through the decline of the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]], which had split into further factions.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, pp. 45-48.&lt;/ref&gt; It had also mobilised 200 people for a &quot;Rights for Whites&quot; demonstration resulting in the [[1989 Dewsbury race riot]]. The BNP claimed the demonstration was in support of white parents who withdrew their children from predominantly Muslim schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;dr&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Dewsbury Reporter]] |date=1 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about Dewsbury, Tyndall made the claim that &quot;the name of our party, for long languishing
in obscurity, is now on thousands of lips&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 48 cf. ''British Nationalist'', Aug./Sept. 1989, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the party also saw a popularity growth in east London and relocated its bookshop to a heavily fortified headquarters at [[Welling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boothroyd|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], Tyndall and [[Jane Birdwood|Lady Birdwood]] were noted candidates who unsuccessfully stood for election.&lt;ref name=&quot;twothree&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1992.stm|title=BNP: under the skin, 1992–1993|author=BBC |date=25 November 2001|accessdate=18 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barberis|2005|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, BNP candidate [[Derek Beackon]]—a last minute replacement for [[Eddy Butler]]—won the party its first [[Local government in England|local council]] seat in 1993 from Labour, during a local-by election for the [[Isle of Dogs]], [[Tower Hamlets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;/&gt; The seat was fought on a &quot;Rights for Whites&quot; platform, in which it was alleged black families were being favoured in local housing initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;bnpbarb&quot;/&gt; In May 1994, as local elections approached, the BNP hoped to hold its seat, but was defeated by Labour.

In the aftermath of Beackon’s electoral victory and losing his seat the following year, the British National Party clashed with paramilitary organisation, [[Combat 18]],&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; which had evolved in 1991 from a 'security force' made up of nationalists drawn from [[football casual]] firms was created to defend far-right activists, allegedly in response to a hammer attack at [[Kensington]] Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;inde&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/combat-18-memoirs-of-a-streetfighting-man-1142204.html|title= Combat 18: Memoirs of a street-fighting man |work=The Independent |location=London |date=1 February 1998|accessdate=18 January 2010|first=Nick|last=Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/online/issue30/lob30-10.htm|title= Combat 18 and MI5: some background notes |author=Lobster Magazine|year=1995|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force firebombed the headquarters of the communist newspaper, the ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]'', and by 1993 had transformed into the [[Neo-Nazi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atkins|2004|p=67}}. {{harvnb|McAuley|2003|p=152}}. {{harvnb|Cameron|2002|p=111}}. {{harvnb|Gabriel|1998|p=164}}. {{harvnb|Thurlow|1998|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt; paramilitary organisation [[Combat 18]].&lt;ref name=&quot;inde&quot;/&gt; That same year, the BNP proscribed membership of the group&lt;ref name=&quot;twothree&quot;/&gt; and claimed it had been infiltrated by [[MI5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7736000/7736870.stm|title=Interview with the British National Party|author=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=19 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1995, Tyndall maintained that in response to the BNP’s victory in Millwall, C18 had been ‘created’ by the State security services in order to wreck
the BNP and its electoral support.&lt;ref&gt;S''pearhead'', no. 319, Sept. 1995, pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Griffin, who later became British National Party chairman, stated in ''Spearhead'' during 1999 that members of Combat 18 had been a faction of the [[British Movement]] some years earlier, from which they were expelled, but never part of the BNP. He claimed that it had &quot;been known for some years that MI5 encouraged or even ordered the setting up of C18 in order to disrupt and discredit the BNP after historic electoral success in Millwall in 1993&quot;, and also that ''[[The Observer]]'' had confirmed that Combat 18 was a state-sponsored &quot;honeytrap&quot; right from the start.

In August 1995 Tyndall committed the party to contesting 50 seats at the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; However the party was in a poor state, as the membership had dropped to 700 and there was an on-going conflict with Combat 18.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, pp.68-69 cf. ''Searchlight'', no. 241, July 1995, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The party attempted to further modernise its image for the upcoming [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] as Michael Newland, the party’s press officer looked towards the example [[Austrian Freedom Party]] as a model for a ‘new’, modern and respectable British nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Spearhead'', no. 325, March 1996, pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Newland however briefly resigned from the party in early 1996 convinced that it needed a new leader. [[Nick Griffin]] joined the party in 1995, having led a faction of the National Front and Tyndall employed him to edit ''Spearhead''. Griffin believed the British National Party needed to be further modernised, with no fascist connections, but through a forthright commitment to what he regarded as [[historical revisionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; A booklet, ''Who are the Mind-benders?'' co-authered by Griffin was unveiled by the BNP in early 1997, arguing that Britain and its media was mass-controlled by a &quot;liberal-elite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Spearhead'', no. 336, Feb. 1997, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Griffin flirted with [[Holocaust Denial]] writing in ''The Rune'' that the Holocaust was a &quot;mixture of Allied wartime propaganda, extremely profitable lie, and latter-day witch-hysteria&quot;. He was consequently prosecuted under the Public Order Act at the instigation of [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|Alex Carlile]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/legan/legan029.pdf|title= The British State versus Freedom of Expression: The Case of R. v.

Following the 1997 general election, the BNP once again suffered a set back. At local elections in May 1998, the BNP fielded five more candidates than in 1994 but its average vote fell from just over 13% to a derisory 3.28%. In Tower Hamlets, its average share of the poll slumped by almost half.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1998, membership stood at 1,100.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Within four years, the BNP had gone from thinking it was on the verge of a major electoral breakthrough to the point of stagnation, this led to the party's first leadership election.

===Griffin leadership, identity nationalism===

In October 1999, Nick Griffin, supported by [[Tony Lecomber]], stood against Tyndall for leadership of the BNP.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatw&quot;/&gt;
John Tyndall, only received 411 (30%) of the votes, while Griffin the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Copsey, 2004, p. 100 cf. Fight Back! The Election Manifesto of the British National Party (1992), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; After Griffin won he began modernising the party's image,&lt;ref name=&quot;eatw&quot;/&gt; though the crucial policy change from compulsory to voluntary [[repatriation]] had already been accomplished under Tyndall's leadership. Griffin moved the party from a focus on the status of Jews in Britain, to allowing Jews to stand for the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nationalism and Israel&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=1057|title=Nationalism and Israel |date=28 July 2006 |publisher=British National Party |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195726/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=1057 |archivedate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new monthly newspaper, ''The Voice of Freedom'', was initiated, as well as a journal, ''Identity''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatw&quot;/&gt; During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], following the [[2001 England riots|milltown riots]],&lt;ref name=&quot;geed&quot;/&gt; [[Oldham]] and [[Burnley]] polled highest for the BNP.&lt;ref name=&quot;geed&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|2002|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[11 September attacks|9/11]] the BNP made further political capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbas|2005|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal democracy of the BNP has been criticised by members for giving too much power to the chairman and for not being widely available for the membership to consult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/dewsbury-news/Auty-quits-after-BNP-leadership.4455958.jp |title=Auty quits after BNP leadership bid fails – Yorkshire Evening Post |publisher=Yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk |author=Richard Edwards |accessdate=19 September 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kKpPK7Qw|archivedate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a leadership challenge to Griffin by Colin Auty and Colin Jackson resulted in resignations and expulsions among their supporters and 67 senior activists.

===2010 General Election, leadership challenge===

The British National Party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] fielded a record 338 candidates, polling 563,743 votes, but won no seats. Nick Griffin came third in the [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]] constituency, where the party the same year in the local elections lost all of its 12 councillors it held on the borough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/council/html/3892.stm Barking and Dagenham 2010 election results] BBC, retrieved on 8 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 26 BNP councillors lost their seats, leaving the party with 28 seats overall.

Following disappointing election results in 2011, and a General Members Meeting which did away with the virtually insurmountable nominations' requirement for a leadership election, a [[British National Party leadership election, 2011|leadership election]] took place in 2011.

===Political tendency===
It has been claimed{{by whom|date=May 2012}} that the BNP has, since its foundation, been fascist. The party's predecessor, the NF, was overtly fascist,{{fact|date=May 2012}} incorporating British nationalism, racism, and [[antisemitism]] into its core ideology.{{fact|date=May 2012}} This ideology was taken up by the newly formed BNP. Founder John Tyndall proclaimed: &quot;''[[Mein Kampf]]'' is my bible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,11375,1028498,00.html Expelled BNP founder plans court battle] ''The Observer'', 24 August 2003.

Historian Richard Overy has said that &quot;Fascism with a capital F&quot; was strictly a movement of the past. According to David Stevenson, &quot;the BNP is different in style and structure from fascism in the 1930s&quot; saying that although they do not wear uniforms they still count &quot;bully boys&quot; among their membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/09/bnp-fascism-meps-far-right |title=Leading historians on whether fascism is on the march again &amp;#124; Politics |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2009|first=Stephen|last=Moss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic policy===
The economic policy of the party has developed over time. In the 1990s, the party reflected [[protectionism]] and [[economic nationalism]], although in comparison with other radical nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on [[corporatism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2002|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the &quot;subordination of the power of the City to the power of the government&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot; /&gt; It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum [[self-sufficiency]] in food production.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot; /&gt; It has advocated ending overseas aid in order to provide aid within the UK and to finance the repatriation of immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot; /&gt; In 2002, the party criticised corporatism as a &quot;mixture of big capitalism and state control&quot;, saying it favoured a &quot;[[distributism|distributionist]] tradition established by home-grown thinkers&quot; favouring small business.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatw&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Eatwell|2004|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2005 manifesto, the BNP opposed &quot;[[globalism]], [[international socialism]], [[laissez-faire capitalism]] and [[economic liberalism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/BNP_uk_manifesto.pdf|publisher=BBC|title=BNP General Election Manifesto 2005|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP rejects the notion of [[Thatcherism]] and &quot;submitting to the dictates of the international marketplace&quot; which &quot;has no loyalty to this country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt; The BNP has claimed that it is possible for a national economy to thrive outside of the [[laissez-faire]] model, pointing to 21st century examples such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt; The BNP claims that, while immigration increases the [[Aggregate income|aggregate GNP]] by providing cheap labour, it decreases the [[Per capita income|per-capita GNP]], which the BNP claims is most representative of the economic well-being of British people.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt;

The party says that &quot;old-style socialist methods&quot; of tax and spend &quot;turned out to have harmful effects&quot; and it would instead seek &quot;non-destructive means to reduce income inequality&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt; Central to the BNP's economic policies are greater share ownership and the establishment of [[worker cooperative|worker co-operatives]]. The party advocates the provision of extra resources for &quot;especially gifted children&quot; and the reversal of closures of special needs schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt;

In the BNP 2010 Manifesto (pp.&amp;nbsp;8–10) some of their key economic policies are summed up as follows:

*The BNP will forbid the development and importation of genetically modified produce.
*The BNP would support local economies by creating a national network of autonomous credit unions.
*The BNP will ensure that globalist corporations pay their fair share of the tax burden.
*The BNP will charge foreign trucks for the right to use Britain’s road network, as other European nations already allegedly do.
*A BNP government would tackle the national debt problem by cutting expenditure on all projects which they think do not serve British interests.

===Social and cultural policy===
Some key social and cultural policies of the British National Party are summed up below from their most recent Manifesto:&lt;ref name=&quot;BNP General Election 2010 Manifesto&quot;&gt;[http://communications.bnp.org.uk/ge2010manifesto.pdf BNP General Election 2010 Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The BNP will introduce a new Bill of Rights which will guarantee certain basic civil liberties.
*The BNP will encourage the teaching of British history, culture and traditions at schools.
*The BNP will introduce formal bank holidays for all of our nations’ patron saints

*The BNP will ensure that appropriate areas of public life, including school assemblies, are based on a commitment to the values of traditional Western Christianity, as a benchmark for a decent and civilised society.

In 2005 the BNP proposed to reintroduce compulsory [[National Service]] for the young and proposed that men should keep a rifle and ammunition in their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt;  In their 2010 Manifesto, the BNP have expanded on their policy of National Service, claiming the youths who take National Service will subsequently be funded for their University or further education: &quot;On satisfactory completion of their period of National Service, all suitably qualified youngsters will become eligible to receive a fully funded university education. The less academically qualified will be entitled to paid apprenticeships or training.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://communications.bnp.org.uk/ge2010manifesto.pdf BNP General Election 2010 Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt;

A further BNP policy is &quot;to end the conflict in Ireland by welcoming Eire{{sic}} as well as Ulster as equal partners in a federation of the nations of the British Isles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080120155729/www.bnp.org.uk/sms-news-texts/ &quot;BNP Policies&quot;], BNP Website. Retrieved 4 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime===
The BNP advocates capital punishment for &quot;drug dealers, child murderers, multiple murderers, murderers of policemen on duty and terrorists where guilt is proven beyond all doubt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BNP General Election 2010 Manifesto&quot;/&gt; Other key BNP policies on crime include:

*The BNP will abolish political correctness from the police service in favour of real crime fighting.
*The BNP will establish a penal station for hardened and repeat criminals on the British island of South Georgia.
*The BNP will reintroduce the right of householders to defend themselves and their property using whatever means they deem necessary.

===Immigration===
Since its formation the British National Party has staunchly opposed immigration. The BNP argues that: &quot;To ensure that we do not become a minority in our own homeland, and that the native British peoples of our Islands retain their culture and identity, we call for an immediate halt to all further immigration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;BNP Manifesto, 2005, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] the party advocated total repatriation for all ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Non-whites already here must be repatriated or otherwise resettled overseas and Britain made once again a white country&quot; – BNP General Election Manifesto 1997 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8320241.stm&gt;] [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1332045/BNP-struggles-for-respectability.html]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Nick Griffin]] became chairman in 1999, the BNP changed their total [[repatriation]] policy to only voluntary, a key policy which remains to date, offering financial &quot;incentives for immigrants and their descendants to return home.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Rebuilding&quot;/&gt; The party maintains that ethnic minorities legally in Britain are entitled to stay as long as they always remain the minority population demographically:&lt;ref&gt;BNP Manifesto 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The BNP recognises the right of legally settled and law-abiding minorities to remain in the UK and enjoy the full protection of the law, on the understanding that the indigenous population of Britain has the right to remain the majority population of our nation.

In their 2010 Manifesto (p.&amp;nbsp;30) the BNP argues that Islamic immigration must be &quot;halted and reversed as it presents one of the most deadly threats yet to the survival of our nation&quot;. Furthermore their policy is also to &quot;deport all foreigners convicted of crimes in Britain, regardless of their immigration status&quot; as well as deport illegal immigrants and &quot;reject all asylum seekers who passed safe countries on their way to Britain&quot;.

====British Army immigrant issue====
It has been claimed that the BNP is opposed to allowing British Army [[Gurkha]]s the right of settlement in the United Kingdom. In 2009, Nick Griffin said: &quot;We don't think the most overcrowded country in Europe, can realistically say, 'Look, you can all come and all your relatives'...When the Gurkhas signed up—frankly as mercenaries—they expected a pension which would allow them to live well in their own country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00kctbm |title=BBC iPlayer |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Mirror&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/05/13/bnp-keep-the-gurkhas-out-of-here-115875-21354308/|title=BNP: Keep the Gurkhas out of here |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK|date=13 May 2009|accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he said that if he could swap &quot;100,000 members of the Muslim community, who say that they support al Qaeda&quot; for the Gurkhas it &quot;would be a good exchange&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/BNP-Chairman-Nick-Griffin-Pulls-Out-Of-Royal-Garden-Party-Gurkhas-A-Good-Swap-For-Muslims/Article/200905415290010 |title=Sky News BNP |publisher=News.sky.com |accessdate=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nick Griffin has described the commentary about his party's polices on the Gurkhas as &quot;lies&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6474863.ece |location=London |work=The Times  | first=Russell | last=Jenkins | title=BNPs Nick Griffin finally gets to make a speech | date=10 June 2009}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating the party has “never before even debated this issue”.

===Race===
During the leadership of Tyndall, the party firmly supported [[white nationalism]] and the BNP 1997 Manifesto thus called for Britain to be made &quot;once again a white country&quot; through a total repatriation programme for all ethnic minorities. The BNP's 1992 General Election manifesto said that the party had &quot;no quarrel with the ordinary Jew who goes about his own business and does not attempt to influence national affairs in the interests of his racial group&quot;, but was opposed to Jewish people &quot;whose activities in pursuit of the interests of their own co-racialists here and around the world can sometimes bring them into conflict with British interests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tyndall|first=John |title=Fight Back! ''The Election Manifesto of the British National Party''|publisher=British National Party|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the BNP under Tyndall was described by the [[European Parliament|European Parliament's]] committee on racism and xenophobia as an &quot;openly Nazi party&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bnputs&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = BNP: under the skin|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1984.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate =4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the party's deputy leader [[Richard Edmonds]] said, &quot;We are 100 per cent racist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bnputs&quot;/&gt; However, under the leadership of [[Nick Griffin]], from 1999, the party began to radically change its stance on race issues. Writing in the party's newspaper, ''The Voice of Freedom'', Nick Griffin wrote an article entitled &quot;The BNP and Race&quot; in 2001 to clarify that the &quot;The BNP is no longer a genuine White Racial Nationalist party&quot; and that:

{{quote|&quot;The BNP is not a 'race supremacist' party. The BNP does not claim that any one race is superior to any other, simply that they are different. The party merely wishes to preserve those differences which make up the rich tapestry of human kind… to protect and preserve the racial and cultural integrity of the British people – and of others too – the party believes in separation… To sum up, the BNP is fighting for the very right to exist of not just the British but of all peoples.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The BNP and Races&quot;, ''The Voice of Freedom'', January, 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The BNP under Griffin espouses &quot;[[ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalism]]&quot; based on &quot;concern for the well-being of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ethnic nations that compose the United Kingdom&quot;. According to Griffin, regarding the BNP's racial views in 2004: &quot;we don't hate black people, we don't hate asians, we don't oppose any ethnic group for what God made them, they have a right to their own identity as such as we do, all we want to do is to preserve the ethnic and cultural identity of the British people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in &quot;Fascism : a very short introduction&quot;, Kevin Passmore, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of political science have noted this change in racial ideology and consider it to be [[ethnopluralism]] or 'differentialism' ([[racial realism]]), influenced by the [[European New Right]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Britain made – Inside the Radical Right: The Development of Anti-Immigrant Parties in Western Europe&quot;, David Art, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Europe for the Europeans: the foreign and security policy of the populist radical&quot;, Christina Schori Liang, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Andrew Marr Show|Andrew Marr Show]]'' in 2009, Nick Griffin declared that the BNP &quot;does not want all-white UK&quot; because &quot;Nobody out there wants it or would pay for it&quot; and that the claims he was a fascist were smears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNP 'does not want all-white UK'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8146585.stm|accessdate=31 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the party changed its constitution which had restricted membership to &quot;indigenous British&quot; people.

The party has stated that it does not oppose the Jewish, Hindu or Sikh religions but does not accept practising Sikhs or Hindus as ethnically British since they are not indigenous.&lt;ref name=Blake2005&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=390 |title=&quot;Asians&quot; in Britain: A personal message from the BNP's webeditor |last=Blake |first=Steve |date=12 July 2005 |publisher=British National Party |quote=[I]ndigenous Britons, Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and the many other ethnic and culturally different groups.... |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195804/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=390 |archivedate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP sums up its views on non-indigenous British as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnp.org.uk/resource/english-democrats-vs-british-national-party]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The British National Party...recognises pro-British members of assimilated minorities as British in a civic sense, and welcomes their contribution to our fight for fair play for, and the future survival of, the indigenous peoples of these islands.

*But we absolutely reject the poisonous, Politically Correct, anti-indigenous fiction that they are English, or Scottish, or Welsh, or Irish. They may well be very decent people, but if any of us went to Nigeria or Afghanistan, no-one would dream of pretending that we were Nigerians or Afghans.

The BNP is opposed to mixed-race relationships because &quot;when whites take partners from other ethnic groups, a white family line that stretches back into deep pre-history is destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref name=bnpfaq&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20020203190553/www.bnp.org.uk/faq.html &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;], bnp.org.uk, Retrieved on 4 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Griffin has also stated: &quot;...while the BNP is not racist, it must not become multi-racist either. Our fundamental determination to secure a future for white children is restated, and an area of uncertainty is addressed and a position which is both principled and politically realistic is firmly established. We don't hate anyone, especially the mixed race children who are the most tragic victims of enforced multi-racism, but that does not mean that we accept [[miscegenation]] as moral or normal. We do not and we never will.&quot;&lt;ref name=racereality&gt;Griffin, Nick [http://web.archive.org/web/20071010043702/http://www.bnp.org.uk/articles/race_reality.htm &quot;The BNP: Anti-asylum protest, racist sect or power-winning movement?&quot;].

====Criticism of Islam====
The party states that it &quot;has moved on in recent years, casting off the leg-irons of conspiracy theories and the thinly veiled anti-semitism which has held this party back for two decades. The real enemies of the British people are home grown Anglo-Saxon Celtic liberal-leftists&amp;nbsp;... and the Crescent Horde—the endless wave of Islamics who are flocking to our shores to bring our island nations into the embrace of their barbaric desert religion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nationalism and Israel&quot;/&gt;

Consequently, the party has shifted allegiance in conflicts involving Israel. Its head of legal affairs, Lee Barnes, wrote on the party's website about the [[2006 Lebanon War]]: &quot;As a Nationalist I can say that I support Israel 100% in their dispute with [[Hezbollah]]. In fact, I hope they wipe Hezbollah off the Lebanese map and bomb them until they leave large greasy craters in the cities where their Islamic extremist cantons of terror once stood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Barnes [http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195705/http://www.bnp.org.uk/columnists/brimstone2.php?leeId=80 &quot;Nationalism and Israel&quot;], BNP Website, 28 July 2006.

The British National Party promotes [[familialism]] and supports the [[nuclear family]] of [[Western culture|Western tradition]], as well as favouring traditional roles for women and men.

The BNP was criticised over a web article titled, &quot;Liars, buggers and thieves&quot;, which grouped several gay politicians in with convicted murderers, rapists and paedophiles. The author, BNP councillor Julian Leppert, defended it and said that the reason why gay MPs were included was because, &quot;it fits in with the headline, the bugger part, I guess&quot;, and stated that the BNP are &quot;a family party with family values&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Geen, Jessica [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-12458.html &quot;Exclusive: BNP describes gay politicians as 'buggers and criminals'&quot;], ''Pink News'', 15 May 2009, Retrieved on 9 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==BNP holding local government seats==

===County and district councillors===
The British National Party once had over 50 elected county and district councillors (55 in 2008, and 58 in 2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05064.pdf Electoral performance of the British National Party in the UK]&lt;/ref&gt; but lost many of these seats in the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2010|2010]] and [[United Kingdom local elections, 2011|2011]] local elections, and a few through defections and resignations. In October 2011, the BNP had 8 councillors, one of whom was re-elected during the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2011|2011 local elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNP Down to Eight Councillors Countrywide|url=http://bnpideas.com/?p=2133|accessdate=31 January 2012|newspaper=British National Party Ideas|date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 2012 elections this number was reduced to three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/04/bnp-green-party-election?newsfeed=true BNP falls as Greens rise on mixed night for smaller parties]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parish and town councillors===

==Electoral performance==
{{Main|British National Party election results|Elections in the United Kingdom}}

The BNP has contested seats in England, Wales and Scotland. In January 2011, the party registered in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12349646|title= BNP registers in Northern Ireland for the first time

====1983–2005====
The BNP achieved no real success in its first three general elections from 1983 to 1992. No deposits were saved and it never polled above 3.6% in any constituency.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ge1992.html Election.demon.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]] the BNP percent of votes overall was 0.1% of the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Election Results 9 April 1992|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m13.pdf|publisher=pariament.uk|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997]] the BNP for the first time saved 3 deposits (out of 56 contested seats).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ge1997.html Election.demon.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Their highest amount of votes received was 3350 (7.5%) in the East End seat of [[Bethnal Green and Bow]] (held by Labour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNP: A party on the fringe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1507680.stm|accessdate=31 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]] saved 5 deposits (out of 33 contested seats) and secured its best ever general election result in [[Oldham West and Royton]] (which had recently been the scene of racially motivated rioting between white and Asian youths) where party leader [[Nick Griffin]] secured 16.4% of the vote – more than doubling the party's previous best performance in any constituency. Its average votes per candidate also increased from 664 to 1,428, and it secured 47,129 votes in total.

The United Kingdom general election in 2005 was considered a major breakthrough by the BNP, as they picked up 192,746 votes in the 119 constituencies it contested, took a 0.7% share of the overall vote, and retained a deposit in 40 of the seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4519347.stm |work=BBC News | title=BNP sees increase in total votes | date=6 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010====

However, a record of 73 deposits were saved.

Party chairman Nick Griffin came third in the [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]] constituency, behind [[Margaret Hodge]] of Labour and Simon Marcus of the Conservatives, who were first and second respectively. At 14.6%, this was the BNP's best result in any of the seats it contested that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a11.stm |title=Election 2010 &amp;#124; Constituency &amp;#124; Barking |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local elections===
The BNP's first electoral success came in 1993, when [[Derek Beackon]] was returned as a councillor in [[Millwall]], London. He lost his seat in elections the following year. The next BNP success in local elections was not until the [[Burnley Council election, 2002|2002]] local elections, when three BNP candidates gained seats on [[Burnley (borough)|Burnley]] council.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05064.pdf Parliament.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2000, the BNP fielded 17 candidates in 12 councils and polled 3,022 votes. The average share of votes in wards contested was 8%.
*In 2001, the BNP fielded 4 candidates in three councils and polled 867 votes, with an average share of 4% in the wards contested.
*In 2002, the BNP fielded 67 candidates and polled 30,998 votes in 26 local councils. The BNP average share of votes was 16%. Three BNP candidates were elected for the first time in Burnley with an average share of 28.1%.
*In 2003, the BNP fielded a total of 217 candidates in 71 local authorities in England and Scotland. The party won a total of 13 council seats, polling over 101,221 votes and averaging 17% of the vote in those wards where it fielded candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;

The BNP's success in the 2003 local elections sparked national media publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/and-now-they-have-five-but-what-happens-when-the-bnp-wins-a-seat-746262.html Independent.co.uk]{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNP in fifth election win|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-156455/BNP-fifth-election-win.html|accessdate=31 January 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later the same year, the BNP won two local by-elections. In the Heckmondwicke ward of Kirklees Council in August, David Exley polled 1,607 votes (44%). In September, Nick Geri won the Grays Riverside ward of Thurrock council, polling 552 votes (38%).&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt; Later in Burnley, the number of councillors increased, making the BNP briefly the second largest party and the official opposition on that council, a position it lost after the resignation of a BNP councillor who had been disciplined by the party. The BNP stood in the subsequent [[Burnley local elections#Lanehead By-Election 2003|by-election]].

*In 2004, the BNP had 312 candidates stand for election in 59 local authorities in England and Wales, including 25 candidates in Sunderland, 24 in Birmingham and 23 in Leeds. The BNP won 14 council seats and polled 190,200 votes.
*In 2005, the BNP fielded 41 candidates in 18 councils and polled 21,775 votes, averaging 11% share in the contested wards.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;

The party's biggest election success to date was a gain of 52% of the vote in the Goresbrook ward of [[Barking]] in the 2004 local elections. The victorious councillor, Daniel Kelley, retired just 10 months later, claiming he had been an outcast within the council. A new election was held in June 2005, in which the seat was regained by the Labour candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/9-democracy/elections/results/elect-by-goresbrook-05.html|title=LBBD: Goresbrook Ward By-Election Result}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2006, the BNP polled a total of 229,389 votes, having fielded 363 candidates in 78 local authorities across England. The party averaged 18% of the votes in wards contested. The BNP fielded 40 candidates in Birmingham, 25 in Sunderland, 23 in Kirklees and 22 in Leeds. 33 BNP councillors were elected; four lost their seats and the party gained a seat with the defection of a Conservative councillor in Lincolnshire bringing its total to 49.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/SNSG-05064.pdf |title=Electoral performance of the British National Party in the UK |publisher=Edmund Tetteh (House of Commons Library) |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=21 November 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest gain in the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2006|local elections on 4 May 2006]], was in [[London Borough of Barking and Dagenham|Barking and Dagenham]] where the BNP won 12 of the 13 seats it contested,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;BNP laughing stock at council meeting&quot;, ''Barking and Dagenham Recorder'', 18 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; gaining 17% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/nov/15/nick-griffin-barking-general-election|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=BNP leader Nick Griffin to take on Margaret Hodge in Barking|first=Peter|last=Walker|date=15 November 2009|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP also won three seats in [[Epping Forest (district)|Epping Forest]], three in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], three in [[Sandwell]], two in [[Burnley Council election, 2006|Burnley]], two in [[Kirklees]], and single seats in [[Bradford]], [[Havering]], [[Solihull]], [[Redditch]], [[London Borough of Redbridge|Redbridge]], [[Pendle]] and [[Leeds]]. In 2006, the BNP also gained its first parish councillor in Wales when Mike Howard of Rhewl Mostyn, [[Flintshire]], previously an Independent, joined the BNP.

*In the 2007 local elections, the BNP polled 292,911 votes. It won 10 seats with a net gain of one. The party fielded a record of 744 candidates in 148 councils across England and Scotland. This was more than double the number of candidates fielded in 2006; they scored on average 13% of the votes in the wards which they contested.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2444454.ece |title=BNP goes bourgeois as party aims for rural seats|work=The Independent |location=London |date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2007|first1=Nigel|last1=Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary of BNP councillors from 2000–2007: from 2000 to 2001 the BNP had none, in 2002 it had three, by 2003 it had
16 local councillors, this increased to 21 by 2005, in 2006 the biggest gain saw BNP's councillors rise to 48, and by 2007 to 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;100council&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7382831.stm |title=BNP gains from Labour disaffection |publisher=BBC News |first=Dominic |last=Casciani |date=4 May 2008 |accessdate=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the number of BNP councillors fell slowly due to resignations and expulsions, several of them associated with a failed leadership challenge in the summer. By the end of the year, the number was 42. In 2008, however, the BNP increased its councillors to 55.

*In 2008, the BNP polled an average of 14% across 593 wards contested having fielded 612 candidates. The total number of votes polled by the BNP stood at 240,968. The party gained 15 seats and had 55 councillors in total.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt;

==Legal issues==

===Claims of repression of free speech===
The BNP says that [[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] guidelines on reporting 'far right' organisations forbid unionised journalists from reporting uncritically on the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnp.org.uk/2008/03/the-media-reporting-on-the-bnp/|title=The Media: Reporting on the BNP|author=Martin Wingfield|date=16 March 2008|accessdate=17 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, 60,000 copies of ''Voice of Freedom'', which had been printed in [[Slovakia]], were seized by British police at Dover. The police later admitted this was a mistake and released the impounded literature shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071014195814/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=521 &quot;Thousands of pounds wasted by New Labour just to deny BNP a voice&quot;], BNP Website, 12 September 2005.

===Employment cases and related controversies===
In ''[[ASLEF v. United Kingdom]]'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] overturned an employment appeal tribunal ruling that awarded BNP train driver [[Jay Lee]], damages for expulsion from a trade union. It found that the union was entitled to decide who could be a member, and that the UK was in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in the way it had treated ASLEF.&lt;ref&gt;European Court of Human Rights: [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=813953&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ASLEF v. United Kingdom: Final judgement], Strasbourg, 27 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Clive Potter, later an official of [[Solidarity – The Union for British Workers]], was expelled from his union. A court upheld the expulsion and found that it was based on previous exclusion rather than BNP membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:j9ITehWultQJ:www.pforum.fire.gov.uk/document/147+potter+bnp+prison+service&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=uk Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case, Robert Baggs claimed that he had been discriminated against because of &quot;religion, or similar philosophical belief&quot; after he was refused a job at a [[General practitioner|GP]] surgery. His claimed that the employer was in violation of the Employment (Religious Discrimination) Regulations of 2003. The Employment Tribunal found that membership of the BNP was not a &quot;similar&quot; belief,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article384990.ece|work=The Times |location=London |title=BNP loses battle|date=26 April 2005|accessdate=27 April 2010|first=Daniel|last=Barrett}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case was rejected.

Arthur Redfearn was a bus driver whose BNP membership was unknown to his employer, Serco, until he was elected as a councillor. His employer was concerned that he might endanger its contract with a local authority to transport vulnerable people of various ethnicities from a day centre and he was dismissed. The Employment Tribunal held that members of racist organisations could lawfully be dismissed on health and safety grounds if there was a danger of violence occurring in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emplaw.co.uk/researchfree-redirector.aspx?StartPage=data%2f2005irlr744.htm |title=Disclaw Publishing – Employment Law, unfair dismissal, redundancy pay |publisher=Emplaw.co.uk |accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been unsuccessfully argued at the Employment Tribunal that Redfearn had been racially discriminated against because the BNP is a whites-only organisation, and was treated unfairly in comparison to racist organisations that were non-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BAILII|country=ew|litigants=SERCO LIMITED and ARTHUR REDFEARN|court=EWCA|division=Civ|num=659|para=16|date=25 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a BNP candidate and Regional Organiser, Kevin Scott, was dismissed from the [[B&amp;Q]] hardware store in [[Gateshead]]. The management said this was not due to his party membership but due to &quot;low morale&quot; amongst other staff who did not want to work with him, and also the number of calls from customers expressing their disapproval. Scott settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, although the BNP had pledged to support any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2264846.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Store settles with sacked BNP worker |publisher=BBC News |date=17 September 2002 |accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A retired police officer, John Phazey, stood as a BNP European Assembly candidate.

In the past, Nick Griffin has defended the threat of violence to further the party's aims. In 1986, when Griffin was Deputy Chairman of the NF, he advised his audience at an anti-[[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] rally to use the &quot;traditional British methods of the brick, the boot and the fist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Yorkshire Post'', 17 February 1986&lt;/ref&gt; After the BNP won its first council seat in 1993, he wrote that the BNP should not be a &quot;postmodernist rightist party&quot; but &quot;a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan 'Defend Rights for Whites' with well-directed boots and fists. When the crunch comes, power is the product of force and will, not of rational debate&quot;. In 1997 he said: &quot;It is more important to control the streets of a city than its council chambers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardng&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/sep/01/features.magazine37|title=Flying the flag|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|date=1 September 2002|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People affected by the disclosure included a DJ, Rod Lucas, who was dropped by the [[Talksport]] radio station.

===Equality and Human Rights Commission===
The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] sent the BNP a letter in 2009, ahead of legal action, setting out concerns about the BNP's constitution and membership criteria. It alleged that the BNP's constitution restricting membership to white people was unlawful under the Race Relations Act. The BNP chose to fight this opinion in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].

The Commission issued county court proceedings against party leader Nick Griffin and two other officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8218397.stm Legal action over BNP membership], BBC News.

The BNP agreed to suspend further membership applications until an Extraordinary General Meeting in January 2010 confirming changes to the constitution. The case was adjourned in order to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1220565/BNP-change-whites-membership-rules-fall-foul-discrimination-laws.html |title=BNP to change 'whites only' membership rules so as not to fall foul of discrimination laws &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the case, the Secretary of State for Wales, [[Peter Hain]] protested against the BBC's inclusion of Griffin on the [[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]] programme, claiming the court case meant the BNP was &quot;an unlawful body&quot;. [[Shami Chakrabarti]], director of [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], said: &quot;A shiny new constitution does not a democratic party make. It would be a pyrrhic victory, to say the least, if anyone thought that giving the BNP a facelift would make the slightest difference to a body with so much racism and hatred pumping through its veins.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The courts declared that the new constitution still breached equality laws and was still indirectly discriminatory. Judge Paul Collins ordered the BNP to pay costs and said its membership list must remain &quot;closed&quot; until it complied with race relations laws. The BNP claimed that it had a waiting list of black and Asian people and wanted more applications from ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;New BNP rules rejected by court&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8564742.stm|work=BBC News|title=New BNP rules rejected by court|date=12 March 2010|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the BNP leadership was accused of lying over the matter by the EHRC who claimed that the offending passage had not been removed but merely altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/nov/08/nick-griffin-high-court-bnp |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Matthew | last=Taylor | title=BNP leader Nick Griffin accused of lying over party's constitution | date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent hearing the BNP leadership was found not guilty of the contempt of court.

==Opposition==
The BNP is condemned by many sections of the media. High-ranking politicians from each of the mainstream parties have, at various times, called for their own supporters to vote for anyone but the BNP,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1756111,00.html|title=Guardian: Cameron: vote for anyone but BNP|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 April 2006|accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Blair admits 'paying penalty' for US links|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1541686/Blair-admits-paying-penalty-for-US-links.html| accessdate=20 February 2007|first=George|last=Jones|date=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown stated: &quot;Londoners and the rest of the British people know that backing the BNP is totally at odds with what it really means to be British—and the great British values the rest of us share, such as democracy and decency, freedom and fairness, tolerance and equality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/04/29/hope-not-hate-vote-for-equality-freedom-and-hope-by-gordon-brown-115875-20398497/|title=Hope not hate: Vote for equality, freedom and hope|last=Brown|first=Gordon|date=29 April 2008|work=Daily Mirror |location=UK|accessdate=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[David Cameron]],&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Cameron calls on voters to back anyone but the BNP|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1516510/Cameron-calls-on-voters-to-back-anyone-but-the-BNP.html| accessdate=5 December 2006|first=George|last=Jones|date=24 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] party leader [[Nick Clegg]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cleggtoday&quot;&gt;Nick Clegg &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a party of thugs, fascists.&quot; Speaking on ''Today'', BBC Radio 4, 8 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and former Lib Dem leader Sir [[Menzies Campbell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=Liberal Democrats|title=Lib Dems appeal to ethnic minority voters|url=http://libdems.org.uk/news/lib-dems-appeal-to-ethnic-minority-voters.10064.html

The British Government announced in 2009 that the BNP's two MEPs would be denied some of the access and information afforded to other MEPs. The BNP would be subject to the &quot;same general principles governing official impartiality&quot; and they would receive &quot;standard written briefings as appropriate from time to time&quot;, but diplomats would not be &quot;proactive&quot; in dealing with the BNP MEPs and that any requests for policy briefings from them would be treated differently and on a discretionary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/09/diplomats-shun-nick-griffin-bnp-europe |title= UK diplomats shun BNP officials in Europe|accessdate=23 October 2009|location=London |first=Ian|last=Traynor|date=9 July 2009|work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the most visible and vocal opponents of the BNP and other far right-wing groups are [[Unite Against Fascism]] and ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]''. Unite Against Fascism, which aims to unite a broad spectrum of opposition to the far-right, includes the [[Anti-Nazi League]], the [[National Assembly Against Racism]] and the [[Student Assembly Against Racism]]. ''Searchlight'' has monitored the activities of far-right groups in Britain and abroad, including the BNP and its members, for many years.

Some opponents of fascism call for no coverage to be given to groups or individuals enunciating what they describe as &quot;[[hate speech]]&quot;. The &quot;[[No Platform]]&quot; stance is to deny perceived fascist hate speech any sort of publicity. The policy is most commonly associated with university student unions and debating societies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/blogs/blog/aaronporter/2010/09/14/Re-affirming-our-support-for-No-Platform/ Nusconnect.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; but has also resulted in BNP candidates being banned from speaking at various hustings meetings around the country. In 2005, the ''[[Leeds Student]]'' newspaper was criticised after publishing an interview with Nick Griffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leedstoday.net/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=39&amp;ArticleID=971585|title=Yorkshire Evening Post: BNP interview fury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, an invitation to Nick Griffin by the [[University of St Andrews]] Union Debating Society to participate in a debate on multiculturalism was withdrawn after protests.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Jackson, [http://news.scotsman.com/farrightintheuk/Universitys-invitation-to-BNP-leader.2600849.jp &quot;University's invitation to BNP leader withdrawn&quot;], ''The Scotsman'', 5 February 2005.

In May 2007, a presentation by Nick Griffin was to be held at the [[University of Bath]], but the University withdrew permission due to concerns over the large number of people opposing the meeting and possible disruption it could cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/6644117.stm|title=BBC News: University halts BNP speech plan|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, a [[Democratic Unionist Party]] councillor in [[Northern Ireland]], [[Bobby McKee]], condemned a BNP leafleting campaign in his home town of [[Larne]] opposing a refugee dentention centre being built there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/bnp-takes-hate-message-to-larne-14966990.html#ixzz18T30Vjjk BNP takes hate message to Northern Ireland] ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veterans and Second World War===
In June 2009, the [[Royal British Legion]] wrote to Griffin privately to ask him to stop wearing their poppy symbol. After he refused and wore the badge at campaign events and on the party's televised election broadcast, The Legion said in an open letter: &quot;True valour deserves respect regardless of a person's ethnic origin, and everyone who serves or has served their country deserves nothing less&amp;nbsp;... [our national chairman] appealed to your sense of honour. But you have responded by continuing to wear the poppy. So now we're no longer asking you privately. Stop it, Mr Griffin.

In September 2009, the Legion accepted a donation which it had initially rejected from BNP member Rachel Firth. Firth had spent 24 hours raising the money, half of which was given to the Legion and the other half to the BNP. The Legion said that Firth had assured them that the donation would not be exploited politically although the story was later &quot;splashed across&quot; the BNP's website. BNP spokesman Simon Darby denied that the party exploited the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8250086.stm|title=British Legion accepts BNP gift|last=Furlong|first=Ray|date=11 September 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]]'s family has criticised the BNP after the party used his image and quotes from one of his speeches in its campaign. Churchill's grandson, [[Nicholas Soames]], described the BNP as &quot;monstrous&quot; and said its use of Churchill was &quot;offensive and disgusting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8068717.stm &quot;BNP's Churchill use 'disgusting'&quot;], ''BBC News'', 26 May 2009, Retrieved on 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNP was also caught up in a dispute with 1940s singer [[Vera Lynn]] after she objected to the party selling copies of her [[(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover|White Cliffs of Dover]] CD on its website to fund its European election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/4687730/Dame-Vera-Lynn-takes-on-BNP-over-White-Cliffs-of-Dover.html &quot;Dame Vera Lynn takes on BNP over White Cliffs of Dover&quot;], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|telegraph.co.uk]]'', 18 February 2009, Retrieved on 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
