Following the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] after World War I, the five provinces that constitute modern Lebanon were [[French Mandate of Lebanon|mandated to France]]. The French expanded the borders of [[Mount Lebanon Governorate|Mount Lebanon]], which was mostly populated by [[Maronite]]s and [[Druze]], to include more Muslims.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The name ''Lebanon'' comes from the [[Semitic language|Semitic]] root ''LBN'', meaning &quot;white&quot;, likely a reference to the snow-capped [[Mount Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,621 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features and Historic Sites |last1=Room |first1=Adrian |edition=2nd |year=2005|publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7 |pages=214–216|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&amp;pg=PA214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of an early settlement in Lebanon was found in [[Byblos]], which is considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;byblos&quot; /&gt; and date back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and burial jars left by the [[Neolithic]] and [[Copper Age|Chalcolithic]] fishing communities who lived on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea over 7,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://destinationlebanon.gov.lb/eng/Byblos/History.asp |title=Archaeological Virtual Tours: Byblos |publisher=Destinationlebanon.gov.lb |accessdate=14 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080223164318/http://destinationlebanon.gov.lb/eng/Byblos/History.asp |archivedate = 23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon was a part of northern Canaan, and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants - the [[Phoenicia]]ns, a seafaring people that spread across the Mediterranean before the rise of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;About.com (1987).[http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_lebanonphoenicians.htm &quot;Lebanon in Ancient Times&quot;]. Retrieved 17 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Their most famous colonies were [[Carthage]] in today’s Tunisia and [[Cadiz]] in today’s Spain. The [[Phoenicians]] are best known as the inventors of the [[alphabet]], among many other things. After two centuries of Persian rule, [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] ruler [[Alexander the Great]] attacked and burned [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], the most prominent Phoenician city. Throughout the subsequent centuries leading up to recent times, the country became part of numerous succeeding empires, among them [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Achaemenid Assyria|Assyria]]n, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]], [[List of Muslim empires and dynasties|Arab]], [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]], [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]], the [[Crusader States|Crusader]]'s state of [[County of Tripoli]] founded by [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] that encompassed most of present day Lebanon, and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

===Ottoman Era and French mandate===
{{see also|Sidon Eyalet|Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate}}
In 1590, [[Fakhr-al-Din II]] became successor to Korkmaz. He was a skilled politician and described as a pupil of [[Machiavelli]]. Fakhr-al-Din II adjusted to the lifestyles of the Druze, Christianity and Islam, according to his needs. He paid tribute to the Sultanate of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and shared the spoils of war with his masters. Eventually, Fakhr-al-Din II was appointed Sultan of Mt. Lebanon, with full authority. He was considered one of the greatest rulers of the region, also across the Middle of Lebanon. But, his enemies and governors angered the Ottoman Sultanate. Hence, a campaign, calling for the arrest of Fakhr-al-Din II, found the deposed leader in [[Istanbul]], where he was executed by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Photographs in History&quot; (Arabic) – sixth edition 1999. P. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the Emirate of Mt. Lebanon that lasted more than 500 years was replaced, instead of the emirate meteor. Approximately 10,000 Christians [[1860 Lebanon conflict|were killed]] by the Druzes in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+lb0026) Library of Congress Country Studies: Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lebanon was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] for over 400 years, until 1918 when the area became a part of the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon|French influence]], following World War I. By the end of the war, famine had killed an estimated 100,000 people in Beirut and Mount Lebanon, about 30% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/arabunity/2008/02/2008525183842614205.html Dreaming of Greater Syria].

In the first half of 1920, Lebanese territory was claimed as part of the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]], but shortly the [[Franco-Syrian War]] resulted in Arab defeat and capitulation of the Hashemites.

On 1 September 1920, France reestablished Greater Lebanon after the Moutasarrifiya rule removed several regions belonging to the Principality of Lebanon and gave them to Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Chorbishop Seely Beggiani (2005). [http://www.stmaron.org/marhist11.html &quot;Aspects of Maronite History (Part Eleven) The twentieth century in Western Asia&quot;]. Retrieved 24 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon was a largely Christian country (mainly [[Maronites|Maronite]] territory with some [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]] enclaves) but it also included areas containing many Muslims (including [[Druze]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} On 1 September 1926, France formed the Lebanese Republic. A constitution was adopted on 25 May 1926 establishing a democratic republic with a parliamentary system of government.

===Post-independence===
Lebanon gained independence in 1943, while France was occupied by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pbs.org/behindcloseddoors/glossary.html| title =  Glossary: Cross-Channel invasion| accessdate =17 October 2009| publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
General [[Henri Dentz]], the [[Vichy]] [[High Commissioner]] for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation. The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through [[Syria]] to [[Iraq]] where they were used against British forces. The United Kingdom, fearing that [[Nazi Germany]] would gain full control of Lebanon and [[Syria]] by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon.

After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941 General [[Georges Catroux]] announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the [[Free French]] government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by throwing the new government into prison. In the face of international pressure, the French released the government officials on 22 November 1943 and recognized the independence of Lebanon.

The [[Allies of World War II|allies]] kept the region under control until the end of World War II. The last French troops withdrew in 1946. Lebanon's unwritten [[National Pact]] of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian, its [[Speaker (politics)|speaker of the parliament]] to be a [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shiite Muslim]], its prime minister be [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]], and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister be [[Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/publications/lebanons-confessionalism-problems-and-prospects|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080709034419/http://www.usip.org/pubs/usipeace_briefings/2006/0330_lebanon_confessionalism.html|archivedate=9 July 2008|title=Lebanon's Confessionalism: Problems and Prospects|last=Harb|first=Imad|date=March 2006|work=USIPeace Briefing|publisher=United States Institute of Peace|accessdate=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil (including a [[Lebanon crisis of 1958|civil conflict in 1958]]) interspersed with prosperity built on [[Beirut|Beirut's]] position as a regional center for finance and trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Studies Department of State&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35833.htm|title=Background Note: Lebanon|date=January 2009|work=Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1948, Lebanon supported neighbouring Arab countries against Israel. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against Israel, it was without the support of the Lebanese government, and Lebanese troops did not officially invade.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 524&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire, armored cars, volunteers and logistical support.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; On 5–6 June 1948, the Lebanese army captured [[Al-Malkiyya]].

Lebanon is located in Western Asia between latitudes [[33rd parallel north|33°]] and [[35th parallel north|35° N]], and longitudes [[35th meridian east|35°]] and [[37th meridian east|37° E]].

The country's surface area is {{convert|10452|sqkm}} of which {{convert|10230|sqkm}} is [[land area|land]]. Lebanon has a coastline and border of {{convert|225|km}} on the [[Mediterranean sea]] to the west, a {{convert|375|km}} border shared with [[Syria]] to the north and east and a {{convert|79|km}} long border with [[Israel]] to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;enbr&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan – Middle East: region in transition | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | author=Etheredge, Laura S; Britannica Educational Publishing | year=2011| pages=85–159| isbn=978-1-61530-414-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|border]] with the Israeli-occupied [[Golan Heights]] is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called [[Shebaa Farms]].&lt;ref&gt;Telegraph (2000) [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/1343868/Israel%27s-withdrawal-from-Lebanon-given-UN%27s-endorsement.html &quot;Israel's Withdrawal from Lebanon Given UN's Endorsement&quot;]. Retrieved 1 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon is divided into four distinct [[Physical geography|physiographic]] regions: the coastal plain, the [[Lebanon Mountains|Lebanon mountain]] range, the [[Beqaa valley]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]].
[[File:Barouk Mountain.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Mountain scenery in [[Barouk]]]]
The narrow and discontinuous [[coastal plain]] stretches from the [[Syria]]n border in the north where it widens to form the [[Akkar]] plain to [[Naqoura|Ras al-Naqoura]] at the border with Israel in the south. The fertile coastal plain is formed of marine sediments and river deposited [[alluvium]] alternating with sandy bays and rocky beaches.
The Lebanon mountains rise steeply parallel to the Mediterranean coast and form a ridge of [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] that runs for most of the country's length. The mountain range varies in width between 10&amp;nbsp;km and 56&amp;nbsp;km; it is carved by narrow and deep gorges. The Lebanon mountains peak at {{convert|3088|m}} above sea level in [[Qurnat as Sawda']] in [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] and gradually slope to the south before rising again to a height of {{convert|2695|m}} in [[Mount Sannine]].
The Beqaa valley sits between the Lebanon mountains in the west and the Anti-Lebanon range in the east; it's a part of the [[Great Rift Valley]] system. The valley is 180&amp;nbsp;km long and 10 to 26&amp;nbsp;km wide, its fertile soil is formed by alluvial deposits.
The Anti-Lebanon range runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains, its highest peak is in [[Mount Hermon]] at {{convert|2814|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;enbr&quot;/&gt;

The mountains of Lebanon are drained by [[Intermittent stream|seasonal torrents]] and [[perennial stream|rivers]] foremost of which is the {{convert|145|km}} long [[Litani river|Leontes]]  that rises in the Beqaa Valley to the west of [[Baalbek]] and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre.&lt;ref name=&quot;enbr&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Lebanon}}
[[File:P1060155 r1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Abraham River|Nahr Ibrahim]] running through the lush Adonis gorge]]
Lebanon has a moderate [[Mediterranean climate]]. In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid. In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops.&lt;ref name=&quot;enbr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Bonechi et al.)

===Law===
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
The Lebanese legal system is based on the [[Law of France|French system]], and is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (heritage, marriage, divorce, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community. For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the [[Sharia]] law.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalex&quot;/&gt; For Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims. personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the [[Roman Rota|Vatican Rota court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mallat.com/articles/T/The%20Lebanese%20Legal%20System.pdf The Lebanese Legal System - Chibli Mallat]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable set of codified laws is the [[Code des Obligations et des Contrats]] promulgated in 1932 and equivalent to the [[French Civil Code]].&lt;ref name=&quot;globalex&quot;&gt;[http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Lebanon.htm GlobaLex - The Lebanese Legal System and Research]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capital punishment]] is still used to sanction certain crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalex&quot;/&gt;

The Lebanese court system consists of three levels: courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. The Constitutional Council rules on constitutionality of laws and electoral frauds. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage and inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] | last = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | title = Arab Political Systems: Baseline Information and Reforms – Lebanon | accessdate =4 July 2009 | url = http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Lebanon_APS.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Lebanon was estimated to be 4,125,247 in July 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; however no official census has been taken since 1932 due to the sensitive [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessional political balance]] between Lebanon's various religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,COUNTRYPROF,LBN,4562d8cf2,4954ce52c,0.html Lebanon : Overview].

The culture of Lebanon is the cross culture of various civilizations over thousands of years. Originally home to the [[Phoenicia]]ns, and then subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Assyria]]ns, the [[Persia]]ns, the [[Greeks]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the Arabs, the Crusaders, the [[Ottoman Turks]] and most recently the French, Lebanese culture has over the millennia evolved by borrowing from all of these groups. Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different ethnic and religious groups, has further contributed to the country's festivals, musical styles and literature as well as cuisine.

Despite the ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they “share an almost common culture”.&lt;ref name=&quot;StokesJamie&quot;&gt;Stokes, Jamie.  ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East'', page 406&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lebanese Arabic]] is universally spoken while food, music, and literature are deep-rooted “in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms”.&lt;ref name=&quot;StokesJamie&quot; /&gt;

{{Main|Public holidays in Lebanon}}
Lebanon celebrates national and both [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] holidays. Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian Calendar and Julian Calendar.  Catholics, Protestant, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December.

Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son to God,the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura (the Shiite Day of Atonement). Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day.

Lebanon hosts about 15 concerts from international performers each year, ranking 1st for nightlife in the Middle East, and 6th worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanon-tourism.gov.lb/news/Details.aspx?NewsId=10|title=Lebanon Summer &amp; Winter Festivals|work=Lebanese Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Lebanon}}
Both summer and winter sports thrive in Lebanon because of the unique geography. In autumn and spring, for example, it is possible to go skiing in the morning and swimming in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman, David.  ''The Mirage of Peace: Understanding the Never-Ending Conflict in the Middle East'', page 48&lt;/ref&gt; At the competitive level, basketball and [[Association football|football]] are among Lebanon’s most popular sports. In recent years, Lebanon has hosted the [[AFC Asian Cup]] and the [[Pan Arab Games]].

Lebanon has six [[Skiing in Lebanon|ski resorts]], with opportunities also available for [[cross-country skiing]], [[snowshoe]]ing, and [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]]. In the summer, skilifts can be used to access hiking trails, with views stretching as far as [[Cyprus]] to the west and [[Syria]] to the east on clear days. [[Canoeing]], cycling, [[rafting]], [[climbing]], swimming, sailing and [[caving]] are among the other common leisure sports in Lebanon. Adventure and extreme sports are also possible throughout the country. The [[Beirut Marathon]] is held every fall, drawing top runners from Lebanon and abroad. Race day is promoted as a fun, family event, and it has become a tradition for many to participate in costumes or outlandish clothing.

[[Rugby league in Lebanon|Rugby league]] is a relatively new but growing sport in Lebanon. The [[Lebanon national rugby league team]] participated in the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup]], and narrowly missed qualification for the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup|2008]] and [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013]] tournaments. Lebanon also took part in the [[2009 European Cup]] where, after narrowly failing to qualify for the final, the team defeated [[Ireland national rugby league team|Ireland]] to finish 3rd in the tournament. Lebanon international [[Hazem El Masri]] holds the record as the all-time highest points scorer in Australia's [[National Rugby League]], having moved from Lebanon to Australia as a child.

The strongest sport in Lebanon is [[Basketball]] with the [[Lebanon national basketball team|Lebanese National Team]] qualifying for the [[FIBA World Championship]] 3 times in a row. Considered as one of the basketball power houses in Asia, Lebanon was able to defeat strong teams such as [[Venezuela]] and France. In [[2010 FIBA World Championship]], Lebanon defeated [[Canada national men's basketball team]] but failed to qualify to the second round. Lebanese [[Rony Seikaly]] played in the NBA for over a decade, and [[Fadi El Khatib]] is the most decorated player in the Lebanese National Basketball League.
Dominant Basketball teams in Lebanon are [[Sporting Al Riyadi Beirut]], who are the current Arab and Asian champions, [[Hekmeh|Club Sagesse]] who were able to earn the Asian and Arab championships before, along with [[Champville SC]], [[Al Mouttahed Tripoli]], and [[Hoops Club]],and [[Byblos]].

[[Football]] is also one of the more popular sports in the country with the [[Lebanese Premier League]] with its most successful clubs being [[Al-Ansar Club]] and [[Nejmeh SC]] with notable players being [[Roda Antar]] and [[Youssef Mohamad]], the first Arab to captain a European premier league team. 

Lebanon hosted the [[2009 Jeux de la Francophonie]] from 27 September to 6 October, and have participated in every [[Olympic Games]] since it's independence, winning a total of four medals.

Prominent Lebanese bodybuilders include [[Samir Bannout]], [[Mohammad Bannout]] and [[Ahmad Haidar]].

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Lebanon}}
The United Nations assigned Lebanon an education index of 0.871 in 2008. The index, which is determined by the adult literacy rate and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio, ranked the country 88th out of the 177 countries participating.&lt;ref name=undp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_LBN.html |title=Human development indicators Lebanon |accessdate=17 November 2008 |work=United Nations Development Programme, Human Development Reports}}{}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools===
All Lebanese schools are required to follow a prescribed curriculum designed by the Ministry of Education. Some of the 1400 private schools offer IB programs,&lt;ref&gt;Samidoun (2006). [http://www.samidoun.org/?q=node/812 &quot;Aid groups scramble to fix buildings; fill backpacks before school bell rings&quot;]. Retrieved 9 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and may also add more courses to their curriculum with approval from the Ministry of Education. The main subjects taught are mathematics, sciences, Arabic, and at least one secondary language (either French or English).

The government introduces a mild form of selectivity into the curriculum by giving 11th graders choice between two &quot;concentrations&quot;: sciences, humanities, and 12th graders choose between four concentrations: life sciences, general sciences, sociology and economics, and humanities and literature. The choices in concentration do not include major changes in the number of subjects taken (if at all). However, subjects that fall out of the concentration are given less weight in grading and are less rigorous, while subjects that fall within the concentration are more challenging and contribute significantly to the final grade.

Students go through three academic phases:

|students who pass official exams earn a Baccalaureate Certificate (''Baccalauréat Libanais'') in the concentration they chose in 12th grade. Students studying at French-system schools or American-system schools may also graduate with a French Baccalaureate that is considered equivalent to the Lebanese Baccalaureate. Students can also graduate with an International Baccalaureate (currently in some of the private schools).

The first eight years are, by law, compulsory.&lt;ref name=&quot;us_dos&quot; /&gt;

===Higher education===
[[File:Beirut Universitet Haigazian.jpg|thumb|[[Haigazian University]] in Beirut.]]
Following secondary school, Lebanese students may choose to study at a university, a college, or a vocational training institute. The number of years to complete each program varies. While the Lebanese educational system offers a very high quality and international class of education, the local employment market lacks sufficient opportunities, thus encouraging many of the young educated to travel abroad.

Lebanon has forty-one nationally accredited universities, several of which are internationally recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Infopro Management. [http://www.opportunities.com.lb/Lebanon/bhb/initdoc.asp?catId=21 &quot;Lebanon Opportunities – Business Information&quot;]. Retrieved 30 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ar icon}}Lebanese Directory of Higher Education. [http://web.archive.org/web/20071211044854/http://www.higher-edu.gov.lb/Marasim.html Decrees]. higher-edu.gov.lb. Retrieved 30 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American University of Beirut]] (AUB) and the [[Université Saint-Joseph]] (USJ) were the first Anglophone and the first Francophone universities to open in Lebanon, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;eIFL.net Regional Workshop (2005). [http://www.eifl.net/docs/collaborative_management_of_electronic_resources.ppt &quot;Country Report: Lebanon&quot;]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}. Retrieved 14 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Université Saint-Joseph. [http://web.archive.org/web/20060706105323/http://www.usj.edu.lb/english/history.php 125 years of history – A timeline]. Retrieved 8 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another prestigious and internationally recognized university is the [[Lebanese American University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanese American University|url=http://www.lau.edu.lb/|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities in Lebanon, both public and private, largely operate in French or English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalla10.yalla.com.lb/students/abroad/english/lebanon.html &quot;Yalla! Students&quot;]. Retrieved 15 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the English universities, students who have graduated from an American-style high school program enter at the [[freshman]] level to earn their baccalaureate equivalence from the Lebanese Ministry of Higher Education. This qualifies them to continue studying at the higher levels. Such students are required to have already taken the [[SAT I]] and the [[SAT II]] upon applying to college, in lieu of the official exams. On the other hand, students who have graduated from a school that follows the Lebanese educational system are directly admitted to the [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] year. These students are still required to take the SAT I, but not the SAT II. The university [[academic degrees]] for the first stage are the Bachelor or the [[Licentiate|Licence]], for the second stage are the Master or the [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]] and the third stage is the doctorate.

==Health==
