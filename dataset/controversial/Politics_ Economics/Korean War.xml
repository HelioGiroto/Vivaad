The '''Korean War''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 한국전쟁 or 조선전쟁, [[Hanja]]: {{linktext|韓國|戰爭}} or {{linktext|朝鮮|戰爭}}; 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953)&lt;ref name=&quot;fas.org&quot; /&gt;{{refn | name = nbArmistice Agreement | group = lower-alpha | As per armistice agreement of 1953, the opposing sides had to &quot;insure a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armistice Agreement&quot; /&gt;}} was a war between the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] and the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]].  It was primarily the result of the political [[division of Korea]] by an agreement of the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the conclusion of the [[Pacific War]] at the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. The [[Korean Peninsula]] was [[Korea under Japanese rule|ruled by the Empire of Japan]] from 1910 until the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II. Following the [[surrender of Japan|surrender of the Empire of Japan]] in September 1945, American administrators divided the peninsula along the [[Division of Korea|38th parallel]], with [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military forces]] occupying the southern half and [[Soviet military|Soviet military forces]] occupying the northern half.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boose1995&quot; /&gt; 

The failure to hold free elections throughout the Korean Peninsula in 1948 deepened the division between the two sides; the North established a communist government, while the South established a capitalist one. The 38th parallel increasingly became a political border between the two Korean states. Although reunification negotiations continued in the months preceding the war, tension intensified. Cross-border skirmishes and raids at the 38th Parallel persisted. The situation escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devine 2007 819-821&quot; /&gt; It was the first significant armed conflict of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hermes2002&quot; /&gt; In 1950 the [[Soviet Union]] boycotted the [[Soviet Union and the United Nations|United Nations security council]], in protest at representation of China by the [[Kuomintang]] / [[Republic of China]] government, which had taken refuge in [[Taiwan]] following defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In the absence of a dissenting voice from the Soviet Union, who could have vetoed it, the United States and other countries passed a security council resolution authorizing military intervention in Korea.

The United States of America provided 88% of the 341,000 international soldiers which aided South Korean forces in repelling the invasion, with twenty other countries of the United Nations offering assistance. Suffering severe casualties, within two months the defenders were pushed back to a small area in the south of the [[Korean Peninsula]], known as the [[Pusan perimeter]]. A rapid U.N. counter-offensive then drove the North Koreans past the 38th Parallel and almost to the [[Yalu River]], when the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) entered the war on the side of North Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devine 2007 819-821&quot; /&gt; Chinese intervention forced the Southern-allied forces to retreat behind the 38th Parallel. While not directly committing forces to the conflict, the Soviet Union provided material aid to both the North Korean and Chinese armies. The active stage of the war ended on 27&amp;nbsp;July 1953, when the armistice agreement was signed. The agreement restored the border between the Koreas near the 38th Parallel and created the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ), a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide fortified buffer zone between the two Korean nations. Minor outbreaks of fighting continue to the present day.

With both North Korea and South Korea sponsored by external powers, the Korean War was a [[proxy war]]. From a [[military science]] perspective, it combined strategies and tactics of World War&amp;nbsp;I and World War&amp;nbsp;II: it began with a mobile campaign of swift [[infantry]] attacks followed by air [[tactical bombing|bombing]] raids, but became a static [[trench warfare|trench war]] by July 1951.

== Background ==

=== Terminology ===

In the United States of America, the war was initially described by President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a &quot;[[police action]]&quot; as it was conducted under the auspices of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman1950&quot; /&gt; Colloquially, it has been referred to in the United States as ''&quot;The Forgotten War&quot;'' or ''&quot;The Unknown War&quot;'' because of the lack of public attention it received both during and after the war, and in relation to the global scale of [[World War II]] and the subsequent angst of the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Naval Historical Center&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p= 2}}

In South Korea the war is usually referred to as &quot;625&quot; or the ''6–2–5 Upheaval'' (''yug-i-o dongnan''), reflecting the date of its commencement on 25&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoare1999&quot; /&gt;

In North Korea the war is officially referred to as the ''Fatherland Liberation War'' (''Choguk haebang chǒnjaeng'') or alternatively the ''&quot;[[Names of Korea#Korea|Chosǒn]] War&quot;'' (''Chosǒn chǒnjaeng'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim2003&quot; /&gt; In the People's Republic of China the war is officially called the ''War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea'' ({{zh| t = 抗美援朝戰爭| s = 抗美援朝战争| p = Kàngměiyuáncháo zhànzhēng}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;CRI2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Xinhua2000&quot; /&gt; although the term ''&quot;[[Names of Korea#Chinese-speaking areas|Chaoxian]] War&quot;'' ({{zh|t=朝鮮戰爭|s=朝鲜战争|p= Cháoxiǎn zhànzhēng}}) is also used in unofficially.

=== Japanese rule (1910–1945) ===
{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}

Upon defeating the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–96), the [[Empire of Japan]] occupied the [[Korean Empire]] – a peninsula strategic to its [[hegemony|sphere of influence]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=}} A decade later, defeating [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05), Japan made Korea its [[protectorate]] with the [[Eulsa Treaty]] in 1905, then annexed it with the [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty]] in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel1972&quot; /&gt;

[[Korean nationalism|Korean nationalists]] and the [[intelligentsia]] fled the country, and some founded the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea|Provisional Korean Government]] in 1919, which was headed by [[Syngman Rhee]] in Shanghai. This government-in-exile was recognized by few countries. From 1919 to 1925 and beyond, Korean communists led and were the primary agents of internal and external warfare against the Japanese.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=23}}{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|p=516}}

[[Korea under Japanese rule]] was considered to be part of the Empire of Japan as an industrialized [[colony]] along with [[Taiwan]], and both were part of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. In 1937, the colonial Governor-General, General [[Jirō Minami]], commanded the attempted [[cultural assimilation]] of Korea's 23.5&amp;nbsp;million people by banning the use and study of Korean language, literature, and culture, to be replaced with that of mandatory use and study of their Japanese counterparts. Starting in 1939, the populace was required to use Japanese names under the [[Sōshi-kaimei]] policy. In 1938, the Colonial Government established labor conscription.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In China, the Nationalist [[National Revolutionary Army]] and the Communist [[People's Liberation Army]] helped organize refugee Korean patriots and independence fighters against the Japanese military, which had also occupied parts of China. The Nationalist-backed Koreans, led by Yi Pom-Sok, fought in the [[Burma Campaign]] (December 1941 – August 1945). The Communists, led by [[Kim Il-sung]], fought the Japanese in Korea and Manchuria.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

During World War II, the Japanese used Korea's food, livestock, and metals for their [[war effort]]. Japanese forces in Korea increased from 46,000 soldiers in 1941 to 300,000 in 1945. Japanese Korea conscripted 2.6&amp;nbsp;million forced laborers controlled with a [[collaborationism|collaborationist]] Korean police force; some 723,000 people were sent to work in the overseas empire and in metropolitan Japan. By 1942, Korean men were being conscripted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. By January 1945, Koreans comprised 32% of Japan's labor force. In August 1945, when the United States dropped [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], around 25% of those killed were Koreans.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|p=516}} At the end of the war, other world powers did not recognize Japanese rule in Korea and Taiwan.

Meanwhile, at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] (November 1943), the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], the United Kingdom, and the United States decided &quot;in due course Korea shall become free and independent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early1943&quot; /&gt; Later, the [[Yalta Conference]] (February 1945) granted to the [[Soviet Union]] European &quot;buffer zones&quot;—[[satellite state]]s accountable to Moscow—as well as an expected Soviet pre-eminence in China and [[Manchuria]], in return for joining the Allied [[Pacific War]] effort against Japan.{{sfn|Goulden|1983|p=17}}

=== Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945) ===
{{Main|Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945)}}

As agreed with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the [[Tehran Conference]] (November 1943) and the [[Yalta Conference]] (February 1945), the Soviet Union declared war against Japan within three months of the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the war in Europe]], on 9 August 1945.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|p=516}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Whelan1991&quot; /&gt; By 10 August, the [[Red Army]] occupied the northern part of the Korean peninsula as agreed, and on 26 August halted at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] for three weeks to await the arrival of US forces in the south.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=24, 25}}

On 10 August 1945, with the 15 August [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] near, the Americans doubted whether the Soviets would honor their part of the Joint Commission, the US-sponsored Korean occupation agreement. A month earlier, Colonel [[Dean Rusk]] and Colonel [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] divided the Korean peninsula at the 38th parallel after hurriedly deciding that the US Korean Zone of Occupation had to have a minimum of two ports.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCullough1992&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;McCune1946&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grajdanzev1945&quot; /&gt;

Explaining why the occupation zone demarcation was positioned at the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, &quot;even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by US forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement ... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops&quot;, especially when &quot;faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area.&quot;{{sfn|Goulden|1983|p=17}} The Soviets agreed to the US occupation zone demarcation to improve their negotiating position regarding the occupation zones in Eastern Europe, and because each would accept Japanese surrender where they stood.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=25}}

=== Chinese Civil War (1945–1949) ===
{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}

After the end of [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Chinese Civil War]] resumed between the Chinese Communists and the Chinese Nationalists. While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with [[wiktionary:materiel|materiel]] and manpower.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=110}} According to Chinese sources, the North Koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of material while thousands of Korean &quot;volunteers&quot; served in the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) during the war.{{sfn|Chen|1994|pp=110–111}} North Korea also provided the Chinese Communists in Manchuria with a safe refuge for non-combatants and communications with the rest of China.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=110}}

The North Korean contributions to the Chinese Communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 to 70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they would later play a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=110}} China promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=111}} The Chinese support created a deep division between the Korean Communists, and Kim Il-Sung's authority within the Communist party was challenged by the Chinese faction led by Pak Il-yu, who was later purged by Kim.{{sfn|Chen|1994|pp=110, 162}}

After the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government named the Western nations, led by the United States, as the biggest threat to its national security.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=26}} Basing this judgment on China's [[century of humiliation]] beginning in the early 19th century,{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=22}} American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War,{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=41}} and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries,{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=21}} the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism.{{sfn|Chen|1994|p=19}} As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery.{{sfn|Chen|1994|pp=25–26, 93}}

=== Korea divided (1945–1949) ===
{{See also|Division of Korea}}

At the [[Potsdam Conference]] (July–August 1945), the Allies unilaterally decided to divide Korea—without consulting the Koreans—in contradiction of the Cairo Conference.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=24}}{{sfn|Appleman|1998|pp=24–5}}{{sfn|Cumings|1981|p=25}}{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=52}}

On 8 September 1945, Lt. Gen. [[John R. Hodge]] of the United States arrived in [[Incheon]] to accept the Japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}} Appointed as military governor, General Hodge directly controlled South Korea as head of the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] (USAMGIK 1945–48).{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p= 63}} He established control by restoring to power the key Japanese colonial administrators and their Korean police collaborators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hermes2002&quot; /&gt; The USAMGIK refused to recognise the provisional government of the short-lived [[People's Republic of Korea]] (PRK) because he suspected it was communist. These policies, voiding popular Korean sovereignty, provoked civil insurrections and guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel1972&quot; /&gt; On 3 September 1945, Lieutenant General Yoshio Kozuki, Commander, [[Japanese Seventeenth Area Army]], contacted Hodge, telling him that the Soviets were south of the 38th parallel at [[Kaesong]]. Hodge trusted the accuracy of the Japanese Army report{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}}

In December 1945, Korea was administered by a United States–Soviet Union Joint Commission, as agreed at the [[Moscow Conference (1945)]]. The Koreans were excluded from the talks. The commission decided the country would become independent after a five-year trusteeship action facilitated by each régime sharing its sponsor's ideology.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=25–26}}{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=53}} The Korean populace revolted; in the south, some protested, and some rose in arms;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel1972&quot; /&gt; to contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December 1945 and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People's Committees on 12 December 1945.

On 23 September 1946 an 8,000-strong railroad worker strike began in [[Busan|Pusan]]. Civil disorder spread throughout the country in what became known as the [[Autumn Uprising of 1946|Autumn uprising]]. On 1 October 1946, Korean police killed three students in the Daegu Uprising; protesters counter-attacked, killing 38 policemen. On 3 October, some 10,000 people attacked the [[Yeongcheon]] police station, killing three policemen and injuring some 40 more; elsewhere, some 20 landlords and pro-Japanese South Korean officials were killed.{{sfn|Cumings|1981|loc=chapter 3, 4}} The USAMGIK declared [[martial law]].

The [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Representative Democratic Council]], led by nationalist [[Syngman Rhee]], opposed the Soviet–American trusteeship of Korea, arguing that after 35 years (1910–45) of Japanese colonial rule most Koreans opposed another foreign occupation. The USAMGIK decided to forego the five-year trusteeship agreed upon in Moscow, given the 31 March 1948 United Nations election deadline to achieve an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] civil government in the US Korean Zone of Occupation.

On 3 April what began as a demonstration commemorating Korean resistance to Japanese rule ended with the [[Jeju Uprising]] where between 14,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Blowback&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Chalmers | last = Johnson| authorlink = Chalmers Johnson| title = Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire|edition= 2000, rev. 2004|pages= 99–101 | publisher = Owl Book| isbn= 0-8050-6239-4}}  According to Chalmers Johnson, death toll is 14,000-30,000&lt;/ref&gt; and 60,000 citizens were killed by South Korean soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek2000&quot; /&gt;

On 10 May, South Korea convoked its [[South Korean general election, 1948|first national general elections]] that the Soviets first opposed, then boycotted, insisting that the US honor the trusteeship agreed to at the Moscow Conference.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=26}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Time1946&quot; /&gt;

North Korea held [[North Korean parliamentary election, 1948|parliamentary elections]] three months later on 25 August 1948.{{sfn|Malkasian|2001|p=13}}

The resultant anti-communist South Korean government promulgated a national political constitution on 17 July 1948, elected a president, the American-educated [[strongman (politics)|strongman]] Syngman Rhee on 20 July 1948. The elections were marred by terrorism and sabotage resulting in 600 deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stueck2004&quot; /&gt; The Republic of Korea (South Korea) was established on 15 August 1948. In the Russian Korean Zone of Occupation, the Soviet Union established a Communist North Korean government{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=26}} led by [[Kim Il-sung]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMH&quot; /&gt; President Rhee's régime expelled communists and [[Left-wing politics|leftists]] from southern national politics. Disenfranchised, they headed for the hills, to prepare for guerrilla war against the US-sponsored ROK Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMH&quot; /&gt;

As [[Korean nationalism|nationalists]], both Syngman Rhee and Kim Il-Sung were intent upon reunifying Korea under their own political system.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=27}} With [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] fighting over the control of the Korean Peninsula,&lt;ref name=&quot;VoA2010&quot; /&gt; the North Koreans gained support from both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. They escalated the continual border skirmishes and raids and then prepared to invade. South Korea, with limited [[matériel]], could not match them.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=27}} During this era, the US government assumed that all communists (regardless of nationality) were controlled or directly influenced by Moscow; thus the US portrayed the civil war in Korea as a Soviet [[hegemony|hegemonic]] maneuver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wainstock1999&quot; /&gt;

In October 1948, South Korean left-wing soldiers rebelled against the government's harsh clampdown in April on [[Jeju island]] in the [[Yeosu-Suncheon Rebellion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HankyorehJanuary2009&quot; /&gt;

The Soviet Union withdrew as agreed from Korea in 1948. U.S. troops withdrew from Korea in 1949, leaving the South Korean army relatively ill-equipped. On 24 December 1949, South Korean forces killed 86 to 88 people in the [[Mungyeong massacre]] and blamed the crime on communist marauding bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chosun2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OhMyNews2009&quot; /&gt;

== Course of the war ==

=== The conflict begins (June 1950) ===
[[File:Korean war 1950-1953.gif|thumb|Territory often changed hands early in the war, until the front stabilized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#d45444&quot;&gt;North Korean, Chinese and Communist forces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#4cd444&quot;&gt;South Korean, US and United Nations forces&lt;/span&gt;]]

In April 1950 Kim Il-sung travelled to Moscow and secured Stalin's support for a policy to unify Korea under his authority. Although agreeing with the invasion of South Korea in principle, Stalin refused to become directly involved in Kim's plans, and advised Kim to enlist Chinese support instead. In May 1950 Kim visited Beijing, and succeeded in gaining Mao's endorsement. At the time, Mao's support for Kim was largely political (he was contemplating the invasions of Taiwan and Tibet), and was unaware of Kim's precise intentions or the timing of Kim's attack. When the Korean war broke out, the Chinese were in the process of demobilizing half of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]]'s 5.6&amp;nbsp;million soldiers.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=139–140}}  Stalin created &quot;detailed [war] plans&quot; that were communicated to the North Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;David Dallin, ''Soviet Foreign Policy After Stalin'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1961), p60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas J.

On 7 June 1950, Kim Il-sung called for an election in whole Korea on 5–8 August 1950 and a consultative conference in [[Haeju]] on 15–17 June 1950. On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South, who were later arrested by the South. Fourteen days later on 25 June 1950, the North [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) crossed the 38th parallel border and invaded South Korea.

Under the guise of counter-attacking a South Korean provocation raid, the KPA crossed the 38th parallel behind artillery fire at dawn on Sunday 25 June 1950.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=14}} The KPA said that [[Republic of Korea Army]] (ROK Army) troops, under command of the régime of the &quot;bandit traitor [[Syngman Rhee]]&quot;, had crossed the border first, and that they would arrest and execute Rhee.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}} Both Korean armies had continually harassed each other with skirmishes and each continually staged raids across the 38th parallel border.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

On 27 June, Rhee evacuated from [[Seoul]] with government officials. Rhee ordered the [[Bodo League massacre]] on 28 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chosun2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HankyorehJune2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OhMyNews2007&quot; /&gt;

On 28 June, South Korea bombed the bridge across [[Hangang Bridge bombing|the Han River]] to stop the North Korean army.&lt;ref name=&quot;ci010629&quot; /&gt; However, Seoul  fell that same day.

Early on in the fighting, South Korea put its forces under the authority of the [[United Nations Command (Korea)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot; /&gt;

==== Factors in U.S. intervention ====

The Truman Administration was caught at a crossroads. Before the invasion, Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by Secretary of State Acheson.{{sfn|Kim|1973|p=30}} Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia. At the same time, the Administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved as well.

One facet of the changing attitude toward Korea and whether to get involved was Japan. Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, &quot;...Japan itself increasingly appeared as the major East Asian prize to be protected&quot;. U.S. East Asian experts saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region. While there was no United States policy that dealt with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan pushed South Korea to the fore. &quot;The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman's decision to intervene... The essential point... is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of US policy toward Japan.&quot;{{sfn|Kim|1973|p=46}} The United States wanted to shore up Japan to make it a viable counterweight against the Soviet Union and China, and Korea was seen as integral to that end.
[[File:South Korean refugees mid-1950.jpg|thumb|Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans fled south in mid-1950 after the North Korean army invaded.]]
The other important part of committing to intervention lay in speculation about Soviet action in the event that the United States intervene. The Truman administration was fretful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the U.S. committed in Korea. At the same time, &quot;[t]here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [the conflict]&quot;.{{sfn|Rees|1964|p=22}} In Truman's mind, this aggression, if left unchecked, would start a chain reaction that would destroy the United Nations and give the go ahead to further Communist aggression elsewhere. Korea was where a stand had to be made, the difficult part was how. The UN Security council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans and the US immediately began using air and naval forces in the area to that end. The Administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisors believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone.{{sfn|Rees|1964|p=23}} 

Also, it was still uncertain if this was a clever ploy by the Soviet Union to catch the U.S. unawares or just a test of U.S. resolve. The decision to commit ground troops and to intervene eventually became viable when a communiqué was received on 27 June from the Soviet Union that alluded it would not move against U.S. forces in Korea. &quot;This opened the way for the sending of American ground forces, for it now seemed less likely that a general war—with Korea as a preliminary diversion—was imminent&quot;.{{sfn|Rees|1964|p=26}} With the Soviet Union's tacit agreement that this would not cause an escalation, the United States now could intervene with confidence that other commitments would not be jeopardized.

==== United Nations Security Council Resolutions ====

On 25 June 1950, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea, with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 82]]. The Soviet Union, a [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto-wielding power]], had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), not the People's Republic of China, [[China and the United Nations|held a permanent seat]] in the UN Security Council.{{sfn|Malkasian|2001|p=16}} After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 83|Resolution 83]] recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] ordered U.S. air and sea forces to help the South Korean régime. On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the U.S. of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gromyko1950&quot; /&gt;

The Soviet Union challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons. The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from U.S. Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the Korean conflict was beyond UN Charter scope, because the initial north–south border fighting was classed as a civil war. The Soviet representative boycotted the UN to prevent Security Council action, and to challenge the legitimacy of the UN action; legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of the five permanent members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gross1951&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schick1950&quot; /&gt;

==== Comparison of military forces ====
[[File:Lackland recruits Korean War 1951.jpg|thumb|In early 1951 USAF recruits arrived by the train load, more than doubling the population of [[Lackland AFB]].]]

By mid-1950 North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them [[Kaesong]], [[Chuncheon]], [[Uijeongbu]], and [[Ongjin, South Hwanghae|Ongjin]]. Their forces included 274 [[T-34|T-34-85]] tanks, some 150 [[Yakovlev|Yak]] fighters, 110 attack bombers, 200 artillery pieces, 78 Yak trainers, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}} In addition to the invasion force, the North Korean KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}} Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North Korean and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their in-country armies.

In contrast, the ROK Army defenders were vastly unprepared, and the political establishment in the south, while well aware of the threat to the north, were unable to convince American administrators of the reality of the threat. In ''South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu'' (1961), R.E. Appleman reports the ROK forces' low combat readiness as of 25 June 1950. The ROK Army had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the US military, but requests were denied), and a 22–piece air force comprising 12 [[Liaison aircraft|liaison-type]] and 10 [[T-6 Texan|AT6]] advanced-trainer airplanes. There were no large foreign military garrisons in Korea at invasion time, but there were large US garrisons and air forces in Japan.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}}

Within days of the invasion, masses of ROK Army soldiers—of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee régime—were either retreating southwards or were [[Defection|defecting]] en masse to the northern side, the KPA.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=23}}

[[File:KoreanWarFallenSoldier1.jpg|thumb|A GI comforts a grieving infantryman.]]
Despite the rapid post–Second World War Allied demobilizations, there were substantial U.S. forces occupying Japan; under General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s command, they could be made ready to fight the North Koreans.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=42}} Only the [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea|British Commonwealth]] had comparable forces in the area.

On Saturday, 24 June 1950, U.S. Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] informed President Truman by telephone, &quot;Mr. President, I have very serious news. The North Koreans have invaded South Korea.&quot;{{sfn|Goulden|1983|p=48}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess2001&quot; /&gt; Truman and Acheson discussed a U.S. invasion response with defense department principals, who agreed that the United States was obligated to repel military aggression, paralleling it with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s aggressions in the 1930s, and said that the mistake of [[appeasement]] must not be repeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graebner1979&quot; /&gt; In his autobiography, President Truman acknowledged that fighting the invasion was essential to the American goal of the global [[containment]] of communism as outlined in the [[NSC-68|National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68)]] (declassified in 1975):

{{quote|Communism was acting in Korea, just as Hitler, Mussolini and the Japanese had ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall Communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores. If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threat and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman1980&quot; /&gt;}}

President Truman announced that the U.S. would counter &quot;unprovoked aggression&quot; and &quot;vigorously support the effort of the [UN] security council to terminate this serious breach of peace.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess2001&quot; /&gt; In Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General [[Omar Bradley]] warned against appeasement, saying that Korea was the place &quot;for drawing the line&quot; against communist expansion. In August 1950, the President and the Secretary of State obtained the consent of Congress to appropriate $12&amp;nbsp;billion to pay for the military expenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess2001&quot; /&gt;

Acting on State Secretary Acheson's recommendation, President Truman ordered General MacArthur to transfer matériel to the Army of the Republic of Korea while giving air cover to the evacuation of U.S. nationals. The President disagreed with advisors who recommended unilateral U.S. bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US Seventh Fleet]] to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Government]] asked to fight in Korea. The U.S. denied the Nationalist Chinese request for combat, lest it provoke a communist Chinese retaliation.{{sfn|Rees|1964 | page = 27}} Because the U.S. had sent the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] to &quot;neutralize&quot; the [[Taiwan Strait]], Chinese premier Zhou Enlai criticized both the UN and U.S. initiatives as &quot;armed aggression on Chinese territory.&quot;{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=140}}

The [[Battle of Osan]], the first significant American engagement of the Korean War, involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith, which was a small forward element of the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=45}} On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the North Koreans at [[Osan]] but without weapons capable of destroying the North Koreans' tanks. They were unsuccessful; the result was 180 dead, wounded, or taken prisoner. The KPA progressed southwards, pushing back the US force at [[Battle of Pyongtaek|Pyongtaek]], [[Battle of Chonan|Chonan]], and [[Battle of Chochiwon|Chochiwon]], forcing the 24th Division's retreat to [[Daejeon|Taejeon]], which the KPA captured in the [[Battle of Taejon]];{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=48}} the 24th Division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured, including the Division's Commander, Major General [[William F. Dean]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=48}} Overhead, the KPAF shot down 18 USAF fighters and 29 bombers; the USAF shot down five KPAF fighters.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

By August, the KPA had pushed back the ROK Army and the [[Eighth United States Army]] to the vicinity of Pusan, in southeast Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=53}} In their southward advance, the KPA purged the Republic of Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=56}} On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung that he was responsible for the KPA's atrocities.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p= 56}} By September, the UN Command controlled the Pusan perimeter, enclosing about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the [[Nakdong River]].

Although Kim's early successes had led him to predict that he would end the war by the end of August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. To counter the possibility of American invasion, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of [[Gao Gang]]. Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea. Lei concluded that [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] would most likely attempt a landing at [[Incheon]]. After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur's most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei's findings, and issued orders to Chinese army commanders deployed on the Korean border to prepare for American naval activity in the [[Korea Strait]].{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=141}}

=== Escalation (August – September 1950) ===
[[File:Korean War, train attack.jpg|left|thumb|The [[U.S. Air Force]] attacking railroads south of [[Wonsan]] on the eastern coast of North Korea.]]

In the resulting [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] (August–September 1950), the U.S. Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at [[Battle of Naktong Bulge|the Naktong Bulge]], [[Battle of P'ohang-dong|P'ohang-dong]], and [[Battle of Taegu|Taegu]]. The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support [[sortie]]s that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic. KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=47–48, 66}}To deny materiel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the U.S. Navy air forces attacked transport hubs. Consequently, the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=58}}

Meanwhile, U.S. garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and matériel to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=59–60}} Tank battalions deployed to Korea directly from the United States mainland from the port of San Francisco to the port of [[Pusan]], the largest Korean port. By late August, the Pusan Perimeter had some 500 medium tanks battle-ready.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=61}} In early September 1950, ROK Army and UN Command forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers. The UN forces, once prepared, counterattacked and broke out of the Pusan Perimeter.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p= }}{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=61}}

=== Battle of Inchon (September 1950) ===
{{Main|Battle of Inchon}}
[[File:IncheonLandingMcArthur.jpg|thumb|General [[Douglas MacArthur]], UN Command CiC (seated), observes the naval shelling of Incheon from the [[USS Mount McKinley (AGC-7)|USS ''Mt. McKinley'']], 15 September 1950.]]

Against the rested and re-armed Pusan Perimeter defenders and their reinforcements, the KPA were undermanned and poorly supplied; unlike the UN Command, they lacked naval and air support.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=58, 61}} To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, General MacArthur recommended an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] at [[Incheon|Inchon]] (now known as Incheon), well over {{convert|100|mi|km}} behind the KPA lines.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=67}} On 6 July, he ordered Major General [[Hobart R. Gay]], Commander, [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], to plan the division's amphibious landing at Incheon; on 12–14 July, the 1st Cavalry Division embarked from [[Yokohama]], Japan to reinforce the 24th Infantry Division inside the Pusan Perimeter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalry Outpost Publications&quot; /&gt;

Soon after the war began, General MacArthur had begun planning a landing at Incheon, but [[the Pentagon]] opposed him.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=67}} When authorized, he activated a combined United States Army, United States Marine Corps, and ROK Army force. The [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]], led by General [[Edward Almond]], Commander, consisted of 40,000 men of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and around 8,600 ROK Army soldiers.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=68}} By 15 September attack date, the amphibious assault force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, [[psychological warfare]], [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle. However, the bombardment destroyed most of the city of Incheon.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=70}}

After the Incheon landing the 1st Cavalry Division began its northward advance from the Pusan Perimeter. &quot;Task Force Lynch&quot;—3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and two 70th Tank Battalion units (Charlie Company and the Intelligence–Reconnaissance Platoon)— effected the &quot;Pusan Perimeter Breakout&quot; through {{convert|106.4|mi}} of enemy territory to join the 7th Infantry Division at Osan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalry Outpost Publications&quot; /&gt; The X Corps rapidly defeated the KPA defenders around Seoul, thus threatening to trap the main KPA force in Southern Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=71–72}}

On 18 September Stalin dispatched General [[Matvei Zakharov|H.M. Zakharov]] to Korea to advise Kim Il-sung to halt his offensive around the Pusan perimeter and to redeploy his forces to defend Seoul. Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans. As the overall commander of Chinese forces, Zhou Enlai suggested that the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the enemy forces at Inchon only if they had reserves of at least 100,000 men; otherwise, he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=143}}

On 25 September Seoul was recaptured by South Korean forces. American air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA, destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery. North Korean troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=143}} During the general retreat only 25,000 to 30,000 soldiers managed to rejoin the Northern KPA lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KIMH&quot; /&gt; On 27 September Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=143}}

On 27 September, MacArthur received the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him that operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if &quot;at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weintraub2000&quot; /&gt; On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=143}} On 30 September, Defense Secretary [[George Marshall]] sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur: &quot;We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weintraub2000&quot; /&gt; During October, the ROK police [[Goyang Geumjeong Cave Massacre|executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea]],&lt;ref name=Hankyoreh100209&gt;{{cite news

On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the United States that it was prepared to intervene in Korea if the United States crossed the 38th parallel. Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's [[Encirclement Campaigns]] in the 1930s. North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=143–144}}

By 1 October 1950, the UN Command repelled the KPA northwards, past the 38th parallel; the ROK Army crossed after them, into North Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=79–94}} MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA's unconditional surrender.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=144}} Six days later, on 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=81}} The X Corps landed at [[Wonsan]] (in southeastern North Korea) and [[Riwon]] (in northeastern North Korea), already captured by ROK forces.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=87–88}} The Eighth United States Army and the ROK Army drove up western Korea and captured [[Pyongyang]] city, the North Korean capital, on 19 October 1950.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=90}} The [[187th Infantry Regiment (United States)|187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team]] (&quot;Rakkasans&quot;) made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at [[Sunchon, North Korea|Sunchon]] and [[Sukchon]]. The missions of the 187th were to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from [[Pyongyang]]; and to rescue American [[prisoners of war]]. At month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war.

Taking advantage of the UN Command's strategic momentum against the communists, General MacArthur believed it necessary to extend the Korean War into China to destroy depots supplying the North Korean war effort. President Truman disagreed, and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=83}}

=== China intervenes (October – December 1950) ===
[[File:China Crosses Yalu.jpg|thumb|Chinese forces cross the Yalu River.]]

On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] to the [[Taiwan Strait]], to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC).&lt;ref name=1950-US-DoD&gt;{{Cite journal|author=US Department of Defense |title=Classified Teletype Conference, dated 27 June 1950, between the Pentagon and General Douglas MacArthur regarding authorization to use naval and air forces in support of South Korea.

On 20 August 1950, Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] informed the United Nations that &quot;Korea is China's neighbor... The Chinese people cannot but be concerned about a solution of the Korean question&quot;. Thus, through neutral-country diplomats, China warned that in safeguarding Chinese [[national security]], they would intervene against the UN Command in Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=83}} President Truman interpreted the communication as &quot;a bald attempt to blackmail the UN&quot;, and dismissed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Offner2002&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Korean War aces.jpg|thumb|190px|Korean War [[flying aces]],1950]]
1 October 1950, the day that UN troops crossed the 38th parallel, was also the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. On that day the Soviet ambassador forwarded a telegram from Stalin to Mao and Zhou requesting that China send five to six divisions into Korea, and Kim Il-sung sent frantic appeals to Mao for Chinese military intervention. At the same time, Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces themselves would not directly intervene.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=144}}

In a series of emergency meetings that lasted from 2–5 October, Chinese leaders debated whether to send Chinese troops into Korea. There was considerable resistance among many leaders, including senior military leaders, to confronting the United States in Korea. Mao strongly supported intervention, and Zhou was one of the few Chinese leaders who firmly supported him. After General [[Lin Biao]] refused Mao's offer to command Chinese forces in Korea (citing poor health), Mao called General [[Peng Dehuai]] to Beijing to hear his views. After listening to both sides' arguments, Peng supported Mao's position, and the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=144–146}} Later, the Chinese claimed that US bombers had violated PRC national airspace while en route to bomb North Korea ''before'' China intervened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weng1966&quot; /&gt; On 8 October 1950, Mao Zedong redesignated the PLA North East Frontier Force as the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] (PVA).&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy2000&quot; /&gt;

In order to enlist Stalin's support, Zhou traveled to Stalin's summer resort on the [[Black Sea]] on 10 October. Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time. Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=146, 149}} Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p=361}} Soviet shipments of matériel, when they did arrive, were limited to small quantities of trucks, grenades, machine guns, and the like.{{sfn|Cumings|2005|p=266}}

Immediately on his return to Beijing on 18 October 1950, Zhou met with Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Gao Gang, and the group ordered two hundred thousand Chinese troops to enter North Korea, which they did on 25 October. After consulting with Stalin, on 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou the overall commander and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander. Orders given by Zhou were delivered in the name of the Central Military Commission.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=147–148}}

UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]] discipline minimized aerial detection.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=102}} The PVA marched &quot;dark-to-dark&quot; (19:00–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away;{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=102}} PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-[[division (military)|division]] army to march the {{convert|286| mi}} from An-tung, Manchuria to the combat zone in some 19 days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging {{convert|18|mi}} daily for 18 days.{{sfn|Appleman|1998|p=}}

Meanwhile, on 10 October 1950, the 89th Tank Battalion was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division, increasing the armor available for the Northern Offensive. On 15 October, after moderate KPA resistance, the 7th Cavalry Regiment and Charlie Company, 70th Tank Battalion captured Namchonjam city. On 17 October, they flanked rightwards, away from the principal road (to Pyongyang), to capture [[Hwangju]]. Two days later, the 1st Cavalry Division captured Pyongyang, the North's capital city, on 19 October 1950.

On 15 October 1950, President Truman and General MacArthur met at [[Wake Island]] in the mid-Pacific Ocean. This meeting was much publicized because of the General's discourteous refusal to meet the President on the continental US.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=88}} To President Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea,{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=89}} and that the PRC's opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed. He believed the PRC had some 300,000 soldiers in Manchuria, and some 100,000–125,000 soldiers at the Yalu River. He further concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, &quot;if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter&quot; without air force protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donovan1996&quot; /&gt;  

After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the '''First Phase Offensive''' on 25 October, attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border. This military decision made by China solely changed the attitude of the Soviet Union. After 12 days of Chinese troops entering the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China.&lt;ref&gt;Shen Zhihua, China and the Dispatch of the Soviet Air Force: The Formation of the Chinese-Soviet-Korean Alliance in the Early Stage of the Korean WarThe Journal of Strategic Studies, vol. 33, no.2, pp. 211-230&lt;/ref&gt; After decimating the ROK [[II Corps (South Korea)|II Corps]] at the [[Battle of Onjong]], the first confrontation between Chinese and US military occurred on 1 November 1950; deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army [[encirclement|encircled]] and attacked the US [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry Regiment]] with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the [[Battle of Unsan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart&quot; /&gt; The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the [[Ch'ongch'on River]], while the Chinese unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory. It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow-up their victory.

The UN Command, however, were unconvinced that the Chinese had openly intervened due to the sudden Chinese withdrawal. On 24 November, the '''Home-by-Christmas Offensive''' was launched with the US Eighth Army advancing in northwest Korea, while the US X Corps were attacking along the Korean east coast. But the Chinese were waiting in ambush with their '''Second Phase Offensive'''.

On 25 November at the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River]], and then decimated the US [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] on the UN forces' right flank.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=98–99}} The UN Command retreated; the US Eighth Army's retreat (the longest in US Army history)&lt;ref name=&quot;CohenGooch2006&quot; /&gt; was made possible because of the [[Turkish Brigade]]'s successful, but very costly, rear-guard [[Battle of Wawon|delaying action near Kunuri]] that slowed the PVA attack for two days (27–9 November). On 27 November at the Korean eastern front, a US [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] Regimental Combat Team (3,000 soldiers) and the US [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] (12,000–15,000 marines) were unprepared for the PVA 9th Army Group's three-pronged encirclement tactics at the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]], but they managed to escape under Air Force and X Corps support fire—albeit with some 15,000 collective casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins1986&quot; /&gt;

By 30 November, the PVA 13th Army Group managed to expel the US Eighth Army from northwest Korea.

=== Fighting around the 38th parallel (January – June 1951) ===

With Lieutenant-General [[Matthew Ridgway]] assuming the command of the U.S. Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their '''Third Phase Offensive''' (also known as the &quot;Chinese New Year's Offensive&quot;) on New Year's Eve of 1950. Utilizing night attacks in which U.N. Command fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy. UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic, and as a result some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=117}} The Chinese New Year's Offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to [[Third Battle of Seoul|conquer Seoul]] for the second time on 4 January 1951.
[[File:Korean War bombing Wonsan.jpg|thumb|[[A-26 Invader|B-26 Invaders]] bomb logistics depots in Wonsan, North Korea, 1951]]
These setbacks prompted General MacArthur to consider using [[nuclear weapon]]s against the Chinese or North Korean interiors, with the intention that radioactive fallout zones would interrupt the Chinese supply chains.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacArthur&quot; /&gt; However, upon the arrival of the charismatic General Ridgway, the ''esprit de corps'' of the bloodied Eighth Army immediately began to revive.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=113}}

U.N. forces retreated to [[Suwon]] in the west, [[Wonju]] in the center, and the territory north of [[Samcheok]] in the east, where the battlefront stabilized and held.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=117}} The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond Seoul as {{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=118}} food, ammunition, and materiel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines. In late January, upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines, General Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became [[Operation Roundup (1951)|''Operation Roundup'']] (5 February 1951){{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=121}}. A full-scale X Corps advance proceeded which fully exploited the UN Command's air superiority, {{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=120}} concluding with the UN reaching the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] and recapturing [[Wonju]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=121}}

In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the '''Fourth Phase Offensive''' and achieved initial victory at [[Hoengseong]]. But the offensive was soon blunted by the [[US IX Corps|IX Corps]] positions at [[Jipyeong-ri|Chipyong-ni]] in the center.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=121}} Units of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 2nd Infantry Division]] and the [[French Battalion in the Korean War|French Battalion]] fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=121}} The battle is sometimes known as the Gettysburg of the Korean War. The battle saw 5,600 Korean, American and French defeat a numerically superior Chinese force. Surrounded on all sides, the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|US 2nd Infantry Division]] Warrior Division's 23rd Regimental Combat Team with an attached French Battalion was hemmed in by more than 25,000 Chinese Communist Forces. United Nations Forces had previously retreated in the face of large Communist forces instead of getting cut off, but this time they stood and fought at odds of roughly 15 to 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timmons&quot; /&gt;

In the last two weeks of February 1951, ''Operation Roundup'' was followed by ''[[Operation Killer]]'', carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army. It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=121}} ''Operation Killer'' concluded with [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=122}} On 7 March 1951, the Eighth Army attacked with ''[[Operation Ripper]]'', expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March 1951. This was the city's fourth conquest in a years' time, leaving it a ruin; the 1.5&amp;nbsp;million pre-war population was down to 200,000, and people were suffering from severe food shortages.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=122}}&lt;ref name=&quot;KIMH&quot; /&gt;

On 1 March 1951 Mao sent a cable to Stalin, in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the urgent need for air cover, especially over supply lines. Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks. PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, [[Hong Xuezhi]], to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but that they had nothing to eat, no bullets to shoot, and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply, but these efforts were never completely sufficient. At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] began to participate in the war from September 1951 onward.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=149}}

On 11 April 1951, Commander-in-Chief Truman relieved the controversial General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Korea.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=123–127}} There were several reasons for the dismissal. MacArthur had crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses. He believed that whether or not to use nuclear weapons should be his own decision, not the President's.{{sfn|Stein|1994|p=69}} MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p= 600}} MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|p=79}} A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.{{sfn|Halberstam|2007|p= 498}}

General Ridgway was appointed Supreme Commander, Korea; he regrouped the UN forces for successful counterattacks,{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=127}} while General [[James Van Fleet]] assumed command of the US Eighth Army.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=130}} Further attacks slowly depleted the PVA and KPA forces; Operations [[Operation Courageous|''Courageous'']] (23–28 March 1951) and [[Operation Tomahawk|''Tomahawk'']] (23 March 1951) were a joint ground and airborne infilltration meant to trap Chinese forces between Kaesong and Seoul. UN forces advanced to &quot;Line Kansas,&quot; north of the 38th parallel.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=131}} The [[187th Infantry Regiment (United States)|187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team]] (&quot;Rakkasans&quot;) second of two combat jumps were on Easter Sunday, 1951 at [[Munsan-ni]], South Korea codenamed [[Operation Tomahawk]]. The mission was to get behind Chinese forces and block their movement north. The 60th Indian Parachute Field Ambulance provided the medical cover for the operations, dropping an ADS and a surgical team and treating over 400 battle casualties apart from the civilian casualties that formed the core of their objective as the unit was on a humanitarian mission.

The Chinese counterattacked in April 1951, with the '''Fifth Phase Offensive''' (also known as the &quot;Chinese Spring Offensive&quot;) with three field armies (approximately 700,000 men).{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=131, 132}} The offensive's first thrust fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the [[Battle of the Imjin River]] (22–25 April 1951) and the [[Battle of Kapyong]] (22–25 April 1951), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the &quot;No-name Line&quot; north of Seoul.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=133–134}} On 15 May 1951, the Chinese commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK Army and the US X Corps in the east at the [[Soyang River]]. After initial success, they were halted by 20 May.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=136–137}} At month's end, the US Eighth Army counterattacked and regained &quot;Line Kansas,&quot; just north of the 38th parallel.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=137–138}} The UN's &quot;Line Kansas&quot; halt and subsequent offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953.

For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought, but exchanged little territory; the stalemate held. Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=145, 175–177}} On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and [[Li Kenong]] and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=149}} Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the UN Command forces' goal was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=159}} The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations, and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war.

The principal battles of the stalemate include the [[Battle of Bloody Ridge]] (18 August – 15 September 1951),{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=160}} the [[Battle of Heartbreak Ridge]] (13 September – 15 October 1951),{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=161–162}} the [[Battle of Old Baldy]] (26 June – 4 August 1952), the [[Battle of White Horse]] (6–15 October 1952), the [[Battle of Triangle Hill]] (14 October – 25 November 1952), the [[Battle of Hill Eerie]] (21 March – 21 June 1952), the sieges of [[Outpost Harry]] (10–18 June 1953), the [[Battle of the Hook]] (28–9 May 1953) and the [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill]] (23 March – 16 July 1953).

Chinese troops suffered from deficient military equipment, serious logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, and the constant threat of UN bombers. All of these factors generally led to a rate of Chinese casualties that was far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops. The situation became so serious that, on November 1951, Zhou Enlai called a conference in [[Shenyang]] to discuss the PVA's logistical problems. At the meeting it was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area, to increase the number of trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible. These commitments did little to directly address the problems confronting PVA troops.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=148}}

In the months after the Shenyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future. On 24 February 1952, the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Military Commission]], presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: &quot;You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?&quot; The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots, to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|pp=148–149}}

=== Armistice (July 1953 – November 1954) ===
[[File:C Coy 2 RAR soldiers on The Hook Jun 1953 (AWM 157648).png|thumb|right|200px|Men from the Royal Australian Regiment, June 1953.]]
The on again, off again armistice negotiations continued for two years,{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=144–153}} first at Kaesong (southern North Korea), then relocated at [[Panmunjom]] (bordering the Koreas).{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=147}} A major, problematic negotiation point was [[prisoner of war]] (POW) repatriation.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=187–199}} The PVA, KPA, and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north,&lt;ref name=&quot;Boose2000&quot; /&gt; which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=189–190}} In the final armistice agreement, signed on 27 July 1953, a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was set up to handle the matter.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=242–245}}

In 1952 the US elected a new president, and on 29 November 1952, the president-elect, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], went to Korea to learn what might end the Korean War.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=240}} With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War [[armistice]],{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} the KPA, the PVA, and the UN Command [[ceasefire|ceased fire]] with the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel. Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ), which has since been [[Patrol#Military|patrolled]] by the KPA and ROKA, US, and Joint UN Commands.

The Demilitarized Zone runs northeast of the 38th parallel; to the south, it travels west. The old Korean capital city of Kaesong, site of the armistice negotiations, originally lay in the pre-war ROK, but now is in the DPRK. The United Nations Command, supported by the United States, the North Korean Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, signed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] on 27 July 1953 to end the fighting. The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks. The war is considered to have ended at this point, even though there was no [[peace treaty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fas.org&quot; /&gt; North Korea nevertheless claims that it won the Korean War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ho1993&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KCNA2011&quot; /&gt;

After the war, Operation Glory (July–November 1954) was conducted to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead. The remains of 4,167 US Army and US Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner-of-war camps were delivered to the ROK government.&lt;ref name=&quot;OperationGlory&quot; /&gt; After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] (The Punchbowl), on the island of [[Oahu]], Hawaii. [[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]] (DPMO) records indicate that the PRC and the DPRK transmitted 1,394 names, of which 858 were correct. From 4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals. Of these, 2,944 were identified as American, and all but 416 were identified by name.&lt;ref name=&quot;DPMO&quot; /&gt; From 1996 to 2006, the DPRK recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army Times&quot; /&gt;

The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] provided for monitoring by an international commission. Since 1953, the [[Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission]] (NNSC), composed of members from the Swiss&lt;ref name=&quot;SwissArmy&quot; /&gt; and Swedish&lt;ref name=&quot;SwedishArmy&quot; /&gt; Armed Forces, has been stationed near the DMZ.

In April 1975, [[South Vietnam]]'s capital was captured by the [[North Vietnam]] army. Encouraged by the success of Communist revolution in Indochina, Kim Il-sung saw it as an opportunity to liberate the South. Kim visited China in April of that year, and met with [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]] to ask for military aids. Despite the Pyongyang's expectations, however, Beijing refused to help North Korea for another war in Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;KimIlsung1975&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/nkidp-e-dossier-no-7-east-german-documents-kim-il-sung%E2%80%99s-april-1975-trip-to-beijing#_ftn2|title=NKIDP e-Dossier No. 7: East German Documents on Kim Il Sung’s April 1975 Trip to Beijing|author=Ria Chae|date=May 2012|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|series=North Korea International Documentation Project|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the armistice, there have been numerous incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea. In 1976, the [[axe murder incident]] was widely publicized. Since 1974, [[North Korean tunnels|four incursion tunnels]] leading to [[Seoul]] have been uncovered. In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean corvette [[ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772)|ROKS ''Cheonan'']], resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2010&quot; /&gt; Again in 2010, North Korea [[Bombardment of Yeonpyeong|fired artillery shells on Yeonpyeong]] island, killing two military personnel and two civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters2010&quot; /&gt;

According to the data from the [[US Department of Defense]], the United States had suffered 33,686 battle deaths, along with 2,830 non-battle deaths during the Korean War and 8,176 missing in action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhem2000&quot; /&gt; Western sources estimate the PVA had suffered between 100,000 to 1,500,000 deaths (most estimate some 400,000 killed), while the KPA had suffered between 214,000 to 520,000 deaths (most estimate some 500,000). Between some 245,000 to 415,000 South Korean civilian deaths were also suggested, and the total civilian casualties during the war were estimated as 1,500,000 to 3,000,000 (most sources estimate some 2,000,000 casualties).&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2000&quot; /&gt;

Data from official Chinese sources, on the other hand, reported that the PVA had suffered 114,000 battle deaths, 34,000 non-battle deaths, 340,000 wounded, 7,600 missing and 21,400 captured during the war. Among those captured, about 14,000 defected to Taiwan while the other 7,110 were repatriated to China.&lt;ref name=&quot;xu&quot; /&gt; Chinese sources also reported that North Korea had suffered 290,000 casualties, 90,000 captured and a &quot;large&quot; number of civilian deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;xu&quot; /&gt;
In return, the Chinese and North Koreans estimated that about 390,000 soldiers from United States, 660,000 soldiers from South Korea and 29,000 other UN soldiers were &quot;eliminated&quot; from the battlefield.&lt;ref name=&quot;xu&quot; /&gt;

Initially, North Korean armor dominated the battlefield with Soviet T-34-85 medium tanks designed during the Second World War.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=14, 43}} The KPA's tanks confronted a tankless ROK Army armed with few modern anti-tank weapons,{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=39}} including American World War II–model 2.36-inch (60&amp;nbsp;mm) M9 [[bazooka]]s, effective only against the 45&amp;nbsp;mm side armor of the T-34-85 tank.{{sfn|Stein|1994|p=25}} The US forces arriving in Korea were equipped with light [[M24 Chaffee]] tanks (on occupation duty in nearby Japan) that also proved ineffective against the heavier KPA T-34 tanks.{{sfn|Stein|1994|p=18}}

During the initial hours of warfare, some under-equipped ROK Army border units used American [[M101 howitzer|105&amp;nbsp;mm howitzers]] as [[anti-tank gun]]s to stop the tanks heading the KPA columns, firing [[high explosive anti-tank warhead|high-explosive anti-tank ammunition]] (HEAT) over open sights to good effect; at the war's start, the ROK Army had 91 howitzers, but lost most to the invaders.{{sfn|Goulden|1983|p=51}}

Countering the initial combat imbalance, the UN Command reinforcement materiel included heavier US [[M4 Sherman]], [[M26 Pershing]], [[M46 Patton]], and British [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] and [[Centurion tank|Centurion]] tanks that proved effective against North Korean armor, ending its battlefield dominance.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=182–184}} Unlike in the Second World War (1939–45), in which the tank proved a decisive weapon, the Korean War featured few large-scale tank battles. The mountainous, heavily forested terrain prevented large masses of tanks from maneuvering. In Korea, tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces.

The Korean War was the first war in which [[jet aircraft]] played a central role. Once-formidable fighters such as the [[P-51 Mustang]], [[F4U Corsair]], and [[Hawker Sea Fury]]{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=174}}—all [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]], propeller-driven, and designed during World War II—relinquished their air superiority roles to a new generation of faster, [[turbojet|jet-powered]] fighters arriving in the theater. For the initial months of the war, the [[P-80 Shooting Star]], [[F9F Panther]], and other jets under the UN flag dominated North Korea's prop-driven air force of Soviet [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and [[Lavochkin La-9]]s. The balance would shift with the arrival of the [[swept wing]] Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15 Fagot]].{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=182}}{{sfn|Werrell|2005|p=71}}

The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the [[Korean People's Air Force]] (KPAF) of North Korea with the MiG-15 Fagot, one of the world's most advanced jet fighters.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=182}} The fast, heavily armed MiG outflew first-generation UN jets such as the American F-80 and [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian]] and British [[Gloster Meteor#Service during the Korean War|Gloster Meteors]], posing a real threat to [[B-29 Superfortress]] bombers even under fighter escort. [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] pilots flew missions for the North to learn the West's aerial combat techniques. This direct Soviet participation is a ''[[casus belli]]'' that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand, as the US initially feared, to include three communist countries—North Korea, the Soviet Union, and China—and so escalate to atomic warfare.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=182}}

The USAF moved quickly to counter the MiG-15, with three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the [[F-86 Sabre]], arriving in December 1950.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|p=183}}{{sfn|Werrell|2005|pp=76–77}} Although the MiG's higher [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|service ceiling]]—{{convert|50000|ft|m|sigfig=2}} vs. {{convert|42000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}—could be advantageous at the start of a [[dogfight]], in level flight, both swept wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around {{convert|660|mi/h|km/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. The MiG climbed faster, but the Sabre turned and dived better.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2000&quot; /&gt; The MiG was armed with one 37&amp;nbsp;mm and two 23&amp;nbsp;mm cannons, while the Sabre carried six .50 caliber (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns aimed with radar-ranged [[Gunsights#Aircraft gunsights|gunsights]].

By early 1951, the battle lines were established and changed little until 1953. In summer and autumn 1951, the outnumbered Sabres of the USAF's [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter Interceptor Wing]]—only 44 at one point—continued seeking battle in [[MiG Alley]], where the [[Yalu River]] marks the Chinese border, against Chinese and North Korean air forces capable of deploying some 500 aircraft. Following Colonel [[Harrison Thyng]]'s communication with the Pentagon, the [[51st Fighter Wing|51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing]] finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951; for the next year-and-a-half stretch of the war, aerial warfare continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavisThyng&quot; /&gt;

UN forces gained [[Air supremacy|air superiority]] in the Korean theater after the initial months of the war and maintained it for the duration. This was decisive for the UN: first, for attacking into the peninsular north, and second, for resisting the Chinese intervention.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=182–184}} North Korea and China also had jet-powered air forces; their limited training and experience made it strategically untenable to lose them against the better-trained UN air forces. Thus, the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] fed materiel to the war, battling by proxy and finding themselves virtually matched, technologically, when the USAF deployed the F-86F against the MiG-15 late in 1952.

Unlike the [[Vietnam War]], in which the Soviet Union only officially sent 'advisers', in the Korean aerial war soviet forces participated via the 64th Airborn Corps. 1106 enemy airplanes were officially downed by the soviet pilots, 52 of whom earned the title of 'aces' - more than 5 confirmed kills. Since the soviet system of confirming air kills erred on the conservative side - the pilot's words were never taken into account without corroboration from other witnesses, and enemy airplanes falling into the sea were not counted, perhaps the number is greater than 1106.&lt;ref name=&quot;airwar.ru/history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|date= 29 January 2010 |url = http://www.airwar.ru/history/aces/acepostwar/pilot/koreaussr.html | title = Soviet pilots in Korea |publisher = airwar.ru | location = RU | language = Russian | accessdate =5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, and to the present day, the USAF reports an F-86 Sabre [[Loss exchange ratio|kill ratio]] in excess of 10:1, with 792 MiG-15s and 108 other aircraft shot down by Sabres, and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puckett2005&quot; /&gt; The Soviet Air Force reported some 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China's [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF) reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost. The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention. The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively. However, one unconfirmed source claims that the US Air Force has more recently cited 230 losses out of 674 F-86s deployed to Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2000&quot; /&gt; The differing tactical roles of the F-86 and MiG-15 May have contributed to the disparity in losses: MiG-15s primarily targeted B-29 bombers and ground-attack fighter-bombers, while F-86s targeted the MiGs.

The Korean War marked a major milestone not only for fixed-wing aircraft, but also for [[rotorcraft]], featuring the first large-scale deployment of [[helicopter]]s for [[medical evacuation]] (medevac).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreisher2007&quot; /&gt; In 1944–1945, during the Second World War, the [[Sikorsky R-4|YR-4]] helicopter saw limited ambulance duty, but in Korea, where rough terrain trumped the [[jeep]] as a speedy medevac vehicle,&lt;ref name=&quot;OliveDrab&quot; /&gt; helicopters like the [[Sikorsky H-19]] helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Day&quot; /&gt; The limitations of jet aircraft for [[close air support]] highlighted the helicopter's potential in the role, leading to development of the [[AH-1 Cobra]] and other helicopter gunships used in the [[Vietnam War]] (1965–75).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreisher2007&quot; /&gt;

==== Bombing North Korea ====

On 12 August 1950 the USAF dropped 625 tons of bombs on North Korea; two weeks later, the daily tonnage increased to some 800 tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cumings2006&quot; /&gt; U.S. warplanes dropped more napalm and bombs on North Korea than they did during the whole Pacific campaign of World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walkom2010&quot; /&gt;

=== Naval warfare ===
{{Naval engagements of the Korean War}}
[[File:KoreanWarNavyGunfire.jpg|thumb|To disrupt North Korean communications, the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] fires a salvo from its 16-inch guns at shore targets near [[Chongjin]], North Korea, 21 October 1950]]

Because neither Korea had a large navy, the Korean War featured few naval battles; mostly the combatant navies served as naval artillery for their in-country armies. A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the US Navy cruiser [[USS Juneau (CL-119)|USS ''Juneau'']], the Royal Navy cruiser [[HMS Jamaica (44)|HMS ''Jamaica'']], and the frigate [[HMS Black Swan (L57)|HMS ''Black Swan'']] fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them.

During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea and sank supply and ammunition ships to deny the sea to North Korea. Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to US and UN navy ships was from magnetic mines the North Koreans employed for defensive purposes.

The USS ''Juneau'' sank ammunition ships that had been present in her previous battle. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship ''PC 703'' sank a North Korean mine layer in the [[Battle of Haeju]] Island, near Inchon. Three other supply ships were sunk by ''PC-703'' two days later in the [[Yellow Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marolda2003&quot; /&gt;

=== U.S. threat of atomic warfare ===

On 5 April 1950, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] (JCS) issued orders for the retaliatory atomic bombing of Manchurian PRC military bases, if either their armies crossed into Korea or if PRC or KPA bombers attacked Korea from there. The President ordered the transfer of nine [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]s &quot;to the Air Force's Ninth Bomb Group, the designated carrier of the weapons ... [and] signed an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets&quot;, which he never transmitted.{{sfn|Cumings|1997|pp=289–292}}

Many American officials viewed the deployment of nuclear-capable (but not nuclear-armed) B-29 bombers to Britain as helping to resolve the [[Berlin Blockade]] of 1948-1949. Truman and Eisenhower both had military experience and viewed nuclear weapons as potentially usable components of their military. During Truman's first meeting to discuss the war on 25 June 1950, he ordered plans be prepared for attacking Soviet forces if they entered the war. By July, Truman approved another B-29 deployment to Britain, this time with bombs (but without their [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]]), to remind the Soviets of American offensive ability. Deployment of a similar fleet to [[Guam]] was leaked to ''The New York Times''. As United Nations forces retreated to Pusan, and the [[CIA]] reported that mainland China was building up forces for a possible invasion of Taiwan, the Pentagon believed that Congress and the public would demand using nuclear weapons if the situation in Korea required them.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor2538736&quot;&gt;{{cite jstor|2538736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chinese forces pushed back the United States forces from the Yalu River, Truman stated during a 30 November 1950 press conference that using nuclear weapons was &quot;always been [under] active consideration&quot;, with control under the local military commander.{{r|jstor2538736}} The Indian Ambassador, [[Kavalam Madhava Panikkar|K. Madhava Panikkar]], reports &quot;that Truman announced that he was thinking of using the atom bomb in Korea. But the Chinese seemed totally unmoved by this threat ... The propaganda against American aggression was stepped up. The 'Aid Korea to resist America' campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control over anti-national activities. One could not help feeling that Truman's threat came in very useful to the leaders of the Revolution, to enable them to keep up the tempo of their activities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knightley1982&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Panikkar1981&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Exercise Desert Rock I (Buster-Jangle Dog) 003.jpg|upright|thumb|Atom bomb test, 1951. This was the [[Operation Buster-Jangle]] Dog shot, on 1 November.]]
After his statement caused concern in Europe, Truman met on 4 December 1950 with UK prime minister and Commonwealth spokesman [[Clement Attlee]], French Premier [[René Pleven]], and Foreign Minister [[Robert Schuman]] to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion. The US's forgoing atomic warfare was not because of &quot;a disinclination by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China to escalate&quot; the Korean War, but because UN allies—notably from the UK, the Commonwealth, and France—were concerned about a [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the US fought China, who then might persuade the Soviet Union to conquer Western Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman1955&quot; /&gt; The Joint Chiefs of Staff advised Truman to tell Attlee that the United States would only use nuclear weapons if necessary to protect an evacuation of UN troops, or to prevent a &quot;major military disaster&quot;.{{r|jstor2538736}}

On 6 December 1950, after the Chinese intervention repelled the UN Command armies from northern North Korea, General [[J. Lawton Collins]] (Army Chief of Staff), General MacArthur, Admiral [[C. Turner Joy]], General [[George E. Stratemeyer]], and staff officers Major General Doyle Hickey, Major General [[Charles A. Willoughby]], and Major General Edwin K. Wright, met in Tokyo to plan strategy countering the Chinese intervention; they considered three potential atomic warfare scenarios encompassinging the next weeks and months of warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;

* In the first scenario: If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command is forbidden to blockade and bomb China, and without Nationalist Chinese reinforcements, and without an increase in US forces until April 1951 (four [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;
* In the second scenario: If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command have blockaded China and have effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior, and the Nationalist Chinese soldiers are maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing is to hand, then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;
* In the third scenario: if the PRC agreed to not cross the 38th parallel border, General MacArthur recommended UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel, and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards. The US Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul–Incheon area, while X Corps would retreat to Pusan. A UN commission should supervise implementation of the armistice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;

Both the Pentagon and the State Department were nonetheless cautious about using nuclear weapons due to the risk of general war with China and the diplomatic ramifications. Truman and his senior advisors agreed, and never seriously considered using them in early December 1950 despite the poor military situation in Korea.{{r|jstor2538736}}

In 1951, the US escalated closest to atomic warfare in Korea. Because the PRC had deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, pit crews at the [[Kadena Air Base]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, &quot;lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores.&quot; In October 1951, the US effected ''Operation Hudson Harbor'' to establish nuclear weapons capability. USAF B-29 bombers practised individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from [[Yokota Air Base]] in east-central Japan. ''Hudson Harbor'' tested &quot;actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, ground control of bomb aiming&quot;. The bombing run data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry, because the &quot;timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasbrouck1951&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefof Staff1951&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson1998&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CommandingGeneral1951&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FarEastCommand&quot; /&gt; Ridgway was authorized to use nuclear weapons if a major air attack originated from outside Korea. An envoy was sent to Hong Kong to deliver a warning to China. The message likely caused Chinese leaders to be more cautious about potential American use of nuclear weapons, but whether they learned about the B-29 deployment is unclear and the failure of the two major Chinese offensives that month likely was what caused them to shift to a defensive strategy in Korea. The B-29s returned to the United States in June.{{r|jstor2538736}}
[[File:Shootingkoreancivilians.jpg|thumb|&quot;It is reported that large groups of civilians, either composed of or controlled by North Korean soldiers, are infiltrating US positions. The army has requested we strafe all civilian refugee parties approaching our positions&quot;.]]
When Eisenhower succeeded Truman in early 1953 he was similarly cautious about using nuclear weapons in Korea, including for diplomatic purposes to encourage progress in the ongoing truce discussions. The administration prepared contingency plans for using them against China, but like Truman, the new president feared that doing so would result in Soviet attacks on Japan. The war ended as it had begun, without American nuclear weapons deployed near battle.{{r|jstor2538736}}

===Killing of refugees===
In addition to conventional military operations, North Korean soldiers fought the U.N. forces by [[infiltration tactics|infiltrating]] guerrillas among refugees. These soldiers disguised as refugees would approach UN forces asking for food and help, then open fire and attack. U.S. troops acted under a &quot;shoot-first-ask-questions-later&quot; policy against any civilian refugee approaching U.S. battlefield positions,&lt;ref name=&quot;HanleyMendoza2006&quot; /&gt; a policy that led U.S. soldiers to kill an estimated 400 civilians at [[No Gun Ri]] (26–29 July 1950) in central Korea because they believed some of the refugees killed to be North Korean soldiers in disguise.&lt;ref name=&quot;HanleyMendoza2007&quot; /&gt;   The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Korea)|South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] defended this policy as a &quot;military necessity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/10/korea-bloodbath-probe-ends-us-escapes-much-blame/ |title=Korea bloodbath probe ends; US escapes much blame |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=San Diego Union Tribune |author=Charles J.

=== War crimes ===

===== Civilian deaths and massacres =====
{{Further|No Gun Ri Massacre|Geochang massacre|Sancheong-Hamyang massacre|Ganghwa massacre|Seoul National University Hospital Massacre}}

In occupied areas, North Korean Army [[political commissar|political officers]] purged South Korean society of its intelligentsia by executing every educated person—academic, governmental, religious—who might lead resistance against the North; the purges continued during the NPA retreat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rummel1997&quot; /&gt; Immediately after the invasion in June 1950 the South Korean Government ordered the nation-wide &quot;pre-emptive apprehension&quot; of politically suspect or disloyal citizens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The military police and right-wing paramilitary (civilian) armies executed thousands of left-wing and communist political prisoners at Daejeon Prison and in the [[Jeju Uprising]] (1948–49).&lt;ref name=&quot;HanleyChangMay2008&quot; /&gt; The Americans on the island documented the events, but never intervened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek2000&quot; /&gt;

The South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission has investigated numerous atrocities that were committed by various government agencies during Japan's occupation of Korea, the Korean War, and the authoritarian governments that ruled afterwards.  The commission estimates that at least 100,000 people—and possibly higher—were executed in the summer of 1950. The victims include political prisoners, civilians who were killed by US Forces, and civilians who allegedly collaborated with communist North Korea or local communist groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim2010&quot;/&gt;

The Korean armies forcibly [[conscription|conscripted]] available civilian men and women to their war efforts. In ''Statistics of Democide'' (1997), Prof. [[R. J. Rummel]] estimated that the North Korean Army conscripted some 400,000 South Korean citizens and conducted at least 500,000 [[democide|democidal]] killings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rummel1997&quot; /&gt; The South Korean Government reported that the North abducted some 83,000 citizens before the US recaptured Seoul in September 1950; the North says they [[defection|defected]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Choe2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2007&quot; /&gt;

===== Bodo League anti-communist massacre =====
[[File:South Korean soldiers walk among dead political prisoners, Taejon, South Korea.jpg|thumb|ROK soldiers walk among the bodies of political prisoners executed near Daejon, July 1950]]
{{Main|Bodo League massacre}}

To outmaneuver a possible [[fifth column]] in the Republic of Korea, President Syngman Rhee's regime executed its &quot;enemies of the state&quot;—South Koreans who are allegedly communists, pro-North Korea, or leftist—by first imprisoning them for political re-education in the ''Gukmin Bodo Ryeonmaeng'' (National Rehabilitation and Guidance League, also known as the Bodo League). The true purpose of the anti–communist Bodo League, abetted by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] (USAMGIK), was the regime's execution of tens of thousands of suspected &quot;communists&quot; in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Merrill, ''Korea: The Peninsular Origins of the War'' (University of Delaware Press, 1989),
p181.&lt;/ref&gt; USAMGIK officers were present at one political execution site; at least one US officer sanctioned the mass killings of political prisoners whom the North Koreans would have freed after conquering the peninsular south.&lt;ref name=&quot;HanleyChangDec2008&quot; /&gt;

USAMGIK officers photographed the mass killings at Daejon city in central South Korea, where the Truth and Reconciliation Commission believes some 3,000 to 7,000 people were shot and buried in mass graves in early July 1950. Other declassified records report that a US Army Lieutenant Colonel approved the execution of 3,500 political prisoners by the ROK Army unit to which he was military advisor when the KPA reached the southern port city of Pusan.&lt;ref name=&quot;HanleyChangDec2008&quot; /&gt;  According to one news report:  &quot;Although U.S. diplomats reported confidentially they had urged restraint on the South Koreans, there was no sign the U.S. military....tried to halt the mass executions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HanleyChangDec2008&quot; /&gt;

===== Prisoners of war =====
{{See also|Korean POWs detained in North Korea|Hill 303 massacre}}
[[File:Hill 303 Survivors.jpg|thumb|alt=Two men without shirts on sit surrounded by soldiers|Two Hill 303 survivors after being rescued by American units, 17 August 1950]]
The US reported that North Korea mistreated prisoners of war: soldiers were beaten, starved, put to [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], [[death march|marched to death]], and [[summary execution|summarily executed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potter1953&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson2003&quot; /&gt;

The KPA killed POWs at the battles for Hill 312, [[Hill 303]], the Pusan Perimeter, and Daejeon—discovered during early after-battle mop-up actions by the UN forces. Later, a US Congress [[war crime]]s investigation, the ''United States Senate Subcommittee on Korean War Atrocities of the Permanent Subcommittee of the Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations'' reported that &quot;... two-thirds of all American prisoners of war in Korea died as a result of war crimes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lakshmanan1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Zandt2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skelton2002&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Americanexecuted1950korea.jpg|thumb|left|An executed U.S. Army POW of the U.S. 21st Infantry Regiment killed 9 July 1950. Picture taken 10 July 1950]]

Although the Chinese rarely executed prisoners like their Korean counterparts, mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese run POW camps during the winter of 1950–51. About 43 percent of all US POWs died during this period. The Chinese defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were suffering mass starvation and diseases due to the lack of competent logistics system. The UN POWs, however, disputed the claim by pointing out that most of the Chinese camps were located near the easily supplied Sino-Korean border, and that starvation was used to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrination programs, which were running in full swing after the starvation was over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lech2000&quot; /&gt;
[[File:국민방위군 징집자들.jpg|thumb|National Defense Corps soldiers in January 1951.]]
The North Korean Government reported some 70,000 ROK Army POWs; 8,000 were repatriated. South Korea repatriated 76,000 Korean People's Army POWs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2007&quot; /&gt; Besides the 12,000 UN Command forces POWs dead in captivity, the KPA might have press-ganged some 50,000 ROK POWs into the North Korean military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rummel1997&quot; /&gt; Per the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of Korea)|South Korean Ministry of Defense]], there remained some 560 [[Korean POWs detained in North Korea]] in 2008; from 1994 until 2009, some 79 ROK POWs escaped the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;QandA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2004&quot; /&gt;

The North Korean Government denied having POWs from the Korean War, and, via the [[Korean Central News Agency]], reported that the UN forces killed some 33,600 KPA POWs; that on 19 July 1951, in POW Camp No. 62, some 100 POWs were killed as machine-gunnery targets; that on 27 May 1952, in the 77th Camp, [[Geojedo|Koje Island]] (now in [[Geoje]]), the ROK Army incinerated with flamethrowers some 800 KPA POWs who rejected &quot;voluntary repatriation&quot; south, and instead demanded repatriation north.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCNA&quot; /&gt;

In 1997 the [[Geoje POW Camp]] in South Korea was turned into a memorial.

Mao Zedong's decision to involve China in the Korean War was a conscientious effort to confront the most powerful country in the world, undertaken at a time when the regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Mao primarily supported intervention not to save North Korea or to appease the Soviet Union, but because he believed that a military conflict with the United States was inevitable after UN forces crossed the 38th parallel. Mao's secondary motive was to improve his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international. In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China's entrance into the Korean War. Inside China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=150}}

China emerged from the Korean War united by a sense of national pride, despite the war's enormous costs. The Chinese people were educated to believe that the war was initiated by the United States and Korea, and not by a fraternal communist state in the north. In Chinese propaganda, the Chinese war effort was portrayed and accepted as an example of China's engaging the strongest power in the world with an under-equipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate. These successes were contrasted with China's historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years in order to promote the image of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]]. The most significant negative long-term consequence of the war (for China) was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control until the present day.{{sfn|Barnouin|Yu|2006|p=150}}

The Korean War affected other participant combatants. [[Turkey]], for example, entered [[NATO]] in 1952&lt;ref name=&quot;StateDept&quot; /&gt; and the foundation for bilateral diplomatic and trade relations was laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turquie2010&quot; /&gt;

The beginning of racial integration efforts in the U.S. military began during the Korean War, where African Americans fought in integrated units for the first time. Among the 1.8&amp;nbsp;million American soldiers who fought in the Korean War there were more than 100,000 African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congress&quot; /&gt;

Post-war recovery was different in the two Koreas. South Korea stagnated in the first post-war decade, but later industrialized and modernized. Contemporary North Korea remains underdeveloped. South Korea had one of the world's [[Miracle on the Han River|fastest growing economies]] from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. By 2010 it was ranked thirteenth in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA2011&quot; /&gt; 

Post-war, about 100,000 North Koreans were executed in internal communist party purges.&lt;ref&gt;Courtois, Stephane, ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, pg. 564.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Rummel, forced labor and concentration camps were responsible for over one million deaths in North Korea;&lt;ref&gt;Rummel, R.J., [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP10.HTM Statistics Of North Korean Democide: Estimates, Calculations, And Sources], ''Statistics of Democide,'' 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; others have estimated 400,000 deaths in concentration camps alone.&lt;ref&gt;Omestad, Thomas, [http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/030623/23gulag.htm &quot;Gulag Nation&quot;], [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]], 23 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s [[North Korean famine|famine]] killed between 900,000 and 3.5 million North Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;Noland, Marcus, Sherman Robinson and Tao Wang, [http://www.iie.com/publications/wp/99-2.pdf Famine in North Korea: Causes and Cures], ''Institute for International Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eberstadt, Nicholas, and Judith Bannister. 1992.

Korean [[Anti-American sentiment in Korea|anti-Americanism]] after the war was fueled by the presence and behavior of American military personnel ([[USFK]]) and U.S. support for the [[Park Chung-hee|authoritarian regime]], a fact still evident during the country's democratic transition in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes12July1987&quot; /&gt; In a February 2002 Gallup-Korea poll, one-third of South Koreans viewed the United States favorably.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shin2003&quot; /&gt;

In addition a large number of [[Amerasian|mixed race]] 'G.I. babies' (offspring of U.S. and other western soldiers and Korean women) were filling up the country's orphanages. Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of race. Children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in Korean society. Thousands [[Korean adoptee|were adopted]] by American families in the years following the war, when their plight was covered on television.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jang1998&quot; /&gt; The U.S. [[Immigration Act of 1952]] removed race as a limiting factor in immigration, and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea after the Korean War. With the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1965]], which substantially changed U.S. immigration policy toward non-Europeans, [[Korean American|Koreans]] became one of the fastest growing [[Asian American|Asian]] groups in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choe2005&quot; /&gt;

In 2011, some former members of Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]], who had battled there, revisited North Korea. Afterwards they said that they were &quot;very sad&quot;, unsatisfied with the post-war development of North Korea. &quot;(We) liberated them, but they're still struggling for freedom&quot;, said Qu Yingkui.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/history/phtv/dsy/detail_2011_10/25/10128396_0.shtml 志愿军老兵重返朝鲜谈感受：他们水深火热 很痛心]&lt;/ref&gt;
