'''Homosexual agenda''' (or '''gay agenda''') is a term originated by some [[Christian right|conservative Christians]] in the United States to describe the [[LGBT social movements|advocacy]] of cultural acceptance and normalization of [[non-heterosexual]] [[Sexual orientation|orientations]] and relationships. The term is applied to efforts to change government policies and laws on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) issues.  The term has also been used by some [[social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]] to describe alleged goals of [[LGBT rights]] activists, such as '[[homosexual recruitment|recruiting]]' heterosexuals into what they term a 'homosexual lifestyle'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/07/09/512916/hate-group-homosexual-activists-try-to-confuse-children-to-build-their-numbers/ Hate Group: ‘Homosexual Activists’ Try To ‘Confuse Children’ To ‘Build Their Numbers’] ''[[Think Progress]]'' July 9, 2012.

== Origins and usage ==
[[File:Gaymarchwash.jpg|thumb|Cover of DVD ''The Gay Agenda: March on Washington'']]
===Initial usage===
In the US, the term &quot;the gay agenda&quot; was first used in public discourse in 1992 when the [[Family Research Council]], an American [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/us/27right.html?pagewanted=all |title=A Line in the Sand for Same-Sex Marriage Foes |author=Laurie Goodstein |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=October 26, 2008 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; released a video series called ''The Gay Agenda'' as part of a pack of materials campaigning on [[homosexual]] issues and the &quot;hidden gay agenda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herman|first=Didi|date=1998|title=The Anti-Gay Agenda:  Orthodox Vision and the Christian Right|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[Oregon Citizens Alliance]] used this video as part of their campaign for [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Ballot Measure 9]] to amend the Oregon Constitution to prevent what the OCA called [[special rights]] for gays, [[lesbian]]s, and [[bisexual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Signorile|first=Michelangelo|date=1993|title=Queer In America|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Cameron]] — co-founder of the Institute for the Scientific Investigation of Sexuality in Lincoln, later renamed the [[Family Research Institute]] — appeared in the video, wherein he asserted that 75 percent of gay men regularly ingest [[feces]] and that 70-78 percent have had a [[sexually transmitted disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Herman|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Gay Agenda'' was followed by three other video publications; ''The Gay Agenda in Public Education'' (1993), ''The Gay Agenda: March on Washington'' (1993) and a feature follow-up ''Stonewall: 25 Years of Deception'' (1994). The videos contained interviews with [[LGBT rights opposition|opponents of LGBT rights]], and the series was made available through [[Christian right]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Herman|1998|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage and meaning===  

The term is applied to efforts to change government policies and laws on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) issues - such as, for example, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]], [[LGBT adoption]], recognizing [[Suspect classification|sexual orientation as a protected civil rights minority classification]], [[Sexual orientation and military service|LGBT military participation]], inclusion of [[LGBT history]] and themes in [[public education]], introduction of [[anti-bullying legislation]] to protect LGBT minors - as well as non-governmental campaigns and individual actions that increase visibility and cultural acceptance of LGBT people, relationships, and identities. The term has also been used by some [[social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]] to describe alleged goals of [[LGBT rights]] activists, such as '[[homosexual recruitment|recruiting]]' heterosexuals into what they term a 'homosexual lifestyle'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/07/09/512916/hate-group-homosexual-activists-try-to-confuse-children-to-build-their-numbers/ Hate Group: ‘Homosexual Activists’ Try To ‘Confuse Children’ To ‘Build Their Numbers’] ''[[Think Progress]]'' July 9, 2012.

The idea of a ''homosexual agenda'' is also used by some Christian critics of LGBT rights in conjunction with a putative ideology they refer to as ''homosexualism'' (as opposed to a synonym for homosexuality), using ''homosexualists'' to describe people who seek to advance LGBT emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sg.christianpost.com/dbase/editorial/330/7|15/1.htm ''Understanding the Homosexual Agenda'', The Christian Post, Sept 23 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/?p=14100 ''Obama Renews His Commitment to the Full Homosexualist Agenda'', Anglican Mainstream, August 18 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of ''homosexualist'' in this way first appeared in 1995 in Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams' book ''[[The Pink Swastika]]'', &quot;to refer to any person, homosexual or not, who actively promotes homosexuality as morally and socially equivalent to heterosexuality as a basis for social policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mega.nu:8080/ampp/pinkswastika.hold/book.html ''The Pink Swastika'', &quot;A Word to the Reader&quot;, Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams, 3rd edition, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Lively and Abrahams in The Pink Swastika argue that alleged homosexuality found in the Nazi Party, specifically within [[Ernst Rohm]]'s [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], contributed to the extreme militarism of Nazi Germany, and write about the ''gay agenda'' in this context.

On January 8, 2008, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] granted the Gay Agenda trademark &lt;ref&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4006:aeq6au.2.1], GayAgenda Trademark&lt;/ref&gt; to Vibe Media, Inc. Vibe Media, Inc created a news website on the domain gayagenda.com which is used to &quot;provide information, news and commentary in the field of entertainment relating to the gay community&quot; according to the trademark filing. 

===''After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s''===
In 2003 [[Alan Sears]] and Craig Osten, president and vice-president of the [[Alliance Defense Fund]], an American conservative Christian organization, offered another characterization:
{{bquote|It is an agenda that they basically set in the late 1980s, in a book called ''After the Ball'', where they laid out a six-point plan for how they could transform the beliefs of ordinary Americans with regard to homosexual behavior — in a decade-long time frame.... They admit it privately, but they will not say that publicly.&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;{{harv|Kirk|Madsen|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their private publications, homosexual activists make it very clear that there is an agenda. The six-point agenda that they laid out in 1989 was explicit:
#Talk about gays and gayness as loudly and as often as possible(...)
#Portray gays as victims, not as aggressive challengers(...)
#Give homosexual protectors a just cause(...)
#Make gays look good(...)
#Make the victimizers look bad(...)
#Get funds from corporate America(...)&lt;ref name=osten&gt;Osten, Craig (2003).

''[[After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s]]'' is a book published in 1989 by [[Marshall Kirk]] and Hunter Madsen.&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt; It argues that after the [[gay liberation]] phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. It was published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and was generally available.

According to a [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] article by Paul Strand, Sears and Osten argue that ''After the Ball'' follows from &quot;a 1988 summit of gay leaders in [[Warrenton, Virginia]], who came together to agree on the agenda&quot; and that &quot;the two men ([[#CITEREFKirkMadsen1989|Kirk and Madsen]]) proposed using tactics on '[[heterosexual|straight]]' America that are remarkably similar to the [[brainwashing]] methods of [[Mao Zedong|Mao Tse-Tung]]'s [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese]] – mixed with [[Madison Avenue#Advertising industry|Madison Avenue]]'s most persuasive selling techniques.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/media/browse_videos_info.aspx?s=/vod/pst2 Paul Strand, Homosexual Agenda Pushed in Movies Like Brokeback Mountain, CBN]&lt;/ref&gt; The article goes on to claim that films such as ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' are part of this &quot;well-planned [[propaganda]] campaign&quot;.

===Recent usage===
*In 2003, [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], wrote in his dissent in the landmark case ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that{{cquote|Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Cobb|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*In 2004, [[Oklahoma]] Senator [[Tom Coburn]] rated the &quot;gay agenda&quot; as a more pressing danger than any [[terrorist]] activity affecting Americans.&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot; name=Moulitsas&gt;{{cite news |title=Kissing the tarantula: US blogger Markos Moulitsas marvels at the Tories’ attempts to woo the gay vote, in stark contrast to the stance of US conservatives |last=Moulitsas |first=Markos |date=5 May 2005 |publisher=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/may/05/election2005.comment1 |quote=To the newly elected Republican senator from Oklahoma, Tom Coburn, the &quot;gay agenda&quot; is a more pressing danger than terrorists flying planes into buildings and killing allied troops in Iraq. &quot;The gay community has infiltrated the very centres of power in every area across this country, and they wield extreme power ... That agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today,&quot; he said during the 2004 campaign. &quot;Why do you think we see the rationalisation for abortion and multiple sexual partners? That's a gay agenda.&quot; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2005, [[James Dobson]], director of [[Focus on the Family]], described the homosexual agenda as follows:
{{cquote|Those goals include universal acceptance of the gay lifestyle, discrediting of [[Bible|scriptures]] that condemn homosexuality, muzzling of the clergy and Christian media, granting of special privileges and rights in the law, overturning laws prohibiting [[pedophilia]], indoctrinating children and future generations through public education, and securing all the legal benefits of marriage for any two or more people who claim to have homosexual tendencies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, Dr. James (2005). &quot;[http://www.family.org/docstudy/bookshelf/a0032438.cfm Marriage Under Fire]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--dead link?--&gt;}}

=== Satire ===
A [[satire|satirical]] article by Michael Swift which appeared in the ''[[Gay Community News (Boston)|Gay Community News]]'' in February 1987 entitled &quot;Gay Revolutionary&quot; describes a scenario in which homosexual men dominate [[American society]] and suppress all things heterosexual. This was reprinted in ''[[Congressional Record]]'' without the opening line: &quot;This essay is an outré, madness, a tragic, cruel fantasy, an eruption of inner rage, on how the oppressed desperately dream of being the oppressor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/swift1.html Fordham University:  Michael Swift – Gay Revolutionary (the complete essay)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes used satirically as a counterfoil by people who would normally find this term offensive, such as the spoof agenda found on the [[Betty Bowers]] satirical website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bettybowers.com/homoagenda.html The Homosexual Agenda]&lt;/ref&gt; and when Bishop [[Gene Robinson]] declared that &quot;Jesus is the agenda, the homosexual agenda in the Episcopal Church&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/News/2006/06/Jesus-Is-The-Homosexual-Agenda.aspx?p=2 Bishop Gene Robinson, ''Jesus is the Homosexual Agenda'', address to the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, June 14th 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79901_98902_ENG_HTM.htm &quot;The &quot;homosexual agenda, is Jesus, the Jesus I know who communicates God's unwavering love for me&quot;, ''Church need not be afraid, New Hampshire bishop tells Putney gathering'', Episcopal Life, July 13th 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; On an episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', [[Jon Stewart]] defined the gay agenda as &quot;[[gay marriage]], [[civil rights]] protection, [[Fleet Week]] expanded to Fleet Year, [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) assistance for when [[it's raining men]], [[Kathy Griffin]] to host everything and a nationwide ban on [[pleated|pleated pants]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Stewart spells out the gay agenda|author=Lyle Masaki|url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/jon-stewart-spells-out-the-gay-agenda|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
