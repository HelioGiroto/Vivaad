It is one of the [[succession of states|successor states]] of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], from which it declared independence in 1991. It became a member of the [[United Nations]] in 1993 but, as a result of a [[Macedonia naming dispute|dispute with Greece]] over its name, it was admitted under the provisional reference of '''the former &lt;!-- DO ''not'' CAPITALIZE &quot;THE FORMER&quot; - LOWER CASE IS CORRECT --&gt; Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r225.htm United Nations, A/RES/47/225], 8 April 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 817|United Nations Security Council Resolutions 817]] of 7 April and 845 June 18 of 1993, see [http://www.un.org/Docs/scres/1993/scres93.htm UN resolutions made on 1993]&lt;!--don't change this link, direct links to resolutions won't work--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes abbreviated as FYROM.&lt;ref&gt;FYROM on [http://www.google.com/search?q=FYROM&amp;btnGNS=Search+un.org&amp;oi=navquery_searchbox&amp;sa=X&amp;as_sitesearch=un.org&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=AKW&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Ael%3Aofficial un.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's capital is [[Skopje]], with 506,926 inhabitants according to a 2002 census. Other cities include [[Bitola]], [[Kumanovo]], [[Prilep]], [[Tetovo]], [[Ohrid]], [[Veles (city)|Veles]], [[Štip]], [[Kočani]], [[Gostivar]], [[Kavadarci]] and [[Strumica]]. It has more than 50 lakes and sixteen mountains higher than {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Macedonia is a member of the UN and the [[Council of Europe]]. Since December 2005 it has also been a [[Accession of Macedonia to the European Union|candidate for joining the European Union]] and has [[Accession of Macedonia to NATO|applied for NATO membership]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The country's name derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Μακεδονία (''Makedonía''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364599 Μακεδονία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macedonia&quot;&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Macedonia Macedonia], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Macedon|kingdom]] (later, [[Macedonia (region)|region]]) named after the [[ancient Macedonians]]. Their name, Μακεδόνες (''Makedónes''), derives ultimately from the [[ancient Greek]] adjective [[Makednos|μακεδνός]] (''makednós''), meaning &quot;tall, taper&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364596 μακεδνός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which shares the same root as the noun μάκρος (''mákros''), meaning &quot;length&quot; in both ancient and [[modern Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364705 μάκρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; The name is originally believed to have meant either &quot;highlanders&quot; or &quot;the tall ones&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Macedonia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene N. Borza]], ''Makedonika'', Regina Books, ISBN 0-941690-65-2, p.114: The &quot;highlanders&quot; or &quot;Makedones&quot; of the mountainous regions of western Macedonia are derived from northwest Greek stock; they were akin both to those who at an earlier time may have migrated south to become the historical &quot;Dorians&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Guy Wilson, ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece'', Routledge, 2009, p.439: The latest archaeological findings have confirmed that Macedonia took its name from a tribe of tall, Greek-speaking people, the Makednoi.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly referring to the physical character of the ancient Macedonians and their mountainous land.

===Medieval and Ottoman period===
{{Main|South Slavs}}
{{Further|Bulgaria (theme)|Ottoman Vardar Macedonia}}
[[File:Macodnian Sklavinia.png|thumb|300px|''Sklaviniae in Medieval Macedonia'' c. 700 AD]]

During the 580s, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] literature attests to the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] raiding Byzantine territories in the region of Macedonia, aided by [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] or [[Bulgars]]. Historical records document that in c.680 a group of Bulgars, Slavs and Byzantines led by a Bulgar called [[Kuber]] settled in the region of Keramisian plain, centred on the city of [[Bitola]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Acta Sancti Demetrii&quot;, V 195–207, Гръцки извори за българската история, 3, стр. 159–166
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian's]] reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia. The Slavic peoples that settled in the region of Macedonia accepted Christianity as their own religion around the 9th century, during the reign of Tsar [[Boris I of Bulgaria]].

In 1014, Emperor [[Basil II]] finally defeated the armies of [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria]] and by 1018 the Byzantines restored control over Macedonia (and all of the Balkans) for the first time since the 7th century. However, by the late 12th century, Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities, including a brief [[Normans|Norman]] occupation in the 1080s.

In the early 13th century, a revived [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] gained control of the region. Plagued by political difficulties the empire did not last and the region came once again under Byzantine control in early 14th century. In the 14th century, it became part of the [[Serbian Empire]], who saw themselves as liberators of their Slavic kin from Byzantine [[despotism]]. [[Skopje]] became the capital of [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Tsar Stefan Dusan]]'s empire.

With Dusan's death, a weak successor appeared and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. This coincided with the entry of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] into Europe. The [[Kingdom of Prilep]] was one of the short lived states that emerged from the collapse of the [[Serbian Empire]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=y2d6OHLqwEsC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=KINGDOM+OF+PRILEP&amp;q=KINGDOM%20OF%20PRILEP |title=The last centuries of Byzantium, (1261–1453) by Donald MacGillivray Nicol |publisher=Google Books |year=1993|accessdate=28 April 2010|isbn=978-0-521-43991-6|page=500|author1=Nicol, Donald Macgillivray}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually all the central Balkans were conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and remained under its domination for five centuries.

Several movements whose goals were the establishment of autonomous Macedonia, encompassing the entire region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees, later transformed to SMORO. In 1905 it was renamed as Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) and after [[World War I]] the organization separated into the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) and the [[Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation]] (ITRO).

In the early organization the membership was allowed only for Bulgarians, but later it was opened to all inhabitants of European Turkey, ''regardless of their nationality or religion''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.bg/books?id=6RveDmHbIv8C&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=delcev+Bulgarian+loyalty++against++chauvinistic+nationalism&amp;hl=bg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=He%20also%20declared%20his%20&amp;f=false Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, ISBN 3825813878, p. 136.]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of its members however were [[Macedonian Bulgarians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=AIET_7ji7YAC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Internal+Macedonian+Revolutionary+Organization+BULGARIAN+IMRO |title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey: Volume 2, Reform, Revolution, and Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey 1808–1975, by Stanford J.

The uprising and the forming of the Krushevo Republic are considered the cornerstone and precursors to the eventual establishment of the Macedonian state.

===Kingdoms of Serbia and Yugoslavia===
[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries cleanup.jpg|thumb|left|The division of the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] after the [[Balkan Wars]] according to the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]]]
Following the two [[Balkan Wars|Balkan wars]] of 1912 and 1913 and the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], most of its European held territories were divided between [[Greece]], Bulgaria and [[Serbia]]. The territory of the modern Macedonian state was then named ''{{lang|sr|Južna Srbija}}'', &quot;[[Macedonia (terminology)|Southern Serbia]]&quot;. After the First World War, [[Kingdom of Serbia]] became part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. In 1929, the Kingdom was officially renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and divided into provinces called [[banovina (region)|banovinas]]. Southern Serbia, including all of what is now the Republic of Macedonia, became known as the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

The concept of a [[United Macedonia]] was used by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) in the [[interbellum]]. Its leaders – like [[Todor Alexandrov]], [[Aleksandar Protogerov]], [[Ivan Mihailov]], promoted independence of the Macedonian territory split between Serbia and Greece for the whole population, regardless of religion and ethnicity {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

IMRO followed by starting an insurgent war in Vardar Banovina, together with [[Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization]], which also conducted guerilla attacks against the Serbian administrative and army officials there. In 1923 in Stip a paramilitary organisation called [[Association against Bulgarian Bandits]] was formed by Serbian chetniks, IMRO renegades and [[Macedonian Federative Organization]] (MFO) members to oppose IMRO and MMTRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vassil Karloukovski |url=http://www.promacedonia.org/ag/ag_4_6.html |title=Гиза, Антони, &quot;Балканските държави и Македония&quot;, Македонски Научен Институт ­ София, 2001 г |publisher=Promacedonia.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|National Liberation War of Macedonia}}

[[File:Liberation of Skopje.jpg|thumb|left|160|[[Metodija Andonov Chento]] greeted in Skopje after the [[National Liberation War of Macedonia]] in 1944.]]

During World War II, Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis powers|Axis Powers]] from 1941 to 1945. The [[Vardar Banovina]] was divided between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Italy|Italian]]-occupied [[Albania]]. [[Bulgarian Action Committees]] were established and prepared the region for the new Bulgarian administration and army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/bugarash/bccc_1941/index.html Bulgarian Campaign Committees in Macedonia – 1941] Dimitre Mičev&lt;/ref&gt; The Committees were mosltly formed by former members of IMRO, but some communists like [[Panko Brashnarov]], [[Strahil Gigov]] and [[Metodi Shatorov]] also participated.

Bulgarian authorities, under German pressure,&lt;ref&gt;Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to [[concentration camps]], but under German pressure those Jews from their newly annexed territories without Bulgarian citizenship were deported, such as those from Vardar Macedonia and [[Western Thrace]].

He began in earnest to organise armed resistance to the Bulgarian rule and sharply criticized the Sharlo's pro-Bulgarian policy.At a meeting of the partisan brigades, as well as a group of battalions in the Resen region on 21 Dec 1943, Tempo makes the following comments about Shatorov and the leadership of the MCP:...They thought that the Macedonian people were Bulgarians and that they were oppressed by the hegemony of Great Serbia and had to be transferred to Bulgaria. Their basic slogan is: &quot;All non-Macedonians out of Macedonia&quot;. The capital J [Serbo-Croatian spelling of Yugoslavia, Yugoslavian, etc.] was deleted from all documents. In fact they did not want Yugoslavia, no matter where it stood politically. When the war started, the initial decision of this leadership was to be separate from Yugoslavia and from Tito. They declared that Macedonia would be free as soon as the Bulgarians came...&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Liberation War of Macedonia|National Liberation War]] ensued, with German forces being driven out of Macedonia by the end of 1944.

In Vardar Macedonia, after [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944]] the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. Under the leadership of the new Bulgarian pro-Soviet government, four armies, 455,000 strong in total, were mobilized and reorganized. Most of them reentered occupied Yugoslavia in the early October 1944 and moved from Sofia to [[Niš]], Skopje and [[Pristina]] with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=A8X6UH58dlgC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=450+000+bulgarian+army++1944&amp;hl=bg&amp;ei=lw4PTt4G0ar4Bq21nfUP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Axis Forces in Yugoslavia 1941-45, Nigel Thomas, K.

}}
In 1944 the [[ASNOM|Anti-Fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM)]] proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the ''People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''. ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war. The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and the principles of [[Krste Misirkov|Krste Petkov – Misirkov]].

The new republic became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation. Following the federation's renaming as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1963, the People's Republic of Macedonia was likewise renamed, becoming the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. During the [[Greek Civil War|civil war in Greece]] (1946–1949) Macedonian communist insurgents supported the Greek communists. Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia from there. The state dropped the &quot;Socialist&quot; from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.

===Declaration of independence===
The country officially celebrates 8 September 1991 as [[Independence Day (Republic of Macedonia)|Independence day]] ({{lang-mk|Ден на независноста}}, ''Den na nezavisnosta''), with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia, albeit legalising participation in future union of the former states of Yugoslavia. The anniversary of the start of the Ilinden Uprising ([[Elijah|St. Elijah]]'s Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the [[Republic Day (Republic of Macedonia)|Day of the Republic]].

[[Robert Badinter]] as the head of the [[Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia]] recommended EC recognition in January 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050215223455/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archivedate=15 February 2005 |title=Recognition of States: Annex 3 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonia remained at peace through the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav wars]] of the early 1990s. A few very minor changes to its border with Yugoslavia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries. However, it was seriously destabilised by the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, when an estimated 360,000 [[Albanians|ethnic Albanian]] refugees from Kosovo took refuge in the country. Although they departed shortly after the war, soon after, [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|Albanian nationalists]] on both sides of the border took up arms in pursuit of autonomy or independence for the Albanian-populated areas of Macedonia.

===Albanian insurgency===
{{Main|Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia}}
A [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|conflict]] took place between the government and ethnic Albanian insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001. The war ended with the intervention of a [[NATO]] ceasefire monitoring force. Under the terms of the [[Ohrid Agreement]], the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the Albanian minority. The Albanian side agreed to abandon separatist demands and to fully recognise all Macedonian institutions. In addition, according to this accord, the [[National Liberation Army (Albanians of Macedonia)|NLA]] were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtvfan.net/ria-novosti-clashes-between-macedonians-and-albanians-in-macedonia/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Mount Korab, Republic of Macedonia.jpg|thumb|Korab, the tallest mountain in Macedonia]]

Macedonia has a total area of {{convert|25713|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It lies between latitudes [[40th parallel north|40°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[23rd meridian east|23° E]] (a small area lies east of 23°). Macedonia has some {{convert|748|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of boundaries, shared with [[Serbia]] ({{convert|62|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the North, Kosovo ({{convert|159|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the northwest, [[Bulgaria]] ({{convert|148|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the east, [[Greece]] ({{convert|228|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the south, and [[Albania]] ({{convert|151|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the west. It is a transit way for shipment of goods from Greece, through the Balkans, towards Eastern, Western and Central Europe and through Bulgaria to the East. It is part of a larger region also known as [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], which also includes a [[Macedonia (Greece)|region of northern Greece]] known by the same name; and the [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad province]] in southwestern [[geography of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]].

===Topography===
{{Main|Mountains of the Republic of Macedonia}}

Macedonia is a [[landlocked country]] that is geographically clearly defined by a central valley formed by the Vardar river and framed along its borders by mountain ranges. The terrain is mostly rugged, located between the [[Šar Mountains]] and [[Osogovo]], which frame the valley of the [[Vardar]] river. Three large lakes&amp;nbsp;— [[Lake Ohrid]], [[Lake Prespa]] and [[Dojran Lake]]&amp;nbsp;— lie on the southern borders, bisected by the frontiers with Albania and Greece. Ohrid is considered to be one of the oldest lakes and biotopes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.mk/soer2/ohrid_a.htm |title=Macedonian Ministry of Environment |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080119010740/http://www.moe.gov.mk/soer2/ohrid_a.htm |archivedate= 19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is seismically active and has been the site of destructive earthquakes in the past, most recently in 1963 when Skopje was heavily damaged by a major earthquake, killing over 1,000.

Macedonia also has scenic mountains. They belong to two different [[mountain range]]s: the first is the [[Šar Mountains]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523838/Sar-Mountains |title=Britannica's article about Sar Mountains |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euratlas.com/Atlasphys/Sarplanina2.htm |title=Sar Mountains on the Euratlas map of the Europe's most significant mountain ranges |publisher=Euratlas.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that continues to the West Vardar/Pelagonia group of mountains ([[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba Mountain]], [[Nidže]], [[Kožuf|Kozuf]] and [[Jakupica]]), also known as the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric range]]. The second range is the [[Osogovo]]–[[Belasica]] mountain chain, also known as the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope range]]. The mountains belonging to the Šar Mountains and the West Vardar/Pelagonia range are younger and higher than the older mountains that are part of the Osogovo-Belasica mountain group.  [[Mount Korab]] of the Šar Mountains on the Albanian border, at 2,764 m (9,068 ft), is the tallest mountain in Macedonia.

===Hydrography===
[[File:SmolareWaterfall.JPG|thumb|right|[[Smolare Waterfall]]]]
In the Republic of Macedonia there are 1,100 larger sources of water. The rivers flow into three different basins: the Aegean, the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and the [[Black Sea]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymacedonia.net/links/geography.htm |title=Macedonia |publisher=Mymacedonia.net |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aegean basin is the largest. It covers 87% of the territory of the Republic, which is 22,075&amp;nbsp;km. sq. [[Vardar]], the largest river in this basin, drains 80% of the territory or 20,459&amp;nbsp;km. sq. Its valley plays an important part in the economy and the communication system of the country. The project named 'The Vardar Valley' is considered to be crucial for the strategic development of the country.

The river [[Black Drin]] forms the Adriatic basin, which covers an area of about 3,320&amp;nbsp;km. sq., i. e. 13% of the territory. It receives water from Lakes Prespa and Ohrid.

The Black Sea basin is the smallest with only 37&amp;nbsp;km. sq. It covers the northern side of Mount [[Skopska Crna Gora]]. This is the source of the river Binachka Morava, which joins the [[Great Morava|Morava]], and later, the [[Danube]] which flows into the Black Sea.

Even though it is a landlocked country, Macedonia has three lakes and around fifty ponds. [[Lake Ohrid]], [[Lake Prespa]] and [[Lake Dojran]] are the three natural lakes of the country.

The Macedonian word for [[spa]] is бања, transliterated as banja. In the country there are 9 spa towns and resorts: Banište, Banja Bansko, Istibanja, Katlanovo, [[Kežovica]], Kosovrasti, Banja Kočani, Kumanovski Banji and Negorci.

===Climate===
{{See also|Geography of Republic of Macedonia#Climate|l1=Climate of the Republic of Macedonia}}

Macedonia has a transitional climate from Mediterranean to continental. The summers are hot and dry and the winters are moderately cold. Average annual precipitation varies from {{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the western mountainous area to {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the eastern area. There are three main climatic zones in the country: temperate Mediterranean, mountainous and mildly Continental. Along the valleys of the [[Vardar]] and [[Strumica]] rivers, in the regions of [[Gevgelija]], [[Valandovo]], [[Dojran]], [[Strumica]] and [[Radoviš]] the climate is temperate Mediterranean. The warmest regions are [[Demir Kapija]] and [[Gevgelija]], where the temperature in July and August frequently exceeds {{convert|40|°C|°F}}. The mountainous climate is present in the mountainous regions of the country and it is characterised by long and snowy winters and short and cold summers. The spring is colder than the fall. The majority of Macedonia has a moderate [[continental climate]] with warm and dry summers and relatively cold and wet winters. There are 30 main and regular weather stations in the country.

===National parks===
The country has 3 [[national park]]s:

==Flora==
{{Main|Flora of Macedonia}}
[[File:Pinus peuce Habitus BotGardBln0906.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Pinus peuce]]'', the Macedonian Pine or Molika, one of Macedonia's most recognizable trees]]

The [[flora]] of Republic of Macedonia is represented with around 210 [[family (biology)|families]], 920 [[genus (biology)|genera]], and around 3,700 plant [[species]]. The most abundant group are the [[flowering plant]]s with around 3,200 species, which is followed by [[moss]]es (350 species) and [[fern]]s (42).

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Macedonia belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of the Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Pindus Mountains]] [[mixed forests]], [[Balkan]] [[mixed forests]], [[Rhodopes]] [[mixed forests]] and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[sclerophyllous]] and [[mixed forests]].

[[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|National Park of Pelister]] in Bitola is known for the presence of the endemic [[Macedonian Pine]], as well as some 88 species of plants representing almost 30 percent of Macedonian dendroflora. The Macedonian Pine forests on Pelister are divided into two communities; pine forests with ferns and pine forests with junipers. The Macedonian Pine, as a specific conifer species, is a [[relict]] of tertiary flora and the five-needle pine [[Macedonian Pine|Molika]], was first noted on Pelister in 1893.

Macedonia's limited forest growth also includes [[Macedonian Oak]]s, the sycamore, weeping willows, white willows, alders, poplars, elms, and the common ash. Near the rich pastures on Šar Mountain and Bistra, Mavrovo, is another plant species characteristic of plant life in Macedonia—the poppy. The quality of thick [[poppy]] juice is measured worldwide by morphine units; while Chinese [[opium]] contains eight such units and is considered to be of high quality, Indian opium contains seven units, and [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[opium]] only six, Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units and is one of the best quality opium in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=246 |title=Macedonian Flora |publisher=Macedonia.co.uk |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Fauna of Macedonia}}

The fauna of Macedonian forests is abundant and includes bears, wild boars, wolves, foxes, squirrels, chamois and deer. The lynx is found, although very rarely, in the mountains of western Macedonia, while deer can be found in the region of Demir Kapija. Forest birds include the blackcap, the grouse, the black grouse, the imperial eagle and the forest owl.

The three artificial lakes of the country represent a separate fauna zone, an indication of long-lasting territorial and temporal isolation. The fauna of Lake Ohrid is a relict of an earlier era and the lake is widely known for its letnica trout, lake [[Lake whitefish|whitefish]], [[Gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]], [[Rutilus|roach]], podust, and pior, as well as for certain species of snails of a genus older than 30&amp;nbsp;million years; similar species can only be found in [[Lake Baikal]]. Lake Ohrid is also noted in zoology texts for the [[European eel]] and its baffling reproductive cycle: it comes to Lake Ohrid from the distant [[Sargasso Sea]], thousands of kilometres away, and lurks in the depths of the lake for 10&amp;nbsp;years. When sexually mature, the eel is driven by unexplained instincts in the autumn to set off back to its point of birth. There it spawns and dies, leaving its offspring to seek out Lake Ohrid to begin the cycle anew.

===Domestic animals===
The shepherd dog of Šar Mountain is known worldwide as [[Šarplaninac|Šarplaninec]] (Yugoslav shepherd). It stands some 60&amp;nbsp;centimeters tall and is a brave and fierce fighter that may be called upon to fight bears or wolf packs in guarding and defending flocks. The Šarplaninec originates from the shepherd's dog of the ancient Epirotes, the molossus, but the Šarplaninec was recognized as its own breed in 1939 under the name of &quot;Illyrian shepherd&quot; and since 1956 has been known as Šarplaninec.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Macedonia-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|Map of The Republic of Macedonia.]]
Macedonia is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with an [[executive (government)|executive government]] composed of a coalition of parties from the [[unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] ({{lang|mk|Собрание, ''Sobranie''}}) and an independent [[judiciary|judicial branch]] with a [[constitutional court]]. The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the President of the Government. The President is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the state armed forces and a president of the [[National security|state Security]] Council. The President is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most. On the second run of the [[Macedonian presidential election, 2009|presidential elections held on 5 April 2009]], [[Gjorge Ivanov]] was elected as new Macedonian president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ivanov-elected-new-macedonian-president |title=Ivanov Elected New Macedonian President |publisher=BalkanInsight |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005, local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities ({{lang|mk|општини, ''opštini''}}; [[Grammatical number|singular]]: {{lang|mk|општина, ''opština''}}). The capital, [[Skopje]], is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as the &quot;City of Skopje&quot;. Municipalities in Macedonia are units of local self-government. Neighbouring municipalities may establish co-operative arrangements.

The country's main political divergence is between the largely ethnically based political parties representing the country's ethnic Macedonian majority and Albanian minority. The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in 2001, following which a power-sharing agreement was reached. In August 2004, Macedonia's parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate.

After a troublesome pre-election campaign, Macedonia saw a relatively calm and democratic [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2006|change of government]] in the elections held on 5 July 2006. The elections were marked by a decisive victory of the centre-right party [[VMRO–DPMNE|VMRO-DPMNE]] led by [[Nikola Gruevski]]. Gruevski's decision to include the [[Democratic Party of Albanians]] in the new government, instead of the [[Democratic Union for Integration]] – [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]] coalition which won the majority of the Albanian votes, triggered protests throughout the parts of the country with a respective number of Albanian population. However, recently a dialogue was established between the Democratic Union for Integration and the ruling VMRO-DMPNE party as an effort to talk about the disputes between the two parties and to support European and NATO aspirations of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://limun.hr/en/main.aspx?id=127474 |title=Ahmeti accepts the invitation for dialog with Gruevski |publisher=Limun.hr |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the early parliamentary elections held in 2008, [[VMRO–DPMNE|VMRO-DPMNE]] and [[Democratic Union for Integration]] formed a ruling coalition in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/07/08/feature-02 |title=VMRO-DPMNE and DUI form ruling coalition in Macedonia |publisher=SeTimes |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, presidential and local elections in the country were carried out peacefully, which was crucial for Macedonian aspirations to join the EU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0322/breaking39.htm |title=Macedonia elections pass off peacefully |publisher=Irish Times |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling conservative [[VMRO–DPMNE|VMRO-DPMNE]] party won a victory in the local elections and the candidate supported by the party, Gjorgi Ivanov, was elected as the new Macedonian president.

===Parliament===
{{Main|Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Macedonian parliament interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the Parliament Building in Skopje]]
The Macedonian parliament or ''Sobranie'' ({{lang-mk|Собрание}}) is the country's [[legislature|legislative body]]. It makes, proposes and adopts laws. The 120 members are elected for a mandate of four years through a general election. Each Macedonian citizen that is above 18&amp;nbsp;years can vote for one of the Macedonian political parties. The current president of the Macedonian Parliament is [[Trajko Veljanovski]].

===Government===
Executive power in Macedonia is exercised by the Government, whose prime minister is the most politically powerful person in the country. The members of the government are chosen by the Prime Minister and there are ministers for each branch of the society. There are ministers for economy, finance, information technology, society, internal affairs, foreign affairs and other areas. The members of the Government are elected for a mandate of four years. The current Prime Minister is [[Nikola Gruevski]] who is serving his third consecutive term in office.


===Law and courts===
Judiciary power is exercised by courts, with the court system being headed by the Judicial [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]], Constitutional Court and the Republican Judicial Council. The assembly appoints the judges.

Macedonia became a member state of the UN on 8 April 1993, eighteen months after its independence from Yugoslavia. It is referred to within the UN as &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot;, pending a resolution of the [[#Macedonia naming dispute|long-running dispute]] with [[Greece]] about the country's name.

The major interest of the country is a full integration in the European and the [[wikt:transatlantic|Trans-Atlantic]] integration processes. Five foreign policy priorities are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=308 |title=Republic of Macedonia, Ministry of foreign affairs |publisher=Mfa.gov.mk |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* NATO membership

* Commencing negotiations for full-fledged membership in the European Union

* Lifting the [[visa (document)|visa]] regime for Macedonian nationals

* Resolving the naming issue with Greece

* Strengthening the economic and [[public diplomacy]]
Macedonia is member of the following international and regional organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=314 |title=Republic of Macedonia, Ministry of foreign affairs |publisher=Mfa.gov.mk |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] (since 1992), [[World Health Organization|WHO]] (since 1993), [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]] (since 1993), [[Central European Initiative]] (since 1993), [[Council of Europe]] (since 1995), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] (since 1995), [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative|SECI]] (since 1996), [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] (since 2003), [[Central European Free Trade Agreement|CEFTA]] (since 2006), [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]] (since 2001).

In 2005, the country was officially recognized as a [[European Union]] candidate state.

On the NATO summit held in [[Bucharest]] in April 2008, Macedonia failed to gain an invitation to join the organisation because Greece vetoed the move after the dispute over the name issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=M3 Web – http://m3web.bg |url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=91875 |title=Bulgaria: Macedonia Remains Out of NATO Because of Greek Veto over Name Dispute – Novinite.com – Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USA had previously expressed support for an invitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/2/worldupdates/2008-04-02T203446Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-328122-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates |title=Greece stands by NATO veto threat for Macedonia |publisher=Thestar.com.my |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the summit then decided to extend an invitation only on condition of a resolution of the naming conflict with Greece.

In March 2009 the [[European Parliament]] expressed support for Macedonia's EU candidacy and asked the EU Commission to grant the country a date for the start of accession talks by the end of 2009. The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for Macedonian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ep-urges-accession-talks-for-macedonia |title=EP Urges Accession Talks For Macedonia |publisher=BalkanInsight.com |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Macedonia has so far failed to receive a start date for accession talks as a result of the naming dispute. The EU's stance is similar to NATO's in that resolution of the naming dispute is a precondition for the start of accession talks.

In October, 2012  the EU Enlargement Commissioner [[Štefan Füle]] proposed a start of accession negotiations with Macedonia for the fourth time,  while the previouse efforts were blocked each time by Greece. At the same time Füle visited Bulgaria in a bid to clarify the state's position with respect to Macedonia. He established that Bulgaria almost has joined Greece in vetoing the accession talks with Macedonia. Bulgarian position was that Sofia cannot grant an EU certificate to Skopje, which is systematically employing an ideology of hate towards Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/enlargement/bulgaria-vetoes-macedonia-eu-acc-news-515809 EurActiv, 02 November 2012, Bulgaria vetoes Macedonia’s EU accession.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Naming dispute====
{{Main|Macedonia naming dispute}}
After the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the name of Macedonia became the object of a dispute between Greece and the newly independent Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite news |publisher=24 (1996) Journal of Political and Military Sociology, 285|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910/ |title=A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name? An Analysis of Greece's Dispute with FYROM |accessdate=11 February 2008 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the south, the Republic of Macedonia borders the region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]], which administratively is split into three [[Peripheries of Greece|peripheries]] (one of them comprising both [[Western Thrace]] and a part of Greek Macedonia). Citing [[Macedonia naming dispute#Greek position|historical and territorial concerns]] resulting from the ambiguity between the Republic of Macedonia, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia and the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|kingdom of Macedon]] which falls within Greek Macedonia, Greece opposes the use of the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; by the Republic of Macedonia without a geographical qualifier, supporting a compound name (such as &quot;Northern Macedonia&quot;) for use by all and for all purposes (''[[erga omnes]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/ FYROM Name Issue], Hellenic Republic - Ministry of Foreign Affairs &lt;/ref&gt; As millions of ethnic Greeks identify themselves as [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Macedonians]], unrelated to the Slavic people who are associated with the Republic of Macedonia, Greece further objects to the use of the term &quot;Macedonian&quot; for the neighboring country's largest [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic group]]. The Republic of Macedonia is accused of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered parts of [[Culture of Greece|Greece's culture]] (such as [[Vergina Sun]], a symbol associated with the ancient kingdom of Macedon, and [[Alexander the Great]]), and of promoting the [[irredentist]] concept of a [[United Macedonia]], which would include territories of [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Serbia]].

From 1992 to 1995, the two countries also engaged in a dispute over the Macedonian state's first flag, which incorporated the Vergina Sun symbol. This aspect of the dispute was resolved when the flag was changed under the terms of an interim accord agreed between the two states in October 1995.
[[File:Flag of the Republic of Macedonia 1992-1995.svg|thumb|The first [[Flag of the Republic of Macedonia#&quot;Vergina Flag&quot; (1992–1995)|flag of sovereign Macedonia]] (1991–1995) was also part of the dispute with [[Greece]].]]
The UN adopted the provisional reference &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot; ({{lang-mk|Поранешна Југословенска Република Македонија}}) when the country was admitted to the organization in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r225.htm |title=United Nations Resolution 225 (1993) |publisher=United Nations |date=8 April 1993 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most international organizations, such as the [[European Union]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]], and the [[International Olympic Committee]], adopted the same convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=European Commission |title= Background information&amp;nbsp;— The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia |url= http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/international/bilateral/background/mk1_en.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071223150634/http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/international/bilateral/background/mk1_en.html |archivedate= 23 December 2007 |accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=European Broadcasting Union |title= Members' Logos |url= http://www.ebu.ch/members/members_logos.php |accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/archives/pdf/key_documents/2005/package/sec_1425_final_analytical_report_mk_en.pdf |title=Analytical Report for the Opinion on the application from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for EU membership |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/maps/applicants/fyrom_en.htm |title=Europa – The EU at a glance – Maps – FYROM |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=International Olympic Committee |title= List of national olympic committees participating in the xix olympic winter games in salt lake city |url= http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_258.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NATO]] also uses the reference in official documents but adds an explanation on which member countries recognize the constitutional name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=North Atlantic Treaty Organisation |title= The situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is critical |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/0723/e0725a.htm |accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same reference is also used in any discussion to which Greece is a party&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1737425.stm Bid to settle Macedonia name row], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most UN member countries have abandoned the provisional reference and have recognised the country as the ''Republic of Macedonia'' instead. These include four of the five permanent [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] members—the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= US snubs Greece over Macedonia |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3981499.stm |publisher=BBC News |date= 4 November 2004 |accessdate=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]], United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China; several members of the [[European Union]] such as [[Bulgaria]], Poland, and [[Slovenia]]; and over 100 other [[List of United Nations member states|UN members]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Opinion/comm_20050916Tziampiris.html Naming the solution]&quot;, ''[[Kathimerini]]'' English edition, 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The UN has set up a negotiating process with a mediator, [[Matthew Nimetz]], and the two disputed parties, Macedonia and Greece, to try to mediate the dispute. Negotiations continue between the two sides but have yet to reach any settlement of the dispute.

Initially the [[European Community]]-nominated Arbitration Commission's opinion was that &quot;the use of the name 'Macedonia' cannot therefore imply any territorial claim against another State&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050215223455/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archivedate=15 February 2005 |title=European Journal of International Law |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the commission's opinion, Greece continued to object to the establishment of relations between the Community and the Republic under its constitutional name.&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite web |publisher=in: Kourvetaris et al.

A Name for a Conflict? FYROM's Dispute with Greece Revisited|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the coming to power in 2006, and especially since Macedonia's non-invitation to NATO in 2008, the VMRO-DPMNE government has pursued a policy of &quot;[[Macedonian nationalism#Post-independence period and Antiquisation|Antiquisation]]&quot; (&quot;Antikvizatzija&quot;) as a way of putting pressure on Greece as well as for the purposes of domestic identity-building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgievski&quot;&gt;''Ghosts of the past endanger Macedonia's future''. Boris Georgievski, BalkanInsight, October 27, 2009 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ghosts-of-the-past-endanger-macedonia-s-future].&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip of Macedon]] have been built in several cities across the country. Additionally, many pieces of public infrastructure, such as airports, highways, and stadiums have been renamed after Alexander and Philip. These actions are seen as deliberate provocations in neighboring Greece, exacerbating the dispute and further stalling Macedonia's EU and NATO applications.&lt;ref&gt;''Greece slates Skopje's provocative Alexander statue'' Sinisa Jakov Marusic, Balkan Insight, 15 June 2011 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/greece-slates-skopje-s-provocative-alexander-statue]&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has also attracted criticism domestically, as well as from EU diplomats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgievski&quot;/&gt;

In November 2008, Macedonia instituted proceedings before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) against [[Greece]] alleging violations of the 1995 Interim Accord that blocked its accession to NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Davorin – Ljubljana |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081117-macedonia-sues-greece-blocking-nato-entry-membership-name |title=Macedonia sues Greece for blocking NATO entry |publisher=France 24 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICJ was requested to order Greece to observe its obligations within the Accord, which is legally binding for both countries.  In 2011 The United Nations' [[International Court of Justice]] ruled that [[Greece]] violated Article 11 of the 1995 Interim Accord by vetoing Macedonia's bid for [[NATO]] membership at the 2008 summit in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia institutes proceedings against Greece for a violation of Article 11 of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/14881.pdf|publisher=International Court of Justice|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court however did not grant Macedonia's request that it instruct Greece to refrain from similar actions in the future, nor has there been to date a change in the EU's stance that Macedonia's accession negotiations cannot begin until the name issue is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21541400 The Economist, Dec. 11 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in the Republic of Macedonia}}

The Republic of Macedonia is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the U.N. Geneva [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] and [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]], and the Macedonian Constitution guarantees basic human rights to all Macedonian citizens.

There do however continue to be problems with [[human rights]]. According to human rights organisations, in 2003 there were suspected extrajudicial executions, threats and intimidation against human rights activists and opposition journalists and allegations of [[torture]] by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/macedonia?page=2 |title=Amnesty International – Summary – Macedonia |publisher=Web.amnesty.org |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrw2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/macedonia/ Human Rights Watch – Campaigns – Conflict in Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has problems with the human rights of its ethnic minorities. Although Albanians have recently been allowed to study in the [[Albanian language]], before graduating from university they are required to pass a test of their comprehension and use of the [[Macedonian language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hrw2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/europe/macedonia.html |title=Human Rights Watch – Macedonia |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
{{Main|Military of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Mi-24 Macedonian.jpg|thumb|right|[[Macedonian Air Force]] [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24]] helicopter]]
The [[Army of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Armed Forces]] comprise the army, [[Macedonian Air Force|air force]] and [[Wolves (military)|Special Forces]]. The government's national defence policy aims to guarantee the preservation of the independence and sovereignty of the state, the integrity of its land area and airspace and its constitutional order. Its main goals remain the development and maintenance of a credible capability to defend the nation's vital interests and development of the Armed Forces in a way that ensures their interoperability with the armed forces of NATO and the European Union member states and their capability to participate in the full range of NATO missions.

The Ministry of Defence develops the defence strategy and works out the assessment of the possible threats and risks. The MOD is also responsible for the defence system, training, readiness of the Armed Forces, the equipment and the development and it proposes the defence budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morm.gov.mk/morm/en/ARM/Defence-Structure.html National Command Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Republic of Macedonia}}
Ranked as the fourth 'best reformatory state' out of 178 countries ranked by the [[World Bank]] in 2009, Macedonia has undergone considerable economic reform since independence.&lt;ref name= &quot;worldbank&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/eca/eca.nsf/Countries/Macedonia/fffd3db0d7306bfd85256c250061ac88?OpenDocument |title=Macedonia Country Brief |publisher=The World Bank |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}{{nonspecific|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has developed an [[open economy]] with trade accounting for more than 90% of GDP in recent years. Since 1996, Macedonia has witnessed steady, though slow, [[economic growth]] with GDP growing by 3.1% in 2005. This figure was projected to rise to an average of 5.2% in the 2006–2010 period.&lt;ref name= &quot;worldbank-devdata&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/mkd_aag.pdf |title=World Bank development data |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has proven successful in its efforts to combat inflation, with an [[inflation rate]] of only 3% in 2006 and 2% in 2007,&lt;ref name= &quot;worldbank&quot;/&gt; and has implemented policies focused on attracting [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The current government introduced a [[flat tax]] system with the intention of making the country more attractive to foreign investment. The flat tax rate was 12% in 2007 and was further lowered to 10% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.mk/english/News/December2006/ei8-12-2006.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080127122623/http://www.vlada.mk/english/News/December2006/ei8-12-2006.htm |archivedate=27 January 2008 |title=Government of the Republic of Macedonia |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/macedonias-new-flat-tax-51002.aspx |title=Macedonia's Flat Tax |publisher=Nuwireinvestor.com |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these reforms, as of 2005 Macedonia's [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] was 37.2%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org.mk/ |title=Macedonian unemployment rate |publisher=Worldbank.org.mk |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2006 its [[poverty threshold|poverty rate]] was 22%.&lt;ref name= &quot;worldbank-devdata&quot;/&gt; Macedonia has one of the highest shares of people struggling financially, with 72% of its citizens stating that they could only manage on their household’s income ‘with difficulty’ or ‘with great difficulty', though Macedonia, along with Croatia, was the only country in the Western Balkans to not report an increase in this statistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkan-monitor.eu/files/BalkanMonitor-2010_Summary_of_Findings.pdf Gallup Balkan Monitor], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption and a relatively ineffective legal system also act as significant restraints on successful [[economic development]]. Macedonia still has one of the lowest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|per capita GDPs]] in Europe. Furthermore, the country's [[grey market]] is estimated at close to 20% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;The 2006 [[The World Factbook|CIA Factbook]] [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mk.html CIA Factbook Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of structure, as of 2005 the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] constituted by far the largest part of GDP at 57.1%, up from 54.2% in 2000. The [[Secondary sector of the economy|industrial sector]] represents 29.3% of GDP, down from 33.7% in 2000 while agriculture represents only 12.9%, up from 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://devdata.worldbank.org/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080118004059/http://devdata.worldbank.org/ |archivedate=18 January 2008 |title=Welcome to World Bank Group |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=18 January 2008 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles represent the most significant sector for trade, accounting for more than half of total exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonianembassy.org.uk/economy.html |title=Macedonian Embassy London |publisher=Macedonianembassy.org.uk |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important exports include iron, steel, wine and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=290 |title=Macedonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |publisher=Mfa.gov.mk |date=31 December 2005 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] of US$9,157 at [[purchasing power parity]] and a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] of 0.701, Macedonia is less developed and has a considerably smaller economy than most of the former Yugoslav states.

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Macedonian PPS GDP per capita stood at 36% of the EU average in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114|title=GDP per capita in PPS|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure and e-infrastructure===
Macedonia, together with [[Montenegro]], Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Kosovo]], belonged to the less-developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia. It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence, when the Yugoslav [[internal market]] collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended. In addition, it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist [[Eastern Europe|East European]] countries during the transition to a [[market economy]]. Its main land and rail exports route, through [[Serbia]], remains unreliable with high transit costs, thereby affecting the export of its formerly highly profitable, early vegetables market to Germany. Macedonia's IT market increased 63.8% year on year in 2007, which is the fastest growing in the Adriatic region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idc-cema.com/?showproduct=34598 &quot;Investment in Government, Finance, and Telecom Sectors Makes Macedonia's IT Market the Fastest Growing in the Adriatic Region, Says IDC&quot;], ''IDC'' (global provider of market intelligence)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade and investment===
The outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the imposition of sanctions on [[Serbia and Montenegro]] caused great damage to the Republic's economy, with Serbia constituting 60% of its markets before the disintegration of Yugoslavia. When Greece imposed a [[embargo|trade embargo]] on the Republic in 1994–95, the economy was also affected. Some relief was afforded by the end of the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian war]] in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo, but the Kosovo War of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilisation. 

Since the end of the Greek embargo, Greece has become the country's most important business partner. (See [[Greek investments in the Republic of Macedonia]].) Many Greek companies have bought former state companies in Macedonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&amp;folder=19&amp;article=24108 |title=Greek investments in FYROM at 1 bil. Euros |publisher=Greekembassy.org |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[oil refinery]] Okta, the baking company Zhito Luks, a marble mine in [[Prilep]], textile facilities in [[Bitola]], etc., and employ 20,000 people. However, local cross-border trade between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia sees thousands of Greek shoppers visiting to purchase cheaper domestic products.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} 

Other key partners are Germany, Italy, the United States, Slovenia, Austria and Turkey.

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Macedonia}}
Tourism is an important part of the [[economy of the Republic of Macedonia]]. The country's large abundance of natural and cultural attractions make it an attractive destination of visitors. It receives about 700,000 tourists annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faq.macedonia.org/information/101.html |title=101 facts about Macedonia |publisher=Faq.macedonia.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative regions==
{{Main|Statistical regions of Macedonia}}
Macedonia's statistical regions exist solely for legal and statistical purposes. The regions are:
[[File:MSR.png|250px|right|thumb|Macedonian statistical regions]]
*[[Skopje statistical region|Skopje]]
*[[Pelagonia statistical region|Pelagonia]]

===Municipalities===
{{Main|Municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia}}

In August 2004, the Republic of Macedonia was reorganised into 84 municipalities (''{{lang|mk|opštini}}''; sing. ''{{lang|mk|opština}}''); 10 of the municipalities constitute the [[Greater Skopje|City of Skopje]], a distinct unit of local self-government and the country's capital.

Most of the current municipalities were unaltered or merely amalgamated from the previous 123 municipalities established in September 1996; others were consolidated and their borders changed. Prior to this, local government was organised into 34 administrative districts, communes, or counties (also opštini).

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of the Republic of Macedonia|List of cities in the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonians (ethnic group)|}}
The last census data from 2002 shows a population of 2,022,547 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;stat.gov.mk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in the Republic of Macedonia, 2002 – Book XIII, Skopje, 2005.|publisher=State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/pdf/kniga_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The last official estimate from 2009, without significant change, gives a figure of 2,050,671.&lt;ref name='dzs'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/OblastOpsto_en.aspx?id=2 |title=Macedonia - State Statistical Office |publisher=www.stat.gov.mk}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the last census data the largest [[ethnic group]] in the country are the [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]. The second largest group are the [[Albanians]] who dominated much of the northwestern part of the country. Some unofficial estimates indicate that in the Republic of Macedonia there are possibly up to 260,000 [[Roma in the Republic of Macedonia|Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://europeandcis.undp.org/uploads/public/File/rbec_web/vgr/chapter1.1.pdf [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]'s Regional Bureau for Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthodox Christian]]ity is the majority faith of the Republic of Macedonia making up 64.7% of the population, the vast majority of which belong to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. Various other [[Christian denomination]]s account for 0.37% of the population. Muslims comprise 33.3% of the population; Macedonia has the fifth-highest proportion of Muslims in Europe, after those of [[Turkey]] (96%), [[Kosovo]] (90%), [[Albania]] (82%), and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] (48%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Muslims are [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], or [[Romani people|Roma]], although some are [[Macedonian Muslims]]. The remaining 1.63% is recorded as &quot;unspecified&quot; in the 2002 national census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mk.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, there are 1,842 churches and 580 mosques in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnevnik&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/?ItemID=A080C78F46FF724BB7AA82A63C63251E|title=Во Македонија има 1.842 цркви и 580 џамии|date=28 December 2011|publisher=Dnevnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox and Islamic religious communities have secondary religion schools in Skopje. There is an Orthodox [[Seminary|theological college]] in the capital. The Macedonian Orthodox Church has jurisdiction over 10 provinces (seven in the country and three abroad), has 10 bishops and about 350 priests. A total of 30,000 people are baptised in all the provinces every year.

There is a tension between the Macedonian and [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]es which arose from the former's separation and self-declared [[autocephaly]] in 1967. However, the Archbishop's Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church, with Decision No. 06/1959, has recognised the autonomy (self-dependence) of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. After the negotiations between the two churches were suspended, the Serbian Orthodox Church recognised a group led by Zoran Vraniškovski (also known as [[Archbishop Jovan VI of Ohrid|Archbishop Jovan of Ohrid]], a former Macedonian church bishop, as the [[Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric|Archbishop of Ohrid]].

The reaction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church was to cut off all relations with the new Ohrid Archbishopric and to prevent bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church from entering Macedonia. Bishop Jovan was jailed for 18&amp;nbsp;months for &quot;defaming the Macedonian Orthodox church and harming the religious feelings of local citizens&quot; by distributing Serbian Orthodox church calendars and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=bcr&amp;s=f&amp;o=257037&amp;apc_state=henibcr200508 |title=Church Rivalry Threatens to Brim Over |publisher=Iwpr.net |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Macedonian Byzantine Catholic Church]] has approximately 11,000 adherents in Macedonia. The Church was established in 1918, and is made up mostly of converts to Catholicism and their descendants. The Church is of the [[Byzantine Rite]] and is in communion with the Roman and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Its liturgical worship is performed in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David M. Cheney |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/mk.html |title=Catholic Church in Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Catholic-Hierarchy&amp;#93; |publisher=Catholic-hierarchy.org |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small [[Protestantism|Protestant]] community. The most famous Protestant in the country is the late president [[Boris Trajkovski]]. He was from the [[Methodism|Methodist]] community, which is the largest and oldest Protestant church in the Republic, dating back to the late 19th century. Since the 1980s the Protestant community has grown, partly through new confidence and partly with outside missionary help.

The Macedonian [[Judaism|Jewish community]], which numbered some 7,200 people on the eve of World War II, was almost entirely destroyed during the war: only [[Holocaust Memorial Center for the Jews of Macedonia|2% of Macedonian Jews survived]] the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/2007/03/14/macedonia%E2%80%99s-jewish-community-commemorates-the-holocaust-and-embraces-the-future/ |title=Blog Archives » Macedonia's Jewish Community Commemorates the Holocaust, and Embraces the Future |publisher=Balkanalysis.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their liberation and the end of the War, most opted to emigrate to [[Israel]]. Today, the country's Jewish community numbers approximately 200 persons, almost all of whom live in Skopje. Most Macedonian Jews are [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] – the descendants of 15th century refugees who had fled the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s.

According to the 2002 Census, 46.5% of the children aged 0–4 were Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/publikacii/knigaIX.pdf |title=naslovna-9PUB |format=PDF |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Macedonian language|Languages in the Republic of Macedonia}}

The official and most widely spoken language is [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], which belongs to the Eastern branch of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] language group. In municipalities where ethnic groups are represented with over 20% of the total population, the language of that ethnic group is co-official.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.president.gov.mk/en/about-macedonia/basic-facts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonian is closely related to and [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with [[Bulgarian language|Standard Bulgarian]]. It also has some similarities with standard [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and the intermediate [[Torlak]]ian and [[Shopi|Shop]] dialects spoken mostly in southern Serbia and western Bulgaria (and by speakers in the north and east of Macedonia). The [[standard language]] was [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the period following [[World War II]] and has accumulated a thriving literary tradition. Although it is the only language explicitly designated as an official [[national language]] in the constitution, in municipalities where at least 20% of the population is part of another [[minority group|ethnic minority]], those individual languages are used for official purposes in local government, alongside Macedonian.

According to the last census, 1,344,815 Macedonian citizens declared that they spoke Macedonian, 507,989 citizens spoke [[Albanian language|Albanian]], 71,757 citizens spoke [[Turkish language|Turkish]], 38,528 citizens spoke [[Romani language|Romani]], 6,884 citizens spoke [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], 24,773 citizens spoke [[Serbian language|Serbian]], 8,560 citizens spoke [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and 19,241 citizens spoke other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaX.pdf Macedonian census, language and religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of languages are spoken in Macedonia, reflecting its ethnic diversity. Besides the official national language, Macedonian, [[minority language]]s with substantial numbers of speakers are [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (including [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish language|Balkan Gagauz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnologue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MK|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|year=2005|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Serbian language|Serbian]]/[[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] (including [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;United Nations Document&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/974c7c980fa0cce7802566870032a38e?Opendocument|title=Core document forming part of the reports of States Parties : The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurominority&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurominority.eu/version/eng/minority-state2.asp?id_states=28|title=Macedonia ethnic and linguistic minorities|publisher=Eurominority |accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurominority.eu/version/maps/map-european-languages.asp|title=Map of the European languages|publisher=Eurominority|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/83/1983-004-1B1C7082.gif|title=Indo-European languages in contemporary Eurasia|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=4 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/countries/macedonia.shtml|title=BBC: Languages across Europe – Macedonia|publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eupedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/maps_of_europe.shtml#languages|title=Europe languages map|publisher=Eupedia|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few villages of [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] speakers and an immigrant [[Greek language|Greek]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ell|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|year=2005|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MK|title=Lewis, M.

===Education===
[[File:Ss Cyril and Methodius University campus Skopje.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The state university [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje|Ss. Cyril and Methodius]] in the capital Skopje]]
The Macedonian [[education|education system]] consists of:
*[[Kindergarten|pre-school education]]
* primary
* secondary
* higher

The higher levels of education can be obtained at one of the five state universities: [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje]], [[St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola]], [[Goce Delčev University of Štip]], [[State University of Tetovo]] and [[University for Information Science and Technology|University for Information Science and Technology &quot;St. Paul The Apostle&quot; in Ohrid]]. There are a number of private university institutions, such as the European University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oic.org.mk/ OIC.org.mk]&lt;/ref&gt; Slavic University in [[Sveti Nikole]], the [[South East European University]] and others.

The [[United States Agency for International Development]] has underwritten a project called &quot;Macedonia Connects&quot; which has made Macedonia the first all-broadband wireless country in the world. The Ministry of Education and Sciences reports that 461 schools (primary and secondary) are now connected to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/ |title=U.S. Agency for International Development |publisher=Macedonia.usaid.gov |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Provider]] (On.net), has created a MESH Network to provide WIFI services in the 11 largest cities/towns in the country.

==Society==
===Cinema and media===
{{Main|Cinema of the Republic of Macedonia}}
The [[history of film]] making in the republic dates back over 110&amp;nbsp;years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in Bitola. Throughout the past century, the medium of film has depicted the history, culture and everyday life of the Macedonian people. Over the years many Macedonian films have been presented at [[film festival]]s around the world and several of these films have won prestigious awards. The first Macedonian feature film was &quot;''Frosina''&quot;, released in 1952. The first feature film in colour was &quot;''Miss Stone''&quot;, a movie about a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionary in [[Macedonia (terminology)#Ottoman Macedonia|Ottoman Macedonia]]. It was released in 1958. The highest grossing feature film in the Republic of Macedonia was [[Bal-Can-Can]], having been seen by over 500,000 people in its first year alone.

The oldest newspaper in the country is ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' from 1944. Other well known newspaper and magazines are: ''[[Utrinski vesnik|Utrinski Vesnik]]'', ''[[Dnevnik (Skopje)|Dnevnik]]'', ''Vest'', ''Fokus'', ''[[Večer (Skopje)|Večer]]'', ''[[Tea Moderna (magazine)|Tea Moderna]]'', ''[[Makedonsko Sonce]]'', and ''Koha''. Public channel is [[Macedonian Radio-Television]] founded in 1993 by the [[Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia]]. [[TEKO TV]] (1989) from [[Štip]] is the first private [[television channel]] in the country. Other popular private TV's also are: ''[[Sitel (TV channel)|Sitel]]'', ''[[Kanal 5 (Macedonia)|Kanal 5]]'', ''[[Telma (TV channel)|Telma]]'', ''[[Alfa TV (TV channel Macedonia)|Alfa TV]]'', ''[[Alsat-M]]'' and etc.

In 1994 Milco Manchevski's film &quot;Before the Rain&quot; was nominated as Best [[World cinema|Foreign Film]]. Manchevski continues to be the most prominent modern filmmaker in the country having subsequently written and directed &quot;Dust&quot; and &quot;Shadows.&quot;

===Culture===
{{Main|Macedonian culture (ethnic group)|Music of the Republic of Macedonia|List of Macedonians (ethnic group)}}

[[File:Robevci house.jpg|thumb|[[Robevi family house]] – typical Macedonian architecture]]
Macedonia has a rich cultural heritage in art, architecture, poetry, and music. It has many ancient, protected religious sites. Poetry, cinema, and music festivals are held annually. [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian music]] styles developed under the strong influence of Byzantine church music. Macedonia has a significant number of preserved Byzantine fresco paintings, mainly from the period between the 11th and 16th centuries. There are several thousands square metres of [[fresco|fresco painting]] preserved, the major part of which is in very good condition and represent masterworks of the Macedonian School of ecclesiastical painting.

The most important cultural events in the country are the [[Ohrid]] Summer festival of classical music and drama, the [[Struga Poetry Evenings]] which gather poets from more than 50 countries in the world, International Camera Festival in [[Bitola]], Open Youth Theatre and [[Skopje Jazz Festival]] in Skopje etc.
The [[Macedonian Opera]] opened in 1947 with a performance of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' under the direction of Branko Pomorisac. Every year, the May Opera Evenings are held in Skopje for around 20 nights. The first May Opera performance was that of [[Kiril Makedonski]]'s ''Tsar Samuil'' in May 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.in.mk/story.asp?id=19442&amp;rub=35 |title=Macedonian Opera Marks 60th Anniversary.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Тавче гравче.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tavče Gravče]]]]
Macedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]—reflecting [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] ([[Greek cuisine|Greek]] and [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]]) and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] influences, and to a lesser extent [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[German cuisine|German]] and Eastern European (especially [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]]) ones. The relatively warm climate in Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.

Famous for its rich [[Šopska salad]], an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal, Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tavče Gravče]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of the Republic of Macedonia, respectively.

===Sport===
[[File:The Macedonian Basketball Team.JPG|thumb|Macedonia basketball team at a time out during a match with [[Latvia]]]]
