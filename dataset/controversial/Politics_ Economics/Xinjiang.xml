With a documented history of at least 2,500 years, a succession of peoples and empires has vied for control over all or parts of this territory. Prior to the 21st century, all or part of the region has been ruled, controlled, influenced at times by the [[Tocharians]], [[Yuezhi]], [[Xiongnu Empire]], [[Kushan Empire]], [[Han Empire]], [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang]], [[Western Liáng]], [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Uyghur Khaganate]], [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], [[Mongol Empire]] ([[Yuan Dynasty]]), [[Dzungar Khanate]], [[Qing Dynasty]], the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], and, since 1950, the People's Republic of China.

==Names==
Xinjiang was previously known as '''Xiyu''' (西域) or '''Qurighar''' (غەربىي دىيار), meaning [[Western Regions|Western Region]], under the [[Han Dynasty]], which [[Han–Xiongnu War|drove the Xiongnu empire out]] of the region in 60 BC. This was in an effort to secure the profitable [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Susan Whitfield|authorlink=Susan Whitfield|title=The Silk Road: trade, travel, war and faith |year=2004 |publisher=Serindia Publications|page=27|accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as '''Huijiang''' (回疆), meaning &quot;Muslim Frontier,&quot; during the [[Qing Dynasty]] before becoming the province of Xinjiang, which literally means &quot;New Frontier&quot; or &quot;New Border&quot;, in the 1880s.

The general region of Xinjiang has been known by many other names in earlier times including: 西域 (Mandarin: xiyu) = 'Western Regions',&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), pp. xviii, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Tartary, High Tartary, East Chagatay, Mugholistan, Kashgaria, Altishahr ('the six cities' of the Tarim), Little Bokhara and Serindia.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler (2003), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;Xinjiang&quot;, which literally means &quot;New Frontier&quot;, was given during the [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref present-day [[Jinchuan County]] was known as &quot;Jinchuan ''xinjiang''&quot;, etc. After 1821, the Qing changed the names of the other regained regions, and &quot;Xinjiang&quot; became the name specifically of present-day Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cctv.com/program/dtsdgs/20041207/101426.shtml | title=Cultivating and Guarding the West Regions: the Establishment of Xinjiang Province | publisher=[[China Central Television]] | language=Chinese | accessdate=August 27, 2009 | date=December 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as '''Chinese Turkestan''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkestan&quot;/&gt; '''Sinkiang''', [[East Turkestan]], or '''Uyghuristan'''. More specifically, at times, the term East Turkestan only referred to the Xinjiang area south of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains, North of the Tian Shan was called [[Dzungaria]] (Zungaria).&lt;ref&gt;[http://drsubrotoroy.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/chinaempire.jpg Map of China 1900]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Xinjiang is a large, sparsely populated area, spanning over 1.6 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (comparable in size to [[Iran]]), which takes up about one sixth of the country's territory. Xinjiang borders the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and [[India]]'s [[Leh District]] to the south and [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] provinces to the southeast, [[Mongolia]] to the east, [[Russia]] to the north, and [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[India]] to the west.

The east-west chain of the Tian Shan Mountains separate [[Dzungaria]] in the north from the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. Dzungaria is dry steppe. The Tarim Basin is desert surrounded by oases. In the east is the [[Turpan Depression]]. In the west, the Tian Shan split, forming the [[Ili River]] valley.

===Early history===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:SteinMummy.jpg|thumb|left|One of the Caucasoid [[Tarim mummies]] in the [[Tarim Basin]] mummy photographed by [[Aurel Stein]] circa 1910.]] --&gt;
According to J.P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair, the Chinese sources describe the existence of &quot;[[white people]] with lightish hair&quot; or the ''Bai'' people in the ''[[Shan Hai Jing]]'', who lived beyond their northwestern border.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair ''The Tarim Mummies'', p. 55, ISBN 0-500-05101-1. &quot;The strange creatures of the Shanhai jing: (...) we find recorded north of the territory of the &quot;fish dragons&quot; the land of the Whites (Bai), whose bodies are white and whose long hair falls on their shoulders. Such a description could accord well with a Caucasoid population beyond the frontiers of ancient China and some scholars have identified these Whites as Yuezhi.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

April 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The well-preserved [[Tarim mummies]] with [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] features, often with reddish or blond hair, today displayed at the [[Ürümqi]] Museum and dated to the 3rd century BC, have been found in precisely the same area of the Tarim Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert J. | last = Saiget | title = Caucasians preceded East Asians in basin | url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm | work = The Washington Times | publisher = News World Communications | date = April 19, 2005 | accessdate = August 20, 2007 | quote = A study last year by [[Jilin]] University also found that the mummies' DNA had Europoid genes.| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050420224622/http://washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm | archivedate = April 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various nomadic tribes such as the [[Yuezhi]] were part of the large migration of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speaking peoples who were settled in eastern Central Asia (possibly as far as [[Gansu]]) at that time. The [[Ordos culture]] situated at northern China east of the Yuezhi, are another example.

Nomadic cultures such as the Yuezhi are documented in the area of Xinjiang where the first known reference to the Yuezhi was made in 645 BC by the Chinese [[Guan Zhong]] in his [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] 管子 (Guanzi Essays: 73: 78: 80: 81). He described the Yuzhi 禺氏, or Niuzhi 牛氏, as a people from the north-west who supplied [[jade]] to the Chinese from the nearby mountains of Yuzhi 禺氏 at Gansu.&lt;ref&gt;Iaroslav Lebedynsky, ''Les Saces'', ISBN 2-87772-337-2, p59.&lt;/ref&gt; The supply of jade&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dillon, ''China: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; from the Tarim Basin from ancient times is indeed well documented archaeologically: &quot;It is well known that ancient Chinese rulers had a strong attachment to jade. All of the jade items excavated from the tomb of Fuhao of the [[Shang dynasty]], more than 750 pieces, were from [[Khotan]] in modern Xinjiang. As early as the mid-first millennium BC the Yuezhi engaged in the jade trade, of which the major consumers were the rulers of agricultural China.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Liu (2001), pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomadic tribes of the Yuezhi are also documented in detail in Chinese historical accounts, in particular the 2nd–1st century BC &quot;Records of the Great Historian&quot;, or ''[[Shiji]]'', by [[Sima Qian]], which state that they &quot;were flourishing&quot; but regularly in conflict with the neighboring tribe of the Xiongnu to the northeast. According to these accounts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Yuezhi originally lived in the area between the [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] and [[Dunhuang]], but after they were defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] they moved far away to the west, beyond [[Dayuan]], where they attacked and conquered the people of [[Daxia]] and set up the court of their king on the northern bank of the Gui [= [[Oxus]]] River. A small number of their people who were unable to make the journey west sought refuge among the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] barbarians in the Southern Mountains, where they are known as the Lesser Yuezhi.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Burton. Trans. 1993. ''Records of the Grand Historian of China: Han Dynasty II.'' Translated from the ''[[Shiji]]'' of [[Sima Qian]]. Chapter 123: &quot;The Account of [[Dayuan]],&quot; Columbia University Press. Revised Edition. ISBN 0-231-08166-9; ISBN 0-231-08167-7 (pbk.), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Xiongnu Empire ===
{{main|Xiongnu}}
[[File:Tarimbecken 3. Jahrhundert.png|thumb|The [[Tarim Basin]] in the 3rd century CE.]]
Traversed by the [[Northern Silk Road]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 |author=C.Michael Hogan|title=Silk Road, North China|work=The Megalithic Portal|editor= Andy Burnham |year=2007 |publisher=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |accessdate=November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]] and [[Dzungaria]] regions were known as the [[Western Regions]]. At the beginning of the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – AD 220), the region was subservient to the [[Xiongnu]], a powerful nomadic people based in modern [[Mongolia]].

=== Han Dynasty ===
{{main|Protectorate of the Western Regions}}
{{See also|Han Dynasty}}
In the 2nd century BC, Han China sent [[Zhang Qian]] as an envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] (西域都護府) at Wulei (烏壘; near modern [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Luntai]]) to oversee the entire region as far west as the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]]. Tarim Basin was under the influence and control of the Han dynasty.

During the usurpation of [[Wang Mang]] in China, the dependent states of the protectorate rebelled and returned to domination in AD 13. Over the next century, Han China conducted several expeditions into the region, re-establishing the protectorate from 74 to 76, 91 to 107, and from 123 onward. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin and Central Asia. This region was also ruled by the [[Kushan Empire]] between 114 and 168. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the protectorate continued to be maintained by [[Cao Wei]] (until 265) and the [[Western Jin Dynasty]] (from 265 onwards).
[[File:BuddhaTumshuqXinjiang5thcentury.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Buddha]] statue from [[Tumshuq]], Xinjiang (5th century CE). This is an example of [[Serindian art]].]]

A summary of Classical sources on the [[Seres]] (Greek and Roman name of Xinjiang) (essentially [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Ptolemy]]) gives the following account:

{{quotation|The region of the Seres is a vast and populous country, touching on the east the Ocean and the limits of the habitable world, and extending west nearly to [[Pamir Mountains|Imaus]] and the confines of [[Bactria]]. The people are civilised men, of mild, just, and frugal temper, eschewing collisions with their neighbours, and even shy of close intercourse, but not averse to dispose of their own products, of which raw silk is the staple, but which include also silk stuffs, furs, and iron of remarkable quality.|[[Henry Yule]], &quot;Cathey and the way thither&quot;}}

Ptolemy had quite good information on Xinjiang, taken from three different accounts.&lt;ref&gt;E. de la Vaissière, &quot;The triple system of orography in Ptolemy's Xinjiang&quot;, in ''Exegisti monumenta Festschrift in Honour of Nicholas Sims-Williams'', Harrassowitz, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===A succession of peoples===
{{See also|Sixteen Kingdoms}}
The Western [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms (both Han and non-Han) that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang]], and [[Western Liáng]], all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying extents and degrees of success. After the final reunification of northern China under the [[Northern Wei]] empire, its protectorate controlled what is now the southeastern third of Xinjiang. Local states such as [[Kashgar|Shule]], [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Guizi]] and [[Qiemo]] controlled the western half, while the central region around [[Turpan]] was controlled by [[Gaochang]], remnants of a state ([[Northern Liang]]) that once ruled part of what is now [[Gansu]] province in northwestern China.

=== Tang Dynasty ===
{{main|Anxi Protectorate}}
{{See also|Tang Dynasty}}
[[File:Westerner on a camel.jpg|thumb|upright|Westerner on a [[Bactrian camel]], Tang Dynasty]]
The [[Tang Dynasty]] was established in 618, and would prove to be one of the most expansionist dynasties in Chinese history. Starting from the 620's and 630's, Tang China conducted a series of expeditions against the [[Tujue]], eventually forcing the surrender of the western Tujue in 657. Xinjiang was placed under the [[Anxi Protectorate]] (安西都護府; &quot;Protectorate Pacifying the West&quot;). The protectorate did not outlast the decline of Tang China in the 8th century.

=== Uyghur Khaganate and Kara-Khanid Khanate ===
{{See also|Uyghur Khaganate|Kara-Khanid Khanate}}

During the devastating [[Anshi Rebellion]], [[Tibetan Empire|Tibet]] invaded Tang China on a wide front from Xinjiang to [[Yunnan]], occupied the Tang capital Chang'an in 763 for 16 days, and taking control of southern Xinjiang by the end of the century. At the same time, the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] took control of northern Xinjiang, as well as much of the rest of Central Asia, including Mongolia.
[[File:BezeklikSogdianMerchants.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] donors to the Buddha (fresco, with detail), [[Bezeklik]], eastern Tarim Basin, 8th century]]
As both Tibet and the Uyghur Khaganate declined in the mid-9th century, the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], which was a confederation of Turkic tribes such as the [[Karluks]], [[Chigils]] and Yaghmas,&lt;ref name=&quot;svat&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 5 - The Qarakhanids |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-65704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; took control of western Xinjiang in the 10th century and the 11th century. Meanwhile, after the Uyghur khanate in Mongolia had been smashed by the Kirghiz in 840, branches of the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] established themselves in [[Gaochang|Qocha]] (Karakhoja) and [[Beshbalik]] near today's Turfan and Urumchi. This Uyghur state would remain in eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, though it would be subject to various overlords during that time. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam, whereas the Uyghur state in eastern Xinjiang remained Manicheaean, but later converting to [[Buddhism]].

In 1132, remnants of the [[Khitan Empire]] from [[Manchuria]] entered Xinjiang, fleeing the onslaught of the [[Jurchens]] into north China. They established an exile regime, the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]], which became overlord over both Kara-Khanid-held and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century.

===Mongol Empire and Yuan Dynasty===
{{See also|Yuan Dynasty}}
After [[Genghis Khan]] had unified Mongolia and began his advance west, the Uyghur state in the Turpan-Urumchi area offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom. By contrast, Genghis Khan's [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Kara-Khitan]] in 1218. Because the Kara-Khitan had persecuted Islam, the Mongols were met as liberators in the [[Kashgar]] area. During the era of the Mongol Empire, the Qubilaid [[Yuan Dynasty]] vied for rule with the [[Chagatai Khanate]] in the area, with the latter taking control of most of this region. After the break-up of the Chagatai Khanate into smaller khanates in the mid-14th century, the region fractured and was ruled by various Persianized Mongol Khans simultaneously, including the ones of Mogholistan (with the assistance of the local Dughlat Emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan) and Kashgaria. These leaders engaged in numerous wars with each other and both the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]]s of [[Transoxania]] to the West and the [[Western Mongols]] to the East, the successor [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] regime based in Mongolia and in China. Although there were high points in Persian culture reached (e.g. the Dughlat historian Hamid-mirza), succession crises and internal divisions (Kashgaria split in two for centuries) meant that this region almost completely fades from the history books during the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Centra Asia (pages 491–501)|author=Grousset, Rene|year=1970|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-0627-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the [[Mongolia]]n [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.

===Dzungar Empire===
{{See also|Dzungar Khanate}}
[[File:Battle of Oroi-Jalatu.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756 between the Chinese and western Mongol armies.]]
The Mongolian Dzungar (also Jungar, Zunghar or Zungar; Mongolian: Зүүнгар Züüngar) is the collective identity of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that formed and maintained one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered the area called [[Dzungaria]] and stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]] (most of this area is renamed to Xinjiang after the fall of the Dzungar Empire). It existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century.

===Qing Dynasty===
{{See also|Qing Dynasty}}
The [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]] gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a long struggle with the Zunghars (Dzungars) that began in the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the [[Oirats|Oirat]] nobel [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining City|Ghulja]], and captured the Zunghar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Zunghar Khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Over the next two years, Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Zunghar khanate and colonised parts of Xinjiang with Han and Hui Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Millward (2007), p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] suffered important loss in the brutal campaigns and the [[smallpox]] epidemic at the time. One writer, [[Wei Yuan]], described the resulting desolation in what is now northern Xinjiang as: &quot;an empty plain for several thousand ''[[li (unit)|li]]'', with no Oirat [[yurt]] except those surrendered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wei Yuan]], 聖武記 ''Sheng Wu Ji'', vol. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that 80% of the 600,000 or more Zunghars were destroyed by a combination of disease and warfare,&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Wen-Djang (1966).

[[File:Battle at Awabat-chuang.jpg|thumb|left|A scene of the Qing campaign against rebels in the East Turkestan, 1828]]
After the defeat of the Dzungars, the Qing made members of a clan of sufi shaykhs known as the [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khojas]], rulers in the western Tarim Basin, south of the Tianshan Mts. In 1758–59, however, rebellions against this arrangement broke out both north and south of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains. The Qing was thus forced, contrary to its initial intent, to establish a form of direct military rule over both Zungharia (northern Xinjiang) and the Tarim Basin (southern Xinjiang). The Manchus put the whole region under the rule of a General of Ili ({{zh|[[:zh:总统伊犁等处将军|伊犁将军]]|Yīlí Jiāngjūn}}), headquartered at the fort of [[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] (the so-called &quot;Manchu Kuldja&quot;, or Yili), 30&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Yining City|Ghulja]] (Yining).

After 1759 state farms were established, &quot;especially in the vicinity of Urumchi, where there was fertile, well-watered land and few people.&quot; From 1760 to 1830 more state farms were opened and the Chinese population in Xinjiang grew rapidly to about 155,000.&lt;ref&gt;Millward (2007), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jahangir Khoja]] invaded Kashgar in 1826 and the Khanate of Kokand conducted raids on Xinjiang. A large [[Slavery in China#Xinjiang|slave trade existed in Xinjiang]] during this time.

By the mid-19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] was encroaching upon Qing China along its entire northern frontier. The Opium Wars and Taiping and other rebellion's in ''[[China proper]]'' had severely restricted the dynasty's ability to maintain its garrisons in distant Xinjiang. In 1864 both Chinese Muslims ([[Hui people|Hui]]) and [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] rebelled in Xinjiang cities, following an on-going Chinese [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Muslim Rebellion]] in Gansu and [[Shaanxi]] provinces further east.&lt;ref&gt;Ho-dong Kim(2004),p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yaqub Beg]]'s Turkic Muslim troops also committed massacres upon the Chinese Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gitcAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA34&amp;dq=tunganis+aksu+cut+out+garrisons+yakoob+beg+drove+massacring#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Accounts and papers of the House of Commons|author=Great Britain.

[[Britannica Online Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Ürümqi (1870)]] Yaqub Beg's Turkic forces, allied with a Han Chinese militia, attacked and besieged Chinese Muslim forces in Urumqi. In 1871, Russia took advantage of the chaotic situation and seized the rich [[Ili River]] valley, including [[Yining City|Gulja]]. By then, Qing China held onto only a few strongholds, including [[Tacheng]].

Yaqub Beg's rule lasted until General [[Zuo Zongtang]] (also known as General Tso) reconquered the region between 1875 and 1877 for Qing China. In 1881, Qing China recovered the [[Yining (city)|Gulja]] region through diplomatic negotiations ([[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)]]).

[[File:Flag of the First East Turkestan Republic.svg|right|thumb|'''Flag of the [[First East Turkestan Republic]]''', which was a short-lived attempt at independence of the lands around [[Kashgar]].]]
In 1912, the Qing Dynasty was replaced by the [[History of the Republic of China|Republic of China]]. [[Yuan Dahua]], the last Qing governor of Xinjiang, fled. One of his subordinates, [[Yang Zengxin]] (杨增新), took control of the province and acceded in name to the Republic of China in March of the same year. Through [[Machiavellian]] politics and clever balancing of mixed ethnic constituencies, Yang maintained control over Xinjiang until his assassination in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Governors of Xinjiang:[[Yang Zengxin]] (1912–1928), [[Jin Shuren]] (1928–33), [[Sheng Shicai]](1933–44) [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/546118/Xinjiang/71463/History ].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kumul Rebellion]] and other rebellions arose against his successor [[Jin Shuren]] (金树仁) in the early 1930s throughout Xinjiang, involving Uyghurs, other Turkic groups, and Hui (Muslim) Chinese. Jin drafted White Russians to crush the revolt. In the [[Kashgar]] region on November 12, 1933, the short-lived self-proclaimed [[First East Turkistan Republic|East Turkistan Republic]] was declared, after some debate over whether the proposed independent state should be called &quot;East Turkestan&quot; or &quot;Uyghuristan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;feener&quot;&gt;R.

The Soviet Union invaded the province in the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. In the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]], the entire province was brought under the control of northeast Chinese warlord [[Sheng Shicai]] (盛世才), who ruled Xinjiang for the next decade with close support from the [[Soviet Union]], many of whose ethnic and security policies Sheng instituted in Xinjiang. The Soviet Union maintained a military base in Xinjiang and had several military and economic advisors deployed in the region. Sheng invited a group of [[Chinese Communists]] to Xinjiang, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s brother [[Mao Zemin]], but in 1943, fearing a conspiracy, Sheng executed them all, including Mao Zemin.

=== 1949–present ===
A [[Second East Turkistan Republic]] (2nd ETR, also known as the [[Three Districts Revolution]]) existed from 1944 to 1949 with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] support in what is now [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]] (Ili, Tarbagatay and Altay Districts) in northern Xinjiang.&lt;ref name=&quot;feener&quot;/&gt; The Second East Turkistan Republic came to an end when the [[People's Liberation Army]] entered Xinjiang in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfcr&quot;/&gt; Also, five ETR leaders, who would negotiate the final status of East Turkistan with the Chinese, died in an air crash in 1949 in Soviet airspace over the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_56244.shtml | title=Uyghur Protests Widen as Xinjiang Unrest Flares | publisher=axisoflogic.com |accessdate = July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Muslim General [[Bai Chongxi]] advocated swamping Xinjiang with disbanded Chinese soldiers to prevent the Soviet union from seizing control during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=snippet&amp;q=pai%20soviet%20soldiers%20sovietization&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=illustrated|page=124|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=276|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}(Cambridge studies in Chinese history, literature, and institutions

According to the PRC interpretation, the 2nd ETR was Xinjiang's revolution, a positive part of the communist revolution in China; the 2nd ETR acceded to and welcomed the PLA when it entered Xinjiang, a process known as the [[Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang]]. However, independence advocates view the ETR as an effort to establish an independent state, and the subsequent PLA entry as an invasion. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

During the [[Great Chinese Famine]] (1958–1961), Xinjiang experienced a great emigration of residents both to the [[Soviet Union]] and to East China. After a number of student demonstrations in the 1980s, the [[Baren Township riot]] of April 1990 led to more than 20 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Han Youwen]], a Salar General, once served as Vice Chairman of Xinjiang.

During the [[Cold War]] and the [[Sino-Soviet split]], China stationed military forces in Xinjiang to guard against Soviet attack, and the Chinese used Xinjiang to supply and train anti Soviet Islamic militants during the Islamic insurgency against the Soviet backed Afghan communists.

During the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between China and Soviet Russia resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing for the opponents enemies. China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro Soviet communists supported China's enemies in Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti communist militants. China responded to the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by supporting the [[Afghan mujahideen|Afghan Mujahidin]] and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang. China acquired military equipment from America to defend itself from Soviet attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starriditor=S.

Xinjiang is divided into two [[prefecture-level cities]], seven [[prefecture of China|prefectures]], and five [[autonomous prefectures]] for [[Mongol]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kirgiz]], [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] minorities. (Two of the seven prefectures are in turn part of Ili, an autonomous prefecture.) These are then divided into eleven districts, twenty county-level cities, sixty-two counties, and six autonomous counties. Five of the county-level cities do not belong to any prefecture, and are ''de facto'' administered by the [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]].

==Geography and geology==
[[File:Karakorum-d04.jpg|thumb|Close to [[Karakoram Highway]] in Xinjiang.]]
[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi]] lake.]]
[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black [[Irtysh]] river in [[Burqin County]] is famous spot for [[sightseeing]].]]
[[File:Turpan-flaming-mountains-camellos-d01.jpg|thumb|[[Flaming Mountains]].]]
Xinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|political subdivision of China]]—it accounts for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. It is split by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range ({{ug|تەڭرى تاغ|Tengri Tagh}}), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north, and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. Much of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. The lowest point in Xinjiang, and in the entire PRC, is the [[Turpan Depression]], 155 metres below sea level; its highest point is the mountain [[K2]], [[eight-thousander|8611 metres above sea level]], on the border with [[Pakistan]]. Other mountain ranges include the [[Pamir Mountains]] in the southeast, the [[Karakoram]] in the south, and the [[Altai Mountains]] in the north.

Most of Xinjiang is young geologically, having been formed from the collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate, forming the [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Shan]], and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountain ranges. Consequently, Xinjiang is a major earthquake zone. Older geological formations occur principally in the far north where the [[Junggar Block]] is geologically part of [[Kazakhstan]], and in the east which is part of the [[North China Craton]].

Xinjiang has within its borders the point of land remotest from the sea, the so-called [[Pole of inaccessibility#Continental|Eurasian pole of inaccessibility]] ({{Coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}) in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], {{convert|1645|mi}} from the nearest coastline (straight-line distance).

The [[Tian Shan]] mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with [[Kashgar]] over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].

Rivers include the [[Tarim River]].

===Time===
Technically, people are supposed to set their clock to the uniform time – Beijing Time throughout China, but due to Xinjiang's westernmost position in China, some local residents follow their own unofficial time – Xinjiang Time [http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm](Xinjiang time corresponds to the UTC+6 time zone, Beijing Time corresponds to UTC+8). Thus, for instance, a movie that opens at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm Beijing Time, opens at 7:00 Xinjiang Time.

===Deserts===
Deserts include:
* [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]]
* [[Kumtag Desert]]
* [[Taklamakan Desert]]

===Major cities===
* [[Urumqi]]
* [[Turpan]]
* [[Kashgar]]
* [[Karamay]]
* [[Yining City|Yining]]
* [[Shihezi]]

===Climate===
Generally, a [[semi-arid]] or [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'' or ''BWk'', respectively) prevails in Xinjiang. The entire region is marked by great seasonal differences in temperature and cold winters. During the summer, the [[Turpan Depression]] usually records the hottest temperatures nationwide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com.cn/html/cityintro/101130501.shtml Weather China]&lt;/ref&gt; with air temperatures easily exceeding {{convert|40|°C}}. In the far north and the highest mountain elevations, however, winter temperatures regularly drop below {{convert|&amp;minus;20|°C}}.

Xinjiang is known for its fruits and produce, including grapes, melons, pears, cotton, wheat, silk, [[walnut]]s and sheep. Xinjiang also has large deposits of minerals and [[petroleum|oil]].

In the late 19th century the region was noted for producing salt, soda, [[borax]], gold, [[jade]] and coal.&lt;ref&gt;Mesny (1899), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xinjiang's nominal GDP was approximately 220 billion [[Renminbi|RMB]] (28 billion USD) in 2004, and increased to 657.4 billion RMB (104.3 billion USD) in 2011, due to exploration of the regions abundant reserves of coal, crude oil and natural and the [[China Western Development]] policy introduced by the State Council to boost economic development in Western China.&lt;ref name=&quot;thechinaperspective.com&quot;&gt;http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/xinjiang-province/&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|per capita GDP]] for 2009 was 19,798 RMB (2,898 USD), with a growth rate of 1.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;thechinaperspective.com&quot;/&gt; Southern Xinjiang, with 95 per cent non-Han population has an average per capita income half that of Xinjiang as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Millward (2007), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil and [[natural gas|gas]] extraction industry in [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]] and [[Karamay]] is booming, with the [[West–East Gas Pipeline]] connecting to Shanghai. The oil and petrochemical sector account for 60% of Xinjiang's local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Xinjiang's exports amounted to 19.3 billion USD, while imports turned out to be 2.9 billion USD in 2008. Most of the overall import/export volume in Xinjiang was directed to and from [[Kazakhstan]] through Ala Pass. China's first border [[free trade zone]] (Horgos Free Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of [[Horgos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200411/02/eng20041102_162447.html |title=Work on free trade zone on the agenda |work=[[People's Daily Online]] |date=November 2, 2004 |accessdate=November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horgos is the largest &quot;land port&quot; in China's western region and it has easy access to the Central Asian market. Xinjiang also opened its second border trade market to Kazakhstan in March 2006, the Jeminay Border Trade Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/12/content_4168911.htm |title=Xinjiang to open 2nd border trade market to Kazakhstan |publisher=Xinhua|date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Han Chinese]] of Xinjiang arrived at different times, from different directions and social backgrounds: they are descendants of criminals and officials who had been exiled from China proper during the second half of the eighteenth and first half of the 19th centuries; descendants of families of military and civil officers from [[Hunan]], Yunnan, [[Gansu]] and [[Manchuria]]; descendants of merchants from [[Shanxi]], Tianjin, [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]] and descendants of peasants who started immigrating into the region in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Hann (2008).

Some Uighur scholars claim descent from both the Turkic Uighurs and the pre-Turkic [[Tocharians]] (or Tokharians, whose language was [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]), and relatively fair-skin, hair and eyes, as well as other so-called '[[Caucasoid]]' physical traits, are not uncommon among them. In general Uyghurs resemble those peoples who live around them in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan.
In 2002, there were 9,632,600 males (growth rate of 1.0%) and 9,419,300 females (growth rate of 2.2%). The population overall growth rate was 10.9‰, with 16.3‰ of [[birth rate]] and 5.4‰ [[mortality rate]].

=== Roads ===
[[File:Karakorum-carretera-d08.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Karakorum highway.]]
In 2008, according to the Xinjiang Transportation Network Plan, the government has focused construction on State Road 314, Alar-Hotan Desert Highway, State Road 218, Qingshui River Line-Yining Highway, and State Road 217, as well as other roads.

The construction of the first expressway in the mountainous area of Xinjiang began a new stage in its construction on July 24, 2007. The 56&amp;nbsp;km highway linking [[Sayram Lake]] and [[Guozi Valley]] in Northern Xinjiang area had cost 2.39 billion yuan. The expressway is designed to improve the speed of national highway 312 in northern Xinjiang. The project started in August 2006 and several stages have been fully operational since March 2007. Over 3,000 construction workers have been involved. The 700 m-long Guozi Valley Cable Bridge over the expressway is now currently being constructed, with the 24 main pile foundations already completed. Highway 312 national highway Xinjiang section, connects Xinjiang with China's east coast, central and western Asia, plus some parts of Europe. It is a key factor in Xinjiang's [[economic development]]. The population it covers is around 40 percent of the overall in Xinjiang, who contribute half of the GDP in the area.

=== Rail ===
[[File:20060425124523.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ürümqi train station.]]
Xinjiang is linked to the rest of China by a single railway, the [[Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway|Lanzhou-Xinjiang (Lanxin) Railway]], which runs from [[Ürümqi]] to [[Lanzhou]] through the [[Hexi Corridor]] in [[Gansu Province]]. This railway connects the regional capital, [[Ürümqi]], with [[Turpan]] and [[Hami Prefecture|Hami]] in eastern Xinjiang. West of Ürümqi, the [[Northern Xinjiang Railway|Northern Xinjiang (Beijiang) Railway]] runs along the northern footslopes of the [[Tian Shan]] range through [[Changji]], [[Shihezi]], [[Kuytun]] and [[Jinghe]] to the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] border at [[Alashankou]], where it links up with the [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] of Central Asia. The Lanxin and Beijiang lines form part of the [[Eurasian Land Bridge|Trans-Eurasian Continental Railway]], which extends from [[Rotterdam]], on the [[North Sea]], to [[Lianyungang]], on the [[East China Sea]].

The [[Second Ürümqi-Jinghe Railway]] opened in 2009 to supplement rail transport capacity on the Northern Xinjiang Railway between Ürümqi and Jinghe. From Jinghe, the [[Jinghe-Yining-Horgos Railway]] heads southwest into the [[Ili River]] Valley to [[Yining (city)|Yining]], [[Huocheng]], and [[Khorgos]], a second rail border crossing with Kazakhstan. From [[Kuytun]], the [[Kuytun-Beitun Railway]] runs north into the [[Junggar Basin]] to [[Karamay]] and Beitun, near [[Altay City|Altay]] in northern Xinjiang. The [[Ürümqi-Dzungaria Railway]] connects Ürümqi with coal fields in the eastern Junggar Basin.

The [[Southern Xinjiang Railway|Southern Xinjiang (Nanjiang) Railway]] branches off of the Lanxin Line at Turpan and heads southwest along the southern footslopes of the [[Tian Shan]] into the [[Tarim Basin]], with stops at [[Yanqi Town|Yanqi]], [[Korla]], [[Kuqa County|Kuqa]], [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]], [[Maralbexi County|Maralbexi (Bachu)]], [[Artux]], and [[Kashgar]]. From Kashgar, the [[Kashgar-Hotan Railway]], follows the southern rim of the Tarim to [[Hotan]], with stops at [[Shule County|Shule]], [[Akto]], [[Yengisar]], [[Shache|Shache (Yarkant)]], [[Yecheng|Yecheng (Karghilik)]], [[Moyu County|Moyu (Karakax)]].

A [[Lanzhou-Xinjiang High-Speed Railway|high-speed railway between Urumqi and Lanzhou]] is currently under construction.
