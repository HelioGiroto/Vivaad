==2003 elections==
[[Human Rights Watch]] commented on the 2003 elections: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Human Rights Watch research found that the government had heavily intervened in the elections campaign in favour of [[Prime Minister]] [[İlham Aliyev]], son of the current President [[Heydar Aliyev]]. The government had stacked the Central Election Commission and local election commission with its supporters, and banned local non-governmental organizations from monitoring the vote. As the elections drew nearer, government officials have openly sided with the campaign of İlham Aliyev, constantly obstructing opposition rallies and attempting to limit public participation in opposition events. In some cases, local officials have closed all the roads into town during opposition rallies, or have extended working and school hours, in one case, even declaring a Sunday work day, to prevent participation in opposition rallies.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2011 protests==
{{main|2011 Azerbaijani protests}}
In his role as leader of Müsavat, Gambar has played a major part in spring 2011 demonstrations inspired by other [[Arab Spring|protests]] throughout the [[Middle East]]. He and his party have organized protests, occasionally joining with fellow opposition groups like the [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front Party]] to rally in [[Baku]] despite a government ban and the steadfast efforts of security forces to disperse gatherings and arrest activists. &quot;There is a criminal, authoritarian and corrupt regime in Azerbaijan, and the people of Azerbaijan no longer want to live under these conditions,&quot; Gambar told ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/world/asia/05azerbaijan.html|agency=The New York Times|first=Michael|last=Schwirtz|title=Opposition in Azerbaijan Vows to Step Up Protests|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early April, Ilkin Gambar, the opposition leader's son currently serving in the [[Azerbaijani Army]], claimed on his [[Facebook]] page that he was being sent to the front lines in Azerbaijan's standoff with [[Armenia]] and that his father had been &quot;warned&quot; that this could be a result of his continuing involvement in protests. For his part, Isa Gambar said, &quot;The Ministry of Defence has a right to place soldiers in any location at its disposal. So I don't want to politicize this issue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://whatwaswritten.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/ilkin-gambar-sent-to-the-front-line-in-connection-to-protests/|agency=WhatWasWritten|title=Ilkin Gambar sent to the front line – in connection to protests?|first=Leyla|last=Najafli|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
