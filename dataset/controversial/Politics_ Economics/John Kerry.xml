'''John Forbes Kerry''' (born December 11, 1943) is the senior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|tenth most senior United States Senator]] and chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]]. He was the presidential nominee of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], but lost to then [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]].

The son of an [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] serviceman, Kerry was born in [[Aurora, Colorado]]. He attended boarding school in Massachusetts and [[New Hampshire]] and went on to graduate from [[Yale University]] class of 1966,  where he majored in [[political science]]. He enlisted in the [[United States Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in 1966 and, during 1968-1969, served a four-month tour of duty in South Vietnam as officer-in-charge (OIC) of a [[Patrol Craft Fast|Swift Boat]]. For that service he was awarded several combat medals that include the [[Silver Star]], [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], and three [[Purple Heart]]s. After returning to the United States, Kerry joined the [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesperson and as an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam war. During that period, he appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs where he deemed United States war policy in Vietnam to be the cause of &quot;war crimes&quot;.

After graduating from [[Boston College Law School]], Kerry worked as an [[Assistant District Attorney]] and co-founded a private firm. He served as [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]] under [[Michael Dukakis]] from 1983 to 1985, where he worked on an early forerunner to the national [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. He won a tight Democratic primary in 1984 for the U.S. Senate and was sworn in the following January. On the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], he led a [[Kerry Committee report|series of hearings]] from 1987 to 1989 which were a precursor to the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. He was an early backer of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], but became a strong opponent of the subsequent war.

Kerry based his [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]] on opposition to the [[Iraq War]]. He and his running mate Senator [[John Edwards]] lost by 34 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. Since then, he has established the Keeping America's Promise [[political action committee|PAC]]. He became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2009, and in 2011 he was appointed to the [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction]].

==Personal life and background==
Kerry is the child of [[Richard J. Kerry|Richard Kerry]] (1915–2000), a [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] Officer and an attorney for the [[Bureau of United Nations Affairs]], and [[Rosemary Forbes Kerry]] (1913–2002), a World War II nurse and member of the wealthy [[Forbes family]]. Rosemary was born in Paris, France, to American parents. Kerry has three siblings: two sisters, Diana (born in 1947) and Margerie (aka Peggy; born in 1941), and a brother, [[Cameron Kerry|Cameron]] (born in 1950), Cameron Kerry was picked to be President [[Barack Obama]]'s general counsel of the [[Commerce Department]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1072956.html Kerry's Jewish brother named to top post at Commerce Department], retrieved on 2009-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kerry's maternal great-great-grandfathers was [[Robert Charles Winthrop]], the 22nd Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KrRAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8yAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5080,615343&amp;dq=robert+winthrop+john+kerry&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] by his Catholic father and Episcopalian mother.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2004/08/Not-A-Prodigal-Son.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Kerry served as an [[altar server|altar boy]]. Although the extended family enjoyed a great fortune, Kerry's parents themselves were upper-[[middle class]]; a wealthy great aunt paid for Kerry to attend elite schools in Europe and [[New England]]. Kerry spent his summers at the [[Les Essarts, Forbes family estate|Forbes family estate]] in Brittany, and there, he enjoyed a more opulent lifestyle than he had previously known in Massachusetts.

It was discovered in 2003 by genealogist Felix Gundacker,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-NYTJudaism&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry's Grandfather Left Judaism Behind in Europe |author=Berger, Joseph |date=2004-05-16 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF173FF935A25756C0A9629C8B63 |accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', that Kerry's paternal grandparents, who had been born &quot;Fritz Kohn&quot; and &quot;Ida Löwe&quot; in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], changed their names to &quot;Frederick and Ida Kerry&quot; in 1900 and converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1901&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeBio&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Kranish, Michael; Mooney, Brian C.; Easton, Nina J. |title=John Kerry: The Complete Biography by ''The Boston Globe'' Reporters Who Know Him Best |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2004-04-27 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/kerry/book/excerpt/ |accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeRoots&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Hearing of roots, Czech village roots Kerry on |author=Whitmore, Brian |date=2004-02-22 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/02/22/hearing_of_roots_czech_village_roots_kerry_on/ |accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeSurprise&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061503.shtml |title=A privileged youth, a taste for risk |author=Kranish, Michael |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2003-06-15 |accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz' elder brother Otto had earlier, in 1887&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeRoots&quot;/&gt; or 1896,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-NYTJudaism&quot;/&gt; also embraced Catholicism. The &quot;Kerry&quot; name, widely misinterpreted as indicative of [[Ireland|Irish]] heritage, was reputedly selected arbitrarily: &quot;According to family legend, Fritz and another family member opened an atlas at random and dropped a pencil on a map. It fell on County Kerry in Ireland, and thus a name was chosen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeBio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeSurprise&quot;/&gt; Leaving their hometown [[Mödling]], a suburb of [[Vienna]] where they had lived since 1896, Fred and Ida, together with their son Eric, emigrated to the United States in 1905, living at first in [[Chicago]] and eventually moving to [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], by 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeBio&quot;/&gt;

The village where Fritz Kohn was born in 1873 was at that time known as [[Bennisch]] and was a part of [[Silesia]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], but is today known as [[Horní Benešov]] in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeRoots&quot;/&gt; After learning of his ancestral connection with their village, the mayor and citizens sent congratulatory correspondence to John Kerry with regard to his political pursuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeRoots&quot;/&gt;

For a time, Fred Kerry was a prosperous and successful shoe merchant, and Ida and two of the children — Richard (who would become the father of John Kerry) and Mildred — were able to afford to travel to Europe in the autumn of 1921, returning on October 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeBio&quot;/&gt; A few weeks later, on November 15, Fred Kerry filed a will leaving everything to Ida and then, on November 23, walked into a washroom of the [[Copley Plaza]] Hotel in Boston and committed [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head with a handgun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeBio&quot;/&gt; The suicide was front-page news in all of the Boston newspapers, reporting at the time that the motive was severe [[asthma]] and related health problems, but modern reports cite family sources saying that the motive was financial trouble: &quot;He had made three fortunes and when he had lost the third fortune, he couldn't face it anymore&quot;, according to granddaughter Nancy Stockslager.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeBio&quot;/&gt;

John Kerry has said that although he knew his paternal grandfather had come from Austria, he did not know until informed by ''The Boston Globe'' on the basis of their genealogical research that Fred Kerry had changed his name from &quot;Fritz Kohn&quot; and had been born Jewish,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-GlobeSurprise&quot;/&gt; nor that his [[great-uncle]] and [[great-aunt]], Ida Kerry's brother Otto and sister Jenni, died in [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry-NYTJudaism&quot;/&gt;

On his mother's side, the [[Forbes]] name can be traced back to [[Thomas Dudley]] of the [[Dudley-Winthrop family]] who landed in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], on June 14, 1630, with his daughter, poet [[Anne Bradstreet|Anne Dudley Bradstreet]], and others aboard the [[Arbella]].

Kerry is 6&amp;nbsp;ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Nagourney |authorlink=Adam Nagourney |title=Antiwar Veteran Eager for Battle |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/09/politics/campaigns/09KERR.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2002-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; enjoys [[surfing]] and [[windsurfing]], as well as [[ice hockey]], [[hunting]] and playing [[bass guitar]]. According to an interview he gave to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2004, Kerry's favorite album is ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and he is a fan of [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], as well as of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]]. He never liked [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jann S. |last=Wenner |authorlink=Jann Wenner |title=John Kerry |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6562106/john_kerry |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070104074710/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6562106/john_kerry |archivedate=2007-01-04 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2004-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 2004 presidential campaign, Kerry used [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s &quot;No Surrender&quot; as one of his campaign songs. Later he would adopt [[U2]]'s &quot;[[Beautiful Day]]&quot; as his official campaign song.

Kerry is described by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', among others, as an &quot;avid [[cycling|cyclist]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Maloney |title=Kerry Au Tour |url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2005/tour05/news/?id=/news/2005/jul05/jul24news2 |date=2005-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politics?

Prior to his Presidential bid, Kerry was known to have participated in several long-distance [[challenge riding|rides]] (centuries). Even during his many campaigns, he was reported to have visited bicycle stores in both his home state and elsewhere. His staff requested recumbent stationary bikes for his hotel rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0327061kerry2.html |title=JK hotel needs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry appeared in a cameo as himself on the April 30, 1992, episode of the hit television sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'', in the episode, &quot;Bar Wars VI: This Time It's For Real.&quot;

In 2003, Kerry was diagnosed with and successfully treated for [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sen. Kerry 's Surgery A Success |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/11/politics/main540196.shtml |work= |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=2003-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Kerry was married to [[Julia Thorne]] in 1970, and they had two daughters together: [[Alexandra Kerry|Alexandra]] and [[Vanessa Kerry|Vanessa]]. Alexandra was born on September 5, 1973, days before Kerry began law school. A graduate of [[Milton Academy]] and [[Brown University]], she received her M.F.A. in June 2004 from the [[AFI Conservatory]]. She is a documentary filmmaker. Vanessa was born on December 31, 1976. She is a graduate of [[Phillips Academy]] and [[Yale University]], and attended [[Harvard Medical School]] and a master's program in health policy at the [[London School of Economics]]. Both daughters were active in their father's 2004 Presidential campaign.

In 1982 Thorne, who was suffering from severe [[clinical depression|depression]], asked Kerry for a separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/people/madame_ex.html |title=News &amp; Politics |publisher=washingtonian.com |date=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were divorced on July 25, 1988, and the marriage was formally [[annulment|annulled]] in 1997. &quot;After 14 years as a political wife, I associated politics only with anger, fear and loneliness&quot; she wrote in ''A Change of Heart'', her book about depression. Thorne later married Richard Charlesworth, an [[architect]], and moved to [[Bozeman, Montana]], where she became active in local environmental groups such as the Greater Yellowstone Coalition. Thorne supported Kerry's 2004 presidential run. She died of cancer on April 27, 2006.

Kerry and his second wife, [[Teresa Heinz Kerry|Teresa Simões-Ferreira Heinz]], the widow of [[Pennsylvania]] Senator [[H. John Heinz III]], a Republican, and former [[United Nations]] interpreter, were introduced to each other by John Heinz at an [[Earth Day]] rally in 1990. They did not meet again until after John Heinz's death, at the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. They married on May 26, 1995, in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]]. John Kerry's stepsons – Teresa's three sons from her previous marriage – are [[H. John Heinz IV]], [[André Heinz]] and [[Christopher Heinz]], who married Alexandra DeRuyter Lewis on February 10, 2007.

The ''[[Forbes 400]]'' survey estimated in 2004 that Teresa Heinz Kerry had a [[net worth]] of $750 million. However, estimates have frequently varied, ranging from around $165 million to as high as $3.2 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], according to a study in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Regardless of which figure is correct, Kerry is the wealthiest U.S. Senator. Kerry is wealthy in his own name, and is the beneficiary of at least four trusts inherited from [[Forbes family]] members, including his mother, who died in 2002. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine (a major business magazine named for an [[Forbes family (publishers)|unrelated Forbes family]]) estimated that if elected, Kerry would have been the third-richest U.S. President in history when adjusted for [[inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Ackman |authorlink=Dan Ackman |title=Kerry Would Be Third-Richest U.S. President If Elected |url=http://www.forbes.com/2004/02/13/cx_da_0213kerry.html |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2004-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment was based on the couple's combined assets, but Kerry and Heinz signed a [[prenuptial agreement]] that keeps their assets separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040823.html |title=What is George W. Bush's net worth vs. John Kerry's net worth? |date=2004-08-23 |publisher=Ask Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry's financial disclosure form for 2002 put his personal assets in the range of $409,000 to $1.8 million, with additional assets held jointly by Kerry and his wife in the range of $300,000 to $600,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Healy |title=Kerry mortgage to help fund race |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/12/19/kerry_mortgage_to_help_fund_race/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2003-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
[[File:John Kerry headshot with US flag.jpg|thumb|upright|Congressional portrait with U.S. flag in the background]]
A [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], Kerry was said to carry a [[rosary]], a prayer book, and a [[St. Christopher]] medal (the patron saint of travelers) when he campaigned. However, while Kerry is personally against [[abortion]], he supports a woman's legal right to have one, which puts him at odds with the [[Catholic Church]]. Similar tension exists between the Church and several other Catholic national political figures, including [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[George Pataki]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Tom Ridge]], [[Tom Vilsack]] (one of his possible vice-presidential choices in the [[2004 election]]), [[Joe Biden]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Discussing his faith, Kerry said, &quot;I thought of being a priest. I was very religious while at school in Switzerland. I was an altar boy and prayed all the time. I was very centered around the Mass and the church.&quot; He also said that the [[Pauline epistles|Letters of Paul]] moved him the most, stating that they taught him to &quot;not feel sorry for myself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/150/story_15043_1.html |title=John Kerry's Spiritual Biography |last=Caldwell |first=Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Christianity Today]]'', Kerry said of his faith: &quot;I'm a Catholic and I practice, but at the same time I have an open-mindedness to many other expressions of spirituality that come through different religions. ... I've spent some time reading and thinking about [religion] and trying to study it, and I've arrived at not so much a sense of the differences, but a sense of the similarities in so many ways.&quot; He said that he believed that the [[Torah]], the [[Qur'an]], and the [[Bible]] all share a fundamental story which connects with readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/october/20.28.html |title=John Kerry's Open Mind |last=Stricherz |first=Mark |date=2004-10-01 |publisher=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years (1943–1966)==
===Childhood===
Kerry was born in [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]], [[Colorado]], at [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center|Fitzsimons Army Hospital]] on December 11, 1943; his father was a member of the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerry.senate.gov/about/biography.cfm|title=John Kerry's online office: About John Kerry|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry has said that his first memory is from when he was three years old, of holding his crying mother's hand while they walked through the broken glass and rubble of her childhood home in [[Saint-Briac-sur-Mer|Saint-Briac]], France. This visit came two and a half years after the United States had liberated Saint-Briac from the [[Military history of Germany during World War II|Nazis]] on August 14, 1944. The family estate, known as [[Les Essarts, Forbes family estate|Les Essarts]], had been occupied and used as a Nazi headquarters during the war. When the Germans abandoned it, they bombed Les Essarts and burned it down.

The sprawling estate was rebuilt in 1954. Kerry and his parents would often spend the summer holidays there. During these summers, he became good friends with his first cousin [[Brice Lalonde]], a future [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]] and [[French Green Party|Green Party]] leader in France, who ran for [[president of France]] in 1981.

While his father was stationed at the U.S. Embassy in [[Oslo, Norway]], Kerry was sent to Massachusetts to attend [[boarding school]]. In 1957, he attended the [[Fessenden School]] in West Newton, a village in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. The Fessenden School is the oldest all-boys independent junior boarding school in the country. There he met and became friends with Richard Pershing, grandson of [[World War I|First World War]] U.S. Gen. [[John J. Pershing|John Joseph Pershing]]. Former Massachusetts senator [[Ted Kennedy]] also attended the Fessenden School, although several years prior to Kerry.

The following year, he enrolled at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], and graduated from there in 1962. Kerry learned skills in [[public speaking]] and began developing an interest in [[politics]]. In his free time, he enjoyed [[ice hockey]] and [[lacrosse]], which he played on teams captained by classmate [[Robert Mueller|Robert S. Mueller III]], the current director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Kerry also played [[bass guitar]] for the prep school's band ''The Electras'', which produced an album in 1961. Only five hundred copies were made, one of which was auctioned on [[eBay]] in 2004 for $2,551.

In 1959, Kerry founded the [[John Winant]] Society at St. Paul's to debate the issues of the day; the Society still exists there.&lt;ref name=&quot;navydove&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Samuel Z. |last=Goldhaber |title=John Kerry: A Navy Dove Runs for Congress |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=352185 |date=1970-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;citm-pt1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Kranish |title=A privileged youth, a taste for risk |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061503.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2003-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1960, Kerry gave his first political speech, in favor of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s election to the [[White House]].

In 1962, Kerry was a volunteer for [[Ted Kennedy]]'s first [[United States Senate|Senatorial]] campaign. The summer after his graduation from St. Paul's, he dated [[Janet Jennings Auchincloss]], First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]'s half-sister. Auchincloss invited Kerry to visit her family's estate, [[Hammersmith Farm]], in [[Rhode Island]], where Kerry met President [[John F. Kennedy]] for the first time.

According to Kerry, when he told the president he was about to enter [[Yale University]], Kennedy grimaced, because he had gone to rival [[Harvard University]]. Kerry later recalled, &quot;He smiled at me, laughed and said: 'Oh, don't worry about it. You know I'm a Yale man too now.'&quot; According to Kerry &quot;The President uttered that famous comment about how he had the best of two worlds now: a Harvard education and Yale degree&quot;, in reference to the [[honorary degree]] he had received from Yale a few months earlier. Later that day, a White House photographer snapped a photo of Kerry sailing with Kennedy and his family in [[Narragansett Bay]].

===Yale University===
In 1962, Kerry entered [[Yale University]], majoring in [[political science]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1966. Kerry played on the [[soccer]], [[hockey]], [[lacrosse]] and [[fencing|fencing teams]]; in addition, he took flying lessons.&lt;ref name=&quot;citm-pt1&quot;/&gt;

In his [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] year, Kerry became the Chairman of the Liberal Party of the [[Yale Political Union]], and a year later he served as President of the Union.  Amongst his influential teachers in this period was Professor [[H. Bradford Westerfield]], who was himself a former President of the Political Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/education/27westerfield.html?scp=1&amp;sq=H.+Bradford+Westerfield&amp;st=nyt Martin, Douglas. &quot;H.

January 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  His involvement with the Political Union gave him an opportunity to be involved with important issues of the day, such as the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] and Kennedy's [[New Frontier]] program. He also became a [[List of Skull and Bones members|member]] of the secretive [[Skull and Bones|Skull and Bones Society]]. He also traveled to Switzerland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/university-news/2007/01/22/at-50-aiesec-ponders-its-future/ |title=At 50, AIESEC ponders its future |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=2007-01-22 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[AIESEC]] Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aiesec.org/AI |title=Welcome to AIESEC |publisher=Aiesec.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yale.edu/aiesec/&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the guidance of the speaking coach and history professor [[Rollin Osterweis]], Kerry won many debates against other college students from across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.library.yale.edu/madid/oneItem.aspx?id=1780700&amp;q=john%20kerry%20debate&amp;q1=&amp;q2=&amp;qc1=&amp;qc2=&amp;qf1=&amp;qf2=&amp;qn=&amp;qo=&amp;qm=&amp;qs=&amp;sid=&amp;qx= Yale Debate Team, 1965-1966, Yale University Manuscripts &amp; Archives Digital Images Database, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1965, as the Vietnam War escalated, he won the Ten Eyck prize as the best [[orator]] in the junior class for a speech that was critical of U.S. [[foreign policy]]. In the speech he said, &quot;It is the spectre of Western [[imperialism]] that causes more fear among Africans and Asians than communism and thus, it is self-defeating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID=21803 |title=Kerry '66: 'He was going to be president' |accessdate=2007-01-29 |last=Leibenluft |first=Jacob |date =February 14, 2003 |publisher=Yale Daily News |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051118173130re_/www.yaledailynews.com/article.asp?AID=21803 |archivedate=2005-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry, viewed as a capable speaker, was chosen to give the class oration at graduation. His speech was a broad criticism of American foreign policy, including the Vietnam War, in which he would soon participate.

==Military service (1966–1970)==
{{Main|John Kerry's military service}}

===Duty on the USS ''Gridley''===
On February 18, 1966, Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johnkerry.com/pdf/jkmilservice/Request_For_History_of_Service.pdf {{Dead link|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his active duty military service on August 19, 1966. After completing sixteen weeks of [[Officer Candidate School]] at the U.S. Naval Training Center in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], Kerry received his officer's commission on December 16, 1966. During the 2004 election, Kerry posted his military records at his website, and permitted reporters to inspect his medical records. In 2005, Kerry released his military and medical records to the representatives of three news organizations, but has not authorized full public access to those records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Kranish |title=Kerry allows Navy release of military, medical records |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/06/07/kerry_allows_navy_release_of_military_medical_records/ |date=2005-06-07 | work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |title=Kerry Grants Three Reporters Broad Access to Navy Records |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/15790 |date=2005-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry's first tour of duty was as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] on the [[guided missile]] [[frigate]] {{USS|Gridley|DLG-21|6}} in 1968. The executive officer of the ''Gridley'' described the deployment: &quot;We deployed from San Diego to the Vietnam theatre in early 1968 after only a six-month turnaround, and spent most of a four month deployment on rescue station in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], standing by to pick up downed aviators.&quot;

During his tour on the ''Gridley'', Kerry requested duty in Vietnam, listing as his first preference a position as the commander of a [[Fast Patrol Craft]] (PCF), also known as a &quot;Swift boat.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rqstswiftboat&quot;&gt;[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/rqstswiftboat.pdf Official Record Copy of request for duty in Vietnam], retrieved on 2009-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt; These {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}} boats have [[aluminum]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s and have little or no armor, but are heavily armed and rely on speed. &quot;I didn't really want to get involved in the war&quot;, Kerry said in a book of Vietnam reminiscences published in 1986. &quot;When I signed up for the swift boats, they had very little to do with the war. They were engaged in coastal patrolling and that's what I thought I was going to be doing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;citm-pt2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Kranish |title=Heroism, and growing concern about war |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061603.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2003-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his second choice of billet was on a river patrol boat, or &quot;[[Patrol boat, rigid|PBR]]&quot;, which at the time was serving a more dangerous duty on the rivers of Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;rqstswiftboat&quot;/&gt;

On June 16, 1968, Kerry was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant, junior grade]]. On June 20, 1968, he left the ''Gridley'' for Swift boat training at the Naval Amphibious Base in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]].

===Swift boat duty===
On November 17, 1968, Kerry reported for duty at Coastal Squadron 1 in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] in [[South Vietnam]]. In his role as an officer in charge of Swift boats, Kerry led five-man crews on a number of patrols into enemy-controlled areas. His first command was Swift boat PCF-44, from December 6, 1968 to January 21, 1969, when the crew was disbanded. They were based at Coastal Division 13 at Cat Lo from December 13, 1968, to January 6, 1969. Otherwise, they were stationed at Coastal Division 11 at An Thoi. On January 30, 1969, Kerry took charge of PCF-94 and its crew, which he led until he departed An Thoi on March 26, 1969, and subsequently the crew was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/#vietnam_service |title=John Kerry's Vietnam medals |publisher=Homepage.mac.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 1969, Kerry and several other officers had a meeting in [[Saigon]] with [[Admiral]] [[Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.|Elmo Zumwalt]], the commander of U.S. Naval forces in Vietnam, and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General officer|General]] [[Creighton Abrams]], the overall commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam. Kerry and the other officers reported that the &quot;[[free-fire zone]]&quot; policy was alienating the Vietnamese and that the Swift boats' actions were not accomplishing their ostensible goal of interdicting Viet Cong supply lines. According to his biographer, [[Douglas Brinkley]], Kerry and the other visiting officers felt their concerns were dismissed with what amounted to a pep talk (''Tour of Duty,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;254–261).

===Military honors===
During the night of December 2, 1968 and early morning of December 3, 1968, Kerry was in charge of a small boat operating near a peninsula north of [[Cam Ranh Bay]] together with a Swift boat (PCF-60). According to Kerry and the two crewmen who accompanied him that night, Patrick Runyon and William Zaladonis, they surprised a group of men unloading [[sampan]]s at a river crossing, who began running and failed to obey an order to stop. As the men fled, Kerry and his crew opened fire on the sampans and destroyed them, then rapidly left. During this encounter, Kerry received a shrapnel wound in the left arm above the elbow. It was for this injury that Kerry received his first [[Purple Heart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/04/17/kerry_purple/index.html |publisher=Salon |title=John Kerry's first Purple Heart |author=Douglas Brinkley |accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry received his second Purple Heart for a wound received in action on the [[Bo De River]] on February 20, 1969. The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters. On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked. They returned to their base to refuel and were unable to return to the mission for several hours.

As the Swift boats reached the [[Cua Lon River]], Kerry's boat was hit by a [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] round, and a piece of [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] hit Kerry's left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, they had no more trouble, and reached the [[Gulf of Thailand]] safely. Kerry still has shrapnel in his left thigh because the doctors tending to him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with [[surgical suture|suture]]s rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/PDFs/Doyle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry received his second Purple Heart for this injury, but like several others wounded earlier that day, he did not lose any time off from duty.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/PDFs/SeaLords324.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/PDFs/SeaLords312-316.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight days later, on February 28, 1969, came the events for which Kerry was awarded his Silver Star. On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of his Swift boat and two others in an eight boat formation. Their mission on the Duong Keo river included bringing a demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese Marines to destroy enemy [[sampan]]s, structures and bunkers as described in the story ''The Death Of PCF 43''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwweb.com/ndc/SwiftBoats/pcf43.htm |title=LTJG Peter N. Upton, '&amp;#39;The Death Of PCF 43'&amp;#39; |publisher=Mwweb.com |date=1969-04-12 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Running into an ambush, Kerry &quot;directed the boats to turn to the beach and charge the Viet Cong positions&quot; and he &quot;expertly directed&quot; his boat's fire and coordinated the deployment of the South Vietnamese troops, according to the original medal citation (signed by Admiral Zumwalt). Going a short distance farther, Kerry's boat was the target of an RPG round; as the boat beached at the site, a VC with a rocket launcher jumped and ran from a spider hole. While the boat's gunner opened fire, wounding the VC on the leg, and while the other boats approached and offered cover fire, Kerry jumped from the boat and chased the VC and killed him, capturing a loaded rocket launcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/jksilverstar.pdf |title=Silver Star Medal - John F. Kerry |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mac.com-kerry&quot;&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/PDFs/SeaLords270.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mac.com-kerry&quot;/&gt;

Kerry's commanding officer, [[Lieutenant Commander]] George Elliott, joked to Douglas Brinkley in 2003 that he didn't know whether to court-martial Kerry for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew. Elliott recommended Kerry for the Silver Star, and Zumwalt flew into An Thoi to personally award medals to Kerry and the rest of the sailors involved in the mission. The Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in the original [[Wikisource:Silver Star Citation - John Kerry|medal citation]] signed by Zumwalt. The engagement was documented in an after-action report, a press release written on March 1, 1969, and a historical summary dated March 17, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/#silver_star |title=John Kerry's Vietnam medals |publisher=Homepage.mac.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 1969, five Swift boats were returning to base together on the Bay Hap river from their missions that day, after a firefight earlier in the day (during which time Kerry received a slight shrapnel wound in the buttocks from blowing up a rice bunker), and debarking some but not all of the passengers at a small village. They approached a fishing weir (a series of poles across the river for hanging nets), so that one group of boats went around left, hugging the shore, and a group with Kerry's 94 boat went around right along the shoreline. A mine was detonated directly beneath the lead boat, PCF-3, as it crossed the weir to the left, lifting PCF-3 completely into the air.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/chinesemac/kerry_medals/PDFs/SeaLords358.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Rassmann]], a [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] advisor who was aboard PCF-94, was knocked overboard when, according to witnesses and the documentation of the event, a mine or rocket exploded close to the boat. According to the documentation for the event, Kerry's arm was injured when he was thrown against a bulkhead during the explosion. PCF 94 returned to the scene and Kerry rescued Rassmann from the water. Kerry received the Bronze Star for his actions during this incident; he also received his third Purple Heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/jkbronzestar.pdf |title=Bronze Star Medal - John F. Kerry |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the crew of PCF-3 had been rescued, and the most seriously wounded sailors evacuated by two of the PCFs, PCF 94 and another boat remained behind and helped salvage the stricken boat together with a damage-control party that had been immediately dispatched to the scene.

===Controversy===
{{Main|John Kerry military service controversy}}
As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 200 Vietnam veterans formed the group [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]] (SBVT), subsequently renamed [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth]], which held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. The group included several members of Kerry's unit, such as Larry Thurlow, who commanded a swift boat alongside of Kerry's,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5765243/ns/msnbc_tv-about_msnbc_tv&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Gardner, who served on Kerry's boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,599034,00.html | work=Time | first=Douglas | last=Brinkley | title=The Tenth Brother | date=March 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return from Vietnam===
After Kerry's third qualifying wound, he was entitled per Navy regulations to re-assignment away from combat duties. Navy records show that Kerry's preferred choice for re-assignment was as an aide in Boston, [[New York]] or [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://files.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/thricewnd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26, 1969, after a final patrol the night before, Kerry was transferred to Cam Ranh Bay to await his orders. He was there for five or six days and left Vietnam in early April. On April 11, 1969, he reported to the [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]-based Atlantic [[Military Sea Transportation Service]], where he would remain on active duty for the following year as a personal aide to an officer, Rear Admiral [[Walter Schlech]]. On January 1, 1970 Kerry was temporarily promoted to full [[Lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He was discharged from active duty on March 1, 1970.

John Kerry was on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1966 until January 1970. He continued to serve in the Naval Reserve until February 1978. Kerry lost at least five friends in the war including Yale classmate Richard Pershing, who was [[killed in action]] on February 17, 1968.

==Anti-war activism (1970–1971)==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:The New Soldier.jpg|150x|thumb|right|Kerry co-authored the book ''[[The New Soldier]]'' with the VVAW.]] --&gt;
{{Main|Vietnam Veterans Against the War}}
After returning to the United States, Kerry joined the [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]] (VVAW). Then numbering about 20,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=Lembcke |title=Still a Force for Peace |url=http://www.vvaw.org/veteran/article/?id=378 |date=Fall 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; VVAW was considered by some (including the administration of President [[Richard Nixon]]) to be an effective, if controversial, component of the antiwar movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Williams |authorlink=Brian Williams |title=Nixon targeted Kerry for anti-war views |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4534274/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kerry Fulbright Commission.jpg|thumb|right|Kerry at the [[Fulbright Hearings]]]]
On April 22, 1971, Kerry became the first Vietnam veteran to testify before Congress about the war, when he appeared before a Senate committee hearing on proposals relating to ending the war. He was still a member of the United States Navy Reserve, holding the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade. Wearing green [[fatigues (uniform)|fatigues]] and service ribbons, he spoke for nearly two hours with the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] in what has been named the [[Fulbright Hearings]], after the Chairman of the proceedings, Senator J.W. Fulbright. Kerry began with [[s:Vietnam Veterans Against the War Statement|a prepared speech]], in which he presented the conclusions of the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]], and then went on to address larger policy issues.

The day after this testimony, Kerry participated in a demonstration with thousands of other veterans in which he and other veterans threw their medals and ribbons over a fence erected at the front steps of the [[United States Capitol]] building to dramatize their opposition to the war. Jack Smith, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], read a statement explaining why the veterans were returning their military awards to the government. For more than two hours, almost 1000 angry veterans tossed their medals, ribbons, hats, jackets, and military papers over the fence. Each veteran gave his or her name, hometown, branch of service and a statement.  Kerry threw some of his decorations as well as some given to him by other veterans to throw.  As Kerry threw his decorations over the fence, his statement was: &quot;I'm not doing this for any violent reasons, but for peace and justice, and to try and make this country wake up once and for all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Oliphant |authorlink=Tom Oliphant |title=I watched Kerry throw his war decorations |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/04/27/i_watched_kerry_throw_his_war_decorations/ | work=The Boston Globe | date=April 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary film ''[[Sir! No Sir!]]'' includes archival footage of Kerry at the demonstration: he is one of several young men seen throwing things over the fence.

===Media appearances===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kerrydoonesbury.png|thumb|Kerry's anti-war activities were satirized by [[Garry Trudeau]] in his comic strip ''[[Doonesbury]]'' on October 22, 1971.]] --&gt;
Because Kerry was a decorated veteran who took a stand against the government's official position, he was frequently interviewed by broadcast and print media. He was able to use these occasions to bring the themes of his Senate testimony to a wider audience.

For example, Kerry appeared more than once on ''[[Dick Cavett|The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television. On one Cavett program (June 30, 1971), in debating [[John O'Neill (Vietnam veteran)|John O'Neill]], Kerry argued that some of the policies instituted by the U.S. military leaders in Vietnam, such as [[free-fire zone]]s and burning noncombatants' houses, were contrary to the [[laws of war]]. In the ''[[Washington Star]]'' newspaper (June 6, 1971), he recounted how he and other Swift boat officers had become disillusioned by the contrast between what the leaders told them and what they saw: &quot;That's when I realized I could never remain silent about the realities of the war in Vietnam.&quot;

On [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet The Press]]'' in 1971, Kerry was asked whether he had personally committed atrocities in Vietnam. He responded:

{{cquote|There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages. All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried [[William Calley|Lieutenant Calley]], are war criminals.}}

===Operation POW===
Kerry's prominence also made him a frequent leader and spokesman at antiwar events around the country in 1971. One of particular note was Operation POW, organized by the VVAW in Massachusetts. The protest got its name from the group's concern that Americans were prisoners of the Vietnam War, as well as to honor American POWs held captive by [[North Vietnam]].

The event sought to tie antiwar activism to patriotic themes. Over the [[Memorial Day]] weekend, veterans and other participants marched from [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] to a rally on [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]]. The plan was to invoke the spirit of the [[American Revolution]] and [[Paul Revere]] by spending successive nights at the sites of the [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]] and the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], culminating in a Memorial Day rally with a public reading of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

The second night of the march, May 29, 1971, was the occasion for Kerry's only arrest, when the participants tried to camp on the village green in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]]. At 2:30 a.m. on May 30, 1971, local and state police awoke and arrested 441 demonstrators, including Kerry, for trespassing. All were given the [[Miranda Warning]] and were hauled away on school buses to spend the night at the Lexington Public Works Garage. Kerry and the other protesters later paid a $5 fine, and were released. The mass arrests caused a community backlash and ended up giving positive coverage to the VVAW.&lt;ref&gt;Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent - Documentary, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Against the Vietnam War: Writings by Activists, Mary Susannah Robbins, pages 78-90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lexington Minute-Man Newspaper, May 23, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry eventually quit the organization over differences with its more radical leaders and members. Kerry has been criticized during his political campaigns about his antiwar activities with VVAW, inspiring the widely-used political pejorative &quot;[[swiftboating]].&quot;

==Early political career (1972–1985)==
===1972 campaign===
In February 1972, after Kerry previously passed on an opportunity to run in another district, his wife, [[Julia Thorne|Julia]] bought a house in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. Residence there would have required Kerry to run for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] against an incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], [[Harold D. Donohue]]. Instead however, the couple rented an apartment in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]]. The incumbent in that district, [[F. Bradford Morse]], was a Republican who was thought to be retiring.

Counting Kerry, the Democratic primary race in 1972 had 10 candidates. One of these was State Representative [[Anthony R. DiFruscia]] of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]]. Both Kerry's and DiFuscia's campaign HQs were in the same building. On the eve of the September primary, Kerry's younger brother Cameron and campaign field director [[Thomas J. Vallely]], both then 22 years old, were found by police in the basement of this building, where the telephone lines were located. They were arrested and charged with &quot;[[burglary|breaking and entering]] with the intent to commit [[grand larceny]]&quot;, but the case was dismissed about a year later. At the time of the incident, DiFruscia alleged that they were trying to disrupt his get-out-the vote efforts. Vallely and Cameron Kerry maintained that they were only checking their own telephone lines because they had received an anonymous call warning that the Kerry lines would be cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;citm-pt4&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian C. |last=Mooney |title=First campaign ends in defeat |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061803.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2003-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Kerry's campaign was hurt by the election-day report of the arrest, he still won the primary, narrowly beating state Representative Paul J. Sheehy. DiFruscia placed third. Kerry lost in Lawrence and Lowell, his chief opponents' bases, but placed first in 18 of the district's 22 towns.

In the general election, Kerry was initially favored to defeat the Republican candidate, former state Representative [[Paul W. Cronin]], and an independent, Roger P. Durkin. A major obstacle, however, was the district's leading newspaper, the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative leaning]] ''[[The Sun (Lowell)|Sun]]''. The paper editorialized against him. It also ran critical news stories about his out-of-state contributions and his &quot;[[carpetbagger|carpetbagging]]&quot;, because he had moved into the district only in April. Subsequently released &quot;Watergate&quot; Oval Office tape recordings of the Nixon White House showed that defeating Kerry's candidacy had attracted the personal attention of President Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E4DF1E39F937A1575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: BIOGRAPHY; Echoes of a 1972 Loss Haunt a 2004 Campaign|authorlink=Todd Purdum|first=Todd S|last=Purdum|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2004|accessdate=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final blow came when, four days before the election, Durkin withdrew in favor of Cronin. Cronin won the election, becoming the only Republican to be elected to Congress that November in a district carried by Democratic [[President of the United States|Presidential]] [[nomination|nominee]] [[George McGovern]].

===District Attorney tenure===
After Kerry's 1972 defeat, he and his wife bought a house in Lowell. He spent some time working as a fundraiser for the [[Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere]] (CARE), an international humanitarian organization. In September 1973, he entered [[Boston College Law School]]. In July 1974, while attending [[law school]], Kerry was named executive director of Mass Action, a Massachusetts advocacy association.

He received his [[Juris Doctor]] ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) from Boston College in 1976. While in law school he had been a student prosecutor in the office of the [[District Attorney]] of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], John J. Droney. After passing the bar exam and being admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1976, he went to work in that office as a full-time prosecutor.

In January 1977, Droney promoted him to First Assistant District Attorney. In that position, Kerry had dual roles. First, he tried cases, winning convictions in a high-profile rape case and a murder. Second, he played a role in administering the office of the district attorney by initiating the creation of special white-collar and organized crime units, creating programs to address the problems of rape and other crime victims and of witnesses, and managing trial calendars to reflect case priorities. It was in this role in 1978 that Kerry announced an investigation into possible criminal charges against then Senator [[Edward Brooke]], regarding &quot;misstatements&quot; in his first divorce trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/images/day5/01.htm |title=/ Photo gallery |publisher=Boston.com |date=1978-06-16 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lieutenant Governor tenure===
In 1979, Kerry resigned from the District Attorney's office to set up a private law firm with another former prosecutor. And, although his private law practice was a success, Kerry was still interested in public office. He re-entered electoral politics by running for [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]] and won a narrow victory in the 1982 Democratic primary. The ticket, with [[Michael Dukakis]] as the gubernatorial candidate, won the general election without difficulty.

The position of Lieutenant Governor carried few inherent responsibilities. Dukakis, however, delegated additional matters to Kerry. In particular, Kerry's interest in environmental protection led him to become heavily involved in the issue of [[acid rain]]. His work contributed to a [[National Governors Association]] resolution in 1984 that was a precursor to the 1990 amendments to the federal [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].

During his campaign, Kerry had argued that nuclear evacuation planning was &quot;a sham intended to deceive Americans into believing they could survive a nuclear war&quot;.

===Election for U.S. Senate===
The junior U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, [[Paul Tsongas]], announced in 1984 that he would be stepping down for health reasons. Kerry decided to run for the seat.  As in his 1982 race for Lieutenant Governor, he did not receive the endorsement of the party regulars at the state Democratic convention. Congressman [[James Shannon]] (a favorite of [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Tip O'Neill]]) was the early favorite to win the nomination, and he &quot;won broad establishment support and led in early polling.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kornacki&gt;Kornacki, Steve (2011-02-07) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/hillary_rodham_clinton/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/02/07/john_kerry_secretary_state Will things finally, really work out for John Kerry?], ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Again as in 1982, however, Kerry prevailed in a close primary.  In his campaign, he promised to mix liberalism with tight budget controls.  As the Democratic candidate, he was elected to the Senate despite a nationwide landslide for the re-election of Republican president [[Ronald Reagan]], for whom Massachusetts voted by a narrow margin.  In his acceptance speech, Kerry asserted that his win meant that the people of Massachusetts &quot;emphatically reject the politics of selfishness and the notion that women must be treated as second-class citizens.&quot;  Kerry was sworn in as a U.S. Senator in January 1985.

===Iran-Contra hearings===
{{Main|Kerry Committee report}}
On April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator [[Tom Harkin]] of [[Iowa]] traveled to [[Nicaragua]] and met the country's president, [[Daniel Ortega]]. Though Ortega was democratically elected, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his [[leftist]] [[Sandinista]] government had strong ties to [[Cuba]] and the [[USSR]]. The Sandinista government was opposed by the [[right-wing]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed rebels known as the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]. While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict. Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the US dropping support of the Contras. The offer was denounced by the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration as a &quot;[[propaganda]] initiative&quot; designed to influence a House vote on a $14 million Contra [[foreign aid|aid package]], but Kerry said &quot;I am willing ... to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas.&quot; The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $27 million aid package six weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;citm-pt6&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=John Aloysius |last=Farrell |title=With probes, making his mark |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2003-06-20 |accessdate=2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1986, Kerry and Senator [[Christopher Dodd]], a Democrat from [[Connecticut]], proposed that hearings be conducted by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] regarding charges of [[Contras|Contra]] involvement in [[cocaine]] and [[marijuana]] [[drug trafficking|trafficking]]. Senator [[Richard Lugar]] of [[Indiana]], the Republican chairman of the committee, agreed to conduct the hearings.

Meanwhile, Kerry's staff began their own investigations and, on October 14, issued a report that exposed illegal activities on the part of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Oliver North]], who had set up a private network involving the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the CIA to deliver military equipment to right-wing Nicaraguan rebels (Contras).  In effect, North and certain members of the President's administration were accused by Kerry's report of illegally funding and supplying armed militants without the authorization of Congress.  Kerry's staff investigation, based on a year-long inquiry and interviews with fifty unnamed sources, is said to raise &quot;serious questions about whether the United States has abided by the law in its handling of the contras over the past three years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1986-10-15 |title=White House Official Linked To Arms Deliveries to Contras |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=6 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3D71339F936A25753C1A960948260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fK%2fKerry%2c%20John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kerry Committee report]] found that &quot;the Contra drug links included ... payments to drug traffickers by the U.S. State Department of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinknoiz.com/covert/contracoke.html |title=Selections from the Senate Committee Report on Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy chaired by Senator John F. Kerry |accessdate=2006-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US State Department paid over $806,000 to known drug traffickers to carry humanitarian assistance to the Contras.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cockburn |first=Alexander |coauthors=Jeffrey St Clair |date=1999-10-01 |title=Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press |publisher=Verso |isbn=1-85984-258-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry's findings provoked little reaction in the media and official Washington.&lt;ref name=&quot;react&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Corn |authorlink=David Corn |date=2001-07-16 |title=Defining John Kerry |journal=The Nation |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20010716/dcorn/2 |format=subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kerry report was a precursor to the [[Iran-Contra affair]]. On May 4, 1989, North was convicted of charges relating to the Iran/Contra controversy, including three felonies. On September 16, 1991, however, North's convictions were overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Johnston |date=1992-12-24 |title=Bush Pardons 6 In Iran Affair, Aborting A Weinberger Trial; Prosecutor Assails 'Cover-Up' Bush Diary at Issue 6-Year Inquiry Into Deal of Arms for Hostages All but Swept Away |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/991224onthisday_big.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George H.W. Bush administration===
On November 15, 1988, at a businessmen's breakfast in [[Lynn, Massachusetts|East Lynn]], Massachusetts, Kerry made a joke about then-[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[George H.W. Bush]] and his running mate, saying &quot;if Bush is shot, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] has orders to shoot [[Dan Quayle]].&quot; He apologized the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB32978E9020931&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=STLtoday - St. Louis Post-Dispatch Archives |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=1988-11-17 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their investigation of Noriega, Kerry's staff found reason to believe that the [[Pakistan]]-based [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) had facilitated Noriega's drug trafficking and [[money laundering]]. This led to a separate inquiry into BCCI, and as a result, banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991. In December 1992, Kerry and Senator [[Hank Brown]], a Republican from Colorado, released ''The BCCI Affair'', a report on the BCCI scandal. The report showed that the bank was crooked and was working with [[terrorism|terrorists]], including [[Abu Nidal]]. It blasted the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve Bank]], as well as influential [[lobbying|lobbyists]] and the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html |title=Follow the Money|last=Sirota |first=David |coauthors=Baskin, Jonathan |year=2004 |month=September}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry was criticized by some Democrats for having pursued his own party members, including former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Clark Clifford]], although Republicans said he should have pressed against some Democrats even harder. The BCCI scandal was later turned over to the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/19rogers.htm |title=The BCCI Affair - 19 Ed Rogers and Kamal Adham |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursors to presidential bid===
{{See also|Massachusetts United States Senate election, 1996|United States presidential election, 2000}}

In 1996, Kerry faced a difficult re-election fight against Governor [[William Weld]], a popular Republican incumbent who had been re-elected in 1994 with 71% of the vote. The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year. Kerry and Weld held several debates and negotiated a campaign spending cap of $6.9 million at Kerry's [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] townhouse. Both candidates spent more than the cap, with each camp accusing the other of being first to break the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rimer |first=Sara |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5D91130F936A15753C1A960958260 |title=POLITICS - THE SENATE - Promises Yield to Old-Fashioned Politics - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1996-10-25 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that this led to Kerry's win in a very close race but it is more than possible that this contributed to his victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/07/politics/campaign/07KERR.html?ex=1391490000&amp;en=d9f9da7327646acd&amp;ei=5007 |date=February 7, 2004 |accessdate=2008-03-31 |first=Kate |last=Zernike |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Facing '96 Loss, Brawling Kerry Fought to Win}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign, Kerry spoke briefly at the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]]. Senator Kerry won re-election with 53 percent to Weld's 45 percent.

In the 2000 presidential election, Kerry found himself close to being chosen as the vice presidential running mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Battenfeld |title=Kerry's stock rises in VP sweepstakes |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LOCAL/northeast/07/14/boh.kerry.veep/index.html |date=2000-07-14 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A release from the presidential campaign of presumptive Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]] listed Kerry on the short list to be selected as the vice-presidential nominee, along with North Carolina Senator [[John Edwards]], Indiana Senator [[Evan Bayh]], Missouri Congressman [[Richard Gephardt]], New Hampshire Governor [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and Connecticut Senator [[Joe Lieberman]]. Gore eventually selected Lieberman as the nominee, but Kerry continued to campaign on behalf of the Gore-Lieberman campaign through [[Election Day (politics)|Election Day]].

===Voting record===
====Overall====
Most analyses place Kerry's voting record on the left within the Senate Democratic caucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/article284m.html FactCheck.org]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2004 presidential election he was portrayed as a staunch [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] by conservative special interest groups and the Bush campaign, who often noted that in 2003 Kerry was rated the ''[[National Journal]]'''s top Senate liberal. However, that rating was based only upon voting on legislation within that past year. In fact, in terms of career voting records, the ''National Journal'' found that Kerry is the 11th most liberal member of the Senate. Most analyses find that Kerry is at least slightly more liberal than the typical Democratic Senator. Kerry has stated that he opposes privatizing [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], supports [[abortion]] rights for adult women and minors, supports [[same-sex marriage]], opposes [[capital punishment]] except for [[terrorists]], supports most [[Gun politics in the United States#Gun control laws|gun control laws]], and is generally a supporter of trade agreements. Kerry supported the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and [[Most Favored Nation]] status for China, but opposed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]].

In July 1997 Kerry joined his Senate colleagues in voting against ratification of the [[Kyoto Treaty]] on [[global warming]] without greenhouse gas emissions limits on nations deemed developing, including India and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=105&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00205 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Kerry has attacked President Bush, charging him with opposition to international efforts to combat global warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;pariah&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry says U.S. 'a sort of international pariah' |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-01-27-kerry-us-policy_x.htm?csp=34 |work= |publisher=[[USA TODAY]] |date=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2008, Kerry voted for S. Amdt. 5685 to H.R. 1424, also known as the &quot;bailout bill.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00212 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraq====
In 1991, during the debate before the [[Gulf War]], Kerry initially opposed the immediate use of military force to expel Iraqi soldiers from [[Kuwait]]. The [[United Nations]] had imposed [[International sanctions|sanction]]s on Iraq, and Kerry argued that the sanctions then in place should be given more time to work.

On December 14, 2001, 3 months after the attacks of 9/11, Kerry said on [[Larry King Live]] that &quot;I think we clearly have to keep the pressure on terrorism globally. This doesn't end with Afghanistan by any imagination. And I think the president has made that clear. I think we have made that clear. Terrorism is a global menace. It's a scourge. And it is absolutely vital that we continue against, for instance, Saddam Hussein.&quot;

More recently, Kerry said on October 9, 2002; &quot;I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.&quot; Bush relied on that resolution in ordering the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Kerry also gave a January 23, 2003 speech to [[Georgetown University]] saying &quot;Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator; leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real.&quot; Kerry did, however, warn that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war: &quot;Mr. President, do not rush to war, take the time to build the coalition, because it's not winning the war that's hard, it's winning the peace that's hard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry Makes It Official |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/02/politics/main571162.shtml |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=2003-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the invasion of Iraq, when no [[weapons of mass destruction]] were found, Kerry strongly criticized Bush, contending that he had misled the country: &quot;When the President of the United States looks at you and tells you something, there should be some trust.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush defends Iraq war in face of WMD findings |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/01/27/sprj.nirq.bush/ |publisher=CNN |date=2004-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry had spoken before the war about the sorts of weapons many believed Saddam Hussein had. On the Senate floor on October 9, 2002, he said that &quot;According to the CIA's report, all U.S. intelligence experts agree that Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons. There is little question that Saddam Hussein wants to develop nuclear weapons.&quot;

===Leadership===
During his Senate career, Kerry has sponsored or cosponsored dozens of [[Act of Congress|bill]]s. Some of his notable bills have addressed [[small business]] concerns, [[education]], [[terrorism]], [[veteran]]s' and [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]]s, marine resource protection and other topics. Of those bills with his sponsorship, as of December 2004, 11 have been signed into law.

Kerry chaired the [[Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]] from 1991 to 1993. The committee's report, which Kerry endorsed, stated there was &quot;no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1993_rpt/pow-exec.html |title=Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs |publisher=[[U.S. Senate]] |date=1993-01-13 |accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and fellow Vietnam veteran [[John McCain]], that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3DC1639F93BA15752C0A962958260 |title=Senate Urges End to U.S. Embargo Against Vietnam |author=Greenhouse, Steven |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1994-01-28 |accessdate=2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, President [[Bill Clinton]] normalized diplomatic relations with the country of Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;time072495&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983202,00.html |title=Good Morning, Vietnam |author=Walsh, James |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1995-07-24 |accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His long-time senior Senate staff includes Chief of Staff David &quot;Mac&quot; McKean and Legislative Director
George Abar.

Kerry was the chairman of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] from 1987 to 1989. He was reelected to the Senate in [[United States Senate election, 1990|1990]], [[United States Senate election, 1996|1996]] (after winning re-election against the then-[[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor of Massachusetts]] Republican [[William Weld]]), [[United States Senate election, 2002|2002]], and [[United States Senate election, 2008|2008]]. In January 2009, Kerry replaced [[Joe Biden]] as the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boston.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Seniority===
{{Main|Seniority in the United States Senate}}
As of 2011, Kerry ranked as the 10th most senior US Senator. Due to the [[longevity]] of Ted Kennedy's service, Kerry was the most senior ''junior Senator''. On Tuesday, August 25, 2009, Kerry became the senior senator from Massachusetts following Ted Kennedy's death.

In the 2004 Democratic [[United States presidential primary|Presidential primaries]], John Kerry defeated several Democratic rivals, including Sen. [[John Edwards]] (D-North Carolina.), former Vermont Governor [[Howard Dean]] and retired [[United States Army|Army]] General [[Wesley Clark]]. His victory in the Iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where Kerry revived his sagging campaign in New Hampshire and the February 3, 2004, primary states like Arizona, South Carolina and New Mexico. Kerry then went on to win landslide victories in Nevada and Wisconsin. Kerry thus won the Democratic nomination to run for President of the United States against incumbent George W. Bush. On July 6, 2004, he announced his selection of John Edwards as his running mate. Democratic strategist [[Bob Shrum]], who was Kerry's 2004 campaign adviser, wrote an article in ''Time'' magazine claiming that after the election, Kerry had said that he wished he'd never picked Edwards, and that the two have since stopped speaking to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrum |first=Robert |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1626498-2,00.html |title=Kerry's Regrets About John Edwards |publisher=Time.com |date=2007-05-30 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a subsequent appearance on ABC's ''This Week'', Kerry refused to respond to Shrum's allegation, calling it a &quot;ridiculous waste of time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/13/kerry-disregards-bob-shru_n_81260.html |title=Kerry Disregards Bob Shrum Book: &quot;Ridiculous Waste Of Time&quot; |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= January 13, 2008|accessdate=2010-03-12 |first=Nico |last=Pitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2004, Kerry conceded the race. Kerry won 59.03 million votes, or 48.3 percent of the popular vote; Bush won 62.04 million votes, or 50.7 percent of the popular vote. Kerry carried states with a total of 252 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]]. One Kerry elector voted for Kerry's running mate, Edwards, so in the final tally Kerry had 251 electoral votes to Bush's 286. Although, as in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|previous election]], there were disputes about the voting, no state was as close as [[Florida]] had been in 2000 (''see [[2004 United States presidential election controversy and irregularities]]'').

==Post-presidential election activities==
===2008 presidential election===
Immediately after the 2004 election, some Democrats mentioned Kerry as a possible contender for the 2008 Democratic nomination. His brother had said such a campaign was &quot;conceivable&quot;, and Kerry himself reportedly said at a farewell party for his 2004 campaign staff, &quot;There's always another four years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glen |last=Johnson |title=Kerry run in '08 called conceivable |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/11/09/kerry_run_in_08_called_conceivable/|work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2004-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry established a separate [[political action committee]], Keeping America's Promise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepingamericaspromise.com/ |title=Keeping America's Promise |publisher=Keepingamericaspromise.com |date=2007-07-05 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that raised money and channeled contributions to Democratic candidates in state and federal races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glen |last=Johnson |title=Kerry creates PAC to back candidates |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/12/05/kerry_creates_pac_to_back_candidates/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2004-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Keeping America's Promise in 2005, Kerry raised over $5.5 million for other Democrats up and down the ballot. Through his campaign account and his political action committee, the Kerry campaign operation generated more than $10 million for various party committees and 179 candidates for the US House, Senate, state and local offices in 42 states focusing on the midterm elections during the 2006 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brain C. |last=Mooney |title=Kerry's barnstorming sparks talk of a run |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/09/kerrys_barnstorming_sparks_talk_of_a_run/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2006-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Cumulatively, John Kerry has done as much if not more than any other individual senator&quot;, Hassan Nemazee, the national finance chairman of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee|DSCC]] said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Klein |coauthors=Kranish, Michael |title=Kerry is pressured to share campaign wealth |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/10/21/kerry_is_pressured_to_share_campaign_wealth/?page=2 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2006-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Kerry DNC 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Kerry speaks during the third night of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].]]
On January 10, 2008, Kerry endorsed Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]] for President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/10/kerry.obama/index.html |title=Kerry endorses Obama over '04 running mate |publisher=CNN.com |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was mentioned as a possible Vice Presidential candidate for Senator Obama, although fellow Senator [[Joe Biden]] was eventually chosen.  After Biden's acceptance of the vice presidential nomination, speculation arose that John Kerry would be a candidate for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hosenball|first=Mark|title=A Bid for an Obama Cabinet|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/141512|work=Newsweek|date=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] was offered the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=November 21, 2008&amp;nbsp; |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/11/hillary-clint-3.html |title=Hillary Clinton reportedly accepts Barack Obama's Cabinet offer &amp;#124; Top of the Ticket &amp;#124; Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2010-03-12|page=m|unused_data=&amp;nbsp;12:49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Clinton should she decide to retire in 2012.&lt;ref name=Kornacki/&gt;

===Controversial comments===
On October 30, 2006, Kerry was a headline speaker at a campaign rally being held for Democratic [[California gubernatorial election, 2006|California gubernatorial candidate]] [[Phil Angelides]] at [[Pasadena City College]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. Speaking to an audience composed mainly of college students, Kerry said, &quot;You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ryan |first=Andrew |title=Kerry says he &quot;botched joke&quot; and lashes out at GOP |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date =October 31, 2006 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/10/kerry_says_he_b.html |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the remarks were made public, leaders from both sides of the political spectrum, including Republicans President George W. Bush, Senator [[John McCain]] and then-Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]], said that Kerry's comments were insulting to American military forces fighting in Iraq. Democratic Representative [[Harold Ford, Jr.]] called on Kerry to apologize{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and [[Pennsylvania]] Senate candidate [[Bob Casey, Jr.]] canceled an appearance with Kerry.

Kerry initially stated: &quot;Let me make it crystal clear, as crystal clear as I know how. I apologize to no one for my criticism of the president and of his broken policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |last=Loven |first=Jennifer |title=Some Democrats join Republicans in pressing Kerry for apology |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date =November 1, 2006 |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/nation/4302629.html |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry also responded to criticism from George W. Bush and [[Dick Cheney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of John Kerry Responding to Republican Distortions, Pathetic Tony Snow Diversions and Distractions

Kerry said that he had intended the remark as a jab at President Bush, and described the remarks as a &quot;botched joke&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandalow |first=Marc |title='Botched joke' feeds a frenzy among Dems, GOP and media |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date =November 2, 2006 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/02/KERRY.TMP |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; having inadvertently left out the key word &quot;us&quot; (which would have been, &quot;If you don't, you get ''us'' stuck in Iraq&quot;), as well as leaving the phrase &quot;just ask President Bush&quot; off of the end of the sentence. In Kerry's prepared remarks, which he released during the ensuing media frenzy, the corresponding line was &quot;... you end up getting us stuck in a war in Iraq. Just ask President Bush.&quot; He also claimed that from the context of the speech which, prior to the &quot;stuck in Iraq&quot; line, made several specific references to Bush and elements of his biography, that Kerry was referring to President Bush and not American troops in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |last=Zernike |first=Kate |title=Flubbed Joke Makes Kerry a Political Punching Bag, Again |work=[[The New York Times]] |date =November 1, 2006 |url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/politics/02kerry.html?ex=1320123600&amp;en=963d1c71e86f271f&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two days of media coverage, citing a desire not to be a diversion, Kerry apologized to those who took offense at what he called the misinterpretation of his comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stout |first=David |title=Kerry Apologizes for Iraq Remark |work=[[The New York Times]] |date =November 1, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/washington/01cnd-kerry.html?ex=1320037200&amp;en=d68aa8623d11759b&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
Kerry said in [[Bali]] an administration run by the Democrats would mean the difference between night and day on policies to fight global warming and the Democrats would, unlike Bush, back mandatory emissions targets and pass a bill to create a [[Cap-and-trade|cap-and-trade system]] for [[carbon dioxide emission]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/45906/story.htm |title=UN Climate Talks Under Pressure to Drop 2020 Goals |publisher=Planet Ark |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GI Bill support===
Kerry has teamed up with Congressman [[Peter T. King]] to help sponsor a new GI Bill to help give incentives for military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billoreilly.com/show;jsessionid=3ED799094806583805B8631AAD355689?action=viewRadioShow&amp;showID=1729|title=Helping our veterans with a new G.I. Bill |author=Bill O'Reilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ted Kennedy funeral===
Kerry served as an honorary [[pallbearer]] for the late Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/08/honorary_pall_b.html Honorary pall bearers to greet Kennedy family outside Basilica], retrieved on 2009-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yacht moored in Rhode Island===
According to the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', dated July 23, 2010, Kerry commissioned construction on a new $7 million dollar yacht (A Friendship 75) in New Zealand and moored it in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]] where the Friendship yacht company is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendshipyachtcompany.com/contacts.html |title=Friendship Yacht Company |publisher=Friendship Yacht Company |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article claimed this allowed him to avoid paying Massachusetts taxes on the property including approximately $437,500 in sales tax and an annual excise tax of about $500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/track/inside_track/view/20100723senator_skipper_skips_town_on_sails_tax/srvc=home&amp;position=0 Sen.

However, on July 27, 2010, Kerry stated he had yet to take legal possession of the boat, had not intended to avoid the taxes, and that when he took possession, he would pay the taxes whether he owed them or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128716458 Sen.

===Libya===
During the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], &quot;Kerry was one of the earliest lawmakers calling for the U.S. to impose a [[no-fly zone]] in [[Libya]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carney, Timothy (2011-03-16) [http://washingtonexaminer.com/politics/2011/03/libya-interventionists-trust-government-not-people Libya interventionists trust government, not people], ''[[Washington Examiner]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan/Pakistan===
[[Image:john kerry visit to raiwind palace.jpg|250px|thumb|Senator John Kerry visiting [[Nawaz Sharif]] at his [[Raiwind Palace]] residence in Pakistan.]]
Kerry &quot;has emerged in the past few years as an important envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan during times of crisis,&quot; a ''Washington Post'' report stated in May, 2011, as Kerry undertook another trip to the two countries. The [[killing of Osama bin Laden]] &quot;has generated perhaps the most important crossroads yet,&quot; the report continued, as the senator spoke at a press conference and prepared to fly from [[Kabul]] to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Partlow, Joshua, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kerry-us-relationship-with-pakistan-at-critical-moment/2011/05/15/AFnx4D4G_story.html?hpid=z3 &quot;Kerry: U.S. relationship with Pakistan at ‘critical moment’&quot;], ''Washington Post'', May 15, 2011 11:26 AM EDT.
