'''Vector Marketing''' is the domestic sales arm of [[Cutco|Cutco Corporation]], an [[Olean, New York|Olean]], New York based [[cutlery]] manufacturer.

==History==
Vector Marketing Corporation and Cutco Cutlery Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries of Cutco Corporation. Formerly known as Alcas Corporation, the company was created as a joint venture between [[Alcoa]] and [[Case Cutlery]]. The factory in Olean, New York was completed in 1949, and the first set of Cutco Cutlery was shipped to [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania]] that same year. Alcoa purchased Case's share of the company in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourcompany&quot;/&gt;

In 1982 members of management purchased the company from Alcoa in a [[management buyout]]. The company remains privately held, and is a major employer in [[Cattaraugus County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cutco.com/company/history.jsp |title=Cutco Cutlery: History |publisher=Cutco Corporation |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofolean.org/CommDev/employers.html |title=Major Employers |publisher=City of Olean Community Development |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vector began as an independent distributor of Cutco Cutlery in 1981. Then Vector was purchased by Alcas Corporation in 1985 (in 2009 Alcas changed its name to Cutco Corporation). Vector Marketing then expanded into Canada in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;ourcompany&quot;/&gt;

As of 2011, Vector has more than 200 offices throughout the U.S. and contracts about 60,000 student workers each year to perform entry-level sales work.&lt;ref name=SB1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.com/news/2011/aug/02/company-cuts-both-ways/ | title=The Company that Cuts Both Ways | publisher=Santa Barbara Independent | date=August 2, 2011 | accessdate=August 2, 2011 | author=Robbins, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Vector Marketing is both a [[multi-level marketing]] and a [[direct sales]] group that builds its work force through advertising via newspapers, [[direct marketing]], [[word-of-mouth]], posted advertisements, [[mail|letters]] and various media on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kellman|first=Beth Robinson|title=Better Business Bureau offers advice on multilevel marketing|url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2010/04/02/news/local_news/doc4bb6bcef66c20482812527.txt?viewmode=fullstory|accessdate=May 19, 2011|newspaper=[[The Oakland Press]]|date=April 2, 2010|location=[[Oakland County, Michigan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carolinian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last =Deal|first =A.

Students are hired to sell Cutco products (mainly [[kitchen knife|kitchen knives]]) to customers, typically their friends and family members via one-on-one demonstrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/streetcents/archives/guide/2001/10/s02_01.html Episode 10].

==Business memberships==

==Controversy==
Some of Vector Marketing former independent contractors have accused Vector Marketing of unsavory business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lsureveille.com/opinion/blue-eyed-devil-don-t-get-scammed-looking-for-work-while-in-college-1.2700848 | title=Blue-Eyed Devil: Don't get scammed looking for work while in college | publisher=lsureveille.com | accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;websteruniv&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last =Lucchesi|first =Nick|title =Vector Marketing targets unaware college students|work=News |page =2|publisher=The Journal|date =February 4, 2004|url =http://media.www.webujournal.com/media/storage/paper245/news/2004/02/04/News/Vector.Marketing.Targets.Unaware.College.Students-596811.shtml|accessdate =June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Statesman&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=da Costa|first=Polyana|title=Firm misled sales recruits to sell knives, students say|url=http://news.statesmanjournal.com/article.cfm?i=85450|newspaper=Salem Statesman-Journal| date=August 21, 2004|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080704103247/http://news.statesmanjournal.com/article.cfm?i=85450|archivedate=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vector frequently advertises in newspapers and on fliers posted on bulletin boards at college campuses, but seldom do those advertisements explain the nature of the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holt|first=Shirleen|title=Help-wanted pitch may have surprise curve|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040222&amp;slug=jobads22|accessdate=July 24, 2010|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=February 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vector Marketing previously required sales representatives to make a refundable [[security deposit]] to procure a set of knives for demonstrations,&lt;ref name=&quot;websteruniv&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Statesman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=gotquestions&gt;{{cite web|title=Vector Marketing - Got Questions?|url=http://vectormarketing.com/got-questions/|publisher=Vector Marketing|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sidelines&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first =Matt|title =Vector policies questionable|page =1|work=MTSU Sidelines|date =October 6, 2004| url=http://media.www.mtsusidelines.com/media/storage/paper202/news/2004/10/06/News/Vector.Policies.Questionable-743131.shtml|accessdate =June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however no deposit is now required.&lt;ref name=SB1/&gt; Students who work for Vector Marketing are considered [[independent contractor]]s and are not reimbursed by the company for money they spend on transportation expenses and other common business expenses while working or for the time they spend at training sessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;carolinian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;websteruniv&quot;/&gt; In the 2008 case ''Vector Marketing Corporation v. New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration'', the [[Supreme Court of New Hampshire]] ruled that Vector employees are independent contractors and Vector is thus exempt from the state business profit tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2008/vecto015.pdf ''Vector Marketing Corporation v. New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration''], New Hampshire Supreme Court case no. 2007-0330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vector was sued in 1990 by the [[Arizona Attorney General]] and in 1999 by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]. In 1994, Wisconsin ordered Vector to stop providing dishonest information to recruits.&lt;ref name=&quot;consumeraffairs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Group Wants to Slice Up Vector|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news03/save.html|work=Consumeraffairs.com|accessdate=May 21, 2010|date=August 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona and Vector agreed to a settlement that punctuated a series of state actions against Vector's [[Tucson]] manager that spanned seven years. Vector agreed not to misrepresent its compensation system as part of the settlement.&lt;ref name=McKay1996&gt;McKay, Peter. &quot;For Vector Marketing, the Question of the Hour; Does the $12.05 Pay in Its Recruitment Ads Accurately Reflect the Wages or Are Respondents Being Misled?&quot;, ''The Washington Post'', July 1, 1996, p.F08.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2011}}

In 1996, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that of &quot;940 Vector recruits surveyed, nearly half either earned no money or actually lost money through working with the company&quot;.&lt;ref name=McKay1996 /&gt; A recruit who was successful in a lawsuit against Vector for failing to adhere to labor laws in New York co-founded a group, Students Against Vector Exploitation (SAVE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gripenstraw| first= Kelsey| title=Beware of Campus Scams|url=http://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2011/04/beware-of-campus-scams|accessdate=May 18, 2011|newspaper=The Bottom Line|date=April 20, 2011|location=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;consumeraffairs&quot; /&gt;

In 2008, Alicia Harris filed a federal [[class action lawsuit]] against Vector. Harris alleged that Vector violated California and federal labor law by failing to pay adequate wages and illegally coercing employees into patronizing the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Chen|first=Edward M.|title=Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2008cv05198/208948/71/|work=Harris v.
