{{History of Kosovo}}

In antiquity, the [[Dardanian kingdom]], and later [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Dardani#Roman Dardania|Dardania]] was located in the region. It was part of [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]], during which time many important monasteries, some of which are now [[UNESCO World Heritage site]]s, were built.  The [[Battle of Kosovo]], in 1389, is regarded by [[Serbs]] as a defining moment in their history and identity. It was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century and would remain under Ottoman rule for the next five centuries. Kosovo was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and with the constitution of [[Yugoslavia]], the '''[[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]]''' was created (Serbian: Аутономна Покрајина Косово и Метохија, ''Autonomna Pokrajina Kosovo i [[Metohija]]'') within the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;It is still so regarded by Serbia (as declared in the 2006 [[Constitution of Serbia]]{{cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/site/dynamics/N_Opinion_ef.asp?L=E&amp;OID=405 |title=Documents by Opinion and Study |publisher=Venice.coe.int |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term severe ethnic tensions between Kosovo's Albanian and Serb populations have left Kosovo ethnically divided, resulting in inter-ethnic violence, including the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

==Background==
Kosovo is landlocked and borders the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the south, [[Albania]] to the west and [[Montenegro]] to the northwest. The remaining line of demarcation is the subject of controversy - seen by proponents of Kosovan independence as the Kosovo-Serbia border and seen by opponents of the independence as the boundary between Central Serbia and an autonomous Kosovo all within Serbia. The largest city and the capital of Kosovo is [[Pristina]] (alternatively spelled ''Prishtina'' or ''Priština''), while other cities include [[Peć]] (Albanian: ''Peja''), [[Prizren]], [[Đakovica]] (''Gjakova''), and [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] (''Mitrovica''). Nominally, the name of Kosovo has come to represent a number of different entities over the centuries and its borders have subsequently altered. There have also been periods when no political entity has existed with the name of Kosovo. Today's outline dates back to 1946, with minor changes in 1953 (Lešak, Belo Brdo, Vračevo, Berberište).

During [[classical antiquity]], the territory roughly corresponding to present-day Kosovo was part of several tribal alliances, including that formed by the [[Dardani]].&lt;ref&gt;Pannonia and Upper Moesia. A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire. A Mocsy. Pages, 9, 26, 65&lt;/ref&gt; Upon conquest, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] dissolved existing tribal alliances and re-integrated communities centred on Roman civitates as part of the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]. Subdivisions in [[Eastern Roman Empire|Late Roman]] times created the region of &quot;Dardania&quot;. After the collapse of Roman control, the region was contested between [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Sklavenes]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and later between the Byzantines, [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] and Serbs.

The name and the region ''Kosovo'' first appears as part of a newly created region within an expanded [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian medieval state]], and soon became its ecclesiastical and secular centre; the region was subsequently enshrined by Serbs as the cradle of their national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. ''The Serbs''. p. 50: ''The shift was more apparent to the south, at first, symbolised by the transfer of the Serbian archbishops from Zica to Pec....The rulers attached themselves to a complex of castles ..around a lake in Kosovo, Prizren, and Skopje.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latawski, Smith|first=Paul Chester, Martin A. |title=The Kosovo crisis and the evolution of post-Cold War European security|year=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-5981-0|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mHB7DKYDBKUC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=kosovo+cradle#v=onepage&amp;q=kosovo%20cradle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The road to war in Serbia: trauma and catharsis |author=Nebojša Popov, Drinka Gojković |publisher=[[Central European University Press]] |year= 2000 |page= 32 |isbn=963-9116-56-4, 9789639116566 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=GkBmdCwHuDsC |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Kosovo crisis and the evolution of post-Cold War European security |author=Paul Chester Latawski, Martin A.

[[Islam]] was introduced to the population. During the late 19th century, Kosovo was the centre of the Albanian national [[National awakening of Albania|awakening]] and the battlefield of the Albanian revolts of [[Albanian Revolt of 1843–1844|1843–44]], [[Albanian Revolt of 1910|1910]] and [[Albanian Revolt of 1912|1912]]. In 1912, the Ottoman [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] was divided between [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], both of which became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], subsequently the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1918. During [[World War II]], the majority of Kosovo was part of [[Albania under Italy|Italian-occupied Albania]], followed by a [[Albania under Nazi Germany|Nazi German occupation]] before becoming an [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1946-1974)|autonomous province]] of [[SR Serbia]] under the [[1946 Yugoslav Constitution]].

After the [[Kosovo War]] and the 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]], the territory came under the interim administration of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo ([[UNMIK]]), most of whose roles were assumed by the European Union [[Rule of law|Rule of Law]] Mission in Kosovo ([[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo|EULEX]]) in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7772548.stm |title=EU launches Kosovo police mission |publisher=BBC News |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008 individual members of the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] (acting [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence#Opinion issued|in a personal capacity and not binding the Assembly itself]]) declared Kosovo's independence as the ''Republic of Kosovo''. Its independence is [[diplomatic recognition|recognised]] by {{Numrec|Kos||out of {{UNnum}} UN member states}} and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan). On 8 October 2008, upon the request of Serbia, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] adopted a resolution asking the [[International Court of Justice]] for an [[ICJ advisory opinion on the legality of Kosovo's independence|advisory opinion]] on the issue of Kosovo's [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declaration of independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE49780C20081008 |title=U.N. backs Serbia in judicial move on Kosovo , International |agency=Reuters   |date=8 October 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2010, the ICJ ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence did not violate general international law because international law contains no 'prohibition on declarations of independence': nor did the declaration of independence violate UN Security Council Resolution 1244, since this did not describe Kosovo's final status, nor had the Security Council reserved for itself the decision on final status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20100722/eu-world-court-kosovo/ |title=World court: Kosovo's independence was legal |agency=Associated Press |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2010 |work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Accordance with international law of the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo&quot;, pp 3-4, http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
{{Main|Names of Kosovo}}
''Kosovo'' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Косово}}, {{IPA-sr|kôsoʋo|}}) is the Serbian neuter [[possessive adjective]] of ''kos'' (кос) &quot;[[Turdus merula|blackbird]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinionleaders.htmlplanet.com/koskosova.html &quot;The name Kosovo&quot;]. Dr John-Peter Maher, [[Professor|Professor Emeritus]] of Linguistics, [[Northeastern Illinois University]]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] for ''Kosovo Polje'', 'blackbird field', the [[Gazimestan|site]] of the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo|Battle of Kosovo Field]]. The name of the field was applied to [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|an Ottoman province]] created in 1864.

The region currently known as &quot;Kosovo&quot; became an [[region|administrative region]] in 1946, as the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1946-1974)|Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]]. In 1974, the compositional &quot;Kosovo and [[Metohija]]&quot; was reduced to a simple &quot;Kosovo&quot; in the name of the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], but in 1990 the region was renamed the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The entire region is commonly referred to in English simply as ''Kosovo'' and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''{{lang|sq|Kosova}}'' ([[Albanian grammar|definite form]], {{IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːva|}}) or ''{{lang|sq|Kosovë}}'' ([[Albanian grammar|&quot;indefinite&quot; form]], {{IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːv|}}). In Serbia, a distinction is made between the eastern and western areas; the term ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Kosovo}}'' ({{lang|sr|Косово}}) is used for the eastern part, while the western part is called ''[[Metohija]]'' ({{lang|sr|Метохија}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution-serbia&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Kosovo 1389.PNG|thumb|The [[Battle of Kosovo Field]] in 1389 determined the future of Kosovo, and the remainder of [[Moravian Serbia|medieval Serbia]], for several centuries.]]

During antiquity, the area which now makes up Kosovo was inhabited by various tribal ethnic groups, who were liable to move, englarge, fuse and fissure with neighbouring groups. As such, it is difficult to locate any such group with precision. The ''Dardani'', whose exact ethno-linguistic affilitation is difficult to determine, were a prominent group in the region during the late Hellenistic and early Roman eras.&lt;ref&gt;N G Hammond, The Kingdoms of Illyria c. 400 – 167 BC. Collected Studies, Vol 2, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, ISBN 0-631-19807-5, Page 85, &quot;...

The area was then conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of [[Moesia Superior]] in AD 87. The region was exposed to an increasing number of 'barbarian' raids from the fourth century AD onwards, culminating with the so-called [[Slavic migrations]] of the 6th to 7th centuries. Archaeologically, the early Middle Ages represent a hiatus in the material record,&lt;ref&gt;F Curta.

Pg 76 ''the Slavs merged with these people (the Illyrians), thus preserving in their own identity remains of ancient Illyrians''&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent political and [[demographic history of Kosovo]] is not known with absolute certainty until c. 13th century AD. Archaeological findings suggest that there was steady population recovery and progression of the Slavic culture seen elsewhere throughout the Balkans. The region was absorbed into the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the 850s, where Christianity and a Byzantine-Slavic culture was cemented in the region. It was re-taken by the Byzantines after 1018, and became part of the newly established Theme of Bulgaria. As the centre of Slavic resistance to Constantinople in the region, the region often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other until the Serb principality of [[Rascia]] conquered it definitively by the end of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;John Fine.

The zenith of Serbian power was reached in 1346, with the formation of the [[Serbian Empire]]. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Kosovo became a political and spiritual centre of the Serbian Kingdom.

===Ottoman Kosovo (1455–1912)===
{{Main|History of Ottoman Kosovo}}
{{See also|Vilayet of Kosovo|History of Ottoman Serbia}}

Kosovo was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|eyalet]]'' of [[Rumelia]], and from 1864 as a separate [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] (''[[vilayet]]''). During this time, [[Islam]] was introduced to the population. The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sandžak]] region cutting into present-day [[Šumadija and Western Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kukës]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] with the city of [[Skopje]] (then Üsküp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]], including larger urban settlements such as [[Štip]] (''İştip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova'').

[[File:Kosovo03.png|thumb|300px|Vilayet of Kosovo]]

The Serbian position is that archives reveal an overwhelming Serbian demographic majority in Kosovo, which was reversed by the end of Ottoman rule, as Banac summarised: &quot;Ottoman raids, plunder, slaving forays, as well as the general devastation caused by constant wars uprooted large numbers of Serbs even before the [[Great Serb Migration]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvtxt|Banac|p=42&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Banac|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the transplantation of Albanian pastoralists from the highlands of Albania to the fertile valleys of Kosovo. However, Anscombe highlights that the most common archives – those derived from the Ottomans – do not clarify unequivocally the 'ethnic' character of the region's inhabitants, because the Ottomans classified their subjects along religious lines (''millets'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe&quot;&gt;Anscombe, Frederick F. (2006). [http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/577/1/Binder2.pdf The Ottoman empire in recent international politics – II: the case of Kosovo]. ''The International History Review'' 28 (4) 758–793.&lt;/ref&gt; Anscombe suggests that records show that the demography of Kosovo was very much mixed and that both Serbian and Albanian ethnic groups dominated. Moreover, they seem to indicate more cases of Albanians rebelling than any other ethnicity in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe&quot;/&gt; However, mainstream historiography clarifies that &quot;there is no conclusive evidence that a people unambiguously identifiable as &quot;Albanian&quot; constituted the majority of the population in Kosovo prior to the Ottoman occupation&quot;. Even the relatively &quot;pro-Albanian&quot; history written by Noel Malcolm concedes that &quot;the region probably had a predominantly Orthodox Christian and Slavic population from the eight to the mid-nineteenth centuries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Balkans: a post-communist history. I Jeffries, R Bideleux. 2007. Pg 513&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing for the possibility of some connection between the regions inhabitants prior to successive Slavic/ Serbian inflows, the Albanians who 'returned' to Kosovo in modern times were certainly not ''the same'' people, having interbred extensively with Vlachs, Slavs, Greeks and Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux, pg 513&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there is little evidence of ethnic Albanian institutional presence in medieval Kosovo, this might be because they were often baptised into Orthodox Christianity and subjected to a process of &quot;Serbianisation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bideleux. Pg 514&quot;&gt;Bideleux. Pg 514&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Islamification, the Albanians might have existed as transhumance pastoralists inhabiting Balkan highland areas, like the [[Vlachs]], engaging in a symbiotic existence with the predominantly agricultural Slavs who inhabited the valleys and plains.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding the War in Kosovo. Pg 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo, like Serbia, was occupied by Austrian forces during the Great War of 1683–1699,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/habsbott16831699.html |title=WHKMLA: Habsburg-Ottoman War, 1683–1699 |publisher=Zum.de |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Ottomans re-established their rule of the region. Such acts of assistance by the Austrian Empire (then arch-rivals of the Ottoman Empire), or Russia, were always abortive or temporary at best.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvtxt|Banac|p=42&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 115 '' Prior to the final conquest, the Turks often took inhabitants as slaves, frequently to Asia Minor&lt;/ref&gt; In 1690, the [[Serbian Patriarch of Peć]] [[Arsenije III Čarnojević|Arsenije III]] apparently led a group of 30 or 40 thousand individuals from Kosovo to the Christian north.&lt;ref&gt;The Serbs. Sima Cirkovic. [[Blackwell Publishing]]. Pg 144 ''Patriarch Arsenije III claimed that 30,000 people followed him (on another occasion the figure was 40, 000)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the [[Patriarchate of Peć]] and the position of Christians in Kosovo further deteriorated,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} including full imposition of [[jizya]] (taxation of non-Muslims).

Although initially stout opponents of the advancing Turks, Albanian chiefs ultimately came to accept the Ottomans as sovereigns. The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire's subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, Islamicisation greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Prior to this, they were organised along simple tribal lines, living in the mountainous areas of modern Albania&lt;ref&gt;Fine 1991, p. 51.: ''The Albanians were not to create any structure resembling a state until the fifteenth century. However, organised in tribes under their own chieftains, the Albanians dominated the mountains of most of what we today think of as Albania''&lt;/ref&gt; (from Kruje to the Sar range). Soon, they expanded into a depopulated Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 244 ''In Kosovo there were visible signs of ethnic change which had accumulated since [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] with the immigration of Albanian cattle farmers. In addition to the continual flow of settlers and the Islamicisation of urban centres, changes in the population were also caused by political events ... Serbs left territories still under the Sultan's control.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as northwestern Macedonia, although some might have been autochthonous to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Banac|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Banac favours the idea that the main settlers of the time were Vlachs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Banac|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Albanians gained prominent positions in the Ottoman government, no fewer than 42 [[Grand Vizier]]s of the Empire were Albanian in origin, including [[Mehmet Akif Ersoy]] (1873–1936) an Albanian from [[Peć]] who composed the [[İstiklâl Marşı|Turkish National Anthem]] in 1921, &quot;İstiklâl Marşı&quot; (The Independence March).&lt;ref&gt;Kosovo (Bradt [[Guide book|Travel Guide]]), by Gail Warrander (Author), Verena Knaus (Author), ISBN 1-84162-199-4; ISBN 978-1-84162-199-9, Publisher: Bradt Travel Guides; 1st edition (1 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; As Hupchik states, &quot;Albanians had little cause of unrest&quot; and &quot;if anything, grew important in Ottoman internal affairs&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;hupchik&quot;&gt;The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism. Dennis Hupchik&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes persecuted Christians harshly on behalf of their Turkish masters.&lt;ref name=&quot;prospect-magazine.co.uk&quot;/&gt; 

In the 19th century, there was an [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|awakening]] of [[ethnic nationalism]] throughout the Balkans. This systematised the underlying ethnic tensions into a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;prospect-magazine.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The ethnic [[National Renaissance of Albania|Albanian nationalism]] movement was centred in Kosovo. In 1878 the [[League of Prizren]] ({{lang-sq|Lidhja e Prizrenit}}) was formed. This was a [[political organisation]] which aimed to unify all the [[Albanians]] of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater [[cultural rights]],&lt;ref&gt;Kosovo What Everyone Needs to Know by Tim Judah Publisher [[Oxford University Press]] US, 2008 ISBN 0-19-537673-0, ISBN 978-0-19-537673-9 page 36&lt;/ref&gt; although they generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 244 ''since Islamicised Albanians represented a significant portion of the Ottoman armed forces and administration, they did not give up the Empire easily''&lt;/ref&gt; The League was dis-established in 1881 but nevertheless enabled the awakening of a [[nation|national identity]] amongst Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;George Gawlrych, The Crescent and the Eagle, (Palgrave/Macmilan, London, 2006), ISBN 1-84511-287-3&lt;/ref&gt; It would be clear that Albanian ambitions were at odds with Serbian aims. The Kingdom of Serbia wished to incorporate this land formerly within its empire.

===20th century===
{{Main|20th century history of Kosovo}}

Kosovo during the 20th century history has largely been characterised by wars and major population exchanges. The region formed a part of numerous entities, some internationally recognised, others not.

====Balkan Wars====
{{Main|Balkan Wars}}

The [[Young Turk]] movement took control of the Ottoman Empire after a coup in 1912 which disposed of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid&amp;nbsp;II]]. The movement supported a centralised form of government and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by the various nationalities of the Ottoman Empire. An allegiance to '''Ottomanism''' was promoted instead.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Zurcher, Ottoman sources of Kemalist thought, (New York, Routledge, 2004), Page. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; An Albanian uprising in 1912 exposed the empire's northern territories in Kosovo and [[Novi Pazar]], which led to an invasion by the [[History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]]. [[Ottoman Dynasty|The Ottomans]] suffered a serious defeat at the hands of Albanians in 1912, culminating in the Ottoman loss of most of its Albanian-inhabited lands. The Albanians threatened to march all the way to [[Salonika]] and reimpose Abdul Hamid.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, A short history of Kosovo, (London, 1998), Page 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wave of Albanians in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] ranks also deserted during this period, refusing to fight their own kin. Two months later in September of the same year, a joint Balkan force made up of Serbian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and Greek forces drove the Ottomans out of most of their European possessions.

The rise of nationalism unfortunately hampered relations between Albanians and [[Serbs in Kosovo]], due to influence from [[Russians]], [[Austrians]] and [[Ottomans]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Isa Blumi, ''Rethinking the Late Ottoman Empire: A Comparative Social and Political History of Albania and Yemen, 1878–1918''
(Istanbul: The Isis Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo's status within Serbia was finalised the following year at the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos145.htm |title=Treaty of London, 1913 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, there were concerted Serbian colonisation efforts in Kosovo during various periods between Serbia's 1912 takeover of the province and [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. So the population of Serbs in Kosovo fell after World War&amp;nbsp;II, but it had increased considerably before then.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A short history of Kosovo'', (London, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. Serbian authorities promoted creating new Serb settlements in Kosovo as well as the assimilation of Albanians into Serbian society.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schabnel 2001 20&quot;&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur, Ramesh (eds). Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention: Selective Indignation, [[Collective action|Collective Action]], and International Citizenship.

====First World War and birth of Kingdom of Yugoslavia====
{{see also|Colonisation of Kosovo}}

In the winter of 1915–16, during [[World War I]], Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Austria–Hungary|Austria-Hungary]].
In 1918, the Allied Powers pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. After the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbia was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] on 1 December 1918.

Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia ([[Zvečan]], Kosovo and southern [[Metohija]]) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, [[Raška (region)|Raška]] and [[Zeta]]. In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]].

In order to change the [[Demographics of Kosovo|ethnic composition of Kosovo]], between 1912 and 1941 a large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised [[Slavic peoples|Slavic nations]] of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as [[constituent country|constituent nations]] of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schabnel 2001 20&quot; /&gt;

Albanians and other Muslims were forced to emigrate, mainly with the [[land reform]] which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;daskalovski&quot;&gt;Daskalovski, Židas.

====Second World War====

After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel ''Kosovo: A Short History'', p.312&lt;/ref&gt;
It is not disputed that 1941-1945 tens of thousands of Serbs, mostly recent colonists, fled from Kosovo: estimates range form 30,000 to 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel, ''Kosovo: A Short History'', p.313&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war Serbian claims that there had been large-scale Albanian immigration range from 72,000 to 260,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Vickers |first= Miranda |author= Miranda Vickers |title=Between Serb and Albanian : a history of Kosovo |url= http://books.google.rs/books?ei=FAdKUNmRCJHitQb-p4DADA&amp;id=S41pAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Miranda+Vickers%22&amp;q=%22encouraged+an+extensive%22#search_anchor |year= 1998 |month= |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |page= |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=The Italian occupation force encouraged an extensive settlement programme involving up to 72,000 Albanians from Albania in Kosovo}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with a tendency to escalate, the last figure being in a petition of 1985) but these claims are disputed by other historians (some of them Serbian) and contemporary references to large-scale migration in Axis documents do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel, ''Kosovo, A Short History'', pp 312-313&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kosovo in Communist Yugoslavia====
{{Main|Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1946-1974)|Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo}}
[[File:Bibloteka Kombëtare e Kosovës.jpg|thumb|National Public Library in Pristina.]]

The province as in its outline today first took shape in 1945 as the ''Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area''. Until World War II, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo had been a political unit carved from the former [[vilayet]] which bore no special significance to its internal population. In the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a vilayet with its borders having been revised on several occasions. When the [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Ottoman province]] had last existed, it included areas which were by now either ceded to [[Albania]], or found themselves within the newly created Yugoslav republics of [[SR Montenegro|Montenegro]], or [[SR Macedonia|Macedonia]] (including its previous capital, [[Skopje]]) with another part in the [[Sandžak]] region of [[Šumadija and Western Serbia]].

Tensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government were significant, not only due to national tensions but also due to political ideological concerns, especially regarding relations with neighbouring Albania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000.

Pp. 35&quot;/&gt; High-ranking Serbian communist official [[Aleksandar Ranković]] sought to secure the position of the Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo's [[nomenklatura]].&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Katherine Bokovoy, Jill A. Irvine, Carol S. Lilly. State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992. Scranton, Pennsylvania, US: Palgrave Macmillan, 1997. Pp. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] in Kosovo at this time was repressed and both Albanians and Muslim Slavs were encouraged to declare themselves to be Turkish and emigrate to Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 35&quot;/&gt; At the same time [[Serbs]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] dominated the government, security forces, and industrial employment in Kosovo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 35&quot;/&gt; Albanians resented these conditions and protested against them in the late 1960s, accusing the actions taken by authorities in Kosovo as being [[colonialism|colonialist]], as well as demanding that Kosovo be made a republic, or declaring support for Albania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 35&quot;/&gt;

After the ouster of Ranković in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia, especially from Slovenia and Croatia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a [[Bosniaks|Muslim Yugoslav]] nationality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melissa Katherine Bokovoy 1992.

Pp. 296&quot;/&gt; Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|University of Pristina]] as an [[Albanian language]] institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melissa Katherine Bokovoy 1992.

In the aftermath of the 1974 constitution, concerns over the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo rose with the widespread celebrations in 1978 of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the [[League of Prizren]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 35&quot;/&gt; Albanians felt that their status as a &quot;minority&quot; in Yugoslavia had made them second-class citizens in comparison with the &quot;nations&quot; of Yugoslavia and demanded that Kosovo be a [[Constituent state|constituent republic]], alongside the other republics of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 36&quot;&gt;Independent International Commission on Kosovo. ''The Kosovo report: conflict, international response, lessons learned''. New York, New York, US: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Protests by Albanians in 1981 over the status of Kosovo resulted in Yugoslav territorial defence units being brought into Kosovo and a state of emergency being declared resulting in violence and the protests being crushed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 36&quot;/&gt; In the aftermath of the 1981 protests, purges took place in the Communist Party, and rights that had been recently granted to Albanians were rescinded – including ending the provision of Albanian professors and Albanian language textbooks in the education system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo. 2000. Pp. 36&quot;/&gt;

Due to very high [[birth rate]]s, the number of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90%. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, since many Serbs departed from Kosovo as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents of alleged harassment from their Albanian neighbours. While there was tension, charges of &quot;genocide&quot; and planned harassments have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example in 1986 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] published an official claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'Genocide'.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=genocide+false+kosovo |title=Religion and the creation of race ... – Google Books |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=20 July 2009|isbn=978-0-8147-6701-6|author1=Prentiss, Craig R|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though they were disproved by police statistics,&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; they received wide play in the Serbian press and that led to further ethnic problems and eventual removal of Kosovo's status. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students of the University of Pristina organised protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia along with [[human rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19810419&quot;&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, &quot;One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were brutally suppressed by the police and army, with many protesters arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdk&quot;&gt;[[Robert Elsie|Elsie, Robert]].

Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s.

The 1986 [[SANU Memorandum|Memorandum of the Serbian Academy]] warned that Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate [[economy|economic sectors]] and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): [http://archive.serbianunity.net/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum]. GIP Kultura. Belgrade.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1989 in protest the Trepca miners began a [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike|hunger strike]] before the official abolition of the autonomy.

On 28 June 1989, [[Slobodan Milošević]] delivered the [[Gazimestan speech]] in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. Many think that this speech helped Milošević consolidate his authority in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', 5 June 1999, US Edition, 1041 words, &quot;What's next for Slobodan Milošević?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, Milošević, employing a mix of intimidation and political manoeuvring, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;&gt;Rogel, Carole. [http://www.springerlink.com/index/J38474423180V000.pdf Kosovo: Where It All Began]. ''International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (September 2003): 167–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo Albanians responded with a [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] separatist movement, employing widespread [[civil disobedience]] and creation of parallel structures in [[medical school|education, medical]] care, and taxation, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Howard. ''Civil Resistance in Kosovo''. London: [[Pluto Press]], 2000. ISBN 0-7453-1569-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1990, the self declared Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo a republic in Yugoslavia and on 22 September 1991 declared Kosovo an independent country, the [[Republic of Kosova (1990–2000)|Republic of Kosova]]. In May 1992, [[Ibrahim Rugova]] was elected president.&lt;ref name=&quot;babuna&quot;&gt;Babuna, Aydın.

''Perceptions'' 8(3), September–November 2003: 43–69.&lt;/ref&gt; During its lifetime, the Republic of Kosova was only [[diplomatic recognition|recognised]] by [[Albania]]; it was formally disbanded in 2000, after the Kosovo War, when its institutions were replaced by the [[Joint Interim Administrative Structure]] established by the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK).

The conflict had been going on since the early 1990s, when Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav President, reduced Kosovo's autonomy, which the province has had since 1969. Kosovo Albanians protested and proclaimed the independent Republic of Kosovo, which, however, was only recognized by neighboring Albania, and refused to cooperate with authorities. Milosevic responded with the dismissal of all Kosovo Albanians in the local area and other harassment, which led to violence between Serbian military and Albanian inhabitants of Kosovo in the mid-1990s.

In 1995 the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the [[Bosnian War]], drawing considerable international attention. However, despite the hopes of Kosovar Albanians, the situation in Kosovo remained largely unaddressed by the [[international community]], and by 1996 the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), an ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] guerilla group, had prevailed over the [[Nonviolent resistance|non-violent resistance]] movement and had started offering armed resistance to [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] security forces, resulting in early stages of the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rama, Shinasi A. [http://www.alb-net.com/amcc/cgi-bin/viewnews.cgi?newsid985323600,53297, The Serb-Albanian War, and the International Community’s Miscalculations]. ''The International Journal of Albanian Studies'', 1 (1998), pp. 15–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, as the violence had worsened and displaced scores of Albanians, Western interest had increased. The Serbian authorities were compelled to sign a [[ceasefire]] and partial retreat, monitored by [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) observers according to an agreement negotiated by [[Richard Holbrooke]]. However, the ceasefire did not hold and fighting resumed in December 1998. The [[Račak massacre]] in January 1999 in particular brought new international attention to the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;/&gt; Within weeks, a multilateral international conference was convened and by March had prepared a draft agreement known as the [[Rambouillet Accords]], calling for restoration of Kosovo's autonomy and deployment of [[NATO]] [[peacekeeping|peacekeeping forces]]. The [[Serbian Party|Serbian party]] found the terms unacceptable and refused to sign the draft.

[[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO intervened]] by bombing Yugoslavia between 24 March and 10 June 1999, aiming to force Milošević to withdraw his forces from Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/all-frce.htm|title=Operation Allied Force|publisher=[[NATO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This military action was not authorised by the Security Council of the United Nations and was therefore contrary to the provisions of the United Nations Charter. However, other law experts disagree, stating &quot;if NATO action is designed to ensure humanitarian relief for the people of Kosovo or merely to help them to repel armed aggression, one could argue that Security Council authorization may not be necessary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asil.org/insigh30.cfm. Retrieved 22 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with continued skirmishes between Albanian guerrillas and Yugoslav forces the conflict resulted in a further massive displacement of population in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/partners/PARTNERS/3bb051c54.pdf|title=NATO and Humanitarian Action in the Kosovo Crisis|author=Larry Minear, Ted van Baarda, Marc Sommers|year=2000|publisher=[[Brown University]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conflict, roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo. Altogether, more than 11,000 deaths have been reported to [[Carla Del Ponte]] by her prosecutors.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/514828.stm |title=World: Europe UN gives figure for Kosovo dead |work=BBC News | date=10 November 1999 | accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 3,000 people are still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 [[Romani people|Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/781310.stm |title=3,000 missing in Kosovo |date= 7 June 2000 |work=BBC News | accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately by June, Milošević had agreed to a foreign military presence within Kosovo and withdrawal of his troops.

Since May 1999, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] has prosecuted crimes committed during the Kosovo War. Nine Serbian and Yugoslavian commanders have been indicted so far for [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] and violations of the [[laws of war|laws or customs of war]] in Kosovo in 1999: Yugoslavian President [[Slobodan Milošević]], Serbian President [[Milan Milutinović]], Yugoslavian [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nikola Šainović]], Yugoslavian Chief of the General Staff Gen. [[Dragoljub Ojdanić]], Serbian Interior Minister [[Vlajko Stojiljković]], Gen. [[Nebojša Pavković]], Gen. ''Vladimir Lazarević'', Deputy Interior Minister of Serbia [[Vlastimir Đorđević]] and Chief of the Interior for Kosovo [[Sreten Lukić]]. Stojiljković killed himself while at large in 2002 and Milošević died in custody during the trial in 2006. In 2009 Milutinovic was acquitted by the Trial Chamber; five defendants were found guilty (three sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, and two to 22 years); and in 2011 the remaining defendant, who had been in hiding when the main trial started, was found guilty and sentenced to 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/sid/10095&lt;/ref&gt; The verdicts are under appeal. The indictment against the nine alleged that they directed, encouraged or supported a campaign of terror and violence directed at Kosovo Albanian civilians and aimed at the expulsion of a substantial portion of them from Kosovo. It has been alleged that about 800,000 Albanians were expelled as a result. In particular, in the indictment of June 2006, the accused were charged with murder of 919 identified Kosovo Albanian civilians aged from one to 93, both male and female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/cis/en/cis_milosevic_slobodan.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milutinovic/cis/en/cis_milutinovic_al_en.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/cis/en/cis_djordjevic_en.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/ind/en/dor-3rdai070119.pdf |title=ICTY/org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Office of the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor has secured final judgements involving the conviction of 7 persons, sentenced to a total of 136 years imprisonment for war crimes in Kosovo involving 89 Albanian victims. As of June 2012, a trial of 12 defendants for an alleged massacre of 44 Albanian victims in Čuška (Alb: Qyshk) is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/predmeti_eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Six KLA commanders were indicted in two cases: [[Fatmir Limaj]], [[Isak Musliu]] and [[Haradin Bala]],&lt;ref&gt;Another Albanian was indicted together with them, but the charges against him were promptly withdrawn after his arrest, as he turned out not to be the person referred to in the indictment.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ramush Haradinaj]], [[Idriz Balaj]] and [[Lahi Brahimaj]]. They were charged with crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in Kosovo in 1998, consisting in persecutions, cruel treatment, torture, murders and rape of several dozens of the local Serbs, Albanians and other civilians perceived unloyal to the KLA. In particular, Limaj, Musliu and Bala were accused of murder of 22 identified detainees at or near the [[Lapušnik prison camp|Lapušnik Prison Camp]]. In 2005 Limaj and Musliu were found not guilty on all charges, Bala was found guilty of persecutions, cruel treatment, murders and rape and sentenced to 13 years. The appeal chamber affirmed the judgements in 2007. In 2008 Ramush Haradinaj and Idriz Balaj were acquitted, whereas Lahi Brahimaj was found guilty of cruel treatment and torture and sentenced to six years. Notices of appeal are currently being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/limaj/cis/en/cis_limaj_al_en.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/haradinaj/cis/en/cis_haradinaj_al_en.pdf |title=ICTY.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/limaj/ind/en/lim-2ai040212e.pdf|title=Second Amended Indictment – Limaj et al |publisher=Icty.org |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN administration period===

[[File:White Drini 05 01.jpg|thumb|The [[White Drin]] river.]]

On 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration ([[UNMIK]]) and authorised [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the [[territorial integrity]] of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Resolution 1244 (1999) |date=17 June 1999 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/371562.stm |accessdate=19 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Serbs (and Roma) left with the Serb forces, or as a result of revenge attacks and occupation of Serb properties in the aftermath of the conflict. Estimates of the number of Serbs thus displaced range from 65,000 to 250,000&lt;ref&gt;European Stability Initiative (ESI): [http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_document_id_53.pdf The Lausanne Principle: Multiethnicity, Territory and the Future of Kosovo's Serbs (.pdf)] , 7 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coordinating Centre of Serbia for Kosovo-Metohija: [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20040416201639/http://www.serbia.sr.gov.yu/coordination_centre/index.html Principles of the program for return of internally displaced persons from Kosovo and Metohija].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]: 2002 Annual Statistical Report: [[Serbia and Montenegro]], pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]] (USCRI): [http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=1624 Country report: Serbia and Montenegro 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2002/coe-kos-16oct.pdf Kosovo: The Human Rights Situation and the Fate of Persons Displaced from Their Homes (.pdf)] &quot;, report by [[Álvaro Gil-Robles|Alvaro Gil-Robles]], [[Council of Europe]] Commissioner for Human Rights, Strasbourg, 16 October 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], Critical Appraisal of Responsee Mechanisms Operating in Kosovo for Minority Returns, Pristina, February 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Refugees 2000, p. 2&quot;&gt;US Committee for Refugees (USCR), April 2000, Reversal of Fortune: Yugoslavia's Refugees Crisis Since the Ethnic Albanian Return to Kosovo, p. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Refugees 2000, p. 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2002/coe-kos-16oct.pdf Kosovo: The human rights situation and the fate of persons displaced from their homes (.pdf)] &quot;, report by [[Álvaro Gil-Robles|Alvaro Gil-Robles]], [[Council of Europe]] Commissioner for Human Rights, Strasbourg, 16 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Relations and Security Network (ISN): [http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_lausanne_reactions_id_1.pdf Serbians return to Kosovo not impossible, says report (.pdf)] , by Tim Judah, 7 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that the 1991 census recorded only 194,000 Serbs living in Kosovo, the higher estimates, if based on fact, must include Roma, Serbs displaced within Kosovo, and perhaps other elements. It is generally agreed by both Serbs and Albanians that the number of Serbs remaining in Kosovo is in the range of 100,000-120,000, although in most urban centres other than North Mitrovica and Kamenica the Serb population is now negligible. Although, since 2004, the Kosovo Government has been the largest funder of returns projects for displaced persons, the number of such returns remains relatively low, partly due to continued fears of possible violence or harassment.

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]]. The UN-backed talks, led by UN [[Diplomatic rank|Special Envoy]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm |title=UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock |publisher=BBC News |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|UN Security Council Resolution]] which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the United States, the United Kingdom and other European members of the [[Security Council]], was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |author=Southeast European Times |date= 10 July 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1 |title=A long reconciliation process is required |author=James Dancer |date=30 March 2007 |work=Financial Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a &quot;[[Troika (triumvirate)|Troika]]&quot; consisting of negotiators from the [[European Union]] ([[Wolfgang Ischinger]]), the United States ([[Frank G. Wisner]]) and [[Russia]] (Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko) launched a new effort to reach a status outcome acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. Despite Russian disapproval, the US, the United Kingdom, and France appeared likely to recognise Kosovar independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2209907,00.html |title=Bosnian nightmare returns to haunt EU |author=Simon Tisdall |date=13 November 2007 |work=The Guardian |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo had a 120-member Kosovo Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb and non-Albanian nations (e.g. Bosniaks, Roma, etc.). The Kosovo Assembly was responsible for electing the President, Prime Minister, and Government of Kosovo, and for passing legislation which was vetted and promulgated by UNMIK.

====Provisional Institutions of Self-Government====

In November 2001, the OSCE supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.osce.org/kosovo/13208.html: OSCE Mission in Kosovo – Elections] &quot;, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe&lt;/ref&gt; After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as President and [[Bajram Rexhepi]] (PDK) as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1846264.stm: Power-sharing deal reached in Kosovo] &quot;, [[BBC News]], 21 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in [[Ramush Haradinaj]] (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicinternationallaw.org/docs/BW2005/Balkan_Watch.11April_05.pdf |title=Publicinternationallaw.org |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|Parliamentary elections]] were held on 17 November 2007. After early results, [[Hashim Thaçi]] who was on course to gain 35 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]], and stated his intention to declare independence. Thaçi formed a coalition with current President [[Fatmir Sejdiu]]'s [[Democratic League of Kosovo|Democratic League]] which was in second place with 22 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7179850.stm: Kosovo gets pro-independence PM] &quot;, BBC News, 9 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The turnout at the election was particularly low. Most members of the Serb minority refused to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=info&amp;article=454473&amp;lng=1 |title=Ex-guerrilla chief claims victory in Kosovo election |publisher=EuroNews |date= |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian Liberal Party (SLS), led by Slobodan Petrovič, is the dominant force in all Serb-majority municipalities south of the River Ibar, and is a coalition partner in the Kosovo Government. Turn-out in local elections in these municipalities approaches turn-out in most Albanian-majority municipalities. North of the River Ibar the picture is different. Turn-out in local elections organised under Kosovo applicable law is almost zero and the de facto authorities in these municipalities continue to reject Kosovo's Government.

Kosovo has not made a formal application for UN membership yet.

The [[European Union]] has no official position towards Kosovo's status, but has decided to deploy the [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo]] to ensure a continuation of international civil presence in Kosovo. {{As of|2008|4}}, most of the member-countries of [[NATO]], EU, [[Western European Union|WEU]] and [[OECD]] have recognised Kosovo as independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosovothanksyou.com/stats.php |title=Recognition Information and Statistics – Who Recognized Kosova?

The Serb minority of Kosovo, which largely opposes the declaration of independence, has formed the [[Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija]] in response. The creation of the assembly was condemned by Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK has said the assembly is not a serious issue because it will not have an operative role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/06/30/feature-01 |title=Kosovo Serbs convene parliament; Pristina, international authorities object (SETimes.com) |publisher=SETimes.com |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICJ advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence===
{{Main|International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence}}

''Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence In Respect of Kosovo'' was a request for an [[advisory opinion]] referred to the [[International Court of Justice]] by the [[UN General Assembly]] regarding the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|2008 unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo]]. This was the first case regarding a [[unilateral]] [[declaration of independence]] to be brought before the court.

===Economy===
{{Main|Economy of Kosovo}}
[[File:Kosovo-lignite.jpg|thumb|Kosovo [[lignite]] reserves compared to the world]]
[[File:Bill Clinton Boulevard2.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]] mural, [[Bill Clinton Boulevard]] in Pristina.]]

Kosovo was the poorest part of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), and in the 1990s its economy suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the Yugoslav wars, Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees, and international sanctions on Serbia, of which it was then part.

After 1999, it had an economic boom as a result of post-war reconstruction and foreign assistance. In the period from 2003 to 2011, despite declining foreign assistance, growth of GDP averaged over 5% a year. This was despite the global financial crisis of 2009 and the subsequent eurozone crisis. Inflation was low. 

Kosovo has a strongly negative balance of trade; in 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP, and was 39% of GDP in 2011. Remittances from the Kosovo diaspora accounted for an estimated 14 percent of GDP, little changed over the previous decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;&gt; '' IMF Country Report No 12/100 '' http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf &quot;Unemployment, around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. The private sector which has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak. The economy, and its sources of growth, are therefore geared far more to demand than production, as shown by the current account, which was in 2011 in deficit by about 20% of GDP. Consequently Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora (the majority of these from Germany and Switzerland), FDI (of which a high proportion also comes from the diaspora), and other capital inflows.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;/&gt; 

Government revenue is also dependent on demand rather than production; only 14% of revenue comes from direct taxes and the rest mainly from customs duties and taxes on consumption. In part this reflects low levels of production as shown in the current account; but in part it reflects very low direct taxation rates. In 2009 corporation tax was halved from 20% to 10%; the highest rate of income tax is also 10%.

However, Kosovo has very low levels of general government debt (only 5.8% of GDP),&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;/&gt; although this would rise if Serbia recognised Kosovo and an agreement was reached on Kosovo's share of SFRY debt (which Serbia estimated in 2009 at $1.264 billion &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2637230220080226 |title=Serbia should stop servicing Kosovo debt: EconMin , International |agency=Reuters   |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which it is currently servicing, though Kosovo is putting money into a separate account to take account, on a conservative basis, of potential liabilities). The Government also has liquid assets resulting from past fiscal surpluses (deposited in the Central Bank and invested abroad). Under applicable Kosovo law, there are also substantial assets from privatisation of socially-owned enterprises (SOEs), also invested abroad by the Central Bank, which should mostly accrue to the Government when liquidation processes have been completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;/&gt; 

The net foreign assets of the financial corporations and the Pension Fund amount to well over 50% of GDP. Moreover, the banking system in Kosovo seems very sound. For the banking system as a whole, the Tier One Capital Ratio as of January 2012 was 17.5%, double the ratio required in the EU; the proportion of non-performing loans was 5.9%, well below the regional average; and the credit to deposit ratio was only just above 80%. The assets of the banking system have increased from 5% of GDP in 2000 to 60% of GDP as of January 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;/&gt; Since the housing stock in Kosovo is generally good by South-East European standards, this suggests that (if the legal system's ability to enforce claims on collateral and resolve property issues is trusted), credit to Kosovars could be safely expanded. 

The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) introduced an external trade office and customs administration on 3 September 1999, when it established border controls in Kosovo. All goods imported to Kosovo face a flat 10% duty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html Doing Business in Kosovo - U.S. Commercial Service Kosovo (UN Administered)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  These taxes are collected at all Customs Points at Kosovo's borders, including that between Kosovo and Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seerecon.org/kosovo/documents/wb_econ_report/wb-kosovo-econreport-2-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed free-trade agreements with Croatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/globe-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_category=123&amp;nav_id=37090 Croatia, Kosovo sign Interim Free Trade Agreement], [[B92]], 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euinkosovo.org/upload_press/4.06%20-%20UNMIK%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20Initial%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement%2017.2.06.pdf &quot;UNMIK and Bosnia and Herzegovina Initial Free Trade Agreement&quot;.

This means that Kosovo has no levers of monetary policy over its economy, and must rely on a conservative fiscal policy to provide the means to respond to external shocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;/&gt; Officially registered unemployment stood at 40% of the labour force in January 2012,&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; although some estimates have put it as high as 60%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386 ECIKS - News and analysis about Kosovo Economy in English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The IMF have pointed out, however, that informal employment is widespread, and the ratio of wages to per capita GDP is the second highest in South-East Europe; the true rate may therefore be lower.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF Country Report No 12/100&quot;/&gt; Unemployment among the Roma minority may be as high as 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/882693--roma-forced-back-to-dire-poverty-deprivation Roma forced back to dire poverty, deprivation] 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mean wage in 2009 was $2.98 per hour. 

The dispute over Kosovo's international status, and the interpretation which some non-recognising states place on symbols which may or may not imply sovereignty, continues to impose economic costs on Kosovo. Examples include flight diversions because of a Serbian ban on flights to Kosovo over its territory; loss of revenues because of a lack of a regional dialling code (end-user fees on fixed lines accrue to Serbian Telecoms, while Kosovo has to pay Monaco and Slovenia for use of their regional codes for mobile phone connections; no IBAN code for bank transfers; and no regional Kosovo code for the internet. 

A major deterrent to foreign manufacturing investment in Kosovo was removed in 2011 when the European Council accepted a Convention allowing Kosovo to be accepted as part of its rules for diagonal cumulative origination, allowing the label of Kosovo origination to goods which have been processed there but originated in a country elsewhere in the Convention. Since 2002 the European Commission has compiled a yearly progress report on Kosovo, evaluating its political and economic situation. Kosovo became a member of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on 29 June 2009.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Kosovo}}
[[File:Liqeni I Madhe Peje Kosovo from Fatos Katallozi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lake Lićenat]]]]

Kosovo represents an important link between central and southern Europe and the Adriatic and Black Seas. Kosovo has an area of 10,908 square km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitkosova.org/test/?page=2,4 |title=Visit Kosova}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[44th parallel north|44° N]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[22nd meridian east|22° E]]. The border of Kosovo is approximately 602.09 kilometers long.&lt;ref name=&quot;osmsurround1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Adrian Stabiszewski, Multimedia und IT |url=http://ra.osmsurround.org/analyze.jsp?relationId=53295 |title=OSM Relation Analyzer |publisher=Ra.osmsurround.org |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its climate is [[continental climate|continental]], with warm summers and cold and snowy winters. Most of Kosovo's terrain is mountainous, the highest peak is [[Đeravica]] ({{convert|2656|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=/}}). There are two main plain regions, the [[Metohija]] basin is located in the western part of the Kosovo, and the [[Plain of Kosovo]] occupies the eastern part. The main rivers of the region are the [[White Drin]], running towards the [[Adriatic Sea]], with the [[Erenik]] among its [[tributary|tributaries]]), the [[Sitnica]], the [[South Morava]] in the [[Goljak]] area, and [[Ibar River|Ibar]] in the north. The biggest lakes are [[Gazivoda Lake|Gazivoda]], [[Radonjić]], [[Lake Batlava|Batlava]] and [[Badovac Lake|Badovac]].
39.1% of Kosovo is [[forested]], about 52% is classified as agricultural land, 31% of which is covered by pastures and 69% is arable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rec.org/REC/Publications/CountryReports/Kosovo.PDF Strategic Environmental Analysis of Kosovo]. The Regional Environmental Centre for [[Central Europe|Central and Eastern Europe]], Prishtina, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Kosovo belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Kosovo belongs to the ecoregion of [[Balkan mixed forests]].Currently, the 39,000 ha Šar Mountains National Park, established in 1986 in the [[Šar Mountains]] along the border with the Republic of Macedonia, is the only [[national park]] in Kosovo, although the [[Balkan Peace Park]] in the [[Prokletije]] along the border with Montenegro has been proposed as another one.&lt;ref name=&quot;biodiv&quot;&gt;[http://www.ks-gov.net/akmm/dokumente/Kosovo-Biodiversity%20Assessment.pdf Kosovo: Biodiversity assessment]. Final Report submitted to the [[USAID]], ARD-BIOFOR IQC Consortium, May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest cities are [[Pristina]], the capital, with an estimated 198,000 inhabitants. The old city of [[Prizren]] is towards the south west, with a population of 178,000. [[Peć]] in the west has 95,000 inhabitants with [[Uroševac]] in the south at around 108,000.

===Natural resources===
Kosovo is rich in [[natural resources]]. In Kosovo there are lots of reserves of lead, [[zinc]], silver, nickel, [[cobalt]], copper, iron and [[bauxite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural resources key to the future&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosovo: Natural resources key to the future, say experts|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Business/?id=1.0.1683003038|work=adnkronos.com|accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also believed to be around 14,000&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes of [[lignite]].

[[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] estimates the following ratio: 88% [[Albanians]], 8% [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo Serbs]] and 4% other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html CIA.gov]&lt;!-- {{Dead link|date=July 2009}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
According to latest CIA [[The World Factbook]] estimated data, as of July 2009, Kosovo's population stands at '''1,804,838''' persons. It stated that ethnic composition is &quot;Albanians 88%, Serbs 7%, other 5% (Bosniak, Gorani, Roma, Turk, Ashkali, Egyptian, [[Janjevci|Janjevci – Croats]])&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html#People |title=World Factbook |author=CIA |publisher=CIA |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanians, steadily increasing in number, have constituted a majority in Kosovo since the 19th century, the earlier ethnic composition being disputed. Kosovo's political boundaries do not quite coincide with the ethnic boundary by which Albanians compose an absolute majority in every municipality; for example, Serbs form a local majority in [[North Kosovo]] and [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|two other municipalities]], while there are large areas with an Albanian majority outside of Kosovo, namely in the neighbouring regions of former Yugoslavia: the north-west of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and in the [[Preševo Valley]] in [[Southern and Eastern Serbia]].

At 1.3% per year, ethnic [[Albanians in Kosovo]] have the fastest rate of growth in population in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml |title=Albanian Population Growth |publisher=Files.osa.ceu.hu |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080227175620/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml|archivedate=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over an 82-year period (1921–2003) the population of Kosovo grew to 460% of its original size. Whereas Albanians constituted 60% of Kosovo's 500,000 person population in 1931, by 1991 Albanians constituted 81% of Kosovo's 2 million person population.&lt;ref&gt;Krinka Vidakovic Petrov, &quot;Kosovo: Through the Looking Glass,&quot; [[Israel Council on Foreign Relations|The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]] Vol. 2 No. 1 (Winter 2008), 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; If growth continues at such a pace, the population will reach 4.5&amp;nbsp;million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kosovo-hotels.com/index.php?mod=kos_profile |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080212143112/http://kosovo-hotels.com/index.php?mod=kos_profile |archivedate=12 February 2008 |title=Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtina – Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtinë |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is unlikely to happen; until about 1990, Kosovo Albanians had very high birth rates of about 4 children per woman, similar to many poor developing countries, but this has fallen down to about two since then and will likely sink below replacement eventually, as it has in [[Albania]] itself.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} In addition, Kosovo has a high emigration rate now which it did not have before 1990.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

By contrast, from [[Demographics of Kosovo#World War II-1968|1948]] to [[Demographics of Kosovo#1989-1999: Centralized Yugoslav Control|1991]], the Serb population of Kosovo increased by a mere 12% (one third the growth of the population in Central Serbia). In addition, in the same period, hundreds of thousands have left to settle in more prosperous [[Central Serbia]] or Western Europe. 60% of Kosovo's pre-1999 [[Kosovo Serbs|Serbian]] population resides in Serbia proper following the [[ethnic cleansing]] campaign in 1999. The population of Albanians in Kosovo increased by 300% in the same period{{spaced ndash}}a rate of growth twenty-five times that of the Serbs in Kosovo. Serbs, similar to most other Eastern European Christian ethnic groups, since about 1990 have had very low birth rates (about 1.5 children per woman) and more deaths than births. This ensures a continued dwindling of the Serb minority as a percentage of the population, even with the dropping births among the Albanians.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The two main religions of Kosovo are Islam and Christianity. The great majority of Kosovo Albanians (perhaps 97%) have Muslim family backgrounds, as do the Bosniak, Gorani, and Turkish communities and by some of the Roma/Ashkali/Egyptian community. Kosovo censuses do not ask questions on religious affiliation; it is therefore not clear how many maintain a Muslim affiliation. Kosovo society (like the constitution) remains largely secular. There are an estimated 65,000 Catholics (mostly Albanians, but with some Croats) in Kosovo. The Serb population is almost exclusively Serbian Orthodox. Around 40% of mosques were destroyed in 1998-99, and 140 Orthodox churches were reported to have been destroyed or damaged in the six weeks after the withdrawal of Serbian forces, and around 30 in another outburst of violence in 2004.
There is also a small number of evangelical Protestants, whose tradition dates back to the [[Methodist]] missionaries' work centred in [[Bitola]] in the late 1800s. They are represented by the Kosovo Protestant Evangelical Church (KPEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kishaprotestante.net|title=Mirësevini në faqen zyrtare të Kishës Protestante Ungjillore të Kosovës|last=Protestant Church of Kosovo web page|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations between Albanian and Serb communities===

While there have always been tensions between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, there are also areas where they have had a long history of co-existence as part of what was accepted under the Ottoman Empire to be a multi-ethnic polity. Tensions seem to have worsened in the second half of the nineteenth century and the twentieth century, as ideas of mono-ethnic &quot;nation states&quot; took hold in the Balkans, starting in Serbia. These resulted in large-scale forced emigration of Albanians in central Serbia to Kosovo and elsewhere in 1878; atrocities during the Serbian conquest; attempts to colonise Kosovo with Serbs in the 1920s, 1930s,and 1990s; and projects to &quot;repatriate&quot; people declaring themselves Turkish to Turkey in the 1930s and 1960s (many of them middle-class who might have acted as the natural foundation of a multi-ethnic regional identity). This process culminated in the forcible expulsion of a majority of Kosovo Albanians in 1999, many of whom found on their return that their houses had been destroyed and who displaced Serbs in their turn. It is therefore unsurprising that sociological studies have found that there was little inter-marriage between the two communities during the late Yugoslav era.
There are, however, some areas of Kosovo in which even the events of 1999 had relatively little serious effect on Albanian-Serb relations: in Kamenica, the vegetable market continues to operate on a multi-ethnic basis, and the 2004 riots resulted in a few broken windows.

===The Roma and other minorities===
[[File:Kosovo Roma.PNG|thumb|Roma in Kosovo according to the estimation of the UN-mission in 2005]]
Despite their planned integration into the Kosovar society and their recognition in the Kosovar constitution, [[Romani people|Romani]] and other minorities (i.e. Ashkali and Egyptian communities) continue to face many difficulties, such as segregation and discrimination, in housing, education, health, employment and social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dissidentvoice.org/Articles/Rifati_Kosovo.htm |title=The Roma and &quot;Humanitarian&quot; Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo |publisher=Dissidentvoice.org |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many camps around Kosovo continue to house thousands of [[Internally Displaced People]], all of which are from minority groups and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) – Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountries)/165F03EE03E9D015C1257662005CE095?opendocument&amp;count=10000 |title=IDMC , Internally Displaced persons (IDPs) in Kosovo |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many of the Roma are believed to have sided with the Serbs during the conflict, taking part in the widespread looting and destruction of Albanian property, [[Minority Rights Group International]] report that Romani people encounter hostility by Albanians outside their local areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) – Norwegian Refugee Council |url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpEnvelopes)/B4A8E121B6EA5BBB802570B8005AA863?OpenDocument |title=IDMC : Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre , Countries , Kosovo , Roma, Ashkaelia and Egyptians in Kosovo (2006) |publisher=Internal-displacement.org |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report adds:

{{quote|text=In Kosovo, the critical issue for most minorities has been that of day-to-day security. Organised violence, harassment and attacks on property began at the start of the international administration and have continued ever since. Minorities do not feel adequately protected by the authorities in Kosovo. As described above, organised systematic ethnic cleansing took place in 1999 and 2004, but at all times ongoing insecurity has been chronic. What is critical is not only the actual insecurity but also the perception of minorities as to whether they can be adequately protected.

===Culture and media===
{{See also|Music of Kosovo|List of radio stations in Kosovo|Television in Kosovo}}

Although in Kosovo the music is diverse, authentic [[Music of Albania|Albanian music]] (see ''[[World Music]]'') and [[Serbian music]] do still exist. Albanian music is characterised by the use of the ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''. Classical music is also well known in Kosovo and has been taught at several [[List of pre-college music schools|music schools]] and universities (at the [[Universiteti i Prishtinës|University of Prishtina Faculty of Arts]] in [[Pristina]] and the [[Faculty of Arts of Pristina|University of Priština Faculty of Arts]] at [[Kosovska Mitrovica]]).

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Kosovo}}
[[File:Pristina City Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[City Stadium (Pristina)|City Stadium]] in [[Pristina]].]]

Several sports federations have been formed in Kosovo within the framework of Law No. 2003/24 &quot;Law on Sport&quot; passed by the Assembly of Kosovo in 2003. The law formally established a national [[Olympic Committee of Kosovo|Olympic Committee]], regulated the establishment of sports federations and established guidelines for [[sports club]]s. At present only some of the sports federations established have gained international recognition.

===Rule of law===
Following the [[Kosovo War]], due to the many weapons in the hands of civilians, law enforcement inefficiencies, and widespread devastation, both [[gjakmarrja|revenge killings]] and [[ethnic violence]] surged tremendously. The number of reported murders rose 80% from 136 in 2000 to 245 in 2001. The number of reported arsons rose 140% from 218 to 523 over the same period. UNMIK pointed out that the rise in reported incidents might simply correspond to an increased confidence in the police force (i.e., more reports) rather than more actual crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;unmikstat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmikonline.org/civpol/statistics.htm |title=UNMIK statistics |publisher=Unmikonline.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[UNODC]], by 2008, murder rates in Kosovo had dropped by 75% in five years.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/10585/ Balkaninsight.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] report, March 2008. P. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of noted serious crimes increased between 1999 and 2000, since then it has been &quot;starting to resemble the same patterns of other European cities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unmikstat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iwpr.net/?p=bcr&amp;s=f&amp;o=249549&amp;apc_state=henibcr2001 Kosovo Crime Wave], 17 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], the aftermath of the war resulted in an increase in the [[trafficking of women]] for sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3686173.stm |title=Kosovo UN troops 'fuel sex trade' |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2004 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071213220014/http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng |title=Kosovo: Trafficked women and girls have human rights |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Traynor in Zagreb |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1211214,00.html |title=Nato force 'feeds Kosovo sex trade' |publisher=Guardian |date= 7 May 2004|accessdate=6 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] data, in 2000–2004, Kosovo was consistently ranked fourth or fifth among the countries of Southeastern Europe by number of [[human trafficking]] victims, after Albania, [[Moldova]], Romania and sometimes [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iom.int&quot;&gt;[http://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/published_docs/studies_and_reports/second_annual05.pdf Second Annual Report on Victims of Trafficking in South-Eastern Europe].

P. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual landmines and other [[unexploded ordnance]] remain in Kosovo, although all roads and tracks have been cleared. Caution when travelling in remote areas is advisable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/content/en/travel-advice/europe/12793683/FCO_TRV_ca_kosovo |title=Kosovo travel advice |publisher=Fco-stage.fco.gov.uk |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo is extremely vulnerable to organised crime and thus to [[money laundering]]. In 2000, international agencies estimated that Kosovo was supplying up to 40% of the heroin sold in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/mar/13/balkans |title=Kosovo drug mafia supply heroin to Europe , World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=20 July 2009  | date=13 March 2000 | first=Maggie | last=O'Kane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[1997 rebellion in Albania|1997 unrest in Albania]] and the [[Kosovo War]] in 1998–1999 ethnic Albanian traffickers enjoyed a competitive advantage, which has been eroding as the region stabilises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[UNODC]] report, March 2008. P. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a 2008 report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], overall, ethnic Albanians, not only from Kosovo, supply 10 to 20% of the heroin in Western Europe, and the traffic has been declining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[UNODC]] report, March 2008. P. 14, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a report by Swiss MP [[Dick Marty]] claimed to have evidence that a criminal network tied to the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] and the Prime Minister, [[Hashim Thaci]], executed prisoners and [[Organ theft in Kosovo|harvested their kidneys for organ transplantation]]. The Kosovo government rejected the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|title=Kosovo rejects Hashim Thaci organ-trafficking claims|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11996255|date=15 December 2010|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 January 2011, the [[Council of Europe]] endorsed the report and called for a full and serious investigation into [[Organ theft in Kosovo|its contents]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/14/illegal-organ-removals-charges-kosovo 'Kosovo physicians accused of illegal organs removal racket'] The Guardian, 14 December 2010.

===Wines===
[[Wine]] has historically been produced in Kosovo; both red and white. Currently the wine industry is successful and growing after the war in the 1990s. The main heartland of Kosovo's wine industry is in [[Orahovac|Orahovac (Rahoveci)]] where millions of litres of wine is produced. The main wines produced in Kosovo include [[Pinot Noir]], [[Merlot]] and [[Chardonnay]]. Kosovo has recently been exporting wines to [[Germany]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kosovo's wines flowing again&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Kosovo's wines flowing again|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15401459|accessdate=29 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
