{{Libertarianism sidebar|expanded=all}}
'''Libertarianism''' is the group of [[political philosophy|political philosophies]] that advocates minimizing [[coercion]] and emphasizes [[Political freedom|freedom]], [[liberty]], and [[voluntary association]]. Libertarians generally advocate a [[society]] with significantly less [[government]] compared to most present day societies.

There is no general consensus on the precise definition of libertarianism. The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' defines libertarianism as the [[morality|moral]] view that agents initially fully own themselves and have certain moral powers to acquire property rights in external things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vallentyne|first=Peter|title=Libertarianism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Woodcock]], author of a history of libertarianism, defines it as the philosophy that fundamentally doubts authority and advocates transforming society by reform or revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George.

==Philosophy==
{{See also|Category:Libertarianism by form|Debates within libertarianism}}

Libertarian philosophies are generally divided on three principal questions: by ethical theory – whether actions are determined to be moral [[consequentialism|consequentially]] or in terms of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] (or [[deontological ethics|deontologically]]), the legitimacy of [[private property]], and the legitimacy of the state. Libertarian philosophy can therefore be broadly divided into eight groups based on these distinctions.

===Consequentialist / natural rights distinction===
{{Main|Consequentialist libertarianism|Natural-rights libertarianism}}
{{See also|Non-aggression principle}}
There are broadly two different types of libertarianism which are based on ethical doctrines: &quot;consequentialist libertarianism&quot; and
&quot;natural rights libertarianism&quot; (or &quot;deontological libertarianism&quot;). [[Deontological libertarianism|Deontological libertarians]] have the view that natural rights exist, and from there argue that initiation of force and fraud should never take place.&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothbard|first=Murray N.|title=For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto|year=1989|publisher=[[Collier Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-02-074690-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural rights libertarianism may include both [[right-libertarianism]] and [[left-libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bevir, Mark. Encyclopedia of Political Theory. SAGE, 2010. p. 811&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consequentialist libertarians]] argue that a [[free market]] and strong [[private property|private property rights]] bring about beneficial consequences, such as wealth creation or efficiency, rather than subscribing to a theory of rights or justice.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.virginialawreview.org/content/pdfs/92/1605.pdf|last=Wolff|first=Jonathan|title=Libertarianism, Utility, and Economic Competition|publisher=[[Virginia Law Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are hybrid forms of libertarianism that combine deontological and consequentialist reasoning.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

[[Social contract|Contractarian libertarianism]] holds that any legitimate authority of government derives not from the consent of the governed, but from contract or mutual agreement, though this can be seen as reducible to consequentialism or deontologism depending on what grounds contracts are justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[unknown]|editor=|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/#3 |chapter=Contractarianism|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2007-04-04|publisher=|location=Stanford, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anthony de Jasay|url=http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE9_1_5.pdf |format=PDF|title=Hayek: Some Missing Pieces|journal=The Review of Austrian Economics|volume=9|issue=1|year=1996|pages=107–18|issn=0889-3047|quote=&lt;!--Prior to 1998 RAE was not peer-reviewed, however de Jasay is a well published political economist and comes in under expert. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Foreword|editors=Hardy Bouillon, Hartmut Kliemt|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j0609gRca84C|title=Ordered Anarchy: Jasay and his surroundings|location=Aldershot, UK|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2007|page=xiii|isbn=0-7546-6113-X |author=Hardy Bouillon, Harmut Kliemt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] reject deontological and consequential approaches and use [[historical materialism]] to justify their political beliefs.&lt;ref name=Franks2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=B.Franks|year=2003|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3036/01/Direct_action_ethic.pdf|format=PDF |title=Direct action ethic|journal=Anarchist Studies |volume=11|issue=1|pages=13–41: 24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propertarian / non-propertarian distinction===
{{Main|Propertarianism}}

Propertarian libertarian philosophies define liberty as [[Non-aggression principle|non-aggression]], or the state in which no person or group aggresses against any other person or group, where aggression is defined as the violation of [[private property]].&lt;ref name=new/&gt; This philosophy implicitly recognizes private property as the sole source of legitimate authority. Propertarian libertarians hold that an order of private property is the only one that is both ethical and leads to the best possible outcomes.&lt;ref name=ethics&gt;{{cite book | last=Rothbard | first=Murray | year=1998 | title= The Ethics of Liberty| publisher= NYU Press| place=New York| isbn= 978-0814775066}}&lt;/ref&gt; They generally support the free-market, and are not opposed to any concentration of power (monopolies) provided it is brought about through non-coercive means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ludwig | first=von Mises| year=2007 | title= Human Action: A Treatise on Economics| publisher= Liberty Fund| place=Indianapolis| isbn= 978-0865976313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-propertarian libertarian philosophies hold that liberty is the absence of any form of authority and argue that a society based on freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing [[authoritarian]] institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mendes|first=Manuel da Silva|title=Socialismo libertario ou Anarchismo. Historia e doutrina|year=2011|publisher=Adegi Graphics LLC|language=Portuguese|asin=B004IKWRH2}}{{Page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicitly, it rejects any authority of private property and thus holds that it is not legitimate for someone to claim private ownership of any resources to the detriment of others.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Vallentyne |first=Peter |editor=Edward N.

===Statist / anarchistic distinction===
{{Main|Anarchism|State (polity)}}
{{See also|Anarcho-capitalism and minarchism}}

==Etymology==
The word stems from the French word ''libertaire''. The use of the word &quot;libertarian&quot; to describe a set of political positions can be tracked to the French cognate, ''libertaire'', which was coined in 1857 by French [[anarchist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] who used the term to distinguish his [[libertarian communist]] approach from the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] advocated by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;déjacquecoinslibertarianism&quot;&gt;

Libertarians of various schools were influenced by classical liberal ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Peregrin Otero, editor, ''Noam Chomsky: critical assessments,'' Volumes 2–3, Taylor &amp; Francis US, 1994,[http://books.google.com/books?id=MRdIAV5IVgoC&amp;pg=PA617&amp;dq=enlightenment+influence+socialists+libertarians&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zcJvTerFE8npgQfp46A7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p 617], ISBN 0-415-10694-X, 9780415106948.&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|''libertarian'']] in a metaphysical or philosophical sense was first used by late-Enlightenment [[Freethought|free-thinkers]] to refer to those who believed in [[free will]], as opposed to [[determinism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boaz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David Boaz|title=Libertarianism A Primer|publisher=The Free Press|year=1998|location=London, United Kingdom|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ALmCSGDYP5gC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=the+coming+libertarian+age+boaz#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=22–25|isbn=0-684-84768-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use was in 1789 by [[William Belsham]] in a discussion of free will and in opposition to &quot;necessitarian&quot; (or determinist) views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=|edition=3|url=http://www.oed.com|chapter=Libertarianism|title=Oxford English Dictionary|year=2010|format=database|at=libertarian A.1.}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Belsham|title=Essays|publisher=C.

The writings of [[John Locke]] became influential during this time. Locke's political theory was founded on [[social contract]] theory. Unlike [[Thomas Hobbes]], Locke believed that [[human nature]] is characterised by reason and tolerance. Like Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature allowed men to be selfish. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a [[State of nature#Locke's view on the state of nature|natural state]] all people were equal and independent, and everyone had a natural right to defend his “Life, health, Liberty, or Possessions&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;locke&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Locke | first = John | title = [[Second Treatise of Government]] (10th edition) | publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] | year = 1690 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm | accessdate =25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the basis for the phrase in the American Declaration of Independence: ''&quot;[[Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]&quot;''.

====Mutualism====
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organization emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0-8020-5458-7 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton University Press 1996 ISBN 0-691-04494-5, p.6&lt;br /&gt;''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''What Is Property?'' Princeton, MA: Benjamin R. Tucker, 1876. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early nineteenth century===

====Egoist anarchism====
{{Main|Egoist anarchism}}
An influential form of individualist anarchism, called &quot;egoism&quot; or [[egoist anarchism]], was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodway, David 2006, p. 99&quot;&gt;Goodway, David.

====Early individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism in the United States}}
{{See also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Freethought}}
[[File:Josiah Warren.jpg|190px|thumb|Josiah Warren]]
[[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first American [[anarchist]],&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, ''The Peaceful Revolutionist'', was the first anarchist periodical published,.&lt;ref name=&quot;bailie20&quot;&gt;William Bailie, [http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/warren/1stAmAnarch.pdf] ''Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist – A Sociological Study'', Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Co., 1906, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster &quot;It is apparent...that [[Proudhon]]ian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]]...[[William B. Greene]] presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;againstallauthority.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.againstallauthority.org/NativeAmericanAnarchism.html ''Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism'' by Eunice Minette Schuster]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner´s egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

An important concern for American individualist anarchism was [[free love]]. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–250.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|''The Word'']]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895–1897 as ''The Firebrand''; 1897–1904 as ''Free Society'') was a major anarchist newspaper in the [[United States]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-MSF-551&quot;&gt;&quot;''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.&quot; ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909'', p.551.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication staunchly advocated [[free love]] and [[women's rights]], and critiqued &quot;[[Comstockery]]&quot; – censorship of sexual information.Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;

In New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sochen, June. 1972. ''The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910–1920.'' New York: Quadrangle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''Der arme Teufel''. In Argentina anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] published the newspaper called ''{{lang|es|La Voz de la Mujer}}'' ({{lang-en|The Woman's Voice}}), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;molyneux&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Molyneux|first=Maxine|title=Women's movements in international perspective: Latin America and beyond|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2001|page=24|isbn=978-0-333-78677-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yg9HFrOG89kC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freethought]] also motivated activism in this movement. &quot;[[freethought]] was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf Wendy McElroy]. &quot;The culture of individualist anarchist in Late-nineteenth century America&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;

===Late nineteenth century===

====Georgism====
{{Main|Geolibertarianism|Georgism}}

In the late nineteenth century, the libertarian philosophy of [[Georgism]] became influential among many libertarians, particularly among American libertarians. The Georgist philosophy is based on the writings of the economist [[Henry George]] (1839–1897), and is usually associated with the idea of a single tax on the value of land. Georgists argue that a [[Land value tax|tax on land value]] is [[Economic efficiency|economically efficient]], [[Justice|fair]] and [[Equity (economics)|equitable]]; and that it can generate sufficient revenue so that other taxes, which are less fair and efficient (such as taxes on production, sales and income), can be reduced or eliminated.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCluskey and Franzsen&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=jkogP2U4k0AC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=disadvantages+of+land+value+taxation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Yn2x3XN3gf&amp;sig=tr_q00vD3k9bSE4S3YLY5Qznms8#PPA4,M1 Land Value Taxation: An Applied Analysis, William J.

====The First International====
{{Main|International Workingmen's Association}}
{{Libertarian socialism}}
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |location=New York, N.Y |isbn=0-393-09143-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (sometimes called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blin | first = Arnaud | title = The History of Terrorism | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-520-24709-4 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-595-24912-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |ref=harv | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), Russian revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allied themselves with the [[federalist]] socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bak | first = Jǹos | title = Liberty and Socialism | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-8476-7680-3 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8101-1740-1 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organized labor====
{{Main|Anarchism in Spain|Anarcho-syndicalism|International Workers' Association|Spanish Revolution}}
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

In response, unions across the [[United States]] prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-00600-8 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 |isbn=0-691-04711-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day.

In 1890, a second attempt was made, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight hour day was made. The event was also intended to memorialize the workers killed in the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 |isbn=0-7178-0624-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on [[May Day]] had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.&lt;ref name=foner&gt;{{Cite book| last = Foner | first = Philip Sheldon | title = May day: a short history of the international workers' holiday, 1886–1986 | publisher = International Publishers | location = New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-7178-0624-3 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the [[International Workers Association]], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular &quot;The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazil]], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]...it grew quickly
to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title=&quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, July 25, 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=2003-04-21 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, the slogan &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ‘[[Confiscation|expropriations]]’.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090312022528/http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm &quot;Anarchist-Communism&quot; by Alain Pengam]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it &quot;The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;[[individual reappropriation]]&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalism&quot;&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm &quot;The &quot;illegalists&quot; by Doug Imrie. From &quot;Anarchy: a Journal Of Desire Armed&quot;, Fall-Winter, 1994–95]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labor movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favored individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion– in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad. (in {{Cite news|author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July–August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}})&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emergence of libertarian communism====

Anarchist communist philosopher [[Joseph Déjacque]] was the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dejacque&quot;&gt;Joseph Déjacque, [http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle – Lettre à P.J.

Published in 27 issues from June 9, 1858 to February 4, 1861, ''Le Libertaire'' was the first anarcho-communist journal published in America. This was the first anarchist journal to use the term &quot;libertarian&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html [[Hakim Bey]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to anarchist historian [[Max Nettlau]], the first use of the term libertarian communism was in November 1880, when a French anarchist congress employed it to more clearly identify its doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French anarchist journalist [[Sébastien Faure]], later founder and editor of the four-volume ''Anarchist Encyclopedia,'' started the weekly paper ''Le Libertaire'' (''The Libertarian'') in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''anarchist communism'' was first formulated in the Italian section of the [[First International]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111–113&quot;&gt;Nunzio Pernicone, &quot;Italian Anarchism 1864–1892&quot;, pp. 111–113, AK Press 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]] took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organizationalist and [[Insurrectionary anarchism|insurrectionary anti-organizationalist]] sections.&lt;ref name=&quot; Alain Pengam&quot;&gt;[http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm &quot;Anarchist-Communism&quot; by Alain Pengam]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the [[First International]] by [[Carlo Cafiero]], Emilio Covelli, [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Andrea Costa]], and other ex-[[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] Republicans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nunzio Pernicone pp. 111–113&quot;/&gt; Anarchist communism is a theory of [[anarchism]] which advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[markets]], [[money]], [[capitalism]], and [[private property]] (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business.

During the early twentieth century, the terms ''libertarian communism'' and ''anarchist communism'' thus became synonymous within the international anarchist movement as a result of the close connection they had in Spain (see [[Anarchism in Spain]]) (with ''libertarian communism'' becoming the prevalent term).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdca.it/fdcaen/historical/vault/ancom-libcom.htm &quot;Anarchist Communism &amp; Libertarian Communism&quot;] by Gruppo Comunista Anarchico di Firenze. from &quot;L'informatore di parte&quot;, No.4, October 1979, quarterly journal of the Gruppo Comunista Anarchico di Firenze, on [[Libcom.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchist communism is also known as anarcho-communism, communist anarchism, or, sometimes, libertarian communism.&quot;[http://libcom.org/thought/anarchist-communism-an-introduction &quot;Anarchist communism – an introduction&quot;] by [[Libcom.org]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, a group of exiled Russian anarchists in France, the Delo Truda (Workers' Cause) group, published a pamphlet titled ''The Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists''. Says Truda, &quot;It arose not from some academic study but from their experiences in the 1917 Russian revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/org_plat.htm &quot;The Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists&quot; by Delo Truda]&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the best-known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon) are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This process of education and class organization, more than any single factor in Spain, produced the collectives. And to the degree that the CNT-FAI (for the two organizations became fatally coupled after July 1936) exercised the major influence in an area, the collectives proved to be generally more durable, communist and resistant to Stalinist counterrevolution than other republican-held areas of Spain.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Murray_Bookchin__To_Remember_Spain__The_Anarchist_and_Syndicalist_Revolution_of_1936.html [[Murray Bookchin].

===Early twentieth century===

====European individualist anarchism====
{{main|European individualist anarchism}}
{{See also|Anarcho-naturism|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex|Individualist anarchism in France}}

''Autonomie Individuelle'' was a French individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-presse-anarchiste.net/spip.php?rubrique258 Autonomie Individuelle (1887–1888)]&lt;/ref&gt; Later this tradition continued with such intellectuals as [[Albert Libertad]], André Lorulot, [[Emile Armand]], [[Victor Serge]], [[Zo d'Axa]] and [[Rirette Maitrejean]] developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, ''[[L’Anarchie]]'' in 1905. Outside this journal, [[Han Ryner]] wrote ''Petit Manuel individualiste'' (1903). Later appeared the journal [[L'EnDehors]] created by Zo d'Axa in 1891.
[[Anarchist naturism]] was promoted by [[Henri Zisly]], [[Emile Gravelle]],&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismo2&quot;&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/1121.htm The daily bleed]&lt;/ref&gt; and Georges Butaud. Anarcho-naturism advocated [[vegetarianism]], [[nudism]], [[hiking]] and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturismolibertario&quot;&gt;[http://www.soliobrera.org/pdefs/cuaderno4.pdf#search=%22Antonia%20Maym%C3%B3n%22 EL NATURISMO LIBERTARIO EN LA PENÍNSULA IBÉRICA (1890–1939) by Jose Maria Rosello]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aujourdhui&quot;&gt;&quot;Les anarchistes individualistes du début du siècle l'avaient bien compris, et intégraient le naturisme dans leurs préoccupations.

There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics.&quot; [http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 143]&lt;/ref&gt; This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] and others. &quot;In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply [[wikt:iconoclastic|iconoclastic]] and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist [[naturism]], the strong defence of [[birth control]] methods, the idea of &quot;[[Union of egoists|unions of egoists]]&quot; with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in symphathy within some, and a strong rejection within others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2044944 &quot;La insumisión voluntaria.

In Italy, individualist anarchism had a strong tendency towards [[illegalism]] and violent [[propaganda by the deed]] similar to French individualist anarchism but perhaps more extreme.&lt;ref name=&quot;italyindiv&quot;&gt;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/anarco-individualismolink &quot;anarco-individualismo&quot; in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical seeds of current [[Insurrectionary anarchism]] were already laid out at the end of 19th-century Italy in a combination of individualist anarchism criticism of permanent groups and organization with a socialist class struggle worldview.&lt;ref name=&quot;indinss&quot;&gt;&quot;Essa trova soprattutto in America del Nord un notevole seguito per opera del Galleani che esprime una sintesi fra l'istanza puramente individualista di stampo anglosassone e americano (ben espressa negli scritti di Tucker) e quella profondamente socialista del movimento anarchico di lingua italiana. Questa commistione di elementi individualisti e comunisti – che caratterizza bene la corrente antiorganizzatrice – rappresenta lo sforzo di quanti avvertirono in modo estremamente sensibile l'invadente burocratismo che pervadeva il movimento operaio e socialista.&quot;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/anarchismo_insurrezionale &quot;anarchismo insurrezionale&quot; in italian anarchopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 20th century it is important the intellectual work of individualist anarchist [[Renzo Novatore]]. Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal ''Iconoclasta!'' alongside the young [[stirner]]ist [[illegalism|illegalist]] [[Bruno Filippi]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wolfi&quot;&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bruno_Filippi__The_rebel_s_dark_laughter__the_writings_of_Bruno_Filippi.html ''The rebel's dark laughter: the writings of Bruno Filippi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spain]] received the influence of American individualist anarchism but most importantly it was related to the French currents. At the turn of the century individualism in Spain takes force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, [[Federico Urales]] and J. Elizalde who will translatre French and American individualists.&lt;ref name=&quot;frenchexperimentation&quot;/&gt; Important in this respect were also magazines such as ''La Idea Libre'', ''[[La revista blanca]]'', ''Etica'', ''[[Iniciales]]'', ''Al margen'' and ''Nosotros''. In [[Germany]] the Scottish-German [[John Henry McKay]] became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. [[Adolf Brand]] (1874–1945) was a [[Germany|German]] [[writer]], [[stirner]]ist [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and pioneering [[campaigner]] for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. Brand published a German [[homosexual]] periodical, ''[[Der Eigene]]'' in 1896. The Irish [[anarchism|anarchist]] writer of the [[Decadent movement]] [[Oscar Wilde]] influenced individualist anarchists such as [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We must kill the christian philosophy in the most radical sense of the word. How much mostly goes sneaking inside the democratic civilization (this most cynically ferocious form of christian depravity) and it goes more towards the categorical negation of human Individuality. “Democracy!

Tucker, in fact, published an American edition. From its early championing of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass to a series of short stories by Francis du Bosque in its last issues, ''Liberty'' was a vehicle of controversial, avant-garde literature.&quot;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;chapter=100896&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 &quot;Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order&quot; by Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anarchist uprisings of the 1910s====
{{Main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolutions of 1917–23}}

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]] which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months. Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition |title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8047-0293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organization in response to the structures of Bolshevism.

The [[Revolutions of 1917–23|revolutionary wave of 1917–23]] saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] the anarchists [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Erich Mühsam]] had important leadership positions within the revolutionary [[Council communism|councilist]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Munich Soviet (or “Council Republic”) of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though – like most revolutions – its stated goals were not exactly “temporary.” Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B. Traven), gave the Soviet a distinct anarchist flavor.&quot; [[Hakim Bey]].

Taylor]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conflicts with fascist regimes====
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution.&quot; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''. August 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

====Market liberals====
During the early 20th century [[modern liberalism in the United States]] began to take a more state-oriented approach to economic regulation. While conservatism in Europe continued to mean conserving hierarchical class structures through state control of society and the economy, some [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives in the United States]] began to refer to conserving traditions of liberty. This was especially true of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], which opposed the [[New Deal]] and U.S. military interventions in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Those who held to the earlier liberal views began to call themselves [[Market liberalism|market liberals]], [[Classical liberalism|classic liberals]] or libertarians to distinguish themselves. The [[Austrian School]] of economics, influenced by [[Frédéric Bastiat]] and later by [[Ludwig von Mises]], also had an impact on what is now [[right-libertarianism]].

===Late twentieth century===

====Counterculture of the 1960s====
Anarchism was influential in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and anarchists actively participated in the [[Protests of 1968|students and workers revolts of 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/dnckhs &quot;These groups had their roots in the anarchist resurgence of the nineteen sixties. Young militants finding their way to anarchism, often from the anti-bomb and anti-Vietnam war movements, linked up with an earlier generation of activists, largely outside the ossified structures of ‘official’ anarchism. Anarchist tactics embraced demonstrations, direct action such as industrial militancy and squatting, protest bombings like those of the First of May Group and Angry Brigade – and a spree of publishing activity.&quot;&quot;Islands of Anarchy: Simian, Cienfuegos, Refract and their support network&quot; by John Patten]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Farrell provides a detailed history of the Catholic Workers and their founders Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin. He explains that their pacifism, anarchism, and commitment to the downtrodden were one of the important models and inspirations for the 60s. As Farrell puts it, &quot;Catholic Workers identified the issues of the sixties before the Sixties began, and they offered models of protest long before the protest decade.&quot;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/268 &quot;The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism&quot; by James J. Farrell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;While not always formally recognized, much of the protest of the sixties was anarchist. Within the nascent women's movement, anarchist principles became so widespread that a political science professor denounced what she saw as &quot;The Tyranny of Structurelessness.&quot; Several groups have called themselves &quot;Amazon Anarchists.&quot; After the [[Stonewall Rebellion]], the New York [[Gay Liberation Front]] based their organization in part on a reading of [[Murray Bookchin]]'s anarchist writings.&quot; [http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Anarchism.pdf &quot;Anarchism&quot; by Charley Shively in ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'']. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Within the movements of the sixties there was much more receptivity to anarchism-in-fact than had existed in the movements of the thirties...But the movements of the sixties were driven by concerns that were more compatible with an expressive style of politics, with hostility to authority in general and state power in particular...By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement.&quot; [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

====In the United States====
In the 1950s many with &quot;Old Right&quot; or [[classical liberal]] beliefs in the United States began to describe themselves as &quot;libertarian.&quot; Arizona [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]]'s right-libertarian leaning challenge to authority also influenced the US libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American radical thought: the libertarian tradition|year=1970|publisher=Heath and Company|location=Lexington, Mass.|page=279|pages=452|editor=Henry J. Silverman}} {{LCC|JA84.U5 S55}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the [[Vietnam War]] divided [[right-libertarians]], [[Libertarian socialism|anarchist libertarians]], and conservatives. Right-libertarians and left-libertarians opposed to the war joined the [[draft dodger|draft resistance]] and [[peace movement]]s and began founding their own publications, like [[Murray Rothbard]]'s ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]''&lt;ref name=Lora-Longton&gt;Ronald Lora, William Henry Longton, (1999) ''Conservative press in 20th-century America,''

The party has run a [[President of the United States|presidential candidate]] every election year since 1972. Over the years, dozens of capitalism-supporting libertarian political parties have been formed worldwide. Educational organizations like the [[Center for Libertarian Studies]] and the [[Cato Institute]] were formed in the 1970s, and others have been created since then.

[[File:Ayn Rand1.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Ayn Rand]]
In the 1950s, philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] became one of the most influential thinkers among libertarians and conservatives. Rand created a philosophy called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and expressed her philosophical ideas in her novels ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', and in [[Book:Ayn Rand|other works]]. She further elaborated on her philosophical ideas in her periodicals ''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]]'', ''[[The Objectivist]]'', and ''[[The Ayn Rand Letter]]'', and in non-fiction books such as ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'' and ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rubin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Harriet |last=Rubin |title=Ayn Rand's Literature of Capitalism |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected being referred to as a ''libertarian'' and
was often [[Libertarianism and Objectivism|at odds]] with many non-objectivist libertarians.  Philosopher [[John Hospers]], a one-time member of Rand's inner circle, proposed a [[Non-agression principle|non-initiation of force]] principle to unite both groups; this statement later became a required &quot;pledge&quot; for candidates of the Libertarian Party, and Hospers himself became its first presidential candidate in 1972.

Right-libertarianism gained significant recognition in academia with the publication of [[Harvard University]] professor [[Robert Nozick]]'s ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' in 1974. The book advocated support for government on the grounds that it was an inevitable phenomenon. It was also written to critique ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' by [[John Rawls]]. ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'' won a [[National Book Award]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html National Book Award: 1975 – Philosophy and Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the [[free market]] perspectives argue that free-market capitalist libertarianism has been successfully propagated beyond the United States since the 1970s via think tanks and political parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;teles2008diffusion&quot;&gt;Steven Teles and Daniel A. Kenney, chapter &quot;Spreading the Word: The diffusion of American Conservativsm in Europe and beyond,&quot; (pp. 136–169) in [http://books.google.com/books?id=Mfy3k0BWBNAC Growing apart?: America and Europe in the twenty-first century] by ed. Sven Steinmo, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2008, ISBN , The chapter discusses how libertarian ideas have been more successful at spreading worldwide than social conservative ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century===

====Anarchism====
Around the beginning of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{Cite book| page=66 |last = Rupert | first = Mark | title = Globalization and International Political Economy | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7425-2943-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt;

Current international anarchist federations include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]]; the CNT-AIT in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html%20Website%20of%20the%20Confédération%20Nationale%20du%20Travail%20-%20Association%20Internationale%20des%20Travailleurs http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html Website of the Confédération Nationale du Travail – Association Internationale des Travailleurs]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|Union Sindicale Italiana]] in Italy; in the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

====In the United States====
In the United States, the [[Tea Party movement]], founded in 2009, has become a major outlet for libertarian ideas&lt;ref name = &quot;wsj1&quot;&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703882404575520252928390046.html ''Tea-Party Movement Gathers Strength'' By Peter Wallsten and Danny Yadron The Wall Street Journal September 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/poll/2011/09/26/is-half-the-tea-part-libertart ''Is Half the Tea Party Libertarian?'' Emily Ekins September 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; especially rigorous adherence to the U.S. Constitution, lower taxes and an opposition to a growing role for the federal government in health care. Electorally, it was considered a key force in Republicans reclaiming control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-12030-503544.html &quot;Katie Couric interviews Tea Party Leaders&quot;, CBS News, January 25, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls (circa 2006) find that the views and voting habits of between 10 and 20 percent (and increasing) of voting age Americans may be classified as &quot;fiscally conservative and socially liberal, or libertarian.&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;BoazKirby06&quot;&gt;''The Libertarian Vote'' by David Boaz and David Kirby, Cato Institute, October 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;anes2004&quot;&gt;''The ANES Guide to Public Opinion and Electoral Behavior, 1948–2004'' American National Election Studies&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on pollsters and researchers defining libertarian views as
* fiscally conservative and socially liberal (based on the common US meanings of the terms) and
* against government intervention in economic affairs, and for expansion of personal freedoms.&lt;ref name = &quot;BoazKirby06&quot;/&gt;

Through 20 polls on this topic spanning 13 years, Gallup found that voters who are libertarian on the political spectrum ranged from 17%- 23% of the US electorate.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gallup2006&quot;&gt;Gallup Poll news release, September 7–10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of these vote for Republican and Democratic (not Libertarian) party candidates. This posits that the common single-axis paradigm of dividing people's political leanings into &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;confused&quot; is not valid.&lt;ref name = &quot;MaddoxStuart84&quot;&gt;''Beyond Liberal and Conservative'' Willaim S. Maddox &amp; Stuart A. Lilie, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarians make up a larger portion of the US electorate than the much-discussed &quot;soccer moms&quot; and &quot;NASCAR dads&quot;, yet this is not widely recognized. One reason for this is that most pollsters, political analysts, and political pundits believe in the paradigm of the single liberal-conservative axis.&lt;ref name = &quot;BoazKirby06&quot;/&gt;

==Libertarian organizations==
{{Category see also|Libertarian parties|Libertarian publications|Libertarian think tanks}}

Since the 1950s, many American libertarian organizations have adopted a free market, capitalist stance; these include the [[Center for Libertarian Studies]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]] (FEE), the [[International Society for Individual Liberty]] (ISIL) and the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]. Libertarians are prominent in the [[Tea Party movement]]. The activist [[Free State Project]], formed in 2001, works to bring 20,000 libertarians to New Hampshire to influence state policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html?pagewanted=all |first=Pam |last=Belluck |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=October 27, 2003 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This source uses the term libertarianism and describes it as free market, but it does not make any explicit claims about the popularity of the use of the word, so it is inappropriate as source for any claims on popularity. The encyclopedias of philosophy are probably a better source, anyway.
