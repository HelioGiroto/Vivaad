The '''September 11 attacks''' (also referred to as '''September&amp;nbsp;11''', '''September&amp;nbsp;11th''', or '''9/11''')&lt;ref group=nb&gt;9/11 is pronounced &quot;nine eleven&quot;. The slash is not part of the pronunciation. The name is frequently used in British English as well as American English even though the dating conventions differ: &quot;9/11&quot; in British English would normally refer to November 9.&lt;/ref&gt; were a series of four coordinated [[suicide attack]]s upon the United States in [[New York City]] and the [[Washington, D.C.]] areas on September 11, 2001. On that Tuesday morning, 19 terrorists from the [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant group [[al-Qaeda]] [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] four passenger jets. The hijackers intentionally flew two of those planes, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]], into the North and South towers of the [[World Trade Center]] complex in New York City; both towers collapsed within two hours. The hijackers also intentionally crashed [[American Airlines Flight 77]] into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], and intended to pilot the fourth hijacked jet, [[United Airlines Flight 93]], into the [[United States Capitol Building]]&lt;ref&gt;Inside 9/11 : Zero Hour, National Geographic Channel documentary, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington, D.C.; however, the plane crashed into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], after its passengers attempted to take control of the jet from the hijackers. [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks]], including all 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes.

Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda, and in 2004, the group's leader, [[Osama bin Laden]], who had initially denied involvement, claimed [[Responsibility for the September 11 attacks|responsibility for the attacks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc-2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Bin Laden claims responsibility for 9/11|publisher = CBC News|date=October 29, 2004|url = http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2004/10/29/binladen_message041029.html|accessdate=2011-09-01 |quote=Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden appeared in a new message aired on an Arabic TV station Friday night, for the first time claiming direct responsibility for the 2001 attacks against the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited [[Israel–United States relations|U.S. support of Israel]], the presence of [[Operation Southern Watch|U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia]], and [[Iraq sanctions|sanctions against Iraq]] as motives for the attacks. The United States responded to the attacks by launching the [[War on Terror]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invading Afghanistan]] to depose the [[Taliban]], which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers. In May 2011, after years at large, [[Death of Osama bin Laden|bin Laden was located and killed]].

The destruction of the Twin Towers caused serious damage to the economy of [[Lower Manhattan]] and had a significant impact on global markets. Cleanup of the [[World Trade Center site]] was completed in May 2002, and the Pentagon was repaired within a year. Numerous memorials were constructed, including the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in New York, the [[Pentagon Memorial]], and the [[Flight 93 National Memorial]] in Pennsylvania. After a lengthy delay, the {{convert|1776|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[One World Trade Center]] is expected to be completed at [[Ground Zero]] in New York City by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowermanhattan.info/construction/project_updates/freedom_tower_26204.aspx |title=1 World Trade Center (Freedom Tower) |publisher=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flight paths of hijacked planes-September 11 attacks.jpg|thumb|right|The flight paths of the four hijacked planes used in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]]

Early on the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]] took control of four commercial airliners (two [[Boeing 757]] and two [[Boeing 767]]) en route to California (three headed to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] in Los Angeles, and one to San Francisco) after takeoffs from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]; [[Newark, New Jersey]]; and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot; /&gt; Large planes with long flights were intentionally selected for hijacking because they would be heavily fueled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chap7&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--weren't early morning flights also chosen because they would have fewer passengers to overcome?--&gt;

The four flights involved were:
*[[American Airlines Flight 11]]: Left Boston's [[Logan Airport]] at 7:59&amp;nbsp;a.m. enroute to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46&amp;nbsp;a.m.
*[[United Airlines Flight 175]]: Left Logan Airport at 8:14&amp;nbsp;a.m. enroute to Los Angeles with a crew of nine and 51 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center at 9:03&amp;nbsp;a.m.
*[[American Airlines Flight 77]]: Left Washington [[Dulles International Airport]] in [[Virginia]] at 8:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. enroute to Los Angeles with a crew of six and 53 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the Pentagon at 9:37&amp;nbsp;a.m.
*[[United Airlines Flight 93]]: Left [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark International Airport]] at 8:42&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;!--wasn't it late taking off, which allowed the passengers to hear of the others?--&gt; enroute to San Francisco, with a crew of seven and 33 passengers, not including four hijackers. After the passengers revolted, the hijackers crashed the plane into the ground near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]] at 10:03&amp;nbsp;a.m.
Media coverage was intense during the attacks and aftermath, beginning moments after the first crash into the World Trade Center.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, news coverage by CNN: {{cite news|journal=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2011/09/07/natpkg-911-aircheck-timeline.cnn|title=Breaking News Videos from CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===
At 8:46&amp;nbsp;a.m., five hijackers crashed [[American Airlines Flight 11]] into the [[World Trade Center]]'s North Tower (1&amp;nbsp;WTC), and at 9:03&amp;nbsp;a.m., another five hijackers crashed [[United Airlines Flight 175]] into the South Tower (2&amp;nbsp;WTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB196/doc01.pdf |title=Flight Path Study – American Airlines Flight 11 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=February 19, 2002 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB196/doc03.pdf |title=Flight Path Study – United Airlines Flight 175 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=February 19, 2002 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth flight, [[United Airlines Flight 93]], under the control of four hijackers, crashed near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], southeast of Pittsburgh, at 10:03&amp;nbsp;a.m. after the passengers fought the hijackers. Flight 93's target is believed to have been either the [[U.S. Capitol|Capitol]] or the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chap7&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=The Attack Looms |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch7.htm |year=2004 |title=9/11 Commission Report |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight 93's cockpit voice recorder revealed crew and passengers attempted to seize control of the plane from the hijackers after learning through phone calls that similarly hijacked planes had been crashed into buildings that morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP93&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=David |last=Snyder |title=Families Hear Flight&amp;nbsp;93's Final Moments |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A12262-2002Apr18 |work=The Washington Post |date=April 19, 2002 |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once it became evident to the hijackers that the passengers might regain control of the plane, the hijackers rolled the plane and intentionally crashed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox93Xscript&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Text of Flight 93 Recording |publisher=Fox News |date=April 12, 2006 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,191520,00.html |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Flight93Story'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/flni/historyculture/index.htm | title = The Flight 93 Story | accessdate = 2011-09-21 | publisher = National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 9:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the FAA grounded all aircraft within the continental U.S., and aircraft already in flight were told to land immediately.

In a September 2002 interview, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] and [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], who are believed to have organized the attacks, said Flight 93's intended target was the United States Capitol, not the White House.&lt;ref&gt;Fouda and Fielding (2004), pp. 158–9.&lt;/ref&gt; During the planning stage of the attacks, [[Mohamed Atta]], the hijacker and pilot of Flight 11, thought the White House might be too tough a target and sought an assessment from [[Hani Hanjour]], who would later hijack and pilot Flight 77.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Eleventh Day pp 323&quot;&gt;{Summers and Swan (2011), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammed also said al-Qaeda initially planned to target nuclear installations rather than the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but decided against it, fearing things could &quot;get out of control.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQaedaplotted2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title= Al-Qaeda 'plotted nuclear attacks'|publisher=BBC News|date=September 8, 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2244146.stm |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final decisions on targeting, according to Mohammed, were left in the hands of the pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Eleventh Day pp 323&quot; /&gt;

More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;NISTcasualties&quot;&gt;Sunder (2005), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the North Tower 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed in the building's eventual collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. A further 107 people below the point of impact did not survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;NISTcasualties&quot;/&gt;

On September 26, 2005, the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Spanish high court]] sentenced [[Abu Dahdah]] to 27 years in prison for conspiracy on the 9/11 attacks and being a member of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda.

Bin Laden interpreted the Prophet [[Muhammad]] as having banned the &quot;permanent presence of infidels in Arabia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;holywar-p3&quot;&gt;Bergen (2001), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden|bin Laden issued]] a [[fatwā]] calling for American troops to leave Saudi Arabia. In 1998, al-Qaeda wrote, &quot;for over seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian Peninsula, plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring Muslim peoples.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 Al Qaeda fatwā&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm |title=1998 Al Qaeda fatwā |publisher=Fas.org |date=February 23, 1998|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 1999, interview, bin Laden said he felt that Americans were &quot;too near to [[Mecca]]&quot;, and considered this a provocation to the entire Muslim world.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-20010926&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/sep/26/afghanistan.terrorism3 |title=Face to face with Osama |work=The Guardian |date=September 26, 2001|location=London|accessdate=2011-09-03| first=Rahimullah | last=Yusufzai}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analysis of suicide terrorism suggested that without U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda likely would not have been able to get people to commit suicide in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pape |first= Robert A. |authorlink= Robert Pape |title= [[Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism]] |year= 2005 |publisher= Random House |location= New York |isbn= 0-8129-7338-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his November 2002 &quot;Letter to America&quot;, bin Laden cited the United States' support of Israel as a motivation: &quot;The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals. And of course there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel. The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased. Each and every person whose hands have become polluted in the contribution towards this crime must pay its price, and pay for it heavily.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BLLTA&quot;/&gt; In 2004 and 2010, bin Laden again connected the September 11 attacks with U.S. support of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Bin Laden's 2004 taped broadcast on the attacks, in which he explains the motives for the attacks and says &quot;The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced. &quot; (Quoted from Al Jazeera [http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html online here])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bin Laden's taped broadcast from January 2010, where he said &quot;Our attacks against you [the United States] will continue as long as U.S. support for Israel continues.... The message sent to you with the attempt by the hero Nigerian [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] is a confirmation of our previous message conveyed by the heroes of Sept. 11&quot;. (Quoted from &quot;Bin Laden: Attacks on U.S. to go on as long as it supports Israel&quot;, in Haaretz.com, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/bin-laden-attacks-on-u-s-to-go-on-as-long-as-it-supports-israel-1.265770 online here])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the 1998 [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden|Al-Qaeda fatwā]]: &quot;[T]he aim [of the United States] is also to serve the Jews' petty state and divert attention from its occupation of Jerusalem and murder of Muslims there.

In addition to those cited by bin Laden and al-Qaeda, analysts have suggested other motives, including western support of non-Islamist authoritarian regimes in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and northern Africa, and western troops in some of these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JC2NzdH0K1cC&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=dictatorship%209%2F11%20saudi%20arabia&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=dictatorship%209%2F11%20saudi%20arabia&amp;f=false |title=Before and After 9/11: A Philosophical Examination of Globalization, Terror |date= April 21, 2011|accessdate=2011-09-11|isbn=978-1-4411-1892-9|author1=Rockmore|first1=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors suggest that humiliation resulting from the Islamic world falling behind the Western world – this discrepancy made especially visible by recent globalization&lt;ref&gt;In [[Bernard Lewis]]'s 2004 book ''[[The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror]]'', he argues animosity toward the west is best understood with the decline of the once powerful [[Ottoman empire]], compounded by the import of western ideas— [[Arab socialism]], [[Liberal movements within Islam|Arab liberalism]] and [[Secularism in the Middle East|Arab secularism]].

Bernard Lewis, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In an essay titled ''The spirit of terrorism'', [[Jean Baudrillard]] described 9/11 as the first global event that &quot;questions the very process of globalization&quot;. {{cite web|url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/baudriterror.htm|title=The spirit of terrorism|last= Baudrillard|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and a desire to provoke the U.S. into a broader war against the Islamic world, in the hope of motivating more allies to support al-Qaeda. Others have argued that 9/11 was a strategic way to provoke America into a war that incites a [[pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] revolution.&lt;ref&gt;In an essay entitled &quot;Somebody Else's Civil War&quot;, [[Michael Scott Doran]] argues the attacks are best understood as part of a religious conflict within the Muslim world and that Bin Laden's followers: &quot;consider themselves an island of true believers surrounded by a sea of iniquity&quot;. Hoping that U.S. retaliation would unite the faithful against the West, bin Laden sought to spark revolutions in Arab nations and elsewhere. Doran argues the [[Osama bin Laden videos]] were attempting to provoke a visceral reaction in the Middle East and ensure that Muslim citizens would react as violently as possible to an increase in U.S. involvement in their region. ({{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57618/michael-scott-doran/somebody-elses-civil-war|title=Somebody Else's Civil War|publisher=Foreign Affairs|accessdate=2009-12-05}} Reprinted in {{Cite book|last1=Hoge|first1=James F.|last2=Rose|first2=Gideon|title=Understanding the War on Terror |publisher=Norton |year=2005 |location=New York|isbn=978-0-87609-347-4|pages=72–75}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Osama bin Laden I Know'', [[Peter Bergen]] argues the attacks were part of a plan to cause the United States to increase its military and cultural presence in the Middle East, thereby forcing Muslims to confront the idea of a non-Muslim government and establish conservative Islamic governments in the region.(Bergen (2006), p. 229.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning of the attacks===

The idea for the attacks came from [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], who first presented it to [[Osama bin Laden]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3128802.stm |title=Suspect 'reveals 9/11 planning' |publisher=BBC News |date=September 22, 2003 |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were in a period of transition, having just relocated back to Afghanistan from [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch5&quot;&gt;9/11 Commission Report, Chapter 5, pp ??&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 African Embassy bombings]] and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch5&quot;/&gt;

In late 1998 or early 1999, bin Laden gave approval for Mohammed to go forward with organizing the plot. A series of meetings occurred in early 1999, involving Mohammed, bin Laden, and his deputy [[Mohammed Atef]].&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch5&quot;/&gt; Atef provided operational support for the plot, including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch5&quot;/&gt; Bin Laden overruled Mohammed, rejecting some potential targets such as the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]] in Los Angeles because, &quot;there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DF1031F933A15750C0A9659C8B63|title=Bin Laden Chose 9/11 Targets, Al Qaeda Leader Says|work=New York Times|last=Lichtblau|first=Eric|date=March 20, 2003|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden provided leadership and financial support for the plot, and was involved in selecting participants.&lt;ref&gt;{Bergen (2006), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden initially selected [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] and [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], both experienced jihadists who had fought in [[Bosnian war|Bosnia]]. Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in the United States in mid-January 2000. In spring 2000, Hazmi and Mihdhar took flying lessons in San Diego, California, but both spoke little English, did poorly with flying lessons, and eventually served as secondary – or &quot;muscle&quot; – hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006), pp. 309–315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDermott (2005), pp. 191–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1999, a group of men from Hamburg, Germany arrived in Afghanistan, including Mohamed Atta, [[Marwan al-Shehhi]], [[Ziad Jarrah]], and Ramzi bin al-Shibh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Richard |last=Bernstein |title=On Path to the U.S. Skies, Plot Leader Met bin Laden |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/national/10PLOT.html?ex=1221624000&amp;en=30bc6f683535b59f&amp;ei=5070 |work=New York Times |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak English, and had experience living in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006), pp. 304–7.&lt;/ref&gt; New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al-Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot's license.&lt;ref&gt;Wright (2006), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanjour arrived in San Diego on December 8, 2000, joining Hazmi.&lt;ref name='9/11 commission staff statement No. 16'&gt; {{cite news | title = 9/11 commission staff statement No. 16 | date = June 16, 2004 | url =http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_16.pdf  | work = 9/11 Commission | accessdate =2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They soon left for Arizona, where Hanjour took refresher training. Marwan al-Shehhi arrived at the end of May 2000, while Atta arrived on June 3, 2000, and Jarrah arrived on June 27, 2000. Bin al-Shibh applied several times for a visa to the United States, but as a [[Yemen]]i, he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa and remain as an illegal immigrant. Bin al-Shibh stayed in Hamburg, providing coordination between Atta and Mohammed. The three [[Hamburg cell]] members all took pilot training in South Florida.

In spring 2001, the secondary hijackers began arriving in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |format=PDF|title=Staff Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel |publisher=9/11 Commission |year=2004 |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2001, Atta met with bin al-Shibh in Spain, where they coordinated details of the plot, including final target selection. Bin al-Shibh also passed along bin Laden's wish for the attacks to be carried out as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;irujo&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2004/03/21/espana/1079823611_850215.html |title=Atta recibió en Tarragona joyas para que los miembros del 'comando' del 11-S se hiciesen pasar por ricos saudíes |publisher=El Pais |date=March 21, 2004 |last=Irujo|first=Jose Maria |accessdate=2012-04-10 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NATO]] council declared the attacks on the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter. This marked the first invocation of Article 5, which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statement by the North Atlantic Council |publisher = NATO |date=September 15, 2001 |url = http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2001/p01-124e.htm |accessdate=2011-09-04 |quote=&quot;Article 5: The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. / Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Prime Minister John Howard invoked Article IV of the [[ANZUS]] treaty. The Bush administration announced a [[War on Terror]], with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states perceived as harboring terrorists, and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing.

On September 14, 2001 a [[joint resolution]] was passed by the United States Congress authorizing U.S. Presidents to fight terrorists and the nations that harbor them called the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]].

On October 7, 2001, the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]] began when U.S. and British forces initiated aerial bombing campaigns targeting [[Taliban]] and al-Qaeda camps, then later invaded Afghanistan with ground troops of the [[Special Forces]]. The overthrow of the Taliban rule of Afghanistan by a U.S.-led coalition was the second-biggest operation of the U.S. Global War on Terrorism outside of the United States, and the largest directly connected to terrorism. Conflict in Afghanistan between the [[Taliban insurgency]] and the [[International Security Assistance Force]] is ongoing. The [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], among other nations with their own internal conflicts with [[Islamic terrorism]], also increased their military readiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuppuswamy|first=C.S. |title = Terrorism in Indonesia : Role of the Religious Organisation |publisher = South Asia Analysis Group |date=November 2, 2005 |url = http://www.saag.org/%5Cpapers16%5Cpaper1596.html |accessdate=2011-09-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070611032357/http://www.saag.org/papers16/paper1596.html |archivedate=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Banlaoi |first=Rommel |contribution=Radical Muslim Terrorism in the Philippines |year=2006 |title=Handbook on Terrorism and Insurgency in Southeast Asia |editor-last=Tan |editor-first=Andrew |place=London |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of people attempted to flee Afghanistan following the attacks, fearing a response by the United States.

===Government policies toward terrorism===
As a result of the attacks, many governments across the world passed [[Anti-terrorism legislation|legislation to combat terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Terrorism in the Asia-Pacific: Threat and Response | journal = [[The Journal of Asian Studies]] | year = 2004 | first = Andrew | last = Scobell | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 1078–9 | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=788144 | accessdate = 2011-09-04| doi = 10.1017/S0021911804002463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted.

In the United States, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] was created to coordinate domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The [[USA Patriot Act]] gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned [[sky marshals]] to flights. Further, the [[Aviation and Transportation Security Act]] made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created a federal security force to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy.&lt;ref name='Modern World History'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beck | first1 = Roger | title = Modern World History | chapter = 20 | publisher = [[Holt McDougal]] | year = 2004 | pages = 657–8 | isbn = 978-0-618-69012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of 9/11 extends beyond geopolitics into society and culture in general. Immediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of flags.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carducci2009b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernardo J.

[[File:Mohamed Atta.jpg|thumb|alt= A head shot of a man in his thirties looking expressionless toward the camera|[[Mohamed Atta]], an Egyptian national, was the ringleader of the hijackers.]]
Immediately after the attacks, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] started [[PENTTBOM]], the largest criminal inquiry in the history of the United States. At its height, more than half of the FBI's agents worked on the investigation and followed a half-million leads.&lt;ref name='Pentbomb'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/9-11-investigation/9-11-investigation | title = 9/11 Investigation (PENTTBOM) | accessdate = 2012-04-11 | publisher = [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI concluded that there was &quot;clear and irrefutable&quot; evidence linking al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Dale L.

Due to a mix-up, the luggage failed to make it aboard American Airlines Flight 11 as planned. The luggage contained the hijackers' names, assignments and al-Qaeda connections. &quot;It had all these Arab-language (sic) papers that amounted to the Rosetta stone of the investigation&quot;, said one FBI agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unraveling 9-11 Was in the Bags&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Unraveling 9–11 Was in the Bags | date = February 6, 2009 | url = http://www.securityinfowatch.com/news/10555883/unraveling-9-11-was-in-the-bags |work=Newsday | accessdate = 2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomaskeansr.jpg|thumb|140px|9/11 Commission Chairman [[Thomas Kean]]]]
The ''National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States'' (9/11 Commission), chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, was formed in late 2002 to prepare a thorough account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/about/bio_kean.htm|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=govinfo.library.unt.edu|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 2004, the 9/11 Commission issued the [[9/11 Commission Report]]. The report detailed the events of 9/11, found the attacks were carried out by members of al-Qaeda, and examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks. Formed from an independent bipartisan group of mostly former Senators, Representatives, and Governors, the commissioners explained, &quot;We believe the 9/11 attacks revealed four kinds of failures: in imagination, policy, capabilities, and management&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foresight-and Hindsight|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch11.htm|work=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission made numerous recommendations on how to prevent future attacks, and in 2011 was dismayed that several of its recommendations had yet to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Brian|title=Post-9/11 assessment sees major security gaps|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/30/nation/la-na-911-report-card-20110831|accessdate=2011-09-04|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse of the World Trade Center===
{{See also|Collapse of the World Trade Center}}

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology investigated the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7&amp;nbsp;WTC. The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;NISTInvest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NIST's World Trade Center Investigation |url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/nist_investigation_911.cfm|work=National Institute of Standards and Technology |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation into the collapse of 1&amp;nbsp;WTC and 2&amp;nbsp;WTC was concluded in October 2005 but that of 7&amp;nbsp;WTC wasn't finalized until August 2008.&lt;ref name=seven&gt;{{cite web|title=NIST WTC 7 Investigation Finds Building Fires Caused Collapse|url=http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/wtc-082108.cfm|publisher=The National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIST found that the fireproofing on the Twin Towers' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers likely would have remained standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;NISTCollapse&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=National Construction Safety Team |url=http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=909017 |title=Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Towers |work=National Institute of Standards and Technology|publisher=United States Department of Commerce |chapter=Executive Summary |month=September|year=2005| accessdate=2011-04-10|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published by researchers of [[Purdue University]] confirmed that, if the thermal insulation on the core columns were scoured off and column temperatures were elevated to approximately {{convert|700|C|F}}, the fire would have been sufficient to initiate collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Irfanoglu|first1=Ayhan|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Christoph M.|title=An Engineering Perspective of the Collapse of WTC-I|journal=Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities|volume=22|year=2008|issue=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Purdue creates scientifically based animation of 9/11 attack|last = Tally|first = Steve|publisher = Purdue News Service|url = http://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2007a/070612HoffmannWTC.html |date=June 12, 2007|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:WTC-Wreckage-exterior shell of south tower.jpg|thumb|right|The exterior support columns from the lower level of the south tower remained standing after the building collapsed]]
The director of the original investigation stated that, &quot;the towers really did amazingly well. The terrorist aircraft didn’t bring the buildings down; it was the fire which followed. It was proven that you could take out two thirds of the columns in a tower and the building would still stand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TerrorProof&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Building a Terror-Proof Skyscraper: Experts Debate Feasibility, Options |first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/Building-a-Terror-Proof-Skyscraper-Experts-Debate-Feasibility-Options/2598/ |accessdate=2012-04-11 |date=September 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward. With the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. Additionally, the report found the towers' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate [[Fire escape|emergency escape]] for people above the impact zones.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Translating WTC Recommendations Into Model Building Codes|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NIBS_MMC/CodeChangeProposals.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110310004023/http://wtc.nist.gov/NIBS_MMC/CodeChangeProposals.htm|archivedate=March 10, 2011|accessdate=2011-09-04|date=October 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7&amp;nbsp;WTC caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently &quot;caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fire-induced progressive collapse that brought the building down&quot;.&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;

===Internal review of the CIA===
The Inspector General of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] conducted an internal review of the CIA's pre-9/11 performance and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism. He criticized their failure to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, as they entered the United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2005/aug/01/00027/|title=Deep Background |publisher=American Conservative| date=April 1, 2005 |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, senators from both major U.S. political parties drafted legislation to make the review public.

One of the first memorials was the [[Tribute in Light]], an installation of 88 searchlights at the footprints of the World Trade Center towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Tribute in light to New York victims|publisher=BBC News| date=March 6, 2002| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1857699.stm| accessdate=2012-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, the [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition]] was held to design an appropriate memorial on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtcsitememorial.org/about.html |title=About the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition |accessdate=2011-09-04 |publisher=World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning design, ''[[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|Reflecting Absence]]'', was selected in August 2006, and consists of a pair of reflecting pools in the footprints of the towers, surrounded by a list of the victims' names in an underground memorial space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| coauthors = [[Associated Press]]| title = WTC Memorial Construction Begins| publisher = [[CBS News]]| date=March 6, 2006| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/13/national/main1393070.shtml| accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for a museum on the site have been put on hold, following the abandonment of the [[International Freedom Center]] in reaction to complaints from the families of many victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Dunlap| first=David| title=Governor Bars Freedom Center at Ground Zero| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/nyregion/29freedom.html|work=The New York Times| date=September 25, 2005| accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
