Mohammed bin Laden divorced Hamida soon after Osama bin Laden was born. Mohammed recommended Hamida to Mohammed al-Attas, an associate. Al-Attas married Hamida in the late 1950s or early 1960s, and they are still together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mysterious Death of Osama Bin Laden |url=http://votebits.com/tag/osama-bin-laden-histery |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children, and bin Laden lived in the new household with three half-brothers and one half-sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker.com&quot; /&gt; The bin Laden family made $5 billion in the construction industry, of which Osama later inherited around $25–30 million.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', &quot;[http://www.economist.com/node/18648254 Osama bin Laden]&quot;, May 5, 2011, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
There is no universally accepted standard for [[transliteration|transliterating]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words and [[Arabic name]]s into English;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitaker|first=Brian|title=Arabic words and the Roman alphabet|url=http://www.al-bab.com/arab/language/roman1.htm|work=Al-Bab.com|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot;. The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S. governmental agencies, have used either &quot;Usama bin Laden&quot; or &quot;Usama bin Ladin&quot;. Less common renderings include &quot;Ussamah bin Ladin&quot; and, in the French-language media, &quot;Oussama ben Laden&quot;. Other spellings include &quot;Binladen&quot; or, as used by his family in the West, &quot;Binladin&quot;. The decapitalization of ''bin'' is based on the convention of leaving short prepositions and articles uncapitalized in surnames; however, ''[[Arabic Name#Nasab نسب|bin]]'' means &quot;son of&quot; and is not, strictly speaking, a preposition or article. The spellings with ''o'' and ''e'' come from a [[Persian language|Persian]]-influenced pronunciation also used in Afghanistan, where bin Laden spent many years.

Osama bin Laden's full name, Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, means &quot;Osama, son of Mohammed, son of Awad, son of Laden&quot;. &quot;Mohammed&quot; refers to bin Laden's father Mohammed bin Laden; &quot;Awad&quot; refers to his grandfather, Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a Kindite [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] tribesman; &quot;Laden&quot; refers not to bin Laden's great-grandfather, who was named Aboud, but to a more distant ancestor.

The Arabic [[natural language|linguistic]] convention would be to refer to him as &quot;Osama&quot; or &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot;, not &quot;bin Laden&quot; alone, as &quot;bin Laden&quot; is a [[patronymic]], not a surname in the Western manner. According to bin Laden's son [[Omar bin Laden]], the family's hereditary surname is &quot;al-Qahtani&quot; ({{lang-ar|القحطاني}}, ''āl-Qaḥṭānī''), but bin Laden's father [[Mohammed bin Laden]] never officially registered the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Growing up Bin Laden: Osama's Wife and Son Take Us Inside Their Secret World |last=bin Laden |first=Najwa |coauthors= [[Omar bin Laden|bin Laden, Omar]]; [[Jean Sasson|Sasson, Jean]] |authorlink=Najwa Ghanem |year=2009 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-56016-4 |page=301 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RcBwm5b8VbAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and ideology==
{{Main|Beliefs and ideology of Osama bin Laden}}

According to former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst [[Michael Scheuer]], who led the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader was motivated by a belief that [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East,&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheuer 2004 9&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheuer| first = Michael| title = Imperial Hubris| publisher = Brassey's, Inc.| year = 2004| location = Dulles, Virginia| page = 9| url = | id = | isbn = 978-0-9655139-4-4|quote= The focused and lethal threat posed to U.S. national security arises not from Muslims being offended by what America is, but rather from their plausible perception that the things they most love and value—God, Islam, their brethren, and Muslim lands—are being attacked by America.}}&lt;/ref&gt; condensed in the phrase &quot;They hate us for what we do, not who we are.&quot;

Bin Laden also said only the restoration of [[Sharia]] law would &quot;set things right&quot; in the Muslim world, and that alternatives such as &quot;[[pan-Arabism]], socialism, communism, democracy&quot; must be opposed.&lt;ref&gt;''Messages'', 2005, p. 218. &quot;Resist the New Rome&quot;, audiotape delivered to al-Jazeera and broadcast by it on January 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This belief, in conjunction with violent jihad, has sometimes been called [[Qutbism]] after being promoted by [[Sayyid Qutb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm |title=Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism |publisher=[[Parameters (journal)|Parameters]] |author=Dale C.

He also called on Americans to &quot;reject the immoral acts of [[:wikt:fornication|fornication]], homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling, and [[usury]]&quot;, in an October 2002 letter.&lt;ref&gt;October 6, 2002. Appeared in Al-Qala'a website and then ''The Observer'' November 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden opposed music on religious grounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attitude towards technology was mixed. He was interested in &quot;earth-moving machinery and [[genetic engineering]] of plants&quot; on the one hand, but rejected &quot;chilled water&quot; on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden's overall strategy against much larger enemies such as the [[Soviet Union]] and United States was to lure them into a long [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] in Muslim countries, attracting large numbers of jihadists who would never surrender. He believed this would lead to economic collapse of the enemy nation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/11/01/binladen.tape/index.html Bin Laden: Goal is to bankrupt U.S.]&quot;. CNN. November 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda manuals clearly outline this strategy.

==Militant activity==
{{Main|Militant activity of Osama bin Laden}}
{{See also|CIA-Osama bin Laden controversy}}

===Mujahideen in Afghanistan===
After leaving college in 1979, bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]] and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the [[mujahideen]] resistance in the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/155236.stm |title=Who is Osama Bin Laden?|publisher=BBC News |date=September 18, 2001 |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told a journalist: &quot;I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Robert Fisk, March 22, 1997, 'The Great War For Civilisation', 2005, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Operation Cyclone]] from 1979 to 1989, the United States provided financial aid and weapons to the [[mujahideen]] through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]. Bin Laden met and built relations with [[Hamid Gul]], who was a [[three-star rank|three-star]] [[Lieutenant General (Pakistan)|general]] in the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani army]] and head of the ISI agency. Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]] and the ISI.

By 1984, bin Laden and Azzam established [[Maktab al-Khidamat]], which funneled money, arms and fighters from around the Arab world into Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's inherited family fortune&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=145 &quot;Lawrence Wright estimates his share of the Saudi Binladin Group circa fall 1989 as amounted to 27&amp;nbsp;million Saudi riyals – a little more than [US]$ 7&amp;nbsp;million.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid for air tickets and accommodation, paid for paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihadi fighters. Bin Laden established camps inside [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] in Pakistan and trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet puppet regime; the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. It was during this time that he became idolised by many Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fisk, 'The Great War For Civilisation', 2005, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation and structuring of Al-Qaeda===
{{Main|Al-Qaeda}}

By 1988, bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat. While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, bin Laden wanted a more military role. One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|2006|pp=74–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988 indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: &quot;Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious.&quot; A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (''[[Bay'at|bayat]]'') to follow one's superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=133–134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because &quot;its existence was still a closely held secret&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between &quot;several senior leaders&quot; of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8EqWnqdsgZMC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=August+11,+1988,+meeting+between+%22several+senior+leaders%22+of+Egyptian+Islamic+Jihad,+Abdullah+Azzam,+and+bin+Laden|title=Urban Terrorism : Myths And Realities|first=N.

The Iraqi [[invasion of Kuwait]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] on August 2, 1990, put the Saudi kingdom and the [[House of Saud]] at risk, with Iraqi forces on the Saudi border and Saddam's appeal to pan-Arabism potentially inciting internal dissent. Bin Laden met with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], and Saudi Defense Minister [[Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Sultan]], telling them not to depend on non-Muslim assistance from the United States and others, offering to help defend Saudi Arabia with his Arab legion. Bin Laden's offer was rebuffed, and the Saudi monarchy invited the deployment of U.S. forces in Saudi territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jehl |first=Douglas |title= A Nation Challenged: Holy war lured Saudis as rulers looked Away |work=The New York Times |date=December 27, 2001 |pages= A1, B4 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden publicly denounced Saudi dependence on the U.S. military, arguing the two holiest shrines of Islam, [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the cities in which the [[Prophet Mohamed]] received and recited Allah's message, should only be defended by Muslims. Bin Laden's criticism of the [[Saudi monarchy]] led them to attempt to silence him. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division landed in north-eastern Saudi city of [[Dhahran]] and was deployed in the desert barely 400 miles from Medina.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, on November 8, 1990, the FBI [[raid (military)|raided]] the [[New Jersey]] home of [[El Sayyid Nosair]], an associate of al-Qaeda operative [[Ali Mohamed]], discovering copious evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers. This marked the earliest discovery of al-Qaeda terrorist plans outside of Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tkb.org/CaseHome.jsp?caseid=332 |title=USA v.

Bin Laden continued to speak publicly against the Saudi government, for which the Saudis banished him. He went to live in exile in Sudan, in 1992, in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abdullah Assam: The Man Before Osama Bin Laden|author=Steve Emerson|url=http://www.iacsp.com/itobli3.html|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan and return to Afghanistan===
In Sudan, bin Laden established a new base for mujahideen operations in [[Khartoum]]. He bought [[Osama bin Laden's house in Khartoum|a house]] on Al-Mashtal Street in the affluent Al-Riyadh quarter and a retreat at [[Soba (city)|Soba]] on the [[Blue Nile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reeve2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Simon|title=The new jackals: Ramzi Yousef, Osama Bin Laden and the future of terrorism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VQjpziNmoE4C&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=May 7, 2011|date=June 27, 2002|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-509-4|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShayLiberman2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shay|first1=Shaul|last2=Liberman|first2=Rachel|title=The Red Sea terror triangle: Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Islamic terror|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v2ss0vor_DkC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=May 7, 2011|date=October 13, 2006|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-0620-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Sudan, he heavily invested in the infrastructure, in agriculture and businesses. He built roads using the same bulldozers he had employed to construct mountain tracks in Afghanistan. Many of his labourers were the same fighters who had been his comrades in the war against the Soviet Union. He was generous to the poor and popular with the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallab2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallab|first=Abdullahi A.|title=The first Islamist republic: development and disintegration of Islamism in the Sudan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s1XdRfAJwLIC&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=May 7, 2011|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7162-6|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Great War for Civilisation', Robert Fisk, 2005, p5.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to criticize King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, and in response, in 1994, Fahd stripped bin Laden of his Saudi citizenship and persuaded his family to cut off his $7&amp;nbsp;million a year stipend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; By now bin Laden was being linked with Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), which made up the core of al-Qaeda. In 1995 the EIJ [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad#Mubarak assassination attempt|attempted to assassinate]] Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. The attempt failed, and the EIJ was expelled from Sudan.

The U.S. State Department accused Sudan of being a &quot;[[State terrorism|sponsor of international terrorism]]&quot; and bin Laden himself of operating &quot;terrorist training camps in the Sudanese desert&quot;. Sudan, therefore, began efforts to expel bin Laden. The 9/11 Commission Report states:&lt;blockquote&gt;In late 1995, when Bin Laden was still in Sudan, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the possibility of expelling Bin Laden. CIA paramilitary officer [[Billy Waugh]] tracked down Bin Ladin in the Sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him, but was denied authorization.&lt;ref&gt;Hunting the Jackal: A Special Forces and CIA Soldier's Fifty Years on the Frontlines of the War Against Terrorism, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Ambassador [[Timothy M. Carney|Timothy Carney]] encouraged the Sudanese to pursue this course. The Saudis, however, did not want Bin Laden, giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship. Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Laden over to the United States. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Laden. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding against bin Laden in any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch4.pdf |format=PDF |title=Responses to Al Qaeda's Initial Assaults |publisher=9/11 Commission |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] further states:&lt;blockquote&gt;In February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States and other governments, asking what actions of theirs might ease foreign pressure. In secret meetings with Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. U.S. officials became aware of these secret discussions, certainly by March. Saudi officials apparently wanted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate his presence in their country. Also Bin Laden may have no longer felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassination attempt that he believed to have been the work of the Egyptian or Saudi regimes, and paid for by the [[CIA]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to the increasing pressure on Sudan from Saudi Arabia, [[Egypt]], and the United States, bin Laden was permitted to leave for a country of his choice. He chose to return to [[Jalalabad|Jalalabad, Afghanistan]] aboard a chartered flight on May 18, 1996 and there forged a close relationship with [[Mullah Mohammed Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12224 |title=Fighters Hunt Former Ally |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Megan K.

In August 1996, bin Laden declared war against the United States. Despite the assurance of President [[George H.W. Bush]] to [[King Fahd]] in 1990, that all U.S. forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there, citing the continued existence of Saddam's regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy). Bin Laden's view was that &quot;the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel. Saudi Arabia had been turned into 'an American colony&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;'The Great War for Civilisation', Robert Fisk, 2005, p22&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fatwā]] was first published in ''[[Al Quds Al Arabi]]'', a London-based newspaper. It was entitled &quot;Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |title=Bin Laden's Fatwa |publisher=Pbs.org |date=August 20, 1998 |accessdate=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]] is sometimes called &quot;The Land of the Two Holy Mosques&quot; in reference to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest places in Islam. The reference to 'occupation' in the fatwā referred to US forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as [[Operation Southern Watch]].

In Afghanistan, bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from &quot;donors from the days of the Soviet jihad&quot;, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden effectively took over [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]], which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of bin Laden's terrorist network.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Braun; Judy Pasternak [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/18/news/mn-5593 &quot;Long Before Sept. 11, Bin Laden Aircraft Flew Under the Radar&quot;].

===Early attacks and aid for attacks===
[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pakistan]]i journalist [[Hamid Mir]] interviewing Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1997]]
It is believed that the first bombing attack involving bin Laden was the December 29, 1992, bombing of the [[Gold Mihor Hotel]] in [[Aden]] in which two people were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbschronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html |title=Who is bin Laden?: Chronology |publisher=PBS |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was after this bombing that al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justification for the killing of innocent people. According to a fatwa issued by [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find their proper reward in death, going to ''[[Jannah]]'' (Paradise) if they were good Muslims and to ''[[Jahannam]]'' (hell) if they were bad or non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, U.S. v. Usama bin Laden, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the general public.

In the 1990s bin Laden's al-Qaeda assisted jihadis financially and sometimes militarily in [[Algeria]], Egypt and Afghanistan. In 1992 or 1993 bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists and urge war rather than negotiation with the government. Their advice was heeded but the [[Algerian Civil War#Massacres and reconciliation|war]] that followed killed 150,000–200,000 Algerians and ended with Islamist surrender to the government.

Bin Laden funded the [[Luxor massacre]] of November 17, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;Jailan Halawi, 'bin Laden behind Luxor Massacre?' ''Al-Ahram Weekly'', May 20–26, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Barbara |last = Plett |title = Bin Laden 'behind Luxor massacre' |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/343207.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=May 13, 1999 |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Profile: Ayman al-Zawahiri |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1560834.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=September 27, 2004 |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which killed 62 civilians, but outraged the Egyptian public. In mid-1997, the [[Northern Alliance]] threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing bin Laden to abandon his [[Najim Jihad]] compound and move his operations to [[Tarnak Farms]] in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;arkChark&quot;&gt;Testimony of [[Abdurahman Khadr]] as a witness in the trial against Charkaoui, July 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another successful attack was carried out in the city of [[Mazar-e-Sharif]] in Afghanistan. Bin Laden helped cement his alliance with the Taliban by sending several hundred Afghan Arab fighters along to help the Taliban kill between five and six thousand [[Hazaras]] overrunning the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1998, Osama bin Laden and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] co-signed a ''fatwa'' in the name of the [[World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders]] which declared the killing of North Americans and their allies an &quot;individual duty for every Muslim&quot; to &quot;liberate the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] (in [[Jerusalem]]) and the holy mosque (in Mecca) from their grip&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/fatw2.htm|title = World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders: Initial &quot;Fatwa&quot; Statement|author=Shaykh Usamah Bin-Muhammad Bin-Ladin|coauthors = Ayman al-Zawahiri, Abu-Yasir Rifa'i Ahmad Taha, Shaykh Mir Hamzah, Fazlur Rahman|date=February 23, 1998 |work=al-Quds al-Arabi |language = Arabic |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm|title = Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders.

Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on June 24, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=252 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rOeSEaw1 | title=Russian Secret Services' Links With Al-Qaeda | date=July 18, 2005 | author=Michel Elbaz | publisher=Axis Globe | archivedate=July 21, 2010 | deadurl = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1998 U.S. Embassy bombings]] were a series of attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous [[truck bomb]] explosions at the United States [[embassy|embassies]] in the major East African cities of [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania and [[Nairobi]], Kenya. The attacks were linked to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the United States public for the first time, and resulted in the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation placing bin Laden on its [[FBI ten most wanted fugitives|Ten Most Wanted]] list.

In December 1998, the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] Counterterrorist Center reported to President [[Bill Clinton]] that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the United States of America, including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bin Ladin Preparing to Hijack U.S. Aircraft and Other Attacks|date=December 4, 1998|accessdate=May 28, 2010|publisher=[[Director of Central Intelligence]]|url = http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001110635/0001110635_0001.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2000, [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] revealed that Islamic militants headed by bin Laden had planned a [[2000 millennium attack plots|triple attack on January 3, 2000]] which would have included bombings in [[Jordan]] of the [[Radisson SAS Hotel]] in [[Amman]] and tourists at [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]] and a site on the [[Jordan River]], the sinking of the destroyer [[USS The Sullivans|USS ''The Sullivans'']] in Yemen, as well as an attack on a target within the United States. The plan was foiled by the arrest of the Jordanian terrorist cell, the sinking of the explosive-filled skiff intended to target the destroyer, and the arrest of [[Ahmed Ressam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;post2&quot;/&gt;

A former U.S. State Department official in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, after it was asserted that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes2001-10-15&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20011015&amp;slug=bosnia15 |title=Bosnia – base for terrorism |work=The Seattle Times |author=Craig Pyes, Josh Meyer and William C.

In 1992, hundreds of volunteers joined an &quot;all-mujahedeen unit&quot; called El Moujahed in an abandoned hillside factory, a compound with a hospital and prayer hall.

According to Middle East intelligence reports, bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in [[Sudan]]. Among them was [[Karim Said Atmani]] who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/50933336.html?FMT=ABS |title=A Bosnian Village's Terrorist Ties |work=The Washington Post |author=R.

A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former mujahideen who were linked to the same Algerian group or to other groups of suspected terrorists, and had lived in the area {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. [[Khalil al-Deek]] was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites. A second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Osama bin Laden. In its June 26, 1997, report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, ''The New York Times'' noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslims forces. Further, the captured men also admitted to ties with Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Bin Laden was granted Bosnian passport, Agence France Presse September 24, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/23/world/outsiders-bring-islamic-fervor-to-the-balkans.html |title=Outsiders Bring Islamic Fervor To the Balkans |work=The New York Times |author=Chris Hedges |date=September 23, 1996 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 it was revealed that bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and [[Bosnian passport]]s in 1993 by the government in Sarajevo. This information was denied by the Bosnian government following the September 11 attacks, but it was later found that Aodouni was arrested in [[Turkey]] and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new explanation was given that bin Laden &quot;did not personally collect his Bosnian passport&quot; and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden was at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; The Bosnian daily ''[[Oslobođenje]]'' published in 2001 that three men, believed to be linked to bin Laden, were arrested in Sarajevo in July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as Imad El Misri, were Egyptian nationals. The paper said that two of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports.

In 1998 it was reported that bin Laden was operating his al-Qaeda network out of [[Albania]]. ''[[The Charleston Gazette]]'' quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of the [[SHISH|Albanian intelligence service]], as saying a network run by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden sent units to fight in the Serbian province of [[Kosovo]]. Confirmation of these activities came from Claude Kader, a French national who said he was a member of bin Laden's Albanian network.

By 1998 four members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) were arrested in Albania and extradited to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mayer, ''The Dark Side'', Doubleday. p. 114. ISBN 978-0-385-52639-5 (0-385-52639-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

During his trial at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] former Serbian President [[Slobodan Milošević]] presented FBI documents that verified bin Laden's al-Qaeda had a presence in the Balkans and aided the Kosovo Liberation Army, which was identified by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organization shortly before the 1998 embassy bombings in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]]. Milošević had argued that the United States aided the terrorists which culminated in its backing of the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] during the Kosovo War.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roche, Reuters, &quot;Milosevic: U.S. was Ally of Al Qaeda in Kosovo&quot;.

Speaking quietly in an even voice, he tells the American people that he ordered the September 11 attacks because 'we are a free people' who wanted to 'regain the freedom' of their nation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18-minute tape, played on Al-Jazeera, four days before the American presidential election, bin Laden accused U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] of negligence on the [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] of the planes on September 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc-2004&quot;/&gt;

According to the tapes, bin Laden claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the destruction of towers in Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3966817.stm |title=Excerpts: Bin Laden video |publisher=BBC News |date=October 29, 2004 |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through two other tapes aired by Al Jazeera in 2006, Osama bin Laden announced, &quot;I am the one in charge of the nineteen brothers.

Identified [[motivations of the September 11 attacks]] include the [[Israel – United States military relations|support of Israel by the United States]], presence of the U.S. military in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. enforcement of [[Iraq sanctions|sanctions against Iraq]].

On March 16, 1998, [[Libya]] issued the first official [[Interpol]] [[arrest warrant]] against bin Laden and three other people.

Bin Laden became the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1990s|456th person listed]] on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, when he was added on June 7, 1999, following his indictment along with others for [[Capital punishment|capital crimes]] in the 1998 embassy attacks. Attempts at assassination and requests for the extradition of bin Laden from the Taliban of Afghanistan were met with failure prior to the bombing of Afghanistan in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/217947.stm |title=Osama bin Laden 'innocent' |date=November 21, 1998 |publisher=BBC News |author=William Reeve |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton convinced the United Nations to impose sanctions against Afghanistan in an attempt to force the Taliban to extradite him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council demands that Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden to appropriate authorities|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19991015.sc6739.doc.html|publisher=United Nations|date=October 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, on October 10, 2001, bin Laden appeared as well on the initial list of the top 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by the President of the United States George W. Bush, in direct response to the September 11 attacks, but which was again based on the indictment for the 1998 embassy attack. Bin Laden was among a group of thirteen fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter list for questioning about the 1998 embassy bombings. Bin Laden remains the only fugitive ever to be listed on both FBI fugitive lists.

Despite the multiple indictments listed above and multiple requests, the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. They did however offer to try him before an Islamic court if evidence of Osama bin Laden's involvement in the September 11 attacks was provided. It was not until eight days after the bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over Osama bin Laden to a third-party country for trial in return for the United States ending the bombing. This offer was rejected by President Bush stating that this was no longer negotiable, with Bush responding &quot;there's no need to discuss innocence or guilt.

Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the United States government since the presidency of [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/24/clinton.binladen/index.html |title=Bill Clinton: I got closer to killing bin Laden |publisher=CNN |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061005001828/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/24/clinton.binladen/index.html |archivedate=October 5, 2006 | deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the September 11 attacks it was revealed that President Clinton had signed a directive authorizing the CIA (and specifically their elite Special Activities Division) to apprehend bin Laden and bring him to the United States to stand trial after the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] in Africa; if taking bin Laden alive was deemed impossible, then deadly force was authorized.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt; On August 20, 1998, 66 cruise missiles launched by United States Navy ships in the [[Arabian Sea]] struck bin Laden's training camps near [[Khost]] in Afghanistan, narrowly missing him by a few hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;/&gt; In 1999 the CIA, together with Pakistani military intelligence, had prepared a team of approximately 60 Pakistani commandos to infiltrate Afghanistan to capture or kill bin Laden, but the plan was aborted by the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état]];&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/18/AR2007111800629.html CIA Trained Pakistanis to Nab Terrorist But Military Coup Put an End to 1999 Plot]&quot;, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000, foreign operatives working on behalf of the CIA had fired a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] at a convoy of vehicles in which bin Laden was traveling through the mountains of Afghanistan, hitting one of the vehicles but not the one in which bin Laden was in.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/16/national/main311490.shtml Report: Clinton Targeted Bin Laden]&quot;, [[CBS News]], September 16, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, prior to the September 11 attacks, [[Paul Bremer]] characterized the [[Clinton administration]] as &quot;correctly focused on bin Laden&quot;, while [[Robert Oakley]] criticized their &quot;obsession with Osama&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;post2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43852-2000Dec23 |title=Terrorists Plotted Jan. 2000 Attacks |work=The Washington Post |author=Vernon Loeb |date=December 24, 2000 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the September 11 attacks, U.S. government officials named bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25&amp;nbsp;million for information leading to his capture or death.&lt;ref name=&quot;fbiwantednotice&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/page2/nov03/laden110503.htm |title=Five Years Ago Today – Usama bin Laden: Wanted for Murder |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |date=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080109080055/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/nov03/laden110503.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2008 | deadurl = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 2007, this figure was doubled to $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCJuly07&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6898075.stm |title=Senate doubles Bin Laden reward |publisher=BBC News |date=July 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Airline Pilots Association]] and the [[Air Transport Association]] offered an additional $2&amp;nbsp;million reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Katie Turner, Pam Benson, Peter Bergen, Elise Labott and Nic Robertson |publisher=CNN |date=September 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/09/23/france.binladen/index.html |title=Officials, friends can't confirm Bin Laden death report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the U.S. government concluded that Osama bin Laden was present during the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], Afghanistan in late 2001, and according to civilian and military officials with first-hand knowledge, failure by the United States to commit enough U.S. ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the United States in the war against al-Qaeda. Intelligence officials have assembled what they believe to be decisive evidence, from contemporary and subsequent interrogations and intercepted communications, that bin Laden began the Battle of Tora Bora inside the cave complex along Afghanistan's mountainous eastern border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Gellman |first1=Barton |last2=Ricks |first2=Thomas E. |title=U.S. Concludes Bin Laden Escaped at Tora Bora Fight |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62618-2002Apr16 |date=April 17, 2002 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Washington Post'' also reported that the CIA unit composed of special operations paramilitary forces dedicated to capturing bin Laden was shut down in late 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/04/AR2006070400375.html |work=The Washington Post |title=CIA Reportedly Disbands Bin Laden Unit |agency=Associated Press |date=July 4, 2006 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush had previously defended this scaling back of the effort several times, saying, &quot;I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really don't care. It's not that important. It's not our priority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/2002/11/13_Laden.html|title=Bush Quotes about Bin Laden|publisher=BuzzFlash|accessdate=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. and Afghanistan forces raided the mountain caves in [[Tora Bora]] between August 14–16, 2007. The military was drawn to the area after receiving intelligence of a pre-[[Ramadan]] meeting held by al-Qaeda members. After killing dozens of al-Qaeda and Taliban members, they did not find either Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21000298 |title=Bin Laden may have just escaped U.S. forces |publisher=MSNBC |author=Justin Balding, Adam Ciralsky, Jim Miklaszewski and Robert Windrem |date=September 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] said in December 2009 that officials had had no reliable information on bin Laden's whereabouts for years. One week later, General [[Stanley McChrystal]], the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said in December 2009 that al-Qaeda will not be defeated unless its leader, Osama bin Laden, is captured or killed. Testifying to the U.S. Congress, he said bin Laden had become an &quot;iconic figure, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world&quot;, and that Obama's deployment of 30,000 extra troops to Afghanistan meant that success would be possible. &quot;I don't think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until he's captured or killed&quot;, McChrystal said of bin Laden. &quot;Killing or capturing bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but the movement could not be eradicated while he remained at large.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8402138.stm |title=Gen McChrystal: Bin Laden is key to al-Qaeda defeat|publisher=BBC News|date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, President Obama ordered a covert operation to kill or capture bin Laden. On May 2, 2011, the White House announced that U.S. Navy SEALs had carried it out, killing him in his [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|Abbottabad compound]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13256791 |title=Osama Bin Laden dead, US President Obama confirms |publisher=BBC News |date= May 2, 2011|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and whereabouts after the September 11 attacks==
{{Main|Location of Osama bin Laden}}

While referring to Osama bin Laden in a CNN film clip on September 17, 2001, then President George W. Bush stated, &quot;I want justice. There is an old poster out west, as I recall, that said, 'Wanted dead or alive' &quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2001, President George W. Bush 'Bin Laden, Wanted dead or alive' |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFgn4EaCGQA |publisher=CNN | date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, bin Laden retreated further from public contact to avoid capture. Numerous speculative press reports were issued about his whereabouts or even death; some placed bin Laden in different locations during overlapping time periods. None were ever definitively proven. After military offensives in Afghanistan failed to uncover his whereabouts, Pakistan was regularly identified as his suspected hiding place. Some of the conflicting reports regarding bin Laden's continued whereabouts and mistaken claims about his death follow:
* In December 11, 2005, a letter from [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] to [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] indicated that bin Laden and the al-Qaeda leadership were based in the [[Waziristan]] region of [[Pakistan]] at the time. In the letter, translated by the United States military's [[Combating Terrorism Center]] at [[West Point]], &quot;Atiyah&quot; instructs Zarqawi to &quot;send messengers from your end to Waziristan so that they meet with the brothers of the leadership [...] I am now on a visit to them and I am writing you this letter as I am with them...&quot; Al-Rahman also indicates that bin Laden and al-Qaeda are &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;have many of their own problems.&quot; The letter has been deemed authentic by military and counterterrorism officials, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/01/AR2006100101083.html |title=Letter Gives Glimpse of Al-Qaeda's Leadership |work=The Washington Post |author=Karen DeYoung|date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu/harmony/CTC-AtiyahLetter.pdf|format=PDF |title=Letter Exposes New Leader in Al-Qa'ida High Command (PDF) |publisher=Combating Terrorism Center at West Point |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070808182757/http://www.ctc.usma.edu/harmony/CTC-AtiyahLetter.pdf |archivedate=August 8, 2007 | deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In March 2009, the [[New York Daily News]] reported that the hunt for bin Laden had centered in the [[Chitral District]] of Pakistan, including the [[Kalam Valley]]. Author [[Rohan Gunaratna]] stated that captured al-Qaeda leaders had confirmed that bin Laden was hiding in Chitral.&lt;ref&gt;Meek, James Gordon, &quot;Tighten The Net On Evil&quot;, ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', 2009-03-15, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the first week of December 2009, a Taliban detainee in Pakistan said he had information that bin Laden was in Afghanistan in 2009. The detainee reported that in January or February (2009) he met a trusted contact who had seen bin Laden in Afghanistan about 15 to 20 days earlier. However, on December 6, 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the United States had had no reliable information on the whereabouts of bin Laden in years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8397684.stm &quot;No Bin Laden information in years, says Gates&quot;].

* On December 9, 2009, BBC News reported that U.S. Army General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]], who served as Commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan from June 15, 2009, until June 23, 2010, emphasized the continued importance of the capture or killing of bin Laden, thus indicating that the U.S. high command believed that bin Laden was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8402138.stm |title=Gen McChrystal: Bin Laden is key to al-Qaeda defeat |publisher=BBC News |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 2, 2010, Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]] arrived in Saudi Arabia for an official visit. The agenda included discussion of a possible Saudi role in Karzai's plan to reintegrate Taliban militants. During the visit an anonymous official of the Saudi Foreign Ministry declared that the kingdom had no intention of getting involved in peacemaking in Afghanistan unless the Taliban severed ties with extremists and expelled Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name=Expel&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/ML-Saudi-Afghan/2010/02/02/id/348703|title=Saudi Arabia Wants Taliban to Expel Bin Laden|date=February 2, 2010|publisher=Newsmax|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 7, 2010, the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Siyassa reported that bin Laden was hiding out in the mountainous town of [[Savzevar]], in north eastern [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memrijttm.org/content/en/report.htm?report=4338 |title=Kuwaiti Daily 'Al-Siyassa': Bin Laden, Al-Zawahiri Guarded by Iranian Troops in Iranian Territory |publisher=Memrijttm.org |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, The Australian News's online edition repeated the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/bin-laden-aides-hiding-in-iran/story-fn3dxity-1225877288776|title=Bin Laden, aides 'hiding in Iran' | date=June 9, 2010 | work=NewsCore}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 18, 2010, an unnamed NATO official suggested that bin Laden was &quot;alive and well and living comfortably&quot; in Pakistan, protected by elements of the country's intelligence services. A senior Pakistani official denied the allegations and said the accusations were designed to put pressure on the Pakistani government ahead of talks aimed at strengthening ties between Pakistan and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8070836/Osama-bin-Laden-living-comfortably-in-Pakistan.html|title=Osama bin Laden 'living comfortably in Pakistan' |work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Rob|last=Crilly|date=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2012 Pakistani newspaper [[Dawn (newspaper)|''Dawn'']] acquired a report produced by Pakistani security officials, based on interrogation of his three surviving wives, that detailed his movements while living underground in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2012-03-30&gt;

In a letter Bin Laden wrote in 2010 he chastised followers who had reinterpreted ''al-tatarrus'' — an Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances – to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians which had turned Muslims against the [[jihad]]i movement. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaida, Bin Laden condemned [[Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan]] for an attack on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that &quot;the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants.&quot; Bin Laden wrote that the tatarrus doctrine &quot;needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established.&quot; He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. In [[Yemen]], Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a &quot;truce&quot; that would bring the country &quot;stability&quot; or would at least &quot;show the people that we are careful in keeping … the Muslims safe on the basis of peace.&quot; In [[Somalia]], he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised [[al-Shabab]] to pursue economic development. He instructed his followers around the world to focus on education and persuasion rather than &quot;entering into confrontations&quot; with Islamic political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/bin_laden_s_documents_al_qaida_letters_show_the_moral_and_political_failure_of_terrorism_.single.html|title=Reflections of a Terrorist|work=Slate|first=William|last=Saletan|date=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whereabouts just prior to his death===
In April 2011, various intelligence outlets were able to pinpoint bin Laden's suspected location near Abbottabad, Pakistan. It was originally believed that bin Laden was hiding near the border between [[Afghanistan]] and Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], but he was found {{convert|100|mi|km}} away in a three-story [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|mansion in Abbottabad]] at {{Coord|34|10|9.51|N|73|14|32.78|E|scale:10|display=inline}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZengerleBull&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/02/us-binladen-compound-idUSTRE7411NX20110502|title=Bin Laden was found at luxurious Pakistan compound|last=Zengerle|first=Patricia|coauthors=Bull, Alister|agency=Reuters |accessdate=May 2, 2011|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/05/osama-bin-laden-pakistan-locals-flock-house Osama bin Laden death: Pakistan locals flock to see villain's lair] Declan Walsh ''[[The Guardian]]'' May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/02/world/asia/abbottabad-map-of-where-osama-bin-laden-was-killed.html|title=Map of Where Osama bin Laden Was Killed – Map |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 2, 2011|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden's mansion was located {{convert|0.8|mi|km}} southwest of the [[Pakistan Military Academy]], the country's &quot;[[West Point]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13257330 |title=Osama Bin Laden's death: How it happened |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=May 2, 2011 | date = June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Osama bin Laden, the face of terror, killed in Pakistan |publisher=CNN |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/05/01/bin.laden.obit/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://inthearena.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/02/spitzer-what-role-did-pakistan-play-in-the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden/ |title=Spitzer: What role did Pakistan play in the killing of Osama bin Laden? – In the Arena |publisher=CNN |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/osama-bin-laden-death-prompts-celebrations-security-alerts/story?id=13507836 |title=President Obama Praises Troops Who Killed Osama bin Laden |publisher=ABC news|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Earth maps show that the compound was not present in 2001, but it was present on images taken in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ogleearth.com/2011/05/finding-osama-bin-ladens-abbottabad-mansion-with-google-earth/ |title=Finding Osama Bin Laden's Abbottabad mansion with Google Earth |date=2011-05-02 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
