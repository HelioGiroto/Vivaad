In this system, the official name of the [[Quebec City|capital is Québec]] in both official languages. The Quebec government renders both names as ''Québec'' in both languages.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] in [[Eastern Canada|east]]-[[Central Canada|central]] [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv |Merriam|Webster|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QLocation&quot;&gt;Quebec is located in the [[Eastern Canada|eastern part of Canada]], but is also historically and politically considered to be part of Central Canada (with [[Ontario]]).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Canadian province with a predominantly [[francophone|French-speaking]] population and the only one whose sole [[official language]] is [[French language|French]] at the provincial level.

Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest [[Canada#Administrative divisions|administrative division]]; only the territory of [[Nunavut]] is larger. It is bordered to the west by the province of [[Ontario]], [[James Bay]] and [[Hudson Bay]], to the north by [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Ungava Bay]], to the east by the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the provinces of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[New Brunswick]]. It is bordered on the south by the [[United States|US]] states of [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], and [[New York]]. It also shares [[maritime border]]s with [[Nunavut]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]].

Quebec is Canada's second most populous province, after [[Ontario]]. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the [[Saint Lawrence River]] between [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]], the capital. [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking communities]] and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the [[island of Montreal]] but are also significantly present in the [[Outaouais]], [[Eastern Townships]], and [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]] regions. The [[Nord-du-Québec]] region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CD&amp;Code1=2499&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=24&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Nord-du-Qu%E9bec&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=24&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom= |title=Community highlights for Nord-du-Québec |year=2006 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec independence]] debates have played a large role in the [[politics of Quebec|politics of the province]].  [[Parti Québécois]]  [[Government of Quebec|governments]] have held referendums on [[sovereignty]] in [[Quebec referendum, 1980|1980]] and [[Quebec referendum, 1995|1995]]; both were voted down by voters, the latter defeated by a very narrow margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |title=Canada |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=December 13, 2011}} See drop-down essay on &quot;History Since 1960&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[House of Commons of Canada]] passed [[Québécois nation motion|a symbolic motion]] recognizing the &quot;[[Québécois people|Québécois]] as a nation within a united Canada.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2528725&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1#SOB-1788846 | work=Hansard of 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087 |title=Routine Proceedings: The Québécois |publisher=Parliament of Canada |date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061127/quebec_motion_061127?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |title=House of Commons passes Quebec nation motion|publisher=CTV News |date=November 27, 2006 |accessdate=October 3, 2009}} &quot;The motion is largely seen as a symbolic recognition of the Québécois nation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

While the province's substantial [[natural resources]] have long been the mainstay of its economy, sectors of the [[knowledge economy]] such as [[aerospace]], information and communication technologies, [[biotechnology]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]] also play leading roles. These many industries have all contributed to helping Quebec become Canada's second most economically influential province, second only to [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poitras|first=François |title=Regional Economies Special Report Micro-Economic Policy Analysis |publisher=Industry Canada |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/eas-aes.nsf/vwapj/srreo200401e.PDF/$FILE/srreo200401e.PDF |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611170023/http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/eas-aes.nsf/vwapj/srreo200401e.PDF/$FILE/srreo200401e.PDF |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |format=PDF |date=2004-01 |accessdate=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive à Québec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|right|thumb|The arrival of [[Samuel de Champlain]], the father of [[New France]], on the site of [[Quebec City]].]]
The name &quot;Québec&quot;, which comes from the [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] word '''kébec''' meaning &quot;where the river narrows&quot;, originally referred to the area around Quebec City where the Saint Lawrence River narrows to a cliff-lined gap. Early variations in the spelling of the name included ''Québecq'' (Levasseur, 1601) and ''Kébec'' (Lescarbot 1609).&lt;ref&gt;Afable, Patricia O. and Madison S. Beeler (1996). &quot;Place Names&quot;. In &quot;Languages&quot;, ed. Ives Goddard. Vol. 17 of ''Handbook of North American Indians'', ed. William C. Sturtevant. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] chose the name ''Québec'' in 1608 for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the French colony of [[New France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpContent.html&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=2&amp;chapter_id=4&amp;page_id=4&amp;lang=E | title = Canada: A People's History&amp;nbsp;– The birth of Quebec | publisher = Canadian Broadcast Corporation|year=2001 | accessdate =August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province is sometimes referred to as &quot;La belle province&quot;.

The [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] was founded in the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] formally transferred the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;his Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts, with the sovereignty, property, possession, and all rights acquired by treaty, or otherwise, which the Most Christian King and the Crown of France have had till now over the said countries, lands, islands, places, coasts, and their inhabitants&quot; – [[s:Treaty of Paris (1763)|''Treaty of Paris'']], 1763&lt;/ref&gt; to Britain after the [[Seven Years' War]]. The proclamation restricted the province to an area along the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. [[The Quebec Act]] of 1774 expanded the territory of the province to include the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Ohio River]] Valley and south of [[Rupert's Land]], more or less restoring the borders previously existing under French rule before the Conquest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geographers1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Canadian Association of Geographers|title=Canada: a Geographical Interpretation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=voYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=33|id=GGKEY:E1DDKEKZ35S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Versailles, 1783]] ceded territories south of the Great Lakes to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;PeirceCo1877&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry B.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Quebec}}
[[File:Map of Quebec.png|thumb|Map of Quebec]]

Located in the [[Eastern Canada|eastern part]] of Canada and (from a historical and political perspective) part of Central Canada, Quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of France or Texas, most of which is very sparsely populated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison between the area of Quebec and various countries|url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/jeunesse/territoire/compa_superf_pays.htm|author=Institut de la statistique du Québec|publisher=Governement of Quebec|accessdate=July 4, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its area is very different from one region to another due to the varying composition of the ground, the climate (latitude and altitude) and the proximity to water. The [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]] (south) and the [[Canadian Shield]] (north) are the two main topographic regions and are radically different.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elson&quot; /&gt;

===Hydrography===

The largest inland body of water is the [[Caniapiscau Reservoir]], created in the realization of the [[James Bay Project]] to produce hydroelectric power. The [[Lake Mistassini]] is the largest natural lake in Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTQ-resC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=150506 |title=Réservoir de Caniapiscau |author=Commission de toponymie du Québec|publisher=Government of Quebec |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saint Lawrence River]] has some of the world's largest sustaining inland Atlantic ports at Montreal (the province's largest city), [[Trois-Rivières]], and Quebec City (the capital). Its access to the Atlantic Ocean and the interior of North America made it the base of early [[French colonization of the Americas|French exploration and settlement]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Since 1959, the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] has provided a navigable link between the Atlantic Ocean and Great Lakes. Northeast of Quebec City, the river broadens into the world's largest [[estuary]], the feeding site of numerous species of whales, fish and sea birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saguenay-St. Lawrence National Park |url=http://www.greatcanadianparks.com/quebec/saguenp/index.htm|publisher=Digital Wizards (Ontario) Inc.|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river empties into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. This marine environment sustains fisheries and smaller ports in the [[Bas-Saint-Laurent|Lower Saint Lawrence]] (''Bas-Saint-Laurent''), [[Côte-Nord|Lower North Shore]] (''Côte-Nord''), and [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]] (''Gaspésie'') regions of the province. The [[Saint Lawrence River]] and its [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence|estuary]] forms the basis of Quebec's development through the centuries. At the same time, many affluent rivers testify to the exploration of land, among them [[Ashuapmushuan River|Ashuapmushuan]], [[Chaudière River|Chaudière]], [[Gatineau River|Gatineau]], [[Manicouagan River|Manicouagan]], [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]], [[Richelieu River|Richelieu]], [[Rupert River|Rupert]], [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]], [[Saint-François River|Saint-François]], [[Saint-Maurice River|Saint-Maurice]].

Quebec's highest point at {{formatnum:1652}} meters is [[Mount Caubvik|Mont d'Iberville]], known in English as [[Mount Caubvick]], located on the border with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the northeastern part of the province, in the [[Torngat Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=5968 |title=Mont D'Iberville, Québec/Newfoundland |publisher=PeakBagger |date=November 1, 2004 |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most populous [[physiographic]] region is the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]]. It extends northeastward from the southwestern portion of the province along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River to the Quebec City region, limited to the North by the [[Laurentian Mountains]] and to the South by the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]]. It mainly covers the areas of the [[Centre-du-Québec]], [[Laval (Québec)|Laval]], [[Montérégie]] and [[Urban agglomeration of Montreal|Montreal]], the southern regions of the [[Capitale-Nationale]], [[Lanaudière]], [[Laurentides]], [[Mauricie]] and includes [[Anticosti Island]], the [[Mingan Archipelago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve of Canada | author= Parks Canada | publisher=Government of Canada | url = http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/qc/mingan/index_e.asp | date = May 2, 2008 | accessdate =May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other small islands of the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence lowland forests]] [[ecoregion]].&lt;ref name=NAC&gt;{{cite web| title = Borderlands / St. Lawrence Lowlands | work = The Atlas of Canada | author = Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Government of Canada | date = October 25, 2006 | url = http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/land/st_lawrence_lowlands.html | accessdate =April 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its landscape is low-lying and flat, except for isolated [[igneous]] outcrops near Montreal called the [[Monteregian Hills]], formerly covered by the waters of [[Lake Champlain]].

[[Mixedwood Plains|Mixed forests]] provide most of Canada's [[maple syrup]] crop every spring.

[[File:Canadian shield.gif|thumb|The [[Canadian Shield]] extends over most of Quebec's land surface]]
More than 95% of Quebec's territory lies within the [[Canadian Shield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt; It is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the [[Laurentian Mountains]] in southern Quebec, the [[Otish Mountains]] in central Quebec and the [[Torngat Mountains]] near [[Ungava Bay]]. The topography of the Shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages, which explains the glacial deposits of boulders, gravel and sand, and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the Shield. The Canadian Shield also has a complex hydrological network of more than a million lakes, bogs, streams and rivers. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. [[Primary industries]] sustain small cities in regions of [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]], [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]], and [[Côte-Nord]].

The [[Labrador Peninsula]] is covered by the [[Laurentian Plateau]] ([[Canadian Shield]]), dotted with mountains such as [[Otish Mountains]]. The [[Ungava Peninsula]] is notably composed of D'Youville mountains, Puvirnituq mountains and Pingualuit crater. While low and medium altitude peak from western Quebec to the far north, high altitudes mountains emerge in the [[Capitale-Nationale]] region to the extreme east, along its longitude. In the [[Labrador Peninsula]] portion of the Shield, the far northern region of [[Nunavik]] includes the [[Ungava Peninsula]] and consists of flat [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] inhabited mostly by the [[Inuit]]. Further south lie the [[subarctic]] [[taiga]] of the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] ecoregion and the [[boreal forest]] of the [[Central Canadian Shield forests]], where [[spruce]], [[fir]], and [[poplar]] trees provide raw materials for Quebec's [[Pulp and paper industry in Canada|pulp and paper]] and [[lumber]] industries. Although the area is inhabited principally by the [[Grand Council of the Crees|Cree]], [[Naskapi]], and [[Innu]] [[First Nations]], thousands of temporary workers reside at [[Radisson, Quebec|Radisson]] to service the massive [[James Bay Hydroelectric Project]] on the [[La Grande River|La Grande]] and [[Eastmain River|Eastmain]] rivers. The southern portion of the shield extends to the [[Laurentian mountains|Laurentians]], a mountain range just north of the  [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]], that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.

The [[Chaudière-Appalaches|Appalachian]] region of Quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of Quebec. The [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] are actually a huge chain that extends from [[Alabama]] to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In between, it covers in Quebec near 800&amp;nbsp;km, from the Montérégie hills to the Gaspé Peninsula. In western Quebec, the average altitude is about 500 meters, while in the Gaspé Peninsula, the Appalachian peaks (especially the Chic-Choc) are among the highest in Quebec, since they exceed 1000 meters.

===Climate===
[[File:Neige Montreal.JPG|thumb|&quot;Mon pays ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver&quot; (&quot;My country isn't a country, it's winter&quot;) [[Gilles Vigneault]]]]
Quebec has three main climate regions. Southern and western Quebec, including most of the major population centres, have a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons having warm to occasionally hot and humid summers and often very cold and snowy winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.johnabbott.qc.ca/~geoscience/intro/Bryce/GoodesClimateMap22Ed%20_1_.pdf |title=Köppen Climate world map |author=Johnabbott Faculty |publisher=johnabbott.qc.ca |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main climatic influences are from western and northern Canada and move eastward, and from the southern and central United States that move northward. Because of the influence of both storm systems from the core of North America and the Atlantic Ocean, precipitation is abundant throughout the year, with most areas receiving more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mm (40&amp;nbsp;in) of precipitation, including over 300&amp;nbsp;centimetres (120&amp;nbsp;in) of snow in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climat-quebec.qc.ca/home.php?id=norm_entab&amp;mpn=stati_clim&amp;slt_nomStations=34&amp;slt_idStations=7016294&amp;slt_variable=10&amp;slt_periode=2&amp;sub=Afficher |title=Climate Normals, tabular, year |author=Climat-Québec |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, severe weather patterns (such as [[tornado]]es and [[severe thunderstorm]]s) occur occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climat-quebec.qc.ca/home.php?id=p23&amp;mpn=ev_mto_sig |title=Tornadoes |author=Climat-Québec |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of central Quebec has a [[subarctic climate]] (Köppen ''Dfc''). Winters are long, very cold, and snowy, and among the coldest in eastern Canada, while summers are warm but very short due to the higher latitude and the greater influence of Arctic air masses. Precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south, except at some of the higher elevations. The northern regions of Quebec have an [[arctic climate]] (Köppen ''ET''), with very cold winters and short, much cooler summers. The primary influences in this region are the Arctic Ocean currents (such as the [[Labrador Current]]) and continental air masses from the High [[Arctic]].

The four seasons in Quebec are spring, summer, autumn and winter, with conditions differing by region. They are then differentiated according to the brightness, temperature and precipitation of snow and rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climat-quebec.qc.ca/home.php?id=norm_entab&amp;mpn=stati_clim&amp;slt_nomStations=34&amp;slt_idStations=7011982&amp;slt_variable=10&amp;slt_periode=1&amp;sub=Afficher |title=Climate Normals, tabular, season |author=Climat-Québec |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily sunshine duration is eight hours in December, the time of year when it is the shortest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/geographie/climat/nordicite/luminosite/?lang=fr|title=Luminosité hivernale |author=Quebec Portal |publisher=Government of Quebec |date=October 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From temperate zones to the northern territories of the Far North, the brightness varies with latitude, as well as the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Northern Lights]] and [[Midnight Sun]].

===Vegetation===
[[File:Gaspé taiga.jpg|thumb|left|Taiga forest in Gaspé, Québec, Canada]]
Given the geology of the province and its different climates, there is an established number of large areas of vegetation in Quebec. These areas, listed in order from the northernmost to the southernmost are: the [[tundra]], the [[taiga]], the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] (coniferous), [[mixed forest]] and [[deciduous forest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History of Quebec|url=http://redpath-museum.mcgill.ca/Qbp/Natural%20History/nat_hist.html|work=A description of the natural history of the province|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the edge of the [[Ungava Bay]] and [[Hudson Strait]] is the [[tundra]], whose flora is limited to a low vegetation of [[lichen]] with only less than 50 growing days a year. The tundra vegetation survives an average annual temperature of {{convert|-8|°C|°F}}. The tundra covers more than 24% of the area of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt; Further south, the climate is conducive to the growth of the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]], bounded on the north by the [[taiga]].
[[File:Ecoregions quebec map.svg|thumb|The different forest areas of Quebec]]
Not as arid as the [[tundra]], the [[taiga]] is associated with the sub-Arctic regions of the [[Canadian Shield]]&lt;ref name=&quot;types veg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Types de végétations du Québec|url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/forets/connaissances/connaissances-inventaire-zones.jsp|work=Types of vegetation and climatic zones of Quebec|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=June 22, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is characterized by a greater number of both plant (600) and animal (206) species, many of which live there all year. The [[taiga]] covers about 20% of the total area of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt; The [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in Quebec that straddle the [[Canadian Shield]] and the upper [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|lowlands]] of the province. Given a warmer climate, the diversity of organisms is also higher, since there are about 850 plant species and 280 [[vertebrate]]s species. The [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] covers 27% of the area of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt; The [[mixed forest]] is a transition zone between the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] and [[deciduous forest]]. By virtue of its transient nature, this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant (1000) and [[vertebrate]]s (350) species, despite relatively cool temperatures. The ecozone [[mixed forest]] covers 11.5% of the area of Quebec and is characteristic of the [[Laurentides|Laurentians]], the [[Chaudière-Appalaches|Appalachians]] and the eastern [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|lowlands]] forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;types veg&quot; /&gt; The third most northern forest area is characterized by [[deciduous forest]]s. Because of its climate (average annual temperature of {{convert|7|°C|°F}}), it is in this area that one finds the greatest diversity of species, including more than 1600 [[vascular plants]] and 440 [[vertebrate]]s. Its relatively long growing season lasts almost 200 days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanisation of Quebec. Most of Quebec's population lives in this area of vegetation, almost entirely along the banks of the St. Lawrence. Deciduous forests cover approximately 6.6% of the area of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt;

The total forest area of Quebec is estimated at {{convert|750300|sqkm|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;domaine_forestier&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/forets/quebec/quebec-milieu.jsp|title=Domaine forestier|author=Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=August 19, 2007 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Abitibi-Témiscamingue]] to the [[Côte-Nord|North Shore]], the forest is composed primarily of conifers such as the [[Abies balsamea]], the [[Jack Pine]], the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]], the [[Picea mariana|black Spruce]] and the [[Larix laricina|Tamarack]]. Some species of deciduous trees such as the Yellow Birch [[Betula alleghaniensis|Yellow Birch]] appear when the river is approached in the south. The [[deciduous forest]] of the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]] is mostly composed of deciduous species such as the [[Acer saccharum|Sugar Maple]], the [[Acer rubrum|Red Maple]], the [[Fraxinus americana|white Ash]], the [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]], the [[Juglans cinerea|Butternut (White Walnut)]], the [[Ulmus americana|American elm]], the [[Tilia americana|basswood]], the [[Carya cordiformis|Bitternut Hickory]] and the [[Quercus rubra|northern red oak]] as well as some conifers such as the [[Eastern White Pine]] and the [[Thuja occidentalis|Northern Whitecedar]]. The distribution areas of the [[Betula papyrifera|Paper Birch]], the [[Populus tremuloides|Trembling Aspen]] and the [[Sorbus|Mountain Ash]] cover more than half of Quebec territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arboquebecium.com/index.html |title=L'Arboretum du Québec |author=Arboquebecium|publisher=Arboquebecium.com |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Quebec}}

===Indigenous peoples and European exploration===
[[File:Glacial Lake Agassiz and Glacial Lake Ojibway, 7,900 BPE.png|thumb|Glacial lakes [[Lake Agassiz|Agassiz]] and [[Glacial Lake Ojibway|Ojibway]], 7,900 BPE.]]
At the time of first European contact and later colonization, [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]], [[Iroquois]] and [[Inuit]] tribes were the peoples who inhabited what is now Quebec.{{sfn |Webb Hodge|1912| p=39}} Their lifestyles and cultures reflected the land on which they lived. Seven Algonquian groups lived [[nomad]]ic lives based on hunting, gathering, and fishing in the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield: (James Bay Cree, [[Innu]], [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]]) and Appalachian Mountains ([[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Western Abenaki|Abenaki]]).  [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], a branch of the Iroquois, lived more settled lives, planting squash and maize in the fertile soils of the St. Lawrence Valley. They appear to have been later supplanted by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] tribe. The Inuit continue to fish and hunt whale and [[Pinniped|seal]] in the harsh Arctic climate along the coasts of Hudson and Ungava Bay. These people traded fur and food and sometimes warred with each other.

[[Basque people|Basque]] whalers and fishermen traded furs with Saguenay natives throughout the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000550 |title=Basques |author=Bélanger, René |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first French [[List of explorers|explorer]] to reach Quebec was [[Jacques Cartier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quebec|url=http://www.canadafaq.ca/quebec/|work=Facts on the province of Quebec|publisher=canadafaq|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who planted a cross in 1534 at either [[Gaspé, Quebec|Gaspé]] or [[Old Fort Bay]] on the [[Basse-Côte-Nord|Lower North Shore]]. He sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1535 and established an ill-fated colony near present-day Quebec City at the site of [[Stadacona]], a village of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians.  [[Linguists]] and [[archeologists]] have determined these people were distinct from the Iroquoian nations encountered by later French and Europeans, such as the five nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]''. Their language was [[Laurentian language|Laurentian]], one of the Iroquoian family. By the late 16th century, they had disappeared from the St. Lawrence Valley.

===New France===
{{Main|New France}}
Around 1522–1523, the Italian navigator [[Giovanni da Verrazano|Giovanni da Verrazzano]] persuaded King Francis I of France to commission an expedition to find a western route to [[Cathay]] (China).&lt;ref name=Verrazzano &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verrazzano.org/en/index2.php?c=viaggioscoperte |title=1524: The voyage of discoveries|publisher=Verrazzano Centre for Historical Studies|year=2002|accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1523, Verrazzano set sail from [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], crossing the Atlantic on a small caravel with 50 men.&lt;ref name=Verrazzano /&gt; After exploring the coast of the present-day Carolinas early the following year, he headed north along the coast, eventually anchoring in the Narrows of New York Bay. The first European to discover the site of present-day New York, he named it Nouvelle-Angoulême in honour of the king, the former count of Angoulême.

Verrazzano gave the names ''Francesca'' and ''Nova Gallia'' to that land between New Spain (Mexico) and English Newfoundland.

In 1534, [[Jacques Cartier]] planted a cross in the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] and claimed the land in the name of King Francis I.{{sfn |Riendeau|2007| p=36}} It was the first province of New France. However, initial French attempts at settling the region met with failure.{{sfn |Riendeau|2007| p=36}} French fishing fleets, however, continued to sail to the Atlantic coast and into the St. Lawrence River, making alliances with [[Aboriginal people in Canada|First Nations]] that would become important once France began to occupy the land. French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable [[fur]]-bearing animals, especially the [[American Beaver|beaver]], an important commodity as the [[European beaver]] had almost been driven to extinction. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.

[[Samuel de Champlain]] was part of a 1603 expedition from France that travelled into the St. Lawrence River. In 1608, he returned as head of an exploration party and founded Quebec City with the intention of making the area part of the [[French colonial empire]].{{sfn |Grenon|2000}}{{sfn |Liebel|1999}}{{sfn |Binot|2004}} Champlain's ''Habitation de Québec'', built as a permanent [[fur trade|fur trading]] outpost, was where he would forge a trading, and ultimately a military alliance, with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and [[Wyandot people|Huron]] nations. Natives traded their furs for many French goods such as metal objects, guns, alcohol, and clothing.

[[Helen Desportes|Hélène Desportes]], born July 7, 1620, to the French [[habitants]] (settlers) Pierre Desportes and his wife Françoise Langlois, was the first child of [[European ethnic groups|European descent]] born in Quebec.

From Quebec, [[coureurs des bois]], [[voyageurs]] and Catholic missionaries used river [[canoe]]s to explore the interior of the North American continent, establishing fur trading forts on the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Étienne Brûlé]] 1615), [[Hudson Bay]] ([[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] and [[Médard des Groseilliers|Groseilliers]] 1659–60), [[Ohio River]] and [[Mississippi River]] ([[Robert Cavelier de La Salle|La Salle]] 1682), as well as the [[Saskatchewan River]] and [[Missouri River]] ([[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de la Vérendrye|de la Verendrye]] 1734–1738).

After 1627, King [[Louis XIII of France]] introduced the [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]] and forbade settlement in [[New France]] by anyone other than [[Roman Catholic]]s. [[Sulpician]] and [[Jesuit]] clerics who founded missions in [[Trois-Rivières]] (Laviolette) and [[Montreal]] or Ville-Marie ([[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]] and [[Jeanne Mance]]) to convert [[New France]]'s Huron and Algonquian allies to [[Catholicism]]. The seigneurial system of governing New France also encouraged immigration from the motherland.

New France became a Royal Province in 1663 under King [[Louis XIV of France]] with a [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]] that included [[intendant of New France|intendant]] [[Jean Talon]]. This change ushered in a golden era of [[French colonization of the Americas|settlement and colonization]] in New France, including the arrival of les &quot;[[Filles du Roi]]&quot;. The population grew from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/98-187-XIE/pop.htm |title=Estimated population of Canada, 1605 to present |author=Statistics Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River and called themselves &quot;[[Canadiens]]&quot; or &quot;[[Habitants]]&quot;. The colony's total population was limited, however, by a winter climate much harsher than that of France, by the spread of diseases, and by the refusal of the French crown to allow [[Huguenots]], or French Protestants, to settle there. The population of New France lagged far behind that of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south, leaving it vulnerable to attack.

===Seven Years' War and capitulation of New France===
[[File:PlainesAbraham.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]]]
Authorities in [[New France]] became more aggressive in their efforts to expel British traders and colonists from the [[Ohio Country|Ohio Valley]]. They began construction of a series of [[fortress|fortifications]] to protect the area.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, pp. 15–19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1754, [[George Washington]] launched a surprise attack on a group of Canadien soldiers sleeping in the early morning hours.  It came at a time when no declaration of war had been issued by either country. This frontier aggression known as the [[Jumonville affair]] set the stage for the [[French and Indian War]] (a US designation; in Canada it is usually referred to as the Seven Years' War, although [[French Canadian]]s often call it ''La guerre de la Conquête'' [&quot;The War of Conquest&quot;]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eccles, W.

By 1756, France and Britain were battling the [[Seven Years' War]] worldwide. In 1758, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] mounted an attack on New France by sea and took the French fort at [[Louisbourg]].

On September 13, 1759, General [[James Wolfe]] defeated General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] on the [[Plains of Abraham]] outside Quebec City. With the exception of the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], located off the coast of Newfoundland, France ceded its North American possessions to Great Britain through the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] in favor of gaining the island of [[Guadeloupe]] for its then-lucrative [[sugar cane]] industry.{{sfn |Hunter|1999| p=505-506}} The [[British Royal Proclamation of 1763]] renamed Canada (part of New France) as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]].

[[File:Battle of Sainte-Foy.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]] was the bloodiest battle in Quebec history. It was the last French victory during the [[Seven Years' War]]. It is interesting to note that the painting made ​​by a British artist shows a glorious victory for England but the reality was quite different. The Battle of Sainte-Foy is sometimes called the Battle of Quebec.]] At roughly the same time as the northern parts of New France were being turned over to the British and beginning their evolution towards modern-day Quebec and Canada, the southern parts of [[New France]] ([[Louisiana]]) were signed over to Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] of 1762.[[File:Capitulation Montreal.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Articles of Capitulation of Montreal|Capitulation of Montreal]] in 1760. According to a legend, when the French surrendered to the British in 1760, it was on [[Île Sainte-Hélène]] that [[François Gaston de Lévis|General Lévis]] ordered all his battalions to burn the regimental flags and has ordered to not give them as honors of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/heritage_culturel_patrimonial.html|title=Parc Jean-Drapeau|author=Ville de Montréal|publisher=Ville de Montréal|accessdate=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] As a result of double cession of Quebec to the British and Louisiana to the Spanish, the [[French colonial empire|first French colonial empire]] collapsed, with France being expelled almost entirely from the continental Americas, left with only a rump set of colonies restricted principally to scattered territories and islands in the Caribbean.{{sfn |Cave|2004}}

After the capture of New France, the British implemented a plan to control the Canadiens and to entice them to assimilate into the British way of life. They prevented Catholics from holding public office and forbade the recruitment of priests and brothers, effectively shutting down Quebec's schools and colleges. This first British policy of assimilation (1763–1774) was deemed a failure. Both the demands in the petitions of the Canadiens' élites and the recommendations by Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] played an important role in persuading London to drop the assimilation scheme, but the looming American revolt was certainly also a factor, as the British were fearful that the French-speaking population of Quebec would side with the rebellious Thirteen Colonies to the south, especially if France allied with the Americans as it appeared it would.

===Quebec Act===
[[File:Province of Quebec 1774.gif|right|thumb|The [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] in 1774.]]
With unrest growing in the colonies to the south, which would one day grow into the [[American Revolution]], the British were worried that the French-speaking Canadians might also support the growing rebellion. At that time, French-speaking Canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of Quebec (more than 99%) and British immigration was not going well. To secure the allegiance of the approximately 90,000 French-speaking Canadians to the British crown, first Governor [[James Murray (military officer)|James Murray]] and later Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] promoted the need for change. There was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the French-speaking Canadian subjects and those of newly arrived British subjects. These efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the [[Quebec Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BROWN FOULDS|first=NANCY|title=The Quebec Act|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0006592|work=Effects and Consequences|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1774.

The Quebec Act provided the people of Quebec their first Charter of Rights and paved the way to later official recognition of the French language and [[French culture]]. The act also allowed ''Canadiens'' to maintain French [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and sanctioned freedom of religion, allowing the Roman Catholic Church to remain, one of the first cases in history of state-sanctioned freedom of religious practice. Further, it restored the Ohio Valley to Quebec, reserving the territory for the fur trade. New France had thus been restored, so that it could play the same role as it did before the Conquest in North America.&lt;ref&gt;W.J.Eccles France in America p.233-34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of the American Revolution===

Although the [[Quebec Act]] was unrelated to the events in [[Boston Tea Party|Boston]] of 1773, and was not regarded as one of the [[Coercive Acts]], the timing of its passage led British colonists to the south to believe that it was part of the program to punish them. The Quebec Act offended a variety of interest groups in the British colonies. Land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a non-representative government. Many feared the establishment of Catholicism in Quebec, and that the French Canadians were being courted to help oppress British Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Ammerman, ''In the Common Cause'', 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Invasion of Quebec.tif|thumb|right|Defending Quebec from an American attack during the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]] in December 1775]]
On June 27, 1775, General George Washington decided to attempt an [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] by the American [[Continental Army]] to wrest Quebec and the St. Lawrence River from the British. A force led by Brigadier General [[Richard Montgomery]] headed north from [[Fort Ticonderoga]] along [[Lake Champlain]] and up the St. Lawrence River valley. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]] persuaded Washington to have him lead a [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec|separate expedition]] through the Maine wilderness. The two forces joined at Quebec City, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]] in December 1775. Prior to this battle, Montgomery (killed in the battle) had met with some early successes, but the invasion failed when British reinforcements came down the St. Lawrence in May 1776 and the [[Battle of Trois-Rivières]] turned into a disaster for the Americans. The army withdrew to Ticonderoga.{{sfn |Lefkowitz|2008}} Although some help was given to the Americans by the locals, Governor Carleton punished American sympathizers and public support of the American cause came to an end.

The [[American Revolutionary War]] was ultimately successful in winning independence for the Thirteen Colonies. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], the British ceded their territory south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Some online versions of the treaty omit [[Delaware]] from the list of former colonies, but the actual text lists it between [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]]. For example, see facsimile of a London newspaper announcing the treaty. [http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/milestones/paris/1.jpg] [http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/milestones/paris/] Delaware is also included in both the preliminary version of the treaty read in the Continental Congress on April 15, 1783 [http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?hlaw:1:./temp/~ammem_jEZ2::] and the one ratified by the Congress on January 14, 1784 [http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc02617))].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, [[Frederick Haldimand]] took over for [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] as governor of Quebec. Haldimand, like the previous governors of the Province of Quebec, appreciated the hard-working Canadiens and acted in his power to keep the English merchants in line.

The arrival of 10,000 Loyalists at Quebec in 1784 destroyed the political balance that Haldimand (and Carleton before him) had worked so hard to achieve. The swelling numbers of English encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/canada |title=Canada |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=December 12, 2011}} See drop-down essay on &quot;Early European Settlement and the Formation of the Modern State&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; To restore stability to his largest remaining North American colony, King George III sent Carleton back to Quebec to remedy the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;W.J.Eccles France in America p.246&quot;&gt;W.J.Eccles France in America p.246&lt;/ref&gt;

In ten years, Quebec had undergone a dramatic change. What worked for Carleton in 1774 was not likely to succeed in 1784. Specifically, there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance – there were simply too many English people unwilling to reach a compromise with the 145,000 Canadiens or their colonial governor. The situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving.&lt;ref name=&quot;W.J.Eccles France in America p.246&quot;/&gt;

===Separation of the Province of Quebec===
Loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the British legal system they were
used to in the American colonies.  The creation of Upper and Lower Canada allowed most Loyalists to live under British laws and institutions, while the French-speaking population of Lower Canada could maintain their familiar French civil law and the Catholic religion.&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;uelac.org&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact was that the two peoples simply could not co-exist{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}. Therefore, Governor Haldimand (at the suggestion of Carleton) drew Loyalists away from [[Quebec City]] and [[Montreal]] by offering free land on the northern shore of Lake Ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to George III. The Loyalists were thus given land grants of {{convert|200|acre|ha|0}} per person. Basically, this approach was designed with the intent of keeping French and English as far apart as possible. Therefore, after the separation of the Province of Quebec, [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] were formed, each with its own government.&lt;ref name=&quot;W.J.Eccles France in America p.246&quot;/&gt;

===''Patriotes''' Rebellion in Lower Canada===
{{Main|Lower Canada Rebellion}}
[[File:Assemblée des six-comtés painting.jpg|thumb|Painting of the [[Assembly of the Six Counties]]]]
In 1837, residents of Lower Canada – led by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]] — formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to the unilateral control of the British governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SWiSH v2.0 |url=http://cgi2.cvm.qc.ca/glaporte/1837.pl?cat=ptype&amp;cherche=DOCUMENT |title=Les Patriotes de 1837@1838 |publisher=Cgi2.cvm.qc.ca |accessdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a Declaration of Rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination and a Declaration of Independence of Lower-Canada in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_Lower_Canada|title=Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada|author=Nelson, Robert|publisher=Wikisource|date=written in February 1838|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their actions resulted in rebellions in both Lower and [[Upper Canada]]. An unprepared [[British Army]] had to raise [[militia]] force; the rebel forces scored a victory in [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1837)|Saint-Denis]] but were soon defeated. The British army burned the Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Quebec|St-Eustache]], killing the rebels who were hiding within it. The bullet and cannonball marks on the walls of the church are still visible to this day.
[[File:Battle of Saint-Denis.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1837)|battle of Saint-Denis]] ]]
After the rebellions, [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was asked to undertake a study and prepare a [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|report]] on the matter and to offer a solution for the British Parliament to assess.&lt;ref name=&quot;durham&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=37606&amp;PHPSESSID=qj23a0tmehl1lulfrlfrhk0c53|title=LAMBTON, JOHN GEORGE, 1st Earl of Durham|author=Ouellet, Fernand|publisher=Government of Canada |work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report recommended that the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada be united, and that the French-speaking population of Lower Canada be assimilated into British culture. Durham's second recommendation was the implementation of [[responsible government]] across the colonies. Following Durham's [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|Report]],&lt;ref name=&quot;durham&quot; /&gt; the British government merged the two colonial provinces into one [[Province of Canada]] in 1840 with the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actunion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000029|title=Act of Union|author=Monet, Jacques|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the political union proved contentious. Reformers in both Canada West (formerly Upper Canada) and Canada East (formerly Lower Canada) worked to repeal limitations on the use of the French language in the Legislature. The two colonies remained distinct in administration, election, and law.

In 1848, Baldwin and LaFontaine, allies and leaders of the Reformist party, were asked by [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] to form an administration together under the new policy of [[responsible government]]. The French language subsequently regained legal status in the Legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;actunion&quot; /&gt;

===Canadian Confederation===
{{main|Canadian Confederation}}
In the 1860s, the delegates from the colonies of [[British North America]] (Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland) met in a series of conferences to discuss self-governing status for a new confederation. The first [[Charlottetown Conference]] took place in [[Charlottetown]], Prince Edward Island, followed by the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] in Quebec City which led to a delegation going to London, Britain, to put forth a proposal for a national union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WAITE|first=P.B.|title=Canadian confederation|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001842|work=history of the formation of the Confederation|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of those deliberations, in 1867 the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed the [[British North America Act]], providing for the Confederation of most of these provinces. The former [[Province of Canada]] was divided into its two previous parts as the provinces of [[Ontario]] (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada). [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] joined Ontario and Quebec in the new [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The other provinces then joined the Confederation, one after the other: [[Manitoba]] and the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1870, [[British Columbia]] in 1871, [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1873, [[Yukon]] in 1898, [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in 1905, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in 1949 and finally [[Nunavut]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Library and Archives Canada|title=Canadian Confederation|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-3000-e.html|work=List of the Provinces and Territories and their joining dates|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quiet Revolution was a period of dramatic social and political change&lt;ref name=&quot;short history&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= 372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that saw the decline of Anglo supremacy in the Quebec economy, the decline of the Roman Catholic Church's influence,&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown1&quot;/&gt; the [[nationalization]] of [[hydro-electric]] companies under [[Hydro-Québec]]&lt;ref name=&quot;short history&quot; /&gt; and the emergence of a [[Quebec sovereignty movement|pro-sovereignty movement]] under former Liberal minister [[René Lévesque]].

During the Quiet Revolution, the government of Quebec invested heavily in the province's industries, in an attempt to modernize the economy and to encourage the development of francophone businesses. It was during this period that the government established the [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]], the [[Régie des rentes]] and the [[Société générale de financement]] to promote the development of the industries in Quebec. In 1961, the [[Conseil d’orientation économique]] was established to promote economic growth of the regions of Quebec, growth which was once heavily funded by the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutiontranquille.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=16|title=La création d’une économie moderne|publisher=Gouvernement du Québec|accessdate=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Quiet Revolution, Quebecers affirmed their identity, especially in the arts, culture and language. It was during the revolution that the government of Quebec formed the Ministry of Culture which focused mainly on defending the French language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutiontranquille.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=15 |title=La promotion de la culture et de la langue|publisher=Gouvernement du Québec|accessdate=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation of Quebec was also marked by the adoption of the Law on the assurance-hospitalisation, guaranteeing [[universal health care]] through a tax-funded public delivery system. In 1964, Quebec had recognized the equality between men and women and allows all women to have jobs which were once exclusively for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutiontranquille.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=14|title=Le développement du système social|publisher=Gouvernement du Québec|accessdate=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of Premier Robert Bourassa, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] invoked the [[War Measures Act]]. In addition, the Quebec [[Ombudsman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protecteurducitoyen.qc.ca/en/index.asp |title=Le Protecteur du citoyen |publisher=Protecteurducitoyen.qc.ca |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Marceau was instructed to hear complaints of detainees and the Quebec government agreed to pay damages to any person unjustly arrested (only in Quebec). On February 3, 1971, [[John Turner]], the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice of Canada]], reported that 497 persons had been arrested throughout Canada under the War Measures Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/octobercrisis/a/octobercrisistl.htm|author=Munroe, Susan|title=October Crisis Timeline|publisher=Canada Online|accessdate=January 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; of whom 435 had been released. The other 62 were charged, of whom 32 committed crimes of such seriousness that a [[Quebec Superior Court]] judge refused them bail. The crisis ended a few weeks after the death of Pierre Laporte at the hands of his captors. The fallout of the crisis marked the zenith and twilight of the FLQ which lost membership and public support.

===Oka Crisis===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
The [[Oka Crisis]] was a [[land dispute]] between a group of [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] people and the town of [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]] which began on July 11, 1990 and lasted until September 26, 1990. One person died as a result. The dispute was the first well-publicized violent conflict between [[First Nations]] and the Quebec government in the late 20th century. The crisis developed from a local dispute between the town of Oka and the Mohawk community of Kanesatake. The town of Oka was developing plans to expand a golf course and residential development onto land which had traditionally been used by the Mohawk. It included pineland and a burial ground, marked by standing tombstones of their ancestors. The Mohawks had filed a land claim for the sacred grove and burial ground near [[Kanesatake]], but their claim had been rejected in 1986.
On August 8, Quebec premier Robert Bourassa had announced at a press conference that he had invoked Section 275 of the [[National Defence Act]] to requisition military support in &quot;aid of the civil power&quot;, a right available to provincial governments. Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] was reluctant to have the federal government and, in particular, the army, so involved. Under the act however, the solicitor general of the province, under direction from Premier [[Robert Bourassa]], had the right to requisition the armed forces to maintain law and order as a provincial responsibility; this move had precedent in Canada, including two decades earlier during the October Crisis.

===Parti Québécois and national unity===
{{main|Parti Québécois|Quebec sovereignty movement}}
In 1977, the newly elected [[Parti Québécois]] government of [[René Lévesque]] introduced the [[Charter of the French Language]]. Often known as [[Bill 101]], it defined French as the only official language of Quebec in areas of provincial jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/preamble.html The Charter of the French Language – Preamble]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}, on the Web site of the ''Office québécois de la langue française'', Retrieved April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lévesque and his party had run in the 1970 and 1973 Quebec elections under a platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. The party failed to win control of Quebec's National Assembly both times – though its share of the vote increased from 23 percent to 30 percent – and Lévesque was defeated both times in the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] he contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=COMEAU|first=ROMBERT|title=Parti Québécois|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0006123|work=History and Achievements|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1976 election, he softened his message by promising a referendum (plebiscite) on [[sovereignty-association]] rather than outright separation, by which Quebec would have independence in most government functions but share some other ones, such as a common currency, with Canada. On November 15, 1976, Lévesque and the Parti Québécois won control of the provincial government for the first time. The question of [[sovereignty-association]] was placed before the voters in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. During the campaign, [[Pierre Trudeau]] promised that a vote for the &quot;no&quot; side was a vote for reforming Canada. Trudeau advocated the [[patriation]] of Canada's Constitution from the United Kingdom. The existing constitutional document, the [[British North America Act]], could only be amended by the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] upon a request by the Canadian parliament.
[[File:Rene Levesque - election 1973 - LAC PA115039.jpg|thumb|left|[[René Lévesque]] in Paul Sauvé arena, Montreal, on the 1973 election night]] &lt;!---------DO NOT COPY OR MOVE THIS PICTURE TO ANOTHER SECTION, THIS PICTURE IS A NON-FREE HISTORIC IMAGE-----------&gt;
Sixty percent of the Quebec electorate voted against the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1980 Quebec Referendum|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/constitution/topics/1092-6040/|work=Facts and results|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation – CBC|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of English and immigrant Quebeckers voted against, and that French Quebeckers were almost equally divided, with older voters less in favour and younger voters more in favour. After his loss in the referendum, Lévesque went back to Ottawa to start negotiating a new constitution with Trudeau, his minister of Justice [[Jean Chrétien]] and the nine other provincial premiers. Lévesque insisted Quebec be able to veto any future constitutional amendments. The negotiations quickly reached a stand-still.

Then on the night of November 4, 1981, (widely known in Quebec as ''La nuit des longs couteaux'' and in the rest of Canada as the [[Patriation#The Kitchen Accord Controversy|&quot;Kitchen Accord&quot;]]) Federal Justice Minister Jean Chrétien&lt;!--not PM Trudeau, as erroneously reported here before. PM Trudeau had simply pointed out to the provinces that had held out with Lévesque that he had been individually negotiating with Lévesque, against the terms of the agreement between all the hold-out provinces--&gt; met with all of the provincial premiers except [[René Lévesque]] to sign the document that would eventually become the new Canadian constitution. The next morning, they presented the &quot;fait accompli&quot; to Lévesque. Lévesque refused to sign the document and returned to Quebec. In 1982, Trudeau had the new constitution approved by the British Parliament, with Quebec's signature still missing (a situation that persists to this day). The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed Trudeau's assertion that every province's approval is not required to amend the constitution. Quebec is the only province not to have assented to the [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001869|title=Constitution, Patriation of|last=Sheppard|first=Robert|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years, two attempts were made to gain Quebec's approval of the constitution. The first was the [[Meech Lake Accord]] of 1987, which was finally abandoned in 1990 when the province of [[Manitoba]] did not pass it within the established deadline. ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] premier [[Clyde Wells]] had expressed his opposition to the accord, but, with the failure in Manitoba, the vote for or against Meech never took place in his province.) This led to the formation of the sovereignist [[Bloc Québécois]] party in Ottawa under the leadership of [[Lucien Bouchard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BUSTA &amp; HUI, Ann|first=Shannon|title=Bloc Québécois through the years|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/bloc-qubcois-through-the-years/article2008669/|work=Timeline|location=Canada |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had resigned from the federal cabinet. The second attempt, the [[Charlottetown Accord]] of 1992, was rejected by 56.7 percent of all Canadians and 57 percent of Quebeckers. This result caused a split in the [[Parti libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party]] that led to the formation of the new [[Action démocratique du Québec|Action démocratique]] (Democratic Action) party led by [[Mario Dumont]] and [[Jean Allaire]].
[[File:Référendum 1995.PNG|thumb|left|The results of the 1995 Quebec referendum per circonscription. Dark brown means high no %; Dark blue means high yes %]]
On October 30, 1995, with the [[Parti Québécois]] back in power since 1994, a [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]] on sovereignty took place. This time, it was rejected by a slim majority (50.6 percent NO to 49.4 percent YES).&lt;ref name=&quot;1995 facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Directeur général des élections du Québec|title=Référendum de 1995|url=http://www.quebecpolitique.com/elections-et-referendums/referendums-quebecois/referendum-de-1995/|work=Information and results|publisher=Quebec Politic|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was enshrouded in controversy. Federalists complained that an unusually high number of ballots had been rejected in pro-federalist areas, notably in the largely Jewish and Greek riding of [[Chomedey (electoral district)|Chomedey]] (11.7 percent or 5,500 of its ballots were spoiled, compared to 750 or 1.7 percent in the general election of 1994) although Quebec's chief electoral officer found no evidence of outright fraud. Moreover, this accusation had been brought despite the fact that only 1.82% of total votes were rejected on a total participation rate of 93,5%&lt;ref name=&quot;1995 facts&quot; /&gt; which is lower than the normal rejection rate. The federal government was accused of not respecting provincial laws with regard to spending during referendums (leading to a [[Sponsorship Scandal|corruption scandal]] that would become public a decade later, greatly damaging the Liberal Party's standing), and of having accelerated the naturalization of immigrants in Quebec before the referendum in order that they could vote, as naturalized citizens were believed more likely to vote no. (43,850 immigrants were naturalized in 1995, whereas the average number between 1988 and 1998 was 21,733.){{Citation needed|Important|date=June 2011}}

The same night of the referendum, an angry [[Jacques Parizeau]], then premier and leader of the &quot;Yes&quot; side, declared that the loss was because of &quot;[[Money and the ethnic vote]]&quot;. Parizeau resigned over public outrage and as per his commitment to do so in case of a loss. [[Lucien Bouchard]] became Quebec's new premier in his place.

Federalists accused the sovereignist side of asking a vague, overly complicated question on the ballot. Its English text read as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Do you agree that Québec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Québec and of the agreement signed on June 12,&amp;nbsp;1995?''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After winning the next election in 1998, Bouchard retired from politics in 2001. [[Bernard Landry]] was then appointed leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] and [[premier of Quebec]]. In 2003, Landry lost the election to the [[Parti Libéral du Québec|Quebec Liberal Party]] and [[Jean Charest]]. Landry stepped down as PQ leader in 2005, and in a crowded race for the party leadership, [[André Boisclair]] was elected to succeed him. He also resigned after the renewal of the Quebec Liberal Party's government in the [[2007 Quebec election|2007 general election]] and the Parti Québécois becoming the second opposition party, behind the Action Démocratique. The PQ has promised to hold another referendum should it return to government.

===''Statut particulier'' (&quot;special status&quot;)===
[[File:Robert-Bourassa.jpg|thumb|In a speech delivered on June 22, 1990, in the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] following the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]], [[Robert Bourassa]] stated, &quot;English Canada must understand very clearly that, no matter what anyone says and no matter what anyone does, Quebec is, today and forever, a distinct society, free and capable of assuming its destiny and development. Thank you.&quot;]]
Given the province's heritage and the preponderance of French (unique among the Canadian provinces), there is an ongoing debate in Canada regarding the unique status (''statut particulier'') of Quebec and its people, wholly or partially. Prior attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to acknowledge Quebec as a '[[distinct society]]' – referring to the province's uniqueness within Canada regarding law, language, and culture – have been unsuccessful; however, the federal government under Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] would later endorse recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Law Group, ''Canadian Constitutional Law'', Third Edition, Toronto: Edmond Montgomery Publications Limited, p. 1261.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2003, the National Assembly of Quebec voted unanimously to affirm &quot;that the people of Québec form a nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saic.gouv.qc.ca/publications/resolutions/20031030_en.pdf Resolution by the National Assembly of Québec, October 30, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 27, 2006, the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] passed a [[Québécois nation motion|symbolic motion]] moved by Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] declaring &quot;that this House recognize that the [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] form a nation within a united Canada.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2544166&amp;File=0&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Pub=hansard&amp;Ses=1#SOB-1798651 Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061128.wnation28/BNStory/National/home |author=Galloway, Gloria; Curry, Bill; Dobrota, Alex |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |title='Nation' motion passes, but costs Harper |date=November 28, 2006 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20061127.wchong1127/BNStory/National |author=Bonoguore, Tenille; Sallot, Jeff; |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |title=Harper's Quebec motion passes easily |date=November 27, 2006 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is considerable debate and uncertainty over what this means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parliament39/motion-quebecnation.html| title = Debate: The motions on the Québécois nation | publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=November 24, 2006 | accessdate =August 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/12/19/harper-motion.html?ref=rss | title = Who's a Québécois?

At present, [[Quebec nationalism|nationalism]] plays a large role in the politics of Quebec, with all three major provincial political parties seeking greater autonomy and recognition of Quebec's unique status. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to examining and defining the nature of Quebec's association with the rest of Canada.

In the most recent poll (January 2012) 43% of Quebeckers supported separation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledevoir.com/politique/quebec/341333/sondage-leger-marketing-le-devoir-the-gazette-une-victoire-morale-pour-pauline-marois Sondage Léger Marketing-Le Devoir-The Gazette – Une victoire morale pour Pauline Marois]. (''in French''). ''Le Devoir'', January 28, 2012. Retrieved March 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, a minority of 39.9 percent of Quebeckers supported separation and a majority of 52.8 percent opposed separation, with 7.3 percent undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ELIZABETH THOMPSON |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/04/06/13489151-qmi.html |title=Canadians answer opinion poll on Quebec separatism |work=Toronto Sun |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Quebeckers who support separatism has remained relatively stable since the year 2000, hovering around at roughly 38–43 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Autos/20051022/quebec_referendum_poll_051022/ |title=Quebec divided on question of separation: poll&amp;nbsp;— CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a decline in support after the failed 1995 referendum, where voter support for separation was at 49.4 percent.

Since the 1960s, the proportion of Francophones who call themselves Quebecer rather than Canadian or French-Canadians has risen steadily: it increased from 21% in 1966 to 67% in 2007. Two polls realized by the [[Association for Canadian Studies]] (ACS), show that young Quebecers aged between 18-24, would vote &quot;yes&quot; at 58% to a referendum on Quebec independence. Quebecers aged between 25-34, 35-44 and 45–54 years old, the rate ranges between 69% to 78%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/quebec-canada/politique-quebecoise/201204/07/01-4513357-souverainete-quebecois-dabord.php|title=Souveraineté: Québécois d'abord|publisher=Ctv.ca |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a recent poll realized by [[Global News]] and [[Postmedia News]], about 49% of Canadian are little concerned about a possible separation of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvanouvelles.ca/lcn/infos/national/archives/2012/06/20120629-215404.html |title=49% des Canadiens indifférents à la séparation du Québec|publisher=LCN |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a recent poll realized by [[Abacus Data]], about 26% of Canadian would be willing to vote for the expulsion of Quebec in the federation if we gave them a chance to vote in a referendum. 52% would vote against and 22% of respondents do not know which way they would vote. Approximately 36% of Albertan would vote YES in a refenredum for the secession of Quebec, while the Ontarian would vote NO by 56%. Approximly 88% of Canadian said all provinces &quot;should be treated equally, even if this may offend the province of Quebec and cause a risk of separation&quot;. Only 12% of people would agreed to do everything in its power to keep Quebec within Canada, even if this requires a special status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/elections-quebec-2012/201208/14/01-4564950-les-canadiens-hors-quebec-disent-non-a-de-nouveaux-compromis.php|title=Les Canadiens hors Québec disent &quot;non&quot; à de nouveaux compromis|publisher=La Presse|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expert from the [[Fraser Institute]] had declared recently, that the separation of Quebec would be better for the economy of Quebec and the economy of Canada. Twenty years ago, the same institute had declared the separation of Quebec would hurt the economy in Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;économie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argent.canoe.ca/lca/affaires/quebec/archives/2012/06/souverainete-mauvaise-Quebec.html|title=La souveraineté ne serait pas &quot; mauvaise &quot; pour le Québec|publisher=LCN |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Robert Laplante from the Institut de recherche en économie contemporaine (IREC), said the Canadian federation is very far from helping the economy of Quebec. He said that even the province of [[Ontario]] could benefit a better economy if separated from Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;économie&quot;/&gt;

The 2006 census counted a total aboriginal population of 108,425 (1.5 percent) including 65,085 [[First Nations|North American Indians]] (0.9 percent), 27,985 [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] (0.4 percent), and 10,950 [[Inuit]] (0.15 percent). It should be noted however, that there is a significant undercount, as many of the biggest Indian bands regularly refuse to participate in Canadian censuses for political reasons regarding the question of aboriginal sovereignty. In particular, the largest [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Iroquois]] reserves ([[Kahnawake]], [[Akwesasne]] and [[Kanesatake]]) were not counted.

Nearly 9 percent of the population of Quebec belongs to a [[visible minority]] group. This is a lower percentage than that of [[British Columbia]], Ontario, [[Alberta]], and [[Manitoba]] but higher than that of the other five provinces. Most visible minorities in Quebec live in or near [[Montreal]].

Quebec is unique among the provinces in its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic population. This is a legacy of colonial times when only Roman Catholics were permitted to settle in [[New France]]. The 2001 census showed the population to be 90.3 percent Christian (in contrast to 77 percent for the whole country) with 83.4 percent [[Catholic|Catholic Christian]] (including 83.2 percent Roman Catholic); 4.7 percent [[Protestant|Protestant Christian]] (including 1.2 percent [[Anglican]], 0.7 percent [[United Church of Canada|United Church]]; and 0.5 percent [[Baptist]]); 1.4 percent [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox Christian]] (including 0.7 percent [[Greek Orthodox]]); and 0.8 percent other Christian; as well as 1.5 percent Muslim; 1.3 percent Jewish; 0.6 percent [[Buddhist]]; 0.3 percent [[Hindu]]; and 0.1 percent [[Sikh]]. An additional 5.8 percent of the population said they had no religious affiliation (including 5.6 percent who stated that they had no religion at all).&lt;br /&gt;

A considerable number of Quebec residents consider themselves to be [[bilingual]] (having a knowledge of French and English). In Quebec, about 40.6 percent (3,017,860) of the population are bilingual; on the island of Montreal, this proportion reaches 60.0 percent (1,020,760). Quebec has the highest proportion of bilinguals of any Canadian province. In contrast, in the [[rest of Canada]], only about 10.2 percent (2,430,990) of the population has a knowledge of both of the country's official languages.

This law has been the subject of periodic controversy since its inception. The written forms of French place-names in Canada retain their [[French orthography#Diacritics|diacritics]] such as accent marks over vowels in English text. Legitimate exceptions are '''Montreal''' and '''Quebec'''. However, the accented forms are increasingly evident in some publications. The ''Canadian Style'' states that '''Montréal''' and '''Québec''' (the city) must retain their accents in English federal documents.

Of the population of 7,546,131 counted by the 2006 census, 7,435,905 people completed the section about language. Of these, 7,339,495 gave singular responses to the question regarding their [[first language]]. The languages most commonly reported were the following:

{{Main|Economy of Quebec}}

Quebec has an [[Developed country|advanced]], [[market economy|market-based]], and [[open economy]]. In 2009, its gross domestic product (GDP) of US$ 32,408 per capita at [[purchasing power parity]] puts the province at par with Japan, Italy and Spain, but remains lower than the Canadian average of US$ 37,830 per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ISQ|2011|p=43|id=ISQ2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found}} The economy of Quebec is ranked the 37th largest economy in the world just behind [[Greece]] and 28th for the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/salle-presse/communiq/2005/mars/mars0516a.htm|publisher=Gouv.qc.ca |title=Government Statistics |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/economie/?lang=fr |title=Le Québec : une économie dynamique |publisher=Government of Quebec |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Montreal Twilight Panorama 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|View of [[Montreal]] from the Mont-Royal belvedere]]  The economy of Quebec represents 20.36% of the [[List of Canadian provinces and territories by gross domestic product|total GDP of Canada]]. Like most industrialized countries, the economy of Quebec is based mainly on the [[services sector]]. Quebec's economy has traditionally been fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and average productivity. The provincial GDP in 2010 was C$ 319,348 billion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Grossdomestic2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/econ15-eng.htm |title=Gross domestic product, expenditure-based, by province and territory |author=Statistics Canada|publisher=Government of Canada |date=November 4, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes Quebec the second largest economy in Canada.

Following these agreements, trade relations with other countries were boosted. As a result, Quebec has seen its exports increase significantly. These international trade contribute to the strength of the Quebec economy, especially concerning employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Export-Import&quot;/&gt;

In 2010, Quebec exports declined by 0.6% compared to previous years. Exports to the United States have remained fairly stable while those to Europe surged by 46.3% and sales to Asia were down 12.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledevoir.com/economie/actualites-economiques/317424/quebec-legere-baisse-des-exportations-en-2010|title= Québec: légère baisse des exportations en 2010|work=Le Devoir |location=Canada  |year=2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unemployment rate in Quebec is around 7%.

Quebec is remarkable for the natural resources of its vast territory. It has about 30 mines, 158 exploration companies and fifteen primary processing industries. Many metallic minerals are exploited, the principals are gold, iron, copper and [[zinc]]. Many other substances are extracted including [[titanium]], [[asbestos]], silver, [[magnesium]], nickel and many other metals and industrial minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Québec |work=Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune |url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/mines/industrie/industrie-substances.jsp |title=Substances exploitées au Québec |accessdate=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 40% of the mineral potential of Quebec is currently known.

Tourism plays an important role in the economy of Quebec. Tourism represents 2.5% of Quebec's GDP and nearly 400,000 people are employed in the tourism sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourisme&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tourisme.gouv.qc.ca/publications/media/document/etudes-statistiques/Tourisme-chiffres2010.pdf|title=Le tourisme en chiffres édition 2010|publisher=Gouvernement du Québec |date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=April 1, 2011|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 30,000 businesses are related to this industry, of which 70% are located outside of [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/tourisme/?lang=fr|title=Tourisme au Québec|publisher=Gouv.qc.ca |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Quebec welcomed 26 million foreign tourists, most of them from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, [[Mexico]] and Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourisme&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/referenc/qcem/qcem_eco_tou.htm|title=TOURISTES97 ET DÉPENSES DES TOURISTES, 2008|publisher=Gouv.qc.ca |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of Quebec has 22 tourist regions, each of which presents its geography, its history and culture. The capital, Quebec City, is the only [[fortified city]] in North America and has its own European cachet. The oldest Francophone city in North America, Quebec City was named a World Heritage Site by [[UNESCO]] in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/300|title=Arrondissement historique du Vieux-Québec|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2008. Montreal is the only Francophone metropolis in North America and also the second largest Francophone city after Paris in terms of population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourquebec.com/ca-en/villesmontreal0.html|title=Montréal: City of festivals|publisher=bonjourquebec|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This major centre of 3.6 million inhabitants is a tapestry of cultures from the world over with its many neighbourhoods, including Chinatown, the Latin Quarter, the Gay Village, Little Italy, Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, the Quartier International and Old Montreal. Montreal has a rich architectural heritage, along with many cultural activities, sports events and festivals.

The province of Quebec has over 400 museums including the [[Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal]], which is the oldest museum in Canada and one of the most important art institutions. It is Montreal's largest museum and is amongst the most prominent in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bonjourquebec.com/ca-en/musees0.html|title=Museums and heritage sites The past is alive and well!|publisher=bonjourquebec|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2009, Premier Jean Charest had announced targets for reducing [[greenhouse gases]] during the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]]. Quebec will cut its emissions by 20% by the year 2020 compared to international reference of 1990. On January 14, 2010, a new law came into force to reduce greenhouse gases from automobiles which represent 40% of Quebec GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/environnement/200912/29/01-934788-ges-le-quebec-sera-aussi-severe-que-la-californie-a-la-mi-janvier.php |title=Lise Millette : GES: le Québec sera aussi sévère que la Californie à la mi-janvier &amp;#124; Environnement |publisher=Cyberpresse.ca |accessdate=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new law stipulates that car manufacturers serving the territory of Quebec must meet an emission ceiling of 187&amp;nbsp;grams of GHG/km or approximatively 7.7 L/100&amp;nbsp;km.

===Fundamental values of Quebec society===
On February 8, 2007, Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]] announced the setting up of a ''[[Bouchard-Taylor Commission|Commission tasked with consulting Quebec Society on the matter of arrangements regarding cultural diversity]]''. The Premier's press release&lt;ref name=&quot;d’étude&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.qc.ca/actualites/communiques/2007/fevrier/2007-02-08.asp|title=Le premier ministre énonce sa vision et crée une commission spéciale d’étude|author=Office of the Premier|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=February 8, 2007|accessdate=July 7, 2011|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; reasserted the three fundamental values of Quebec society:
{{quote|Equality between men and women, primacy of the French language, and [[separation of church and state]] constitute the fundamental values. They are not subject to any arrangement. They cannot be subordinated by any other principle.&lt;ref name=&quot;d’étude&quot;/&gt;}}

Furthermore, Quebec is a free and democratic society that abides by the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/gouv/societedroit/?lang=en|title=The Rule of Law|author=Quebec Portal|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=August 5, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quebec society bases its cohesion and specificity on a set of statements, a few notable examples of which include:

* The ''[[Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdpdj.qc.ca/en/commun/docs/charter.pdf |title=CHARTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM|author=Ministry of Justice of Quebec|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Music of Quebec|Dance of Quebec}}
[[File:Félix Leclerc.jpg|170px| thumb | left | Félix Leclerc]]
Being a modern cosmopolitan society, today, all types of music can be found in Quebec. From [[folk music]] to [[hip-hop]], music has always played an important role in Quebercers culture. From [[La Bolduc]] in 1920s–1930s to the contemporary artists, the music in Quebec has announced multiple songwriters and performers, pop singers and crooners, music groups and many more. Here are photos of two of Quebec's most popular artists of the last century: the singers [[Félix Leclerc]] (1950s) and [[Céline Dion]] (present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repertoiredesartistesquebecois.org/index2.asp|title=Répertoire des artistes québécois|author=Donald Loignon|publisher=DLP multimédia|accessdate=July 6, 2011|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Nations]] and the [[Inuit]] of Quebec also have their own traditional music.
[[File:Celine Dion Concert Singing 'Taking Chances' 2008.jpg|thumb | 200px | Celine Dion during her concert Taking Chances in 2008]]
From Quebec's musical repertoire, the song ''A La Claire Fontaine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000031|title=À la claire fontaine|author=Plouffe, Hélène|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the anthem of the [[New France]], Patriots and [[French Canadian]], then replaced by the ''[[O Canada]]''. Currently, the song ''[[Gens du pays]]'' is by far preferred by many Quebecers to be the national anthem of Quebec. The [[ADISQ|Association québécoise de l'industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidéo]] (ADISQ) was created in 1978 to promote the music industry in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adisq.com/assoc-profil.html |title=Notre raison d’être, c’est la musique de votre quotidien |author=ADISQ |publisher=Association québécoise de l’industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidéo|accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orchestre symphonique de Québec]] and the [[Orchestre symphonique de Montréal]] are respectively associated with the Opéra de Québec and the Opéra de Montreal whose performances are presented at the [[Grand Théâtre de Québec]] and at [[Place des Arts]]. The ''Ballets Jazz de Montreal'', the ''Grands Ballets'' and [[La La La Human Steps]] are three important professional troups of [[contemporary dance]].

Various musical events are held throughout Quebec, such as the [[Festival d'été de Québec]], the ''Emerging Music Festival'' of [[Rouyn-Noranda]], ''Festival en chanson de Petite-Vallée'', the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], the ''Granby International Song Festival'', the ''International Festival of Rhythms of the World'' in Saguenay, the [[Festival Western de Saint-Tite]], the [[Les FrancoFolies de Montréal|Montreal FrancoFolies festival]], the [[Mondial des Cultures]] of Drummondville, the White Nights of Anse de Roche, [[Woodstock en Beauce]], etc. Other festivals join music to fireworks, such as Grand Feux Loto-Québec at the [[Montmorency Falls]], Quebec City, the [[L'International des Feux Loto-Québec|International Loto-Québec Firework]] at amusement park [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]], Montreal, or the ''Grands Feux du Casino'' in the park of Lac-Leamy in Gatineau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quebecgetaways.com/events-festivals|title=Quebec festivals website|author=Festivals et Évenement Québec|publisher=Société des Attractions Touristiques du Québec and Festivals et Événements Québec|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional music is imbued with many dances, such as the [[jig]], the [[quadrille]], the [[Reel (dance)|reel]] and [[line dancing]], which developed in the festivities since the early days of colonization. Various instruments are more popular in Quebec's culture: harmonica (music-of-mouth or lip-destruction), [[fiddle]], [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoons]], [[jaw harp]] and [[accordion]]. The ''podorythmie'' is a characteristic of traditional Quebec music and means giving the rhythm with the feet. Quebec traditional music is currently provided by various contemporary groups seen mostly during Christmas and New Year's Eve celebrations, [[National Holiday (Quebec)|Quebec National Holiday]] and many local festivals.

===Literature and theatre===
{{Main| Literature of Quebec}}
[[File:Lachassegalerie.jpg| thumb| [[Henri Julien]], ''La Chasse-galerie'']]
From New France, Quebec literature was first developed in the travel accounts of explorers such as [[Jacques Cartier]], [[Jean de Brébeuf]], the [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Baron de La Hontan]] and [[Nicolas Perrot]], describing their relations with indigenous peoples. The ''Moulin à paroles'' traces the great texts that have shaped the history of Quebec since its foundation in 1534 until the era of modernity. The first to write the history of Quebec, since its discovery, was the historian [[François-Xavier Garneau]]. This author will be part of the current of patriotic literature (also known as the &quot;poets of the country&quot; and literary identity) that will arise after the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Patriots Rebellion]] of 1837–1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litterature-quebecoise.org/patriote.htm |title=Littérature patriotique du Québec |publisher=Litterature-quebecoise.org |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various tales and stories are told through oral tradition, such as, among many more, the legends of the ''[[Bogeyman]]'', the ''[[Chasse-galerie]]'', the ''Black Horse of Trois-Pistoles'', the ''Complainte de Cadieux'', the ''[[Marie-Josephte Corriveau|Corriveau]]'', the ''dancing devil of Saint-Ambroise'', the ''[[Edouard Beaupré|Giant Beaupré]]'', the ''monsters of the lakes [[Lake Pohenegamook|Pohénégamook]]'' and ''[[Lake Memphremagog|Memphremagog]]'', of ''[[Quebec Bridge]]'' (called the Devil's Bridge), the ''[[Rocher Percé]]'' and of ''Rose Latulipe'', for example.{{sfn |Dupont|2008}}

The [[American Literary Regionalism|regional novel]] from Quebec is called ''Terroir'' novel and is a literary tradition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litterature-quebecoise.org/terroir.htm |title=Littérature du terroir québécois |publisher=Litterature-quebecoise.org |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; specific to the province. It includes such works as ''The Old Canadians'', ''[[Maria Chapdelaine]]'', ''[[Séraphin: un homme et son péché|Un homme et son péché]]'', ''Le Survenant'', etc. There are also many successful plays from this literary category, such as ''[[Les Belles-sœurs]]'' and ''Broue (Brew)''.

Among the theatre troupes are the [[Jean Duceppe|Compagnie Jean-Duceppe]], the ''Théâtre La Rubrique'' at the Pierrette-Gaudreault venue of the Institut of arts in Saguenay, the Théâtre Le Grenier, etc. In addition to the network of cultural centres in Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quebecvacances.com/centre-culturel |title=Centres culturels au Québec |publisher=Quebecvacances.com |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; the venues include the [[Monument-National]] and the ''Rideau Vert'' (green curtain) Theatre in [[Montreal]], the ''Trident'' Theatre in [[Quebec City]], etc. The [[National Theatre School of Canada]] and the [[Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec]] form the future players. The summer theatre is a true symbol of Quebec literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandquebec.com/theatres-du-quebec/theatres-d-ete |title=Théâtres d'été |publisher=Grand Québec |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guideofficiel.ca/#acc |author=Provencher, Mario |title=Guide officiel du théâtre d'été |publisher=GuideOfficiel.ca |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented in the summer, it offers a variety of amusements, usually musicals or humorous dramas, sometimes outdoors, in rural and semi-rural regions of Quebec, in venues such as the theatre of ''la Dame de Cœur'' (the Lady of Heart) in [[Upton, Quebec|Upton]], [[Montérégie]], the ''Grands Chênes'' (Great Oaks) Theatre in [[Kingsey Falls]], [[Centre-du-Québec]] and the theatre of ''la Marjolaine'' in [[Eastmain, Quebec|Eastmain]], [[Estrie]]. The Quebec Theatre Academy and the Quebec Association of Playwrights (AQAD) are the main organizations for the promotion of literature and theatre in Quebec. The Quebec literary awards, including the Medal of the [[Académie des lettres du Québec]], and the ''Soirée des Masques'' reward the important personalities of the year.

===Fine arts===
[[File:Daudelin-Cavalière-Québec.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Charles Daudelin]], ''La Cavalière'', 1963, Sculpture installed in front of the pavilion Gérard Morisset of the Quebec National Museum of Fine Arts in [[Quebec City]]]]
First influenced, since the days of New France, by the religious cult of Catholicism, with works from ''Frère Luc'' (Brother Luke) and more recently from [[Ozias Leduc]] and [[Guido Nincheri]], art of Quebec has developed around the specific characteristics of its landscapes and cultural, historical, social and political representations.&lt;ref&gt;''Art History in Quebec'', La collection du Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, 2004, 268 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the development of Quebec masterpieces in painting, printmaking and sculpture is marked by the contribution of artists such as [[Louis-Philippe Hébert]], [[Cornelius Krieghoff]], [[Alfred Laliberté]], [[Marc-Aurèle Fortin]], [[Marc-Aurèle de Foy Suzor-Coté]], [[Jean-Paul Lemieux]], [[Clarence Gagnon]], Adrien Dufresne, [[Alfred Pellan]], Jean-Philippe Dallaire, [[Charles Daudelin]], [[Arthur Villeneuve]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[Paul-Émile Borduas]] and [[Marcelle Ferron]].

The [[Fine art]]s of Quebec are displayed at the [[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec|Quebec National Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal|Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art]], the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]], the Quebec ''Salon des métiers d'art'' and in many art galleries. While many works decorate the public areas of Quebec, others are displayed in foreign countries such as the sculpture ''Embâcle'' (Jam) by Charles Daudelin on ''Québec Place'' in Paris and the statue ''Québec Libre!'' (free Quebec!) by [[Armand Vaillancourt]] in San Francisco.
The [[École des Beaux-Arts de Montréal|Montreal School of Fine Arts]] forms the [[List of Canadian artists|painters, printmakers and sculptors of Quebec]].

Various buildings reflect the architectural heritage that characterizes Quebec, such as religious buildings, city halls, houses of estates, etc.

===Humor and youth programs===
{{Main|Humor in Quebec|List of French-language Canadian television series}}

===Circus and street art===
[[File:Dralion-Vienna.jpg|thumbnail | The show ''Dralion'', Cirque du Soleil, introduced in 2004]]
Several circus troupes were created in recent decades, the most important being without any doubt the [[Cirque du Soleil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cirque du Soleil Inc.|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Cirque-du-Soleil-Inc-Company-History.html|author=Cirque du Soleil |work=Company history|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these troops are contemporary, travelling and on-horseback circuses, such as [[Les 7 Doigts de la Main]], [[Cirque Éloize]], [[Cavalia]], ''Kosmogonia'', ''Saka'' and Cirque ''Akya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ellequebec.com/societe/fabuleux-destin-du-cirque-quebecois/a/25816 |title=Le fabuleux destin du cirque québécois |author=Tellier, Chantal |publisher=ELLE Québec |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented outdoors under a tent or in venues similar to the [[Casino de Montréal|Montreal Casino]], the circuses attract large crowds both in Quebec and abroad. In the manner of touring companies of the [[Renaissance]], the [[clown]]s, street performers, [[minstrel]]s, or [[troubadour]]s travel from city to city to play their comedies. Although they may appear randomly from time to time during the year, they are always visible in the cultural events such as the Winterlude in Gatineau, the [[Quebec Winter Carnival]], the [[Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival]], the [[Quebec City Summer Festival]], the [[Just for Laughs|Just for Laughs Festival]] in Montreal and the Festival of New France in Quebec.

The [[École nationale de cirque|National Circus School]] and the ''École de cirque de Québec'' were created to train future [[Contemporary circus]] artists. For its part, ''[[Tohu, la Cité des Arts du Cirque]]'' was founded in 2004 to disseminate the circus arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tohu|url=http://www.tohu.ca/en/TOHU/|work=Tohu – Historic and mission|publisher=Tohu, La cité des arts et du cirque|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heritage===

[[File:Val-Jalbert 2.jpg| thumbnail | The school and the convent of the Congregation of Our Lady of Good Council, the ghost town of Val-Jalbert, [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]]]]

The Cultural Heritage Fund is a program of the Quebec government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of Quebec|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/culture/?lang=en#Heritage|work=Culture and Heritage |author=Portal of Quebec |publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the conservation and development of Quebec's heritage, together with various laws.&lt;ref&gt;Law on Archives, Law on Cultural Property and Law on art, literary and scientific contests&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations ensure that same mission, both in the social and cultural traditions in the countryside and heritage buildings, including the ''Commission des biens culturels du Québec'', the ''Quebec Heritage Fondation'', the ''Conservation Centre of Quebec'', the ''Centre for development of living heritage'', the ''Quebec Council of living heri tage'', the ''Quebec Association of heritage interpretation'', etc.

Several sites, houses and historical works reflect the cultural heritage of Quebec, such as the [[Village Québécois d'Antan]], the [[Val-Jalbert, Québec|historical village of Val-Jalbert]], the [[Fort Chambly]], the national home of the Patriots, the Chicoutimi pulp mill (Pulperie de Chicoutimi), the [[Lachine Canal]] and the [[Victoria Bridge (Montreal)|Victoria Bridge]]. Strongly influenced by the presence of the Catholic Church, the development of the religious history of Quebec is provided by organizations like the Council of the religious heritage of Quebec. Since 2007, the government promotes, with the various players in the field, the conclusion of agreements on the use of property belonging to episcopal factories and corporations to establish &quot;''partnerships in financing the restoration and renovation of religious buildings''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcccf.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=2769 |title=Agreement on the usage of Churches in Quebec |author=Ministère de la Culture, de la Communication et de la Condition féminine |publisher=Government of Quebec |date=April 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2011, there are 190 [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Quebec|National Historic Sites of Canada]] in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quebec|work=Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada|publisher=[[Parks Canada]]|accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites were designated as being of national historic significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/clmhc-hsmbc/crit/crit2_e.asp |title=About the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada – Duties |author=Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various museums tell the cultural history of Quebec, like the [[Musée de la civilisation|Museum of Civilization]], the [[Musée de l'Amérique française|Museum of French America]], the [[McCord Museum]] or the Montreal Museum of Archaeology and History in [[Pointe-à-Callière]], displaying artifacts, paintings and other remains from the past of Quebec.

The historical context of 'traditional' Quebec cuisine is from the fur trade period and many dishes have a high fat or lard content. From the early 17th century, French settlers populating North America were interested in a new cuisine to confront the climate and the needs arising from the work of colonization. Mindful of the same nutritional needs as settlers from [[Acadia]], it has many similarities with Acadian cuisine. Quebec's cuisine has a strong French and Irish influence, although many aspects of Canadian aboriginal cuisine have also had a significant impact on Quebec cuisine. Quebec is most famous for its [[Tourtière]], [[Pâté Chinois]] and [[Poutine]]. The temps des sucres (sugar season) is one of the oldest of Quebec culinary traditions. During springtime, many Quebeckers go to the [[Sugar house|cabane à sucre]] (sugar house) for a traditional meal. The Jewish community of [[Montreal]] has contributed [[Montreal-style bagel]]s and [[smoked meat]] which is similar to [[pastrami]].

Quebec has produced beer since the beginning of colonization especially with the emergence of [[spruce beer]]. In 1668, [[Jean Talon]] founded a brewery in Quebec City, but it closed a decade later. Although many people tried to produce a beer between the 17th and 18th centuries, it is only since the 1980s that the industries had produced on a larger scale. Today there are nearly a hundred breweries and companies, including [[Unibroue]], [[Molson Coors]], [[Labatt]] and many others. Quebec also produces wine, [[ice wine]] and [[ice cider]].

Quebec has produced cheese for centuries. The first cheese-making school in North America was established in Saint-Denis-de-Kamouraska in 1893. It was at this moment that the monks of La Trappe of Oka began to produce the famous [[Oka cheese]]. Today there are over 300 different cheeses in Quebec.

===Sports===
[[File:Boston vs. CH au Centre Bell 007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Canadiens de Montréal]] at the [[Bell Centre]]]]
Sports in Quebec constitutes an essential dimension of Quebec culture. The practice of sports and outdoor activities in Quebec was influenced largely by its geography and climate. [[Ice hockey]] remains the national sport. This sport, which was played for the first time on March 3, 1875, at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal and promoted over the years by numerous achievements of the centenary of the [[Montreal Canadiens|Canadiens de Montréal]], still raises passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.canoe.ca/sports/nouvelles/hockey/canadiens/archives/2009/12/20091205-065501.html|title=Un anniversaire douloureux}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major sports include [[Canadian Football]] with the [[Montreal Alouettes]], soccer with the [[Montreal Impact]], the [[Canadian Grand Prix|Grand Prix du Canada]] Formula 1 racing with drivers such as [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]], and professional baseball with the former [[Montreal Expos]]. During its history, Quebec has hosted several major sporting events; including the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], the Fencing World Championships in 1967, track cycling in 1974, and the [[Transat Québec-Saint-Malo]] race created for the first time in 1984.

==National symbols==
{{Main|Symbols of Quebec}}
[[File:Fleur de lys du québec.png|thumb|left|100px|Fleur-de-lys]]
In 1939, the [[government of Quebec]] unilaterally ratified its [[Coat of arms of Quebec|coat of arms]] to reflect [[History of Quebec|Quebec's political history]]: French rule (gold lily on blue background), British rule (lion on red background) and Canadian rule (maple leaves) and with Quebec's motto below &quot;Je me souviens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/ Justice Québec&amp;nbsp;– Drapeauet et symboles nationaux] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Je me souviens]] (&quot;I remember&quot;) was first carved under the coat of arms of Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] façade in 1883. It is an official part of the coat of arms and has been the official license plate motto since 1978, replacing &quot;''La belle province''&quot; (the beautiful province). The expression ''La belle province'' is still used mostly in tourism as a nickname for the province.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Flag-of-Quebec.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The '''[[Fleurdelisé]]''' flying at [[Place d'Armes]] in Montreal.]]
The fleur-de-lis, the ancient symbol of the [[French monarchy]], first arrived on the shores of the [[Gaspésie]] in 1534 with [[Jacques Cartier]] on his first voyage. When [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded [[Québec City]] in 1608, his ship hoisted the merchant flag of a white cross on a blue background. By 1758 at the [[Battle of Carillon]], the [[Flag of Carillon]] would become the basis of Quebec's desire to have its own flag. By 1903, the parent of today's flag had taken shape, known as the &quot;''[[Fleurdelisé]]''&quot;. The flag in its present form with its 4 white &quot;[[fleur-de-lis]]&quot; lilies on a blue background with a white cross replaced the [[Union Jack]] on Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] on January 21, 1948.

===Other official symbols===
[[File:Harfang sur neige.jpg|thumb|left|The ''harfang des neiges'' ([[snowy owl]]), official bird of Quebec.]]

In 1998 the [[Montreal Insectarium]] sponsored a poll to choose an official insect. The [[Limenitis arthemis|White Admiral]] butterfly (''Limenitis arthemis'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/insectarium/toile/info_insectes/fiches/fic_fiche08_amiral.htm |title=Amiral [Toile des insectes du Québec&amp;nbsp;— Insectarium &amp;#93; |publisher=.ville.montreal.qc.ca |date=May 29, 2001 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; won with 32% of the 230&amp;nbsp;660 votes against the Spotted [[Coccinellidae|lady beetle]] (''Coleomegilla maculata lengi''), the [[Ebony Jewelwing]] [[damselfly]] (''Calopteryx maculata''), a species of [[bumble bee]] (''Bombus impatiens'') and the six-spotted [[tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela sexguttata sexguttata'').

===Fête nationale (National Holiday)===
{{Main|Fête nationale du Québec}}
In 1977, the [[Quebec Parliament]] declared June 24 to be Quebec's National Holiday. Historically June 24 was a holiday honouring French Canada's patron saint, [[St. John the Baptist]], which is why it is commonly known as ''La Saint-Jean-Baptiste'' (often shortened to ''La St-Jean''). On this day, the song &quot;[[Gens du pays]]&quot; by [[Gilles Vigneault]] is often heard and commonly regarded as Quebec's unofficial anthem. The festivities occur on June 23 and 24 and are celebrated all over Quebec. In cities like [[Quebec City|Québec]] and [[Montreal|Montréal]], great shows are organized in the main public places (such as the Abraham plains, [[Quebec City|Québec]], or Maisonneuve Park, [[Montreal|Montréal]]) where several of the most popular Quebec artists relay each others{{clarify|date=September 2012}} until late at night.
