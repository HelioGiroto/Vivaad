The '''Tea Party protests''' are a series of protests across the United States that [[List of Tea Party protests, 2009|began in early 2009]]. The protests are part of a larger political movement called the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]].  

Among other events, protests have been held on:

* February 27, 2009 to protest the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]] (TARP) [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|bailout bill]] signed by President [[George W. Bush]] in October 2008 and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA stimulus bill]] signed by President [[Barack Obama]] ten days prior to the protest;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Houston Joins Other Cities Nationwide in Tea Party Protest|url=http://houstonist.com/2009/02/26/tea_parties_coordinated_nationwide.php|publisher=[[Houstonist]]|author=Katharine Shilcutt Gleave|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Tea Party activities since 2010 have been focused on opposing the efforts (supported by the Obama Administration) to enact reforms to health insurance and health care delivery, and on recruiting, nominating, and supporting candidates for upcoming state and national elections. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstimes.com/local/article/GOP-chair-welcomes-tea-party-2134030.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridateaparty.us/news-archive/01.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 1, 2009 tea bag campaign===
On January 19, 2009, Graham Makohoniuk, a part-time trader and a member of Ticker Forum, posted a casual invitation on the market-ticker.org forums to &quot;Mail a tea bag to [[United States Congress|congress]] and to [[United States Senate|senate]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tickerforum.org/cgi-ticker/akcs-www?post=79282&amp;page=1 |title=MAIL A TEA BAG TO CONGRESS &amp; TO SENATE!

''[[Radicals for Capitalism|Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement]]'', pg. 396&lt;/ref&gt; The idea quickly caught on with others on the forum, some of whom reported being attracted to the inexpensive, easy way to reach &quot;everyone that voted for the [[bailout]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tickerforum.org/cgi-ticker/akcs-www?singlepost=950019 |title=Single Post Display - MarketTicker Forums |publisher=Tickerforum.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of market-ticker.org, [[Karl Denninger]] ([[stock trader]] and former [[CEO]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=info&amp;gid=58862492776 |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; published his own write-up on the proposed protest, titled &quot;Tea Party February 1st?,&quot; which was posted in direct response to President Obama's inauguration occurring on the same day, and railed against the bailouts, the [[US national debt]] and &quot;the fraud and abuse in our banking and financial system&quot; which included the predatory lending practices currently at the center of the home mortgage foreclosure crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://market-ticker.org/archives/732-TEA-PARTY-February-1st.html |title=TEA PARTY February 1st? - The Market Ticker  |publisher=Market-ticker.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Karl Denninger, who helped form FedUpUSA in the wake of the March 2008 [[Federal Reserve]] bail out of [[Bear Sterns]], had been a guest on both [[Glenn Beck]] and [[CNBC]] Reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlDIqFuH0d4&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=FedUpUSA on Glenn Beck Show |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://plus.cnbc.com/rssvideosearch/action/player/id/1177173832/code/cnbcplayershare&lt;/ref&gt; By February 1, the idea had spread among [[conservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]-oriented [[blogs]], forums, websites and through a [[viral phenomenon|viral]] email campaign,&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-hamsher/a-teabagger-timeline-koch_b_187312.html |title=Jane Hamsher: A Teabagger Timeline: Koch, Coors, Newt, Dick Armey There From The Start |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= May 16, 2009|accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Denninger has since been credited as one of the founders of the movement, and the organizer for the first Tea Party event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/2010/0915/What-is-the-tea-party-and-how-is-it-shaking-up-American-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediaite.com/online/civil-war-tea-party-founder-calls-sarah-palin-and-newt-gingrich-a-joke/&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, talk [[radio host]] and [[Fox Business Network]] personality [[Dave Ramsey]] appeared on [[Fox and Friends]], waving tea bags and saying &quot;It's time for a Tea Party.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--citation note: quoted material is available both in the written transcript as well as the video, approx 2 minutes in--&gt; He was on the show criticizing the newly confirmed [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Timothy Geithner]], who that morning had outlined his plan to use the $300 billion or so dollars remaining in the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) funds.

&lt;!--Regarding a series of anti-stimulus protests in mid-February 2009 which sources have since attributed to what would become The Tea Party movement--&gt;

Another article, written by Chris Good of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', credits Carender as &quot;one of the first&quot; Tea Party organizers. 

Carendar organized what she called A &quot;Porkulus Protest&quot; on President’s Day, before, as she says, &quot;Rick Santelli’s rant&quot; referring to the CNBC reporter who called for protests after the announcement of the AIG executive bonuses in the face of increasing home mortgage foreclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zernike |first=Kate |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/us/politics/28keli.html |title=Unlikely Activist Who Got to the Tea Party Early |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2010-02-27 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxdayteaparty.com/2009/03/meet-keli-carender-tea-party-organizer-in-seattle-washington/ |title=Meet Keli Carender, Tea Party organizer in Seattle, Washington « Tax Day Tea Party |publisher=Taxdayteaparty.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carender contacted conservative author and [[Fox News]] contributor [[Michelle Malkin]] in order to gain Malkin's support and publicize her event.  Malkin promoted the protest in several posts on her blog, saying that &quot;There should be one of these in every town in America,&quot; and that she would be supplying the crowd with a meal of pulled pork. The protest was held in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] on [[Presidents Day (United States)|Presidents Day]], February 16, the day before President Obama signed the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus bill]] into law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seattleprotest_KIROtv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=KIRO Tv|url=http://www.kirotv.com/video/18727718/index.html |title=VIDEO: Dozens Gather At &quot;Porkulus&quot; Protest |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malkin encouraged her readers to stage similar events in [[Denver]] on February 17 where President Obama planned to sign the stimulus bill into law.

===Birth of national Tea Party movement===
On February 19, 2009,&lt;ref name = McGrath/&gt; in a broadcast from the floor of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], [[CNBC]] Business News Network editor [[Rick Santelli]] loudly criticized the [[Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan|government plan to refinance mortgages]], which had just been announced the day before, as &quot;promoting bad behavior&quot; by &quot;subsidizing losers' mortgages&quot; and raised the possibility of putting together a &quot;Chicago Tea Party in July&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnbc&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnbc.com/id/29471026 Rick Santelli: I Want to Set the Record Straight]

The day following Santelli's comments from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, on February 20, 2009, roughly 50 national conservative leaders participated in a conference call that gave birth to the national Tea Party movement.&lt;ref&gt;

On September 12, 2009, Tea Party protests were held in various cities around the nation.

&lt;!--  I'm commenting out the following and will later delete it. I'm not deleting it right away so that I can't explain the reasons in case someone wants to restore it. The simple reason is that the cited sources do ''not'' support the statements. a) the source says that there were hundreds of thousands of responses, not that all of them planned to attend; b) the three sources for actual turnout said &quot;tens of thousands&quot; which is not &quot;far less&quot; than the prediction of 20,000-30,000 by an organizer; c) the ABC cite says nothing at all about a Park Police estimate of 30,000 &quot;generous&quot; or otherwise.

Some tea partiers condemned the event, questioning the main sponsor, [[Tea Party Nation]], a for-profit group, as well as the several hundred dollar ticket price.  The former [[Alaska]] governor was criticized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kenneth P.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on August 8, 2009 that organizations opposed to the [[health insurance reform]] legislation were urging opponents to be disruptive.  It noted that the Tea Party Patriots web site circulated a memo instructing them to &quot;Pack the hall.  Yell out and challenge the Rep’s statements early. Get him off his prepared script and agenda. Stand up and shout and sit right back down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/us/politics/08townhall.html?hpHealth Debates Turns Hostile],  New York Times, August 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The memo continued, &quot;The Rep [representative] should be made to feel that a majority, and if not, a significant portion of at least the audience, opposes the [[socialist]] agenda of Washington.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/townhallactionmemo.pdf Think Progress], July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Tea party organizers have stated that they look to [[leftist]] radical [[Saul Alinsky]]'s ''[[Rules for Radicals]]'' for inspiration. Protesters have also [[appropriation (art)|appropriated]] [[left-wing]] imagery; the logo for the 9/12 March on Washington featured a [[raised fist]] design that was intended to resemble those used by [[Labour movement|pro-labor]], [[anti-war]], and [[black power]] movements of the 1960s. In addition, the slogan &quot;Keep Your Laws Off My Body&quot;, usually associated with [[pro-choice]] activists, has been seen on signs at tea parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;alinsky&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/27285.html|title=Conservatives use liberal playbook|accessdate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2010, it was announced that the National Tea Party Federation had been set up to publicize the movement, and in particular to respond to criticism, such as allegations of racist behavior by protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/08/nation/la-na-tea-federation9-2010apr09 |title=Tea parties form a federation, but don't call them organized |author=Kathleen Hennessey |date=April 8, 2010 |work= |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2010, the organization sent a letter to the Congressional Black Caucus denouncing racism and requesting that the CBC supply any evidence of the alleged events at the protest on March 20, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biggovernment.com/natteafed/2010/04/26/letter-to-the-congressional-black-caucus-from-tea-party-federation-please-provide-evidence-of-cannon-n-word-incident/ ''Letter to the Congressional Black Caucus from Tea Party Federation: Please Provide Evidence of Cannon N-Word Incident'', Big Government, April 24, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2010, before the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Bill]] was voted on in [[United States Capitol|Washington D.C.]], it was reported that protesters against the bill used racial and anti-gay slurs. Several [[African-American]] lawmakers said that demonstrators shouted &quot;[[nigger|the N-word]]&quot; at them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 2010-03-22&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589776,00.html|title=Tea Party Protesters Dispute Reports of Slurs, Spitting Against Dem Lawmakers|date=March 22, 2010|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Representative [[Anthony Weiner]]’s staffers reported a stream of hostile encounters with tea partiers roaming the halls of Congress.
