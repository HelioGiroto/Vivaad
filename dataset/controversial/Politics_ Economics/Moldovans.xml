'''Moldovans''' or '''Moldavians''' (in [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]/[[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''moldoveni'' {{IPA-ro|moldoˈvenʲ|pron}}; also written ''молдовень'' in the [[Moldovan alphabet|Moldovan Cyrillic script]] currently used only in [[Transnistria]]) are the current inhabitants of the territory of historical [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]]. The territory is currently divided among [[Romania]] (42%), [[Ukraine]] (24%, including [[Northern Bukovina]], [[Hertsa]], [[Bessarabia|Northern Bessarabia]] and [[Budjak]]) and the [[Republic of Moldova]] (34%).

This article refers primarily to the [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speakers of the Republic of Moldova, the historical [[Bessarabia]] and diaspora originating from these regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bexact_search%5D=Official%20Chisinau%20Seeks%20Recognition%20Of%20Moldovan%20Ethnicity%20And%20Minority%20In%20Romania&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=32532&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=8e4592255a &quot;Official Chisinau Seeks Recognition Of Moldovan Ethnicity And Minority In Romania&quot;] The Jamestown Foundation, February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There is an [[Controversy over linguistic and ethnic identity in Moldova|ongoing controversy]] whether Moldovans are a fully fledged ethnic group or a subgroup of the [[Romanians|Romanian ethnic group]].

==Population==
===Moldovan self-awareness===

A poll conducted in the Republic of Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chisinau in October 2009 presented a detailed picture. The respondents were asked to rate the relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of [[Romanians]] on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll showed that 26% of the entire sample, which included all ethnic groups, claimed the two identities were the same or very similar, whereas 47% claimed they were different or entirely different. The results varied significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, while 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar and 44% different or very different, among the senior respondents (aged over 60) the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. The proportion of those who chose the same or very similar identity was higher than the average among the native speakers of Romanian/Moldovan (30%), among the urban dwellers (30%), among those with higher education (36%), and among the residents of the capital city (42%).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interlic.md/download/988/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study conducted in the Republic of Moldova in May 1998, when the self-declared Moldovans were asked to relate the Romanian and Moldovan identities,  55% considered them somewhat different, 26% very different and less than 5% identical.&lt;ref&gt;Pal Kolsto, Hans Olav Melberg ''National Integration and Violent Conflict in Post-Soviet Societies: The Cases of Estonia and Moldova'', pg. 31-34, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2002, ISBN 0-7425-1888-4&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey carried out in the Republic of Moldova by William Crowther in 1992 showed that 87% of the Romanian/Moldovan speakers chose to identify themselves as &quot;Moldovans&quot;, rather than &quot;Romanians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, &quot;The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture&quot;, Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moldovan intellectuals and the Romanian identity===
As opposed to large segments of the population, a significant number of major Moldovan intellectuals considered themselves part of the Romanian nation.

[[Alexei Mateevici]] (1888–1917), author of the current Moldovan anthem [[Limba noastră]] said at a congress of Bessarabian teachers in 1917: &quot;Yes, we are Moldovans, sons of the old Moldavia, but we belong to the large body of the Romanian nation, that lives in Romania, [[Bukovina]] and [[Transylvania]]. Our brothers from Bukovina, Transylvania and Macedonia don't call themselves after the places they live in, but call themselves Romanians. That is what we should do as well!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Da, suntem moldoveni, fii ai vechii Moldove, însă facem parte din marele trup al românismului, aşezat prin România, Bucovina şi Transilvania. Fraţii noştri din Bucovina, Transilvania şi Macedonia nu se numesc după locurile unde trăiesc, ci-şi zic români. Aşa trebuie să facem şi noi!&quot;
Alexei Mateevici, Opere, vol. I, Chişinău, Ştiinţa, 1993, p. 463, după „Şcoala moldovenească”, an. 1, nr. 2 - 4, iulie-septembrie, 1917, p. 55 - 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanoil Catelli]] (1883–1943) a politician of the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], and later of [[Romania]], said in 1917: „The Moldovans who remained silent for 106 years, should speak louder today [...] because they are Romanians, and only the Russians demoted them to the role of &quot;Moldovans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(Romanian) „Moldovenii care au tăcut timp de 106 ani, trebuie să vorbească astăzi mult mai tare, [...] căci ei sunt români, numai ruşii i-au degradat la rolul de &quot;moldoveni&quot;.“ http://www.literaturasiarta.md/pressview.php?l=ro&amp;idc=115&amp;id=730&amp;zidc=1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maria Cebotari]] (1910–1949) one of the most famous sopranos born in [[Bessarabia]] said „Never and in no circumstance has it crossed my mind to say that I am anything else than a Romanian from Bessarabia, or, simply, a Romanian.“
&lt;ref&gt;(Romanian) „Niciodata si in nici o imprejurare nu mi-a trecut prin cap sa spun altceva decit ca sunt românca din Basarabia sau, pur si simplu, - românca.“
 http://punkt.md/revista/citeste/articol/in_hac_habitasse_platea_dictumst///nb/1/nc/3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grigore Vieru]] (1935–2009), prominent Moldovan poet, a staunch supporter of Pan-Romanianism
&quot; Moldovans hurt me too/ Inhumanly/ But I'm happy that  Romanianness/Still lives in them &quot; (Bessarabia with Sorrow)
&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In mine-au dat si moldovenii/
Necrestineste/
Ci-s fericit ca-n ei romanul/
Tot mai traieste&quot; (Basarabie cu jale).
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugen Doga]] (b. 1937), a famous Moldovan composer, explained in an interview his visit to Alba-Iulia (Romania)
&quot;This is the capital of the unification, a real Mecca [...]. I think people come here not forced, but freely, for a return to their brothers&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;http://social.moldova.org/news/eugen-doga-alba-iulia-e-capitala-unirii-i-o-adevrat-mecca-205133-rom.html
Aici e capitala unirii şi o adevărată Mecca [...] Cred că lumea nu vine aici cu forţa ci din propria iniţiativă, pentru o întoarcere la fraţi.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gheorghe Duca]] (b. 1952), president of the Moldovan Academy of Sciences said
&quot;Just like the whole Romanian nation, that Grigore Vieru praised, I cannot believe the Poet left home forever&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;http://social.moldova.org/news/gheorghe-duca-nu-exista-loc-de-targ-privind-limba-romana-206104-rom.html
La fel ca şi întreaga românime, pe care Grigore Vieru a glorificat-o, nu pot să cred nici eu că Poetul a plecat pentru totdeauna de-acasă.
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constantin Tănase (journalist)|Constantin Tănase]] (b. 1949), director of the Moldovan newspaper &quot;''[[Timpul de dimineață]]''&quot;, one of the most influential opinion leaders from Moldova &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vipmagazin.md/top-moldoveni/Cei_mai_influen%C5%A3i_moldoveni_2009/CONSTANTIN_T%C4%82NASE._Liderul_incontestabil__al_presei_autohtone/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vipmagazin.md/top-moldoveni/Cei_mai_influen%C5%A3i_moldoveni_2005/Constantin_T%C4%83nase._Directorul_de_opinie/&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;The academia, the political and cultural elite has to show that Romanianness in the Republic of Moldova is not an extremist whim, but a reality and a condition of the existence of this state&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Academia, elitele politice şi culturale trebuie să demonstreze că românismul R. Moldova nu e un moft extremist, ci o realitate şi o condiţie a existenţei acestui stat.&quot;
http://www.timpul.md/articol/basarabia-1812-%E2%80%93-r--moldova-2012-8485.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution  of the &quot;[[Association of Historians from the Republic of Moldova]]&quot; (AIRM) from October 28, 2009 in favor of teaching the history of Romanians in Moldovan schools reads
&quot;The people of the Moldovan SSR were subjected to the Communist ideology, with the aim of replacing the Romanian identity of the native population, with one newly created&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airm.reg.md/wp/?p=287
Populaţia R.S.S.M. a fost supusă ideologiei comuniste, care avea scopul de a înlocui identitatea românească, a majorității populației locale, cu alta, nou creată.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The welcome message of the [[Union of Writers from Moldova]] is a quote from [[Mircea Eliade]]: &quot;We invite you to become initiated in the literary life of Bessarabia, border Romanian land subjected to a long, too long terror of history&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniuneascriitorilor.md/index.html
Vă  invităm  să  vă  iniţiaţi  în  domeniul  vieţii  literare  a  Basarabiei,  pământ  românesc  de  „margine”  supus  unei  lungi,  prea  lungi  „terori  a  istoriei”  (Mircea Eliade).
&lt;/ref&gt;

The national poet of Moldova and Romania, [[Mihai Eminescu]] was born and lived outside of the territory of the current Republic of Moldova and considered himself Romanian. He is often quoted as saying &quot;''We are Romanians and period/Suntem români şi punct''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timpul.md/articol/suntem-romni-si-punctum-2093.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 Moldovan Census|2004 census results]] reported that out of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova (without Transnistria), 75.81% declared themselves Moldovans and only 2.17% Romanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;mold-census&quot;&gt;National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova: [http://www.statistica.md/recensamint.php?lang=ro 2004 Census results in Moldova]&lt;/ref&gt; A group of international observers considered the census was generally conducted in a professional manner, although they reported several cases when enumerators encouraged respondents to declare themselves Moldovans rather than Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/romanian/news/story/2006/04/printable/060410_moldova_recensamant_limba.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census in Ukraine]] counted 258,600 Moldovans and 150,989 Romanians. The self-identified Moldovans live mostly in the historical regions of [[Bessarabia]] (the [[Budjak]] region of the [[Odessa oblast]] and the [[Novoselytskyi Raion]] of [[Chernivtsi oblast]]), whereas the self-identified Romanians live mostly in the Northern Bukovina and Hertsa regions of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]].&lt;ref name=ukr-census&gt;[http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/nationality_population/nationality_1/s5/?botton=cens_db&amp;box=5.1W&amp;k_t=00&amp;p=60&amp;rz=1_1&amp;rz_b=2_1],  [http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/nationality_population/nationality_1/s5/?botton=cens_db&amp;box=5.1W&amp;_t=73&amp;p=60&amp;rz=1_1&amp;rz_b=2_1], [http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/nationality_population/nationality_1/s5/?botton=cens_db&amp;box=5.1W&amp;k_t=51&amp;p=60&amp;rz=1_1&amp;rz_b=2_1], [http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/estimate/] 2001 census results in Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Russia]], 172,330 Moldovans have been counted in the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian census]]. They are concentrated mostly in [[Moscow]], but also in some rural areas in [[Kuban]], southern [[Siberia]], and  the [[Russian Far East]], where they were deported generations ago. Around 20,000 Moldovans live in [[Kazakhstan]], mostly in the former capital [[Almaty]], but also in some rural areas in the northern parts of the country (another destination of Soviet deportations).

===Regional identity in Romania===

The largest share (47.5%) of the territory of the historical [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]] together with all its formal capitals ([[Baia|Târgul Moldovei]], [[Suceava]] and [[Iaşi]]) and the famous [[Painted churches of northern Moldavia|painted churches]] are located in Romania. The river [[Moldova River|Moldova]] (possibly, the origin of the name of the Principality, see ''[[Etymology of Moldova]]'') now flows entirely through Romania. After the Russian annexation of [[Bessarabia]] in 1812, and Austrian annexation of [[Bukovina]] in 1775, the rest of Moldova united with Walachia and formed the modern Romania.

According to the Romanian census of 2002, there are 4.7 million Romanian speakers in the 8 counties that were once part of the Principality of [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recensamant.ro/&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people, if any, who possibly declared themselves as Moldovans in this census is impossible to know, since Moldovan is officially considered a regional identity in Romania.&lt;ref name=&quot;censushandbook&quot;&gt;[http://www.unece.org/stats/census/2000/files/Romania/2002HandbookForCensusStaff.pdf The Handbook of the Census Staff], 2001, at [[UNECE]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian-speaking inhabitants of these counties generally refer to themselves as &quot;Moldavians&quot;, but declare Romanian ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Socor]]: [http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bexact_search%5D=Official%20Chisinau%20Seeks%20Recognition%20Of%20Moldovan%20Ethnicity%20And%20Minority%20In%20Romania&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=32532&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=8e4592255a &quot;Official Chisinau Seeks Recognition Of Moldovan Ethnicity And Minority In Romania&quot;] The Jamestown Foundation, February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, a small group of Romanian citizens who created the &quot;Moldovan/Moldavian Community in Romania&quot; (Comunitatea moldovenilor din România) attempted unsuccessfully to gain recognition of the minority status for Moldovans from Romania. The organization was initially registered legally, but the decision was soon reverted. Around the same time, during a visit to [[Moldova]], three delegates met with President [[Vladimir Voronin]], who promised them his support.

In [[1998]], Constantin Simirad, the former mayor of [[Iaşi]] founded the Party of the Moldavians ''(Partidul Moldovenilor)'' which later joined the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ziua.net/display.php?data=2001-11-19&amp;id=76849&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party's declared objective was to represent the interests of the Moldavia region in Romania rather than any ethnic identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/local/vaslui/costantin-simirad-a-pus-la-vaslui-bazele-partidului-moldovenilor~ni432&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, the Moldovans from [[Bessarabia]] are usually called Bessarabians ''(basarabeni)'' in order to distinguish them from the inhabitants of Eastern Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.basarabeni.ro/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity in the historical Principality of Moldova==
[[File:Moldova 1483 EnglishPNG.png|thumb|left|The Moldavian Principality in the 15th century]]
According to [[Miron Costin]], a prominent chronicler from the 17th century [[Moldavia]], the inhabitants of the Principality of [[Moldavia]] spoke Romanian and called themselves &quot;Moldovans&quot;, but also &quot;Romanians&quot; which, he notes, comes from &quot;[[Rome|romanus]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Miron Costin, De neamul moldovenilor. Şi acum mulţi ne zic noao, ţării noastre [Moldova] şi Ţării Muntenéşti, streinii, Daţiia, însă norodul, neamul lăcuitorilor, nu ş-au schimbatŭ numele său, ci tot romanus, apoi cu vréme şi îndelungate vacuri romani, apoi rumâni pănă astăzi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miron Costin, De neamul moldovenilor. Aşa şi neamul acésta, de carele scriem, al ţărâlor acestora, numele vechiŭ şi mai direptŭ ieste rumân, adecă râmlean, [...] tot acest nume au ţinut şi ţin pănă astăzi şi încă mai bine munténii decât moldovénii, că ei şi acum zic şi scriu ţara sa rumânească, ca şi românii cei din Ardeal.

Şi aşa ieste acestor ţări şi ţărâi noastre, Moldovei şi Ţărâi Munteneşti numele cel direptŭ de moşie, ieste rumân, cum să răspundŭ şi acum toţi acéia din Ţările Ungureşti lăcuitori şi munténii ţara lor şi scriu şi răspundŭ cu graiul: Ţara Românească&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Slavs|Slavic]] neighbours called Moldovans &quot;[[Vlachs]]&quot; or &quot;Volokhs&quot;, a term equally used to refer to all native Romance speakers from [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Balkan peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger-William Seton Watson, A history of the Romanians, Cambridge University Press, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ethnonym &quot;Romanian&quot; was gaining more and more popularity throughout the West Moldavia and Bukovina during the 19th century, its dissemination in Bessarabia, a more backward and rural province of the Russian Empire at the time, was welcomed mostly by the Romanian-oriented intellectuals, while the majority of the rural population continued to use the old self-identification &quot;Moldovans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Petrescu, &quot;[http://www.pasts.ceu.hu/fileadmin/template/www.pasts.ceu.hu/files/nation_building_and_contested_identities.pdf Contrasting/Conflicting Identities:Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans]&quot; in Nation-Building and Contested Identities, Polirom, 2001, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, ''Moldovan Identity and the Politics of Pan-Romanianism'', Slavic Review, Vol. 53, No. 2. (Summer, 1994), pp. 345-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1920s, historians generally considered Moldovans as a subgroup of the [[Romanians|Romanian ethnos]].&lt;ref&gt;King, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; After 1924, within the newly created Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, [[Soviet]] authorities supported the creation of a different standardized language (see [[Moldovan language]]) to prove that Moldovans form a separate ethnic group.&lt;ref name=page3&gt;King, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bruchis. ''The Language Policy of the CPSU and the Linguistic Situation in Soviet Moldavia'', in ''[[Soviet Studies]]'', Vol. 36, No. 1. (Jan., 1984), pp. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

If in the past, the term &quot;Moldovan&quot; has been used to refer to the population of the historical Principality of Moldavia. However, for the inhabitants of Bessarabia living under the Russian rule, the term gained an ethnic connotation by the beginning 20th century: in May 1917, at a congress of Bessarabian teachers, a dispute arose over the identification of the native population; a group protested against being called &quot;Romanians&quot;, affirming they were &quot;Moldovan&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart J. Kaufman, ''Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War'', [[Cornell University Press]], 2001, ISBN 978-0-8014-8736-1, pg. 134&lt;/ref&gt; while another group, led by the poet [[Alexei Mateevici]], supported the view that the Moldovans are also Romanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Cuvântarea_la_primul_congres_al_învăţătorilor_moldoveni_din_Basarabia Mateevici's speech at the teachers' congress] at Romanian wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Bessarabia [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|joined]] the [[Kingdom of Romania]], following a vote of [[Sfatul Ţării]]. The circumstance of the vote was itself complex, since the Romanian troops were present in Bessarabia at the request of the Sfatul Ţării as it was facing exterior threats and anarchy.
&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture'', Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000, page 33
 &quot;The occupation of Bessarabia by the Romanian[s troops], although carried out after an appeal of members of the Sfatul Tarii and other Moldovan organizations, was not universally welcomed&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, Cristina. ''Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans'' in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian &amp; Hungarian Case Studies''. Editura [[Polirom]]. 2001. As Sorin Alexandrescu suggests, taking into account the situation at that time, the chaos in Russia and the undecided balance in the war, it is reasonable to suppose that the presence of Romanian troops in Bessarabia created a situation in which the majority in the Sfatul Tãrii decided to rally the faction that was advocating the union with Romania as a solution for overcoming of the triple threat of Bolshevism, Ukrainian expansionism and general anarchy.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the union, the largely illiterate Romanian-speaking peasants of Bessarabia did not consider themselves part of a larger Romanian nation, and there was no mass nationalist movement as in other regions, such as Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, Irina. ''Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building, and Ethnic Struggle, 1918-1930''. [[Cornell University Press]], 2000. pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; The unified Romanian state promoted a common identity for all its Romanian-speaking inhabitants. Owing partly to its relative underdevelopment compared to other regions of [[Greater Romania]], as well as to the low competence and corruption of the new Romanian administration in this province, the integration process of Bessarabia in the unified Romanian state was less successful than in other regions and was soon to be disrupted by the Soviet occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, Cristina. ''Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans'' in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian &amp; Hungarian Case Studies''. Editura [[Polirom]]. 2001.

&quot;The members of this overwhelmingly rural, mostly illiterate and quasi-immobile peasant population, who had no sense of national identification with the Romanians, but had idealized memories from the Tsarist period, found themselves overnight citizens of Romania. It was the transition from the Tsarist-type of local government to the Romanian-type of centralized modern state with a corrupt administration that alienated the Bessarabians, many of whom felt, as the interviewed persons bear witness, that they were rather occupied by their alleged brothers than united with them.&quot;  (page 157)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, Cristina. Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans in Nation-Building and Contested identities: Romanian &amp; Hungarian Case Studies.

&quot;The stories told by a group of Bessarabians coming from several villages of Bãlþi county, who, it should be noted, chose to come to Romania instead of living under the Soviet regime, seems to suggest that their native region was the only province acquired after World War I where the Romanian central authorities did not succeed in integrating their own coethnics, among whom some even felt nostalgia for the Tsarist period. Although citizens of Greater Romania, a large majority of Bessarabians did not even begin to consider themselves part of the Romanian nation, going beyond their allegiance to regional and local ties.11 In short, as these oral history interviews reveal, during the interwar period, the Romanian homogenizing state failed in its attempt to transform the peasants of Bessarabia into Romanians.&quot; (page 154)
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, during [[World War II]], Romania agreed to an [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|ultimatum]] and ceded the region to the Soviet Union, which organized it into the [[Moldavian SSR]]. The Soviets began a campaign to strengthen the Moldovan identity  different from that of the rest of [[Romanian language|Romanian]] speakers, taking advantage of the incomplete integration of the Bessarabia into the interwar Romania (see also [[Moldovenism]]).&lt;ref&gt;King,
The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture; Mackinlay, pg. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  The official Soviet policy also stated that [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] were two different languages and, to emphasize this distinction, Moldovan had to be written in a new Cyrillic alphabet (the [[Moldovan alphabet]]) based on the Russian Cyrillic, rather than the older Romanian Cyrillic that ceased to be used in the 19th century in the Old Kingdom and 1917 in Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinlay, pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity and politics in Moldova==
The major Moldovan political forces have diverging opinions regarding the identity of Moldovans. (see also [[Controversy over linguistic and ethnic identity in Moldova]]). This contradiction is reflected in their stance toward the national history that should be taught in Moldovans schools. Forces such as the Liberal Party (PL), Liberal Democratic Party (PLDM) and Our Moldova Alliance (AMN) support the teaching of the history of Romanians. Others, such as the Democratic Party (PD) and the Party of Communists (PCRM) support the history of Republic of Moldova &lt;ref&gt;http://www.adevarul.ro/international/europa/Istoria-Marian-Filat-Lupu-Vlad_0_128987562.html
Vlad Filat, president of PLDM
&quot;Vom învăţa istoria noastră  - cea a românilor, aşa cum este şi firesc&quot;/&quot;We will teach our history - that of Romanians, as it is natural&quot;

Marian Lupu, president PD:
&quot;După părerea noastră, cea mai bună variantă [...] ar fi istoria statului nostru – istoria Republicii Moldova. Fără a pune accente pe momente sensibile, care ar putea duce la o scindare în societate.&quot;, a zis liderul Partidului Democrat, Marian Lupu/&quot;In our opinion, the best option [...] would be the history of our state - the history of the Republic of Moldova. Without focussing on the sensitive moments, which would bring division in our society&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.formula-as.ro/2010/902/spectator-38/petru-bogatu-republica-moldova-nu-mai-poate-fi-orientata-spre-moscova-12015
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jurnalul.ro/stire-caravana-jurnalul-2007/scandalul-manualelor-de-istorie-integrata-99589.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The diverging opinions are also reflected in the official state documents issued in successive legislatures. The Declaration of Independence of 1991 calls the official language &quot;[[Romanian language|Romanian]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europa.md/upload/File/alte_documente/Declaratia%20de%20Independenta%20a%20Republicii%20Moldova%202(1).doc&lt;/ref&gt; and the first anthem adopted by the independent Moldova was &quot;[[Deşteaptă-te, române]]&quot; (&quot;Awaken, Romanian!&quot;), the same as the anthem of [[Romania]].

Mirroring different political configurations of the later Moldovan Parliament, the [[Constitution of Moldova (1994)]] calls the official language &quot;[[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Constitution of the Republic of Moldova. Article 13, Chapter 1 |date=1994-06-29 |quote= The official language of the Republic of Moldova is Moldovan, written in Latin script.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the &quot;Concept of the National Policy of the Republic of Moldova&quot; (2003) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L E G E privind aprobarea Conceptiei politicii nationale de stat a Republicii Moldova  |url=http://www.bri.gov.md/oDepartamentru/ArhiveNews/Conceptia/CNPSrom.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribincea A., Grecu, M. [http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.pdf?tbl=RSDCOI&amp;id=418f804a4 The Concept on National Policy of the Republic of Moldova] UNHCR.&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the Communist-dominated Parliament distinguishes explicitely Moldovans and Romanians as ethnic groups, and so does the [[Moldovan Census (2004)|census of 2004]].

== Religion in Moldova ==
{{Main|Moldovan Orthodox Church|Metropolis of Bessarabia}}
The major [[Christian denomination|denomination]] in Moldova is [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The majority of Moldovan Orthodox Christians belong to the [[Moldovan Orthodox Church]], a branch of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], while a minority belongs to the [[Metropolis of Bessarabia]], a branch of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Both bodies are in [[full communion]], the dispute between them being purely territorial and revolves around the legitimate succession of the interwar Metropolitan [[Episcopal see|See]] of Bessarabia. As of 2007, the Moldovan Orthodox Church has 1255 parishes, while the Metropolis of Bessarabia has 219.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90189.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007], by the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor&lt;/ref&gt;
