The '''Republika Srpska''' {{Audio|RepublikaSrpska.ogg|listen}} ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: ''Republika Srpska'', [[Cyrillic script]]: ''Република Српскa'', {{IPA-sh|rɛpǔblika sr̩̂pskaː|}}) is one of the two main [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|political entities]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the other being the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The [[Constitution of Republika Srpska]] defines it as a territorially unified, indivisible and inalienable constitutional and legal entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that independently performs its constitutional, legislative, executive and judicial functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ustav&quot;&gt;[http://www.ustavnisud.org/upload/4_8_2009_48_ustav_srpski.pdf The Constitution of Republika Srpska] official document, retrieved 17-5-2012 {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska|National Assembly]] and the [[Government of Republika Srpska]] are based in [[Banja Luka]], although [[Sarajevo]] remains the official capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ustav&quot;/&gt;

==Name==
In the name ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Republika Srpska}}'', the first word means republic. The second word is a [[Nominalization|nominalized adjective]] derived by adding the suffix {{lang|sr-Latn|''-ska''}} to {{lang|sr-Latn|''srb-''}}, the root of the noun {{lang|sr-Latn|''Srbin''}}, meaning Serb. The {{lang|sr-Latn|''-ps-''}} sequence rather than {{lang|sr-Latn|''-bs-''}} is a result of [[Assimilation (linguistics)|voicing assimilation]]. Adjectives derived in this way from [[ethnonym]]s are often used in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] as names of countries: e.g., {{lang|sr-Latn|''Škot''}} – {{lang|sr-Latn|''Škotska''}} (Scot – Scotland), {{lang|sr-Latn|''Hrvat''}} – {{lang|sr-Latn|''Hrvatska''}} (Croat – Croatia).

The [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was one of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s six federal units, defined in its constitution as a state of equal citizens, [[Muslims by nationality|Muslim]]s, [[Serbs]], [[Croats]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The first democratic multi-party elections in the republic were held on 18 November 1990. Most seats in its parliament were won by political parties that represented the three peoples: the [[Party of Democratic Action]], the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]], and the [[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croatian Democratic Union]]. The three parties reached a power sharing agreement covering all government bodies and public institutions.

In a session on 14 and 15 October 1991 the Parliament approved the &quot;Memorandum on Sovereignty&quot; as had already been done by [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]]. The Memorandum was adopted despite opposition from 73 Serb deputies, belonging to the Serb Democratic Party (most of the Serb parliamentary representatives) as well as the [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] and the [[Union of Reform Forces]], who regarded the move as illegal.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite journal

The [[Union of Reform Forces]] soon ceased to exist but its members remained in the assembly as the [[Independent Members of Parliament Caucus]]. The assembly undertook to address the achievement of equality between the Serbs and other peoples and the protection of the Serbs' interests jeopardized by decisions of the Bosnian parliament.&lt;ref name=OG1.1/&gt; On 9 January 1992, the assembly proclaimed the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina ({{lang|sr-Latn|''Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine''}}), declaring it part of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

On 28 February 1992 the assembly adopted the [[Constitution of Republika Srpska|Constitution of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the name adopted instead of the previous {{lang|sr-Latn|''Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine''}}). Its territory would include districts, municipalities, and regions where Serbs were the majority and also those where they had become a minority because of [[persecution during World War II]].

The Bosnian parliament, without its Serb deputies, held a [[referendum]] on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 29 February and 1 March 1992, but most Serbs boycotted it since the assembly had previously (9–10 November 1991) held a plebiscite in the Serb regions, 96% having opted for membership of the Yugoslav federation formed only by Serbia and Montenegro.&lt;ref name=Kreca&gt;Kreća, Milenko (11 July 1996). &quot;The Legality of the Proclamation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Independence in Light of the Internal Law of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot; and &quot;The Legality of the Proclamation of Independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Light of International Law&quot; in &quot;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/7365.pdf?PHPSESSID=1f1615e6112c0279dde6f359b53b0659 Dissenting Opinion of Judge Kreća]&quot; (PDF).

The [[Bosnian War|war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] resulted in major changes in the country, some of which were quantified in a 1998 report by [[UNESCO]]. In the non-Serbian region 50% of houses were damaged and 6% destroyed while the number was lower in the Serbian region, 25% damaged and 5% destroyed{{By whom|date=December 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. About half the country's population of 4 million was displaced. In 1996 there were some 435,346 Serbian refugees from the Federation in Republika Srpska while another 197,925 had gone to Serbia. In 1991, 27% of the non-agricultural labor force had been unemployed in Bosnia and this number had increased due to the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/education/educprog/erd/english/com/docs/eur/bih2/srp_cont.html |author=UNESCO |title=Review of the education system in the Republika Srpska | year=1998 |accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the unemployment rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina was an estimated 29% according to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s ''[[The World Factbook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html CIA - The World Factbook&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 unemployment in Republika Srpska was at 90%.

Republika Srpska's population of Serbs had increased by 547,741{{When|date=December 2009}} and [[ethnic cleansing]] considerably reduced the numbers of other groups. The increasing of Serbs in the Republic is due to the influx of ethnic Serbs that were ethnically cleansed from Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressrs.ba/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/9058/Od+pola+miliona,+u+FBiH+ostalo+50.000+Srba.html Press Online Republika Srpska :: Od pola miliona, u FBiH ostalo 50.000 Srba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Croats was reduced by 135,386 (majority of prewar population), and the number of [[Bosniaks]] by some 434,144.

In the early 2000s discrimination against non-Serbs was alleged by NGOs and the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Helsinki Commission]]. The [[International Crisis Group]] reported in 2002 that in some parts of Republika Srpska a returnee is ten times more likely to be the victim of violent crime than is a local Serb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Organizations such as the [[Society for Threatened Peoples]], reporting to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in 2008, claim that non-Serbian refugees returning to Republika Srpska are discriminated against and live under appalling conditions, particularly in the Drina Valley ([[Srebrenica]], [[Bratunac]], [[Višegrad]] and [[Foča]]). Many are unemployed and children must attend schools where all subjects are taught in Serbian. Similar things are taking place in the Federation of Bosnia where the problem of segregation is very visible in Herzegovinan and some Bosnian cities where the population is predominantly Croatian. Separate schools for Croatians and non-Croatians are formed. Croatian nationality students are taught using Croatian curriculum whereas Serbian and Bosniak pupils are taught according to the curriculum of Bosnia and Herzegovina

According to the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees of Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina|European Union Police Mission]], [[UNHCR]], and other international organizations, the security in both Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is at present satisfactory, although some minor threats, real or perceived, can still influence the decision of individuals as to whether they will return to their pre-war addresses, or not.&lt;ref name=revstrat/&gt;

==Geography==
===Boundary===
The [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]] (IEBL) between Bosnia and Herzegovina's two entities essentially follows the front lines at the end of the [[Bosnian War]] with adjustments (most importantly in the western part of the country and around Sarajevo) defined by the [[Dayton Agreement]]. The total length of the IEBL is approximately {{formatnum:1080}}&amp;nbsp;km. The IEBL is an administrative demarcation uncontrolled by military or police and there is free movement across it.

===Municipalities===
{{Main|Municipalities of Republika Srpska}}
Under the Law on Territorial Organization and Local Self-Government, adopted in 1994, Republika Srpska was divided into 80 municipalities. After the Dayton Peace Agreement the law was amended to reflect changes to borders: it now comprises 63 municipalities.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The currency of Republika Srpska is the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]] (KM). A so-called &quot;regulatory guillotine&quot; means that it takes only a few days to register a business there, whereas in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] it often takes several months. [[Gross domestic product]] ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) was estimated in 2010 at about US$7,895 per capita, but growth in the particular area was measured as being the highest in Bosnia, with 6,5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=The Wall Street Journal |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117918783695002652.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title= Bosnian Territory Opens Doors for Business |accessdate=17 June 2007 | first=Beth | last=Kampschror | date=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement on strategic partnership has been concluded between the Iron Ore Mine Ljubija Prijedor and the British company [[LNM Holdings|LNM]] (a major steel producer, now part of [[ArcelorMittal]]). The [[Russia]]n company [[Yuzhuralzoloto]] also signed a strategic partnership with the Lead and [[Zinc]] Mine Sase Srebrenica. Recent foreign investments include privatisation of [[Telekom Srpske]], sold to the [[Serbia]]n [[Telekom Srbija]] for €646 million, and the sale of the petroleum and oil industry, based in [[Bosanski Brod]], [[Modriča]] and [[Banja Luka]], to [[Zarubezhneft]] of Russia, whose investment is expected to total US$970 million in coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nezavisne.com/vijesti.php?vijest=4941&amp;meni=2 |date=25 January 2007 |work=Nezavisine novine |title=Investicija za preporod privrede BiH |accessdate=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 2007, the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Electrical power industry|power utility]] [[CEZ Group|ČEZ]] signed a €1.4 billion contract with the [[Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske]], to renovate the [[Gacko]] I power plant and build a second, Gacko II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Prague Daily Monitor |url=http://launch.praguemonitor.com/en/86/czech_business/6620/ |title=CEZ signs contract on energy project in Bosnia |accessdate=17 June 2007 |date=17 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070521220708/http://launch.praguemonitor.com/en/86/czech_business/6620/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;As of September 2012, the President of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, has signed an agreement with the Russian company Gazprom to build a part of the South Stream pipeline network and two gas power plants in the entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnia-s-serb-entity-signs-for-south-stream-pipeline Bosnia's Serb Entity Signs up for South Stream Pipeline :: Balkan Insight&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===External trade===
In recent years exports (not including trade with the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) have grown significantly and the level of import coverage has improved – from KM 1,130,518,000 (€565 million) and 38.3% in 2005, to KM 1,539,229,000 (€770 million) and 55.8% in 2006. 

In the first two months of 2007, exports grew 19% year on year and imports by 39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rzs.rs.ba/Saopstenja/TrgovinaSPOLJNA/decembar05.pdf |format=PDF|author=Republika Srpska Institute of Statistics |title=External Trade Statistics Release |month=December | year=2005 |accessdate=19 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070401032939/http://www.rzs.rs.ba/Saopstenja/TrgovinaSPOLJNA/decembar05.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rzs.rs.ba/Saopstenja/TrgovinaSPOLJNA/SpoljnaTrgovinaDecembar06.pdf |author=Republika Srpska Institute of Statistics |title=External Trade Statistics Release |month=December | year=2006 |accessdate=19 April 2007|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070401034002/http://www.rzs.rs.ba/Saopstenja/TrgovinaSPOLJNA/SpoljnaTrgovinaDecembar06.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rzs.rs.ba/Saopstenja/TrgovinaSPOLJNA/SpoljnaTrgovinaFebruar07.pdf |author=Republika Srpska Institute of Statistics |title=External Trade Statistics Release |month=February | year=2007 |accessdate=19 April 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rzs.rs.ba/Saopstenja/TrgovinaSPOLJNA/februar06.pdf |author=Republika Srpska Institute of Statistics |title=External Trade Statistics Release |month=February | year=2006 |accessdate=19 April 2007|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070401034505/http://www.rzs.rs.ba/Saopstenja/TrgovinaSPOLJNA/februar06.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation and Salaries===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Since 2001, Republika Srpska initiated significant reforms in the sector of the tax system, which lowered the tax burden to 28.6%, one of the lowest in the region. The 10% rate of capital gains tax and income tax are the lowest in Europe and highly stimulating for foreign investment, and there are no limits on the amount of earnings. Increasing the number of taxpayers and budgeted incomes, and creating a stable fiscal system, were necessary for further reforms in the fields of taxation and duties; this area is a priority goal of the RS authorities. [[Value added tax|VAT]] has been introduced in 2006. Income tax is 46% in the RS, compared to nearly 70% in the Federation, and the [[corporate tax]] rate is 10%, compared to 30% in the Federation. These tax advantages have led to some companies moving their business to RS from the other entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Просјечне плате РС 1996-2010.PNG|thumb|220px|Average net wages ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark|KM]]) in Republika Srpska 1996-2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rzs.rs.ba/Publikacije/Godisnjak/2011/StatistickiGodisnjak2011-WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Republika Srpska saw accelerated salary growth in 2008.  The average net salary in 2008 amounted to KM 755 (€386), which represents an increase of 29% compared to 2007 average. High inflation rate in 2008 caused the difference between the nominal and the real salary growth to be higher than in 2007. Average net salaries in Republika Srpska saw a real growth of 21.8%, since 2008 inflation measured by Consumer Price Index was 7.2%. Marked salary growth was particularly contributed to by salary growth in individual economic sectors, especially in public sector. Regarding pensions in Republika Srpska, their growth in 2008 kept pace with salary trends. The average pension in 2008 amounted to KM 294 (€150), which is larger by 27.8% (y/y). Somewhat higher pension growth in the RS might be explained by significantly faster growth of contributions of the PDI Fund. The average wage as of 2011 stood at KM 809.0 (€414).

==Politics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
{{Main|Politics of Republika Srpska}}
{{Main|Constitution of Republika Srpska}}
[[File:Зграда НСРС.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska|National Assembly]] building]]
[[File:Зграда Владе РС и Интегралов.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Government building (right).]]
Under its constitution, Republika Srpska has a president, parliament (the 83-member [[National Assembly of Republika Srpska]]), executive (with a prime minister and several ministries), its own police, supreme court and lower courts, customs service (under the state-level customs service), and postal service. It also has its own coat of arms, flag (a variant of the Serbian flag without the coat of arms displayed), and national anthem. However, the national anthem, like Spain, San Marino and Abu Dhabi has no words to it. The Constitutional Law on Coat of Arms and Anthem of the Republika Srpska was ruled not in conformance with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina as it states that those symbols &quot;represent statehood of the Republika Srpska&quot; and are used &quot;in accordance with moral norms of Serb people&quot;. According to the Constitutional Court's decision, the Law was to be corrected by September 2006. The national assembly of Republika Srpska formed a board which is going to make a proposal for the anthem and coat of arms of Republika Srpska. Its former flagship airline, [[Air Srpska]], ceased operations in 2003. The new airline, [[Sky Srpska]], has been established in 2007, and has a [[codeshare agreement]] with [[Slovenia]]n airline [[Adria Airways]] since 2010.

Although the constitution names [[Sarajevo]] as the capital of Republika Srpska, the northwestern city of [[Banja Luka]] is the headquarters of most of the institutions of government – including the parliament – and is therefore the ''de facto'' capital.

After the war, Republika Srpska retained its army, but in August 2005, the parliament consented to transfer control of [[Army of Republika Srpska]] to a state-level ministry and abolish the Republic's defense ministry and army by 1 January 2006. These reforms were required by [[NATO]] as a precondition of Bosnia and Herzegovina's admission to the [[Partnership for Peace]]. As of 14 December 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a part of the [[Partnership for Peace]] programme.

===External relations===

On 26 September 2006, Republika Srpska officials signed a &quot;special ties agreement&quot; with [[Serbia]] aimed at promoting economic and institutional cooperation between Serbia and the Republika Srpska (RS). The accord was signed by Serbia's President [[Boris Tadić]] and Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]], former RS President [[Dragan Čavić]], and Prime Minister [[Milorad Dodik]].

Tadić and Koštunica, accompanied by several ministers and some 300 businessmen, arrived in [[Banja Luka]] on two special planes from [[Belgrade]], in what was seen as the biggest-ever boost to strengthening ties in all spheres of life between the Republika Srpska and [[Serbia]]. The Serbian [[Komercijalna banka]] and the [[Dunav osiguranje]] insurance company opened branches in Banja Luka and the Serbian news agency [[Tanjug]] also inaugurated its international press center in Banja Luka, on a day packed with business engagements.

The document sets out steps taken by Serbia and Republika Srpska officials to increase economic and political ties. It is similar to a previous one signed in 2001 between the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the Republika Srpska, which had envisaged close cooperation in economy, defense, education and [[dual citizenship]] for the residents, said a Serbian government statement. The agreement gives Republika Srpska, the same status with Serbia as the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole.  &quot;This agreement will stabilize the relations between countries in the region and it will promote economic, political and cultural relations between Serbia and Republika Srpska,&quot; Čavić told reporters after the signing ceremony. Koštunica added &quot;We have long waited for this day,&quot; and insisting that the agreement would not be &quot;a dead letter on paper,&quot; but would &quot;live and be useful to the citizens of Serbia and Republika Srpska.&quot;

Under the [[Dayton Agreement]], which ended the [[Bosnian war]] in 1995, two entities – [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and the Republika Srpska - formed a single state, but with many decentralised powers.

===Representative offices===
[[File:Представништва Републике Српске у свијету.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Representative offices of the Republika Srpska in World.]]
On 12 February 2009, Republika Srpska opened a new representative office in [[Brussels]]. While EU representatives were not present at the time, all top Republika Srpska officials attended the opening ceremony, saying it would advance their economic, political and cultural relations with the [[European Union]]. This notion has been strongly condemned by Bosniak leaders, saying that this is further proof of Republika Srpska distancing itself from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. President [[Rajko Kuzmanovic]], on the other hand, told reporters that this move does not jeopardize Republika Srpska's place within [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He added that Republika Srpska just used its constitutional right &quot;to open up a representation office in the center of developments with European relevance.&quot; Republika Srpska also has offices of representation in [[Belgrade]] ([[Serbia]]), [[Moscow]] ([[Russia]]), [[Stuttgart]] ([[Germany]]), [[Jerusalem]] ([[Israel]]) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vladars.net/sr-SP-Cyrl/Vlada/Predstavnistva/Pages/default.aspx Представништва Републике Српске у иностранству&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biznis.ba/politika/15405-u-becu-otvoreno-predstavnistvo-republike-srpske.html Biznis.ba - U Beču otvoreno Predstavništvo Republike Srpske&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smedia.rs/vesti/vest/89244/Milorad-Dodik-Otvoreno-predstavnistvo-Republike-Srpske-u-Becu-Dodik-otvorio-predstavnistvo-Republike-Srpske-u-Becu.html# Dodik otvorio predstavništvo Republike Srpske u Beču - VESTI - SMEDIA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 there were plans to open offices in [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/republika-srpska-eu-office-triggers-dispute |title=Republika Srpska EU Office Triggers Dispute |publisher=BalkanInsight.com |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Croatian Prime Minister [[Ivo Sanader]] previously stated &quot;that certainly won't be nor can it be an embassy because the Republika Srpska government is not the government of a sovereign state nor can it be&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|url=http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2007/listopad/predsjednik_vlade_s_visokim_predstavnikom_za_bosnu_i_hercegovinu_lajcakom|title=Prime Minister Sanader receives Lajcak|date=20071220034551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of the republic holidays is Republic Day, commemorating the establishment of Republika Srpska on 9 January 1992. It coincides with [[St. Stephen's Day]] according to the Julian calendar. The Orthodox Serbs also refer to the holiday as the [[Slava]] of Republika Srpska. They regard [[Saint Stephen|Saint Stephen The Protomartyr And Archdeacon]] as the [[patron saint]] of Republika Srpska. The holiday has therefore a religious dimension, being celebrated with special services in Orthodox churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
