'''''Harry Potter''''' is a series of seven [[Fantasy literature|fantasy novels]] written by the British author [[J. K. Rowling]]. The books chronicle the adventures of a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]], [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], and his friends [[Ron Weasley|Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], all of whom are students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The main [[story arc]] concerns Harry's quest to overcome the Dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], whose aims are to become immortal, conquer the [[Harry Potter universe|wizarding world]], subjugate non-magical people, and destroy all those who stand in his way, especially Harry Potter.

Since the release of the first novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' on 30 June 1997, the books have gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2996578.stm|title=Potter's place in the literary canon|publisher=BBC News|last=Allsobrook |first=Dr. Marian|date=18 June 2003|accessdate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has also had some share of criticism, including concern for the increasingly dark tone. {{As of|2011|06}}, the book series has sold about 450 million copies, making it the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books series in history]] and has been [[Harry Potter in translation|translated into 67 languages]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Translations for Harry Potter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boxofficemojo&quot; /&gt; and the last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history.

A series of many [[genre]]s, including [[fantasy]] and [[coming of age]] (with elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[adventure novel|adventure]], and [[romance novel|romance]]), it has many cultural meanings and references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fry|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Fry|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/1205-bbc-fry.html|title=Living with Harry Potter|publisher=BBC Radio 4|date=10 December 2005|accessdate=10 December 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090602092002/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/1205-bbc-fry.html|archivedate=2 June 2009| deadurl = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Up!|work=Entertainment Weekly |last=Jenson|first=Jeff|year=2000|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,85524~5~0~,00.html|accessdate=20 September 2007|date=7 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Chapter|author=Nancy Carpentier Brown|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor|year=2007|url=http://www.osv.com/Portals/0/images/pdf/TheLastChapter.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J.

There are also many other themes in the series, such as prejudice and corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mzimba, Lizo, moderator. Interview with [[Steve Kloves]] and J.K. Rowling&quot;/&gt;

The initial major publishers of the books were [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] in the United Kingdom and [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]] in the United States. The books have since been published by many publishers worldwide. The books, with the seventh book split into two parts, have been made into an eight-part [[Harry Potter (film series)|film series]] by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

Many of its institutions and locations are recognisable, such as London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/07/15/svharry15.xml&amp;page=3|title=Harry Potter and the parallel universe|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=28 September 2008 | location=London | first=Nigel | last=Farndale | date=15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles that remain invisible to the Muggle population.&lt;ref name=&quot;muggle guide&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/820551.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=A Muggle's guide to Harry Potter|date=28 May 2004|accessdate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
When the first novel of the series ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (published in some countries as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'') opens, it is clear some remarkable event has taken place in the wizarding world, an event so very remarkable, even the Muggles notice signs of it. The full background to this event and to the person of Harry Potter is only revealed gradually, through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his background begins to be revealed.

Harry's first contact with the wizarding world is through a half-giant, [[Rubeus Hagrid]], keeper of grounds and keys at Hogwarts. Hagrid reveals some of Harry's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-stories&quot; /&gt; Harry learns that as a baby he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard, [[Lord Voldemort]], who then attempted to kill him also.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-stories&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-07-19-potter-books_N.htm|title=The Harry Potter stories so far: A quick CliffsNotes review |work=USA Today|accessdate=28 September 2008 | first=Carol | last=Memmott | date=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons not immediately revealed, the spell with which Voldemort tried to kill Harry rebounded. Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard [[Albus Dumbledore]], the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant [[Muggle]] (non-wizard) relatives, the Dursleys, who had him safe but hid his true heritage from him in hopes that he would grow up &quot;normal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-stories&quot; /&gt;

With Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: [[Ron Weasley]], a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but hard-up wizarding family, and [[Hermione Granger]], a gifted and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-stories&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|date=15 August 2004|publisher=J.K. Rowling.com|accessdate=27 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080823121201/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry also encounters the school's potions master, [[Severus Snape]], who displays a deep and abiding dislike for him. The plot concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who in his quest for immortality, yearns to gain the power of the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], a substance that gives everlasting life.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-stories&quot; /&gt;

The series continues with ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' describing Harry's second year at Hogwarts. He and his friends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears tied to recent sinister events at the school. Ron's younger sister, [[Ginny Weasley]], enrols in her first year at Hogwarts, and finds a notebook which turns out to be Voldemort's diary from his school days. Ginny becomes possessed by Voldemort through the diary and opens the &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, unleashing an ancient monster which begins attacking students at Hogwarts. The novel delves into the history of Hogwarts and a legend revolving around the Chamber. For the first time, Harry realises that racial prejudice exists in the wizarding world, and he learns that Voldemort's reign of terror was often directed at wizards who were descended from Muggles. Harry also learns that his ability to speak [[Parseltongue]], the language of snakes, is rare and often associated with the [[Black magic|Dark Arts]]. The novel ends after Harry saves Ginny's life by destroying a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]] and the enchanted diary which has been the source of the problems.

The third novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', follows Harry in his third year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Voldemort. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by [[Sirius Black]], an escaped murderer believed to have assisted in the deaths of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the [[dementors]]—dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul—which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to [[Remus Lupin]], a [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher who is eventually revealed to be a [[werewolf]]. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally shown by people his age. Harry learns that both Lupin and Black were close friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, [[Peter Pettigrew]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-plot-azkaban&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/books/rowling-azkaban.html?pagewanted=all|title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|last=Maguire|first=Gregory|date=5 September 1999|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, another recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised—in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.

===Voldemort returns===
[[File:The elephant house.jpg|thumb|200px|&quot;[[The Elephant House (Edinburgh Café)|The Elephant House]]&quot;&amp;nbsp;– The café in Edinburgh in which Rowling wrote the first part of ''Harry Potter''.|alt=&quot;The Elephant House&quot;, a small, painted red café where Rowling wrote a few chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''.]]
During Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'') Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous contest where Harry must compete against a witch and a wizard &quot;champion&quot; from visiting schools as well as another Hogwarts student.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-plot-goblet&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/23/books/rowling-goblet.html|title=Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|last=King|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen King|date=23 July 2000|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry is guided through the tournament by Professor [[Mad-Eye Moody|Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody]], who turns out to be an impostor&amp;nbsp;– one of Voldemort's supporters named [[Barty Crouch, Jr]] in disguise. The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series' shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict. Voldemort's plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds. Although Harry manages to escape from him, Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament, is killed and Voldemort resurges.

In the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In response to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the [[Ministry of Magic]] and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-phoenix-plot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/review/rowling-phoenix.html?pagewanted=all |title='Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' |date=13 July 2003|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008 | first=John | last=Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the wizarding world attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints [[Dolores Umbridge]] as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-phoenix-plot&quot; /&gt;

Harry forms &quot;[[Dumbledore's Army]]&quot;, a secret study group to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned. An important prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort is revealed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivory Tower 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=A Whited|first=Lana|title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a Literary Phenomenon | publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful connection, allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort's actions telepathically. In the novel's climax, Harry and his friends face off against Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]]. Although the timely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the children's lives, Sirius Black is killed in the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp-phoenix-plot&quot; /&gt;

In the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Voldemort begins waging open warfare. Harry and friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts. They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence; Harry eventually begins dating Ginny Weasley. Near the beginning of the novel, Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer, &quot;the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. This book is a source of scholastic success, but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it, becomes a source of concern. Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore, who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort. These reveal that Voldemort, to preserve his life, has split his soul into pieces, creating a series of [[horcrux]]es, evil enchanted items hidden in various locations, one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book.&lt;ref name=&quot;harry-potter-prince&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/books/16choc.html?pagewanted=all |title= Harry Potter Works His Magic Again in a Far Darker Tale |last=Kakutani|first=Michiko |date=16 July 2005 |newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry's snobbish adversary, Draco Malfoy, attempts to attack Dumbledore, and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince.

''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', the last book in the series, begins directly after the events of the sixth book. Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining horcruxes. To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. As they search for the horcruxes, the trio learns details about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives—he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother.

The book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort, his Death Eaters, and various [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]]. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle. After learning that he himself is a horcrux, Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort, who casts a killing curse at him. However, the defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning this, but continue to fight on. Having managed to return from the dead, Harry finally faces Voldemort, whose horcruxes have all been destroyed. In the subsequent battle, Voldemort's curse rebounds off of Harry's spell and kills Voldemort. An epilogue describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects on the wizarding world.

==Structure and genre==
{{See also|Harry Potter influences and analogues}}
The ''Harry Potter'' novels fall within the genre of [[fantasy literature]]; however, in many respects they are also [[bildungsroman]]s, or [[coming of age]] novels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100529012532/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0OON/is_1_24/ai_107896944/ |title=Wizards and wainscots: generic structures and genre themes in the Harry Potter series|last=Anne Le Lievre|first= Kerrie |year=2003|publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=1 September 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contain elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]], adventure, [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], and [[romance novel|romance]]. They can be considered part of the British children's [[boarding school]] genre, which includes [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[Stalky &amp; Co.]], [[Enid Blyton]]'s ''[[Malory Towers]]'', ''[[St. Clare's series|St. Clare's]]'' and the ''[[Naughtiest Girl]]'' series, and [[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Frank Richards's]] ''[[Billy Bunter]]'' novels: the ''Harry Potter'' books are predominantly set in [[Hogwarts]], a fictional British boarding school for wizards, where the curriculum includes the use of [[magic (Harry Potter)|magic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry Potter Boarding&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/563232.stm|title=Harry Potter makes boarding fashionable |publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 September 2008 | date=13 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense they are &quot;in a direct line of descent from [[Thomas Hughes]]'s ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of [[Public school (UK)|British public school]] life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ellen Jones | first = Leslie| title = JRR Tolkien: A Biography | publisher=Greenwood Press|year= 2003 | accessdate=9 September 2005|isbn=978-0-313-32340-9|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= A Whited | first = Lana | title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a Literary Phenomenon | publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also, in the words of [[Stephen King]], &quot;shrewd mystery tales&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wild About Harry&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html | newspaper= The New York Times | title = Wild About Harry | date = 23 July 2000 | first = Stephen | last = King | authorlink = Stephen King | accessdate =9 August 2010 | quote = ...the Harry Potter books are, at heart, satisfyingly shrewd mystery tales.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each book is constructed in the manner of a [[Sherlock Holmes]]-style [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] adventure. The stories are told from a [[third person limited]] point of view with very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'' and the first two chapters of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]'').

In the middle of each book, Harry struggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors, who employ the use of punishments often found in the boarding school [[genre|sub-genre]].{{Citation needed| date=February 2012}}&lt;!--&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry Potter Boarding&quot; /&gt; --&gt; However, the stories reach their climax in the [[summer term]], near or just after [[Final examination|final exams]], when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either [[Voldemort]] or one of his followers, the [[Death Eaters]], with the stakes a matter of life and death–a point underlined, as the series progresses, by one or more characters being killed in each of the final four books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry Potter Last Adventure&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/06/26/rowling-potter-deaths.html | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20060630023326/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/06/26/rowling-potter-deaths.html | archivedate=12 May 2010|title=Two characters to die in last 'Harry Potter' book: J.K.

In the final novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the [[dénouement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry Potter Last Adventure&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1637886_1637891,00.html|title=Harry Potter's Last Adventure | last=Grossman|first=Lev|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=1 September 2008 | date=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing the bildungsroman format, in this part Harry must grow up prematurely, losing the chance of a last year as a pupil in a school and needing to act as an adult, on whose decisions everybody else depends—the grown-ups included.{{Citation needed| date=March 2012}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6910106.stm|title=Press views: The Deathly Hallows |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|accessdate=22 August 2008 | date=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Themes==
According to Rowling, a major theme in the series is death: &quot;My books are largely about death. They open with the death of Harry's parents. There is Voldemort's obsession with conquering death and his quest for [[immortality]] at any price, the goal of anyone with magic. I so understand why Voldemort wants to conquer death. We're all frightened of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Geordie Greig&quot;/&gt;

Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including [[politics of Harry Potter|political subtexts]]. Themes such as [[Normality (behavior)|normality]], oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwald|first=Janey|title=Understanding Harry Potter: Parallels to the Deaf World|journal=The Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|volume=10|issue=4|pages=442–450|year=2005|doi=10.1093/deafed/eni041|pmid=16000691|month=Fall|last2=Greenwald|first2=J |url=http://jdsde.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16000691|format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and &quot;going over one's most harrowing ordeals—and thus coming to terms with them&quot; has also been considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Edward|title=Sentences in Harry Potter, Students in Future Writing Classes|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=21|issue=2|year=2002|page=177|doi=10.1207/S15327981RR2102_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling has stated that the books comprise &quot;a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to [[bigotry]]&quot; and that also pass on a message to &quot;question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7053982.stm|title=JK Rowling outs Dumbledore as gay|accessdate=21 October 2007|date=21 October 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the books could be said to comprise many other themes, such as power/abuse of power, love, prejudice, and free choice, they are, as J. K. Rowling states, &quot;deeply entrenched in the whole plot&quot;; the writer prefers to let themes &quot;grow organically&quot;, rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mzimba, Lizo, moderator.

The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy, &quot;because that ... is how tyranny is started, with people being [[apathetic]] and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-vancouversun-wyman.htm|first=Wyman|last=Max|title=&quot;You can lead a fool to a book but you cannot make them think&quot;: Author has frank words for the religious right|publisher=The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)|date=26 October 2000 |accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and publishing history==
[[File:J. K. Rowling 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The novelist, [[J. K. Rowling]].|alt=J.K. Rowling, a blond, blue-eyed woman, who is the author of the series.]]
In 1990, J. K. Rowling was on a crowded train from [[Manchester]] to London when the idea for Harry suddenly &quot;fell into her head&quot;. Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying:&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry falls into author's head&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=JKRowling.com|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm|title=Biography|first= JK |last = Rowling |accessdate=21 May 2006|year=2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060421032312/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=21 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me.&quot;}}

Rowling completed ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' in 1995 and the [[manuscript]] was sent off to several prospective [[literary agent|agents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eitb24.com/new/en/B24_57676/entertainment/FACTBOX-Final-Harry-Potter-book-set-for-release/|title=Final Harry Potter book set for release|date=15 July 2007|publisher=[[Euskal Telebista]]|accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second agent she tried, Christopher Little, offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to Bloomsbury. After eight other publishers had rejected ''Philosopher's Stone'', Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc| url= http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_22/b3935414.htm| title=Nigel Newton | first=John| last=Lawless| accessdate =9 September 2006|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivory Tower 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=A Whited|first=Lana |title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a Literary Phenomenon|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004| isbn = 978-0-8262-1549-9 |page=351|url=http://books.google.com/?id=iO5pApw2JycC&amp;pg=PA351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Rowling's statement that she did not have any particular [[Demographic profile|age group]] in mind when beginning to write the ''Harry Potter'' books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.newsobserver.com/308/story/637623.html | title = The magic years | last = Huler | first = Scott | work = The News &amp; Observer | accessdate =28 September 2008 }}{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more [[Epicenity|gender-neutral]] pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no [[middle name]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivory Tower 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1349288/Harry-Potter-and-the-mystery-of-J-Ks-lost-initial.html|title=Harry Potter and the mystery of J K's lost initial|last=Savill|first=Richard|date=21 June 2001|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=27 September 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' was published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], the publisher of all ''Harry Potter'' books in the United Kingdom, on 30 June 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/820885.stm|title=The Potter phenomenon|date= 18 February 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]]—the American publisher of the books—as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nypost.com/seven/07022007/news/nationalnews/wild_about_harry_nationalnews_.htm|title=Wild about Harry|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc.|accessdate=27 September 2008 | date=2 July 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Rowling had received US$105,000 for the American rights—an unprecedented amount for a children's book by a then-unknown author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/business/web21interview.html |title=A Brief Walk Through Time at Scholastic|last=Rozhon|first=Tracie|work= The New York Times |date=21 April 2007|accessdate =21 April 2007|page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing that American readers would not associate the word &quot;philosopher&quot; with a magical theme (although the [[Philosopher's Stone]] is alchemy-related), Scholastic insisted that the book be given the title ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' for the American market.

The second book, ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.

Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well-known authors before their work on ''Harry Potter'', such as [[Viktor Golyshev]], who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translation of books two to seven was undertaken by [[Sevin Okyay]], a popular literary critic and cultural commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not lost in translation: Harry Potter in Turkish |last=Güler |first=Emrah |url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=29054|year=2005|work=The Turkish Daily News|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930171135/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=29054|archivedate=15 May 2010|accessdate =9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons of secrecy, translation can only start when the books are released in English; thus there is a lag of several months before the translations are available. This has led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries. Such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_3036000/3036350.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=OOTP is best seller in France&amp;nbsp;— in English!|date=1 July 2003|accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States editions of the ''Harry Potter'' novels have required the adaptation of the texts into [[American English]], as many words and concepts used by the characters in the novels may have not been understood by a young American audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US1/REF/potter.html|title=Differences in the UK and US Versions of Four Harry Potter Books |date=21 January 2008|publisher=FAST US-1|accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book itself was finished on 11 January 2007 in the [[Balmoral Hotel]], Edinburgh, where she scrawled a message on the back of a bust of [[Hermes]]. It read: &quot;J. K.

[[File: Harry Potter Platform Kings Cross.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[London King's Cross railway station]]'s tribute to the book by placing a sign of the fictional platform from the book series due to its vast popularity.]]
Fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books, beginning with the 2000 publication of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''. The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' sold in the first 24 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry Potter casts spell at checkouts&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The popularity of the ''Harry Potter'' series has translated into substantial financial success for Rowling, her publishers, and other ''Harry Potter'' related license holders. This success has made Rowling the first and thus far only billionaire author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2004/02/26/cx_jw_0226rowlingbill04.html|title=J. K.

The Harry Potter brand has been estimated to be worth as much as $15&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;HP brand worth&quot; /&gt;

The great demand for Harry Potter books motivated the ''New York Times'' to create a separate best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just before the release of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''. By 24 June 2000, Rowling's novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best-seller list.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_2000/06/24&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/books/the-times-plans-a-children-s-best-seller-list.html |title=The Times Plans a Children's Best-Seller List |last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=24 June 2000|work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 2007, [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] declared that ''Deathly Hallows'' had broken its [[pre-order]] record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0413/potterh.html|title=New Harry Potter breaks pre-order record|date=13 April 2007|publisher=RTÉ.ie Entertainment|accessdate =23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the release of ''Goblet of Fire'', 9,000 [[FedEx]] trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book.&lt;ref name=ew-gof-midnight&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276735_2,00.html|title=Wild About Harry|date=31 August 2005|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=4 March 2007|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Fierman|first=Daniel|quote=When I buy the books for my grandchildren, I have them all gift wrapped but one...that's for me.

==Reception==
===Literary criticism===

Early in its history, ''Harry Potter'' received positive reviews. On publication, the first volume, ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', attracted attention from the Scottish newspapers, such as ''[[The Scotsman]]'', which said it had &quot;all the makings of a classic&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper-reviews-hp-ps&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Eccleshare|first=Julia|title=A Guide to the Harry Potter Novels|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8264-5317-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cHjF5K2uVdsC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=the+most+imaginative+debut+since+Roald+Dahl|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]'', which called it &quot;Magic stuff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper-reviews-hp-ps&quot; /&gt; Soon the English newspapers joined in, with more than one comparing it to [[Roald Dahl]]'s work: ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' rated it as &quot;the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper-reviews-hp-ps&quot; /&gt; a view echoed by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (&quot;comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper-reviews-hp-ps&quot; /&gt; while ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it &quot;a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper-reviews-hp-ps&quot; /&gt;

By the time of the release of the fifth volume, ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars. Yale professor, literary scholar and critic [[Harold Bloom]] raised criticisms of the books' literary merits, saying, &quot;Rowling's mind is so governed by clichés and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Boston Globe|date=24 September 2003|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/|title=Dumbing down American readers|first=Harold|last=Bloom|accessdate =20 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. S. Byatt]] authored a ''New York Times'' op-ed article calling Rowling's universe a &quot;secondary secondary world, made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children's literature&amp;nbsp;... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons, and the exaggerated (more exciting, not threatening) mirror-worlds of soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry Potter and the Childish Adult&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Harry Potter and the Childish Adult|date=7 July 2003|accessdate=1 August 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/07/opinion/harry-potter-and-the-childish-adult.html |first=A. S.|last=Byatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Rosen]], a novelist and poet, advocated the books were not suited for children, who would be unable to grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that &quot;J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3958599.ece|work=The Times |title=Harry Potter 'is too boring and grown-up for young readers'|date=19 May 2008|accessdate=15 January 2011|last=Sweeney|first=Charlene | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Anthony Holden]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' on his experience of judging ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' for the [[1999 Whitbread Awards]]. His overall view of the series was negative—&quot;the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain&quot;, and he speaks of &quot;pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2000/jun/25/booksforchildrenandteenagers.guardianchildrensfictionprize2000|work=The Observer |title=Why Harry Potter does not cast a spell over me|date=25 June 2000|accessdate=1 August 2008|last=Holden|first=Anthony | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursula Le Guin]] said, &quot;I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it to find out what the fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a &quot;school novel&quot;, good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chronicles of Earthsea|work=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/feb/09/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.ursulakleguin|accessdate=2 October 2009 | location=London | date=9 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, author [[Fay Weldon]], while admitting that the series is &quot;not what the poets hoped for&quot;, nevertheless goes on to say, &quot;but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful prose&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowling books 'for people with stunted imaginations'&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/jul/11/books.harrypotter|work=The Guardian |title=Rowling books 'for people with stunted imaginations'|date=11 July 2003|accessdate=1 August 2008|last=Allison|first=Rebecca | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in ''[[The Times]]'', stating: &quot;There are not many writers who have JK's Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages, to weep—openly, with tears splashing—and a few pages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes&amp;nbsp;... We have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest, funniest, scariest and most moving children's stories ever written&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/children/article2139573.ece|title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by JK Rowling|last=Wilson|first=A. N.|date=29 July 2007|work=The Times |accessdate=28 September 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Taylor of [[Salon.com]], who is primarily a movie critic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2000|publisher=Salon.com|url=http://www.salon.com/col/bios/tayl/index.html|title=Salon Columnist|accessdate=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; took issue with Byatt's criticisms in particular. While he conceded that she may have &quot;a valid cultural point—a teeny one—about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;A.S. Byatt and the goblet of bile&quot; /&gt; he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious [[literary merit]] and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers. Taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books, shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and [[social isolation]] each causes. Taylor also argued that ''Philosopher's Stone'', said to be the most light-hearted of the seven published books, disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims spur the series' success: the book opens with news of a [[double murder]], for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;A.S. Byatt and the goblet of bile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=A. S.

[[Stephen King]] called the series &quot;a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable&quot;, and declared &quot;Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor&quot; to be &quot;remarkable&quot;. However, he wrote that despite the story being &quot;a good one&quot;, he is &quot;a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle&quot;, the formulaic beginning of all seven books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wild About Harry&quot; /&gt; King has also joked that &quot;Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!&quot; He does however predict that Harry Potter &quot;will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]], [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/dec/31/harrypotter.jkjoannekathleenrowling| title=JK Rowling: The mistress of all she surveys| first= Killian| last=Fox|date=31 December 2006|accessdate =10 February 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Washington Post]]'' book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that the large numbers of adults reading the ''Potter'' series but few other books may represent a &quot;bad case of cultural infantilism&quot;, and that the straightforward &quot;good vs. evil&quot; theme of the series is &quot;childish&quot;. He also argued &quot;through no fault of Rowling's&quot;, the cultural and marketing &quot;hysteria&quot; marked by the publication of the later books &quot;trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel can possibly provide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/13/AR2007071301730_pf.html| title=Harry Potter and the Death of Reading |date=15 July 2007| last= Charles|first=Ron | accessdate=16 April 2008 | newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreeing about the motivating effects, Diane Penrod also praised the books' blending of simple entertainment with &quot;the qualities of highbrow literary fiction&quot;, but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific [[merchandising]] that accompanies the book launches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penrod|first=D|date=December 2001|title=The Trouble with Harry: A Reason for Teaching Media Literacy to Young Adults|journal=The Writing Instructor|publisher=Professional Writing Program at Purdue University|url=http://www.writinginstructor.com/penrod.html|accessdate=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenny Sawyer wrote in 25 July 2007 ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' that the books represent a &quot;disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society&quot; in that stories &quot;moral center [sic] have all but vanished from much of today's [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&amp;nbsp;... after 10 years, 4,195 pages, and over 375 million copies, J.

Harry Potter, Sawyer argues, neither faces a &quot;moral struggle&quot; nor undergoes any ethical growth, and is thus &quot;no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0725/p09s02-coop.html| title=Missing from 'Harry Potter&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a real moral struggle | author= Sawyer, Jenny | accessdate=16 April 2008 |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry's first passage through to [[Platform 9¾]] as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes.

In an 8 November 2002 ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a &quot;trust-fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him&quot;. Noting that in Rowling's fiction, magical ability potential is &quot;something you are born to, not something you can achieve&quot;, Suellentrop wrote that Dumbledore's maxim that &quot;It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities&quot; is hypocritical, as &quot;the school that Dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/?id=2073627| title=Harry Potter: Fraud | author= Suellentrop, Chris

===Controversies===
{{Main|Legal disputes over the Harry Potter series|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Politics of Harry Potter|Tanya Grotter}}
The books have been the subject of a number of [[Lawsuit|legal proceedings]], stemming either from claims by American Christian groups that the magic in the books promotes [[Wicca]] and witchcraft among children, or from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements. The popularity and high [[market value]] of the series has led Rowling, her publishers, and film distributor [[Warner Bros.]] to take legal measures to protect their copyright, which have included banning the sale of ''Harry Potter'' imitations, targeting the owners of websites over the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; [[domain name]], and suing author [[Nancy Stouffer]] to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SScholastic Inc, J.K.

The books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds. In 1997 to 1998 ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' won almost all the UK awards judged by children, but none of the children's book awards judged by adults,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eccleshare2002GuidePublishing&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Eccleshare|first=J.|title=A guide to the Harry Potter novels|publisher=Continuum International|year=2002|pages=7–14|chapter=The Publishing of a Phenomenon|isbn=0-8264-5317-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cHjF5K2uVdsC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22a+hugely+entertaining+thriller%22+Rowling+%22a+first-rate+writer+for+children%22+scotsman|accessdate=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was [[intellectual snobbery]] towards books that were popular among children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett2008Crossover&quot; /&gt; In 1999 the winner of the [[Whitbread Book Award|Whitbread Book of the Year Award]] children's division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, [[Seamus Heaney]]'s translation of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Beowulf]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckett2008Crossover&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Beckett|first=S.L.|title=Crossover Fiction|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2008|pages=112–115|chapter=Child-to-Adult Crossover Fiction|isbn=0-415-98033-X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9ipnQ2ryU7IC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22Harry+Potter+and+the+Philosopher%27s+Stone%22+book+sales+bestseller|accessdate=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, shortly before the publication of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', the previous three ''Harry Potter'' books topped the ''New York Times'' fiction best-seller list and a third of the entries were children's books. The newspaper created a new children's section covering children's books, including both fiction and non-fiction, and initially counting only hardback sales. The move was supported by publishers and booksellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_2000/06/24&quot; /&gt; In 2004 ''The New York Times'' further split the children's list, which was still dominated by ''Harry Potter'' books into sections for series and individual books, and removed the ''Harry Potter'' books from the section for individual books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/ten-years-later-harry-potter-vanishes-from-the-best-seller-list/|title=Ten Years Later, Harry Potter Vanishes From the Best-Seller List|last=Garner|first=D.|date=1 May 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split in 2000 attracted condemnation, praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/08/16/bestseller/index.html|title=A list of their own|last=Bolonik|first=K.|date=16 August 2000|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' suggested that, on the same principle, Billboard should have created a separate &quot;[[mop-top]]s&quot; list in 1964 when the [[Beatles]] held the top five places in its list, and [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] should have created a separate game-show list when ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' dominated the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corliss|first=R.|date=21 July 2000|title= Why 'Harry Potter' Did a Harry Houdini |journal=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,50554,00.html|accessdate=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
There are eleven ''Harry Potter'' video games, eight of which correspond with the films and books, and three other spin-offs. The film/book based games are produced by [[Electronic Arts]], as was the [[Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup]] game, with the game version of the first entry in the series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|Philosopher's Stone]]'', being released in November 2001. The video games are released to coincide with the films, containing scenery and details from the films as well as the tone and spirit of the books. Objectives usually occur in and around [[Hogwarts]], along with various other magical areas. The story and design of the games follows the selected film's characterisation and plot; EA worked closely with Warner Brothers to include scenes from the films. The last game in the series, ''Deathly Hallows'', was split with [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 (video game)|Part 1]] released in November 2010 and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (video game)|Part 2]] debuting on consoles in July 2011. The two-part game forms the first entry to convey an intense theme of action and violence, with the gameplay revolving around a third-person shooter style format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrypotter.ea.com/ EA Harry Potter] Retrieved 19 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ea.com/videos?video_id=89a42107c3649210VgnVCM1000001065140aRCRD EA Harry Potter gameplay] Retrieved 19 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The other spin-offs games, [[Lego Harry Potter: Years 1–4]] and [[Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7]] are developed by [[Traveller's Tales]] and published by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]]. A number of other non-interactive media games have been released; board games such as ''[[Cluedo]] Harry Potter Edition'', ''[[Scene It?]] Harry Potter'' and ''[[Lego Harry Potter]]'' models, which are influenced by the themes of both the novels and films.

[[File:Wizarding World of Harry Potter Castle.jpg|thumb|right|Hogwarts Castle as depicted in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter located in Universal Orlando Resort's Island of Adventure.]]
After the success of the films and books, Universal and Warner Brothers announced they would create &quot;The Wizarding World of Harry Potter,&quot; a new ''Harry Potter''-themed expansion to the [[Islands of Adventure]] theme park at [[Universal Orlando Resort]] in Florida. The new land, promoted as the seventh themed &quot;island&quot; of the park, was built from land reserved for expansion outside of the park's original border, as well as from much of the existing &quot;island,&quot; [[Mythos (restaurant)|The Lost Continent]]. A soft opening was held at the end of March 2010, with the land opening on 16 June 2010 for reserved guests. The land officially opened to the public on 18 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/wizarding-world-of-harry-potter/os-universal-harry-potter-staying-pow20100617,0,1970029.story|title=Big day is here: Universal hopes Harry Potter's magic will last|first=Jason|last=Garcia|date=17 June 2010|accessdate=19 June 2010|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guests enter the land through a recreation of the Hogsmeade station,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1213793/Harry-Potter-theme-park-Universal-unveils-details-Wizarding-World-Harry-Potter.html|title=Hogwarts opens in Florida: Amazing new Harry Potter theme park to cast its spell over British tourists|accessdate=19 September 2009|date=19 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading into the village of [[Hogsmeade]], with a [[Forced perspective|forced-perspective]] Hogwarts castle at the very end of the street. The castle contains the expansion's centrepiece attraction, ''Harry Potter &amp; the Forbidden Journey,'' a [[KUKA|KUKA arm]] attraction which takes passengers through many realistic scenes influenced by the movies and books, including soaring over Hogwarts, getting involved in a Quidditch match, and having close encounters with dragons, dementors, and the Whomping Willow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia-times.com.au/entertainment/article.php?id=7096|title=Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park opens|date=19 June 2010|accessdate=19 June 2010|work=Australia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attractions include a twin high-speed rollercoaster named the ''[[Dragon Challenge]],'' a renovation of the previously existing rollercoaster, ''[[Dueling Dragons]]'', and a family roller coaster called ''[[Flight of the Hippogriff]]'', a renovation of the previously existing ride, ''[[Flight of the Hippogriff#Flying Unicorn era|Flying Unicorn]]''. In addition to the three rides are several themed shops and restaurants, heavily inspired by their appearances in the books and films: Honeydukes sells sweets, such as chocolate frogs and ''Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour Beans'', ''Ollivander's'' offers personalised magic wands, Zonko's Joke Shop sells various items including Sneakoscopes, and the Three Broomsticks serves food and drink, most notably Butterbeer and pumpkin juice.

Developed at a cost of $265 million, the new land &quot;has seen capacity crowds [and] waits of up to two hours just to enter the ... merchandise shop.&quot; Islands of Adventure saw a massive increase in attendance following the expansion, seeing gains of as much as 36%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brigante |first=Ricky |url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/2010/12/harry-potter-gives-universals-islands-of-adventure-park-huge-attendance-boost-in-2010-but-numbers-still-dont-rival-disneys/ |title=Harry Potter gives Universal's Islands of Adventure park huge attendance boost in 2010&amp;nbsp;– but numbers still don't rival Disney's |publisher=Inside the Magic |accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a period during which attendance to competitor resort [[Walt Disney World]] dropped slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wesh.com/r/24580700/detail.html |title=Disney World Attendance Declines Slightly |publisher=WESH |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney had itself entered negotiations for a ''Harry Potter''-themed expansion, but ultimately turned down the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barbaro|first=Michael|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/09potter.html|title=A Wizard Rivals Mickey|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 January 2011|page=A14|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In March 2011, Warner Bros. announced plans to build a tourist attraction in the United Kingdom to showcase the ''Harry Potter'' film series. Warner Bros. Studio Tour London will be a behind-the-scenes walking tour featuring authentic sets, costumes and props from the film series. The attraction will be located at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]], where all eight of the ''Harry Potter'' films were made. Warner Bros. stated that two new sound stages would be constructed to house and showcase the famous sets from each of the British-made productions, following a £100 million investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-12645416|title=Harry Potter tour to open at Leavesden studios in 2012|accessdate=18 May 2011 |publisher=BBC News|date=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sets have been revealed, and tickets have already been sold. It opened to the public in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16257334 |title=Harry Potter tour at Leavesden Studios reveals new sets |accessdate=16 February 2012 |publisher=BBC News|date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
