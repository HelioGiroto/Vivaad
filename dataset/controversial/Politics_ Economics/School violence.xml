'''School violence''' is widely held to have become a serious problem in recent decades in many countries, especially where weapons such as guns or knives are involved. It includes violence between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==International character of school violence==
===Australia===

The Education Minister of the State of Queensland said in July 2009 that the rising levels of violence in schools were &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; and admitted that not enough had been done to combat violent behaviour. 55,000 students had been suspended in the state's schools in 2008, nearly a third of which were for &quot;physical misconduct&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chilcott, T., &amp; Odgers, R. (2009, July 9).  [http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,27574,25753048-3102,00.html  Government can do more on school violence].''The Courier-Mail'', Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In South Australia, 175 violent attacks against students or staff were recorded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/26/2609043.htm  School violence 'dealt with']. (2009, June 26). ''ABC News Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
A recent study found that violence experienced by teachers in francophone Belgium was a significant factor in decisions to leave the teaching profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author-separator =,  | doi = 10.1348/000709906X114571 | last1 = Galand | first1 = B. | last2 = Lecocq | first2 = C. | last3 = Philipott | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = School violence and teacher professional disengagement | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18781276 | journal = British Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = Pt 2| pages = 465–477 | pmid = 17504557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===

Following &quot;numerous reports over the past decade about school violence&quot;, the Education Minister in 2009 introduced stricter regulations about student behaviour, including inappropriate dress, being drunk, and carrying mobile phones. Teachers were to be given new powers to punish disruptive students.&lt;ref&gt;Kostadinov, P. (2009, June 19). [http://www.sofiaecho.com/2009/06/19/737778_little-or-nothing  Little or nothing]. ''Sofia Echo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The French Education Minister claimed in 2000 that 39 out of 75,000 state schools were &quot;seriously violent&quot; and 300 were &quot;somewhat violent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lichfield, J.  (2000, January 27). [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/violence-in-the-lycees-leaves-france-reeling-727241.html  Violence in the lycees leaves France reeling].  ''The Independent''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
A survey by the Education Ministry showed that students at public schools were involved in a record number of violent incidents in 2007—52,756 cases, an increase of some 8,000 on the previous year. In almost 7,000 of these incidents, teachers were the target of assault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/mail/ed20081202a1.html Getting children to get along.] (2008, December 2). ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
In 2006, in response to the suicide of a girl after she was sexually molested in school, the Polish Minister of Education, [[Roman Giertych]], launched a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; school reform.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, A. (2006, November 3). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6113660.stm  Polish drug use and suicide sparks school plan.] ''BBC News Online'', London.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this plan, teachers would have the legal status of [[civil servant]]s, making violent crimes against them punishable by higher penalties. [[Head teacher]]s (equivalent to principals in the US) will be, in theory, able to send aggressive pupils to perform [[community service]] and these students' parents may also be fined. Teachers who fail to report violent acts in school could face a [[prison sentence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;warsaw&quot;&gt;[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/13372  The shadow in our schools] (2006, December 20). ''Warsaw Voice''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The South African Human Rights Commission has found that 40% of children interviewed said they had been the victims of crime at school. More than a fifth of sexual assaults on South African children were found to have taken place in schools. Exposure to domestic violence, gangsterism, and drugs have had a substantial impact on student performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7292818.stm  Violence rife in S Africa schools].

===United Kingdom===
A government inquiry in 1989&lt;ref&gt;Department of Education and Science and the Welsh Office. (1989). ''Discipline in schools: Report of the Committee of Enquiry Chaired by Lord Elton''. London: HMSO. ISBN 0-11-270665-7&lt;/ref&gt; found that 2 percent of teachers had reported facing physical aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, N. (1995, December 10). [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/school-violence-rocketing-in-90s-1524988.html School violence rocketing in 90s]. ''The Independent'', London.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 a survey of 6,000 teachers by the teachers' trade union NASUWT found that over 16% claimed to have been physically assaulted by students in the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasuwt.org.uk/consum/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=NASUWT_000286&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=latest&amp;allowInterrupt=1 Safe to teach?].

''NASUWT report''. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of police statistics found through a Freedom of Information request, in 2007 there were more than 7,000 cases of the police being called to deal with violence in schools in England.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. (2008, December 23). [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/police-called-to-7000-violent-incidents-in-schools-1209075.html  Police called to 7,000 violent incidents in schools]. ''The Independent''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2009 another teachers' union, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, released details of a survey of over 1,000 of its members which found that nearly one quarter of them had been on the receiving end of physical violence by a student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atl.org.uk/Images/Pupil%20%20Parent%20Behaviour-%20press%20release%20April%202009.pdf  Violent pupils and parents make teachers' lives a misery].

In Wales, a 2009 survey found that two-fifths of teachers reported having been assaulted in the classroom. 49% had been threatened with assault.&lt;ref&gt;Miloudi, S. (2009, June 28). [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/06/28/two-out-of-five-teachers-in-wales-have-been-assaulted-91466-24002445/  Two out of five teachers in Wales have been assaulted]. ''Wales on Sunday'', Cardiff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to the U.S. [[National Center for Education Statistics]], school violence is a serious problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCES&quot;&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. (2008). [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009022 ''Indicators of school crime and safety''].

[http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/SchoolViolence_FactSheet-a.pdf  ''Understanding school violence'']. Retrieved 2009-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the latest year for which comprehensive data were available, a nationwide survey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author-separator =,  | last1 = Eaton | first1 = D.K. | last2 = Kann | first2 = L. | last3 = Kinchen | first3 = S. | last4 = Shanklin | first4 = S. | last5 = Ross | first5 = J. | last6 = Hawkins | first6 = J.| last7 =Harris | year = 2008| first7 =WA| last8 =Lowry| first8 =R| last9 =McManus| first9 =T | title = Youth risk behavior surveillance—United States, 2007 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5704a1.htm | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

The rate was three times higher among males than among females.  In the 12 months antedating the survey, 7.8% of high school students reported having been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property at least once, with the prevalence rate among males twice that as among females.  In the 12 months antedating the survey, 12.4% of students had been in a physical fight on school property at least once.  The rate among males was twice the rate found among females.  In the 30 days antedating the survey, 5.5% of students reported that because they did not feel safe, they did not go to school on at least one day. The rates for males and females were approximately equal.

Five percent of teachers in urban schools were physically attacked, with smaller percentages in suburban and rural schools.  Other members of school staffs are also at risk for violent attack, with school bus drivers being particularly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author-separator =,  | doi = 10.1097/00043764-199701000-00009 | last1 = Peek-Asa | first1 = C. | last2 = Howard | first2 = J. | last3 = Vargas | first3 = L. | last4 = Kraus | first4 = J.

==Risk factors==
===The individual child===
====Internalizing and externalizing behaviors====

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or depression. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie&quot;&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I. Donnerstein (Eds.), ''Aggression: Theoretical and empirical reviews''. New York: Academic.

====Other individual factors====

A number of other individual factors are associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Early starters have worse outcomes than children whose antisocial activities begin late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author-separator =,  | doi = 10.1017/S0954579498001734 | last1 = Patterson | first1 = G.

===Home environment===

The home environment is thought to contribute to school violence. The Constitutional Rights Foundation suggests long-term exposure to [[gun]] violence, parental [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], physical abuse of the child, and child sexual abuse teaches children that criminal and violent activities are acceptable.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRE&quot;&gt;Constitutional Rights Foundation. (1997). [http://www.crf-usa.org/school-violence/causes-of-school-violence.html  ''Causes of school violence'']. Retrieved on April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Harsh parental discipline is associated with higher levels of aggressiveness in youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sampson&quot;/&gt; There is some evidence indicating that exposure to television violence&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, B.

Straus adduced evidence for the view that exposure to parental [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] increases the risk of aggressive conduct in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author-separator =,  | doi = 10.1525/sp.1991.38.2.03a00010 | last1 = Straus | first1 = M.

Gerald Patterson’s social interactional model, which involves the mother’s application and the child's counterapplication of ''coercive'' behaviors, also explains the development of aggressive conduct in the child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patterson&quot;&gt;Patterson, G.

McCord (Ed.), ''Coercion and punishment in long-term perspectives'' (pp. 81–105). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, coercive behaviors include behaviors that are ordinarily punishing (e.g., whining, yelling, hitting, etc.). Abusive home environments can inhibit the growth of social cognitive skills needed, for example, to understand the intentions of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodge, Pettit&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author-separator =,  | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.104.4.632 | last1 = Dodge | first1 = K.

==Controversies==
===Lax school authorities===

In 2005 on a school bus in Montgomery County, Maryland, an 11-year old girl was attacked by a group of several older boys who, the girl said, grabbed her breasts and feigned sex acts.  Also in 2005 on a school bus in [[Colonial Heights, Virginia]], south of Richmond, Virginia, three boys and two girls aged 8 to 13 held an 11-year-old girl down in the back of the bus and forcefully penetrated her with an object.&lt;ref name = &quot;Williamson&quot;&gt;Williamson, E., &amp; Aratani, L. (2005, June 14). [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301642.html As school bus sexual assaults rise, danger often overlooked]. ''Washington Post''. B01.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Maryland case, the child's mother, not the school, called the police, although a school administrator did notify the girl's mother (the students were not charged with sexual assault because the police mishandled the paperwork); in the Virginia case, the bus driver saw the incident and notified both the school and the girl's mother, prompting coordinated investigations by the police and the school. In 2008, the [[Baltimore]] School District failed to intervene in an act of violence committed against a teacher. A student had taken a [[video]] of a peer beating her art teacher. School officials ignored the problem until the video was posted on [[MySpace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nuefeld&quot;&gt;Nuefeld, S. (2008, April 10).

===The media===
 	
[[School shootings]] are rare and unusual forms of school violence. [[School shootings]] are accountable for less than 1% of violent crimes in public schools, with an average of 16.5 deaths per year from 2001–2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;/&gt; Some commentators claim that media coverage encourages school violence,&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author-separator =,  | doi = 10.1080/09620210802492807 | last1 = Brown | first1 = J. | last2 = Munn | first2 = P. | year = 2008 | title = School violence as a social problem: Charting the rise of the problem and the emerging specialist field | url = | journal = International Studies in Sociology of Education | volume = 18 | issue = 3–4| pages = 219–230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a more likely explanation is that the reporting follows the events in question. On April 16, 2007, [[Seung-Hui Cho]] killed 32 people at [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech]] before committing suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, C. (2007, April 16).

Retrieved on April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the press would likely have been faulted if it did not cover serious threats to public safety like the Virginia Tech and [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine massacre]]s.

==Prevention and intervention==

The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2006). [http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/duip/spotlite/SafeYouthSafeSchools.htm School health policies and programs study]. Retrieved on April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*''Society-level prevention strategies'' aim to change social and cultural conditions in order to reduce violence regardless of where the violence occurs. Examples include reducing [[media violence research|media violence]], reshaping social [[norm (sociology)|norms]], and restructuring [[education|educational systems]].&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/shpps/2006/factsheets/pdf/FS_ViolencePrevention_SHPP2006.pdf/ &quot;School Health Policies and Programs Study 2006&quot;], 2008. Retrieved April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The strategies are rarely used and difficult to implement.

*''School-wide strategies'' are designed to modify the school characteristics that are associated with violence. An avenue of [[Occupational health psychology#Workplace incivility and violence|psychological research]] is the reduction of violence and incivility, particularly the development of interventions at the level of the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author-separator =,  | doi = 10.1016/S0962-1849(05)80077-0 | last1 = Howard | first1 = K.

**The implementation of ''school-wide early-warning systems'', the school equivalent of a [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]]-like surveillance operation designed to &quot;prevent the worst cases of school violence,&quot; has been problematic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schon&quot;/&gt; Recent developments in early threat assessment, however, show promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15388220.2010.519432 | pmid = | title = Development, Evaluation, and Future Directions of the Virginia Student Threat Assessment Guidelines | year = 2011 | last1 = Cornell | first1 = Dewey | last2 = Allen | first2 = Korrie | journal = Journal of School Violence | volume = 10 | pages = 88–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence-prevention efforts can also be usefully directed at developing anti-bullying programs, helping teachers with classroom-management strategies, applying behavioral strategies such as the Good Behavior Game, implementing curricular innovations such as the Second Step syllabus, developing programs to strengthen families (see below), and implementing programs aimed at enhancing the social and academic skills of at-risk students (see below).
