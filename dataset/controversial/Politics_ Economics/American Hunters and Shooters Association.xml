'''The American Hunters and Shooters Association''' ('''AHSA'''), founded in 2005, was a small United States-based group, which has set itself apart from the much larger gun owner organization, the [[National Rifle Association]], founded in 1871, by advocating further restrictions on 2nd Amendment rights. Critics questioned the legitimacy of the group, including whether the membership was composed of or representative of gun owners, or was merely a [[front organization]] for misleading political endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fieldandstream.com/pages/meet-american-hunters-and-shooters-association | title=Meet the American Hunters and Shooters Association | publisher=Field and Stream | accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saysuncle.com/2008/02/29/american_hunters_and_shooters_association_screech-2/ | title=American Hunters and Shooters Association Screech | publisher=SayUncle (blog) | accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The AHSA described itself as &quot;... a national grassroots organization committed to safe and responsible gun ownership&quot; and &quot;... a mainstream group of hunters who are looking to belong to a gun owners association that doesn't have a radical agenda.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;

Deposition before the United States District Court For the Eastern District of New York, City of New York vs. Beretta USA Corp. et al., September 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The AHSA billed itself as a moderate, common-sense advocacy organization. It favored most restrictions on firearms, but believed that little progress will be made until gun owners are allowed to bring their common-sense perspective to the table.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 2008, [[Brady Campaign]] President [[Paul Helmke]] stated that he saw his organization's issues &quot;as complementary to&quot; those of the AHSA.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) and other pro-gun organizations criticized the AHSA for its members' associations with other gun-control organizations and gun-control legislation. NRA-ILA Executive Director [[Chris W. Cox|Chris Cox]] characterized the AHSA as &quot;the latest front group for the anti-gun movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

|quote=Seeking to pick up the baton dropped by the ham-fisted Americans for Gun Safety, the American Hunters and Shooters Association (AHSA) has arrived on the scene to become the latest front group for the anti-gun movement in America.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the similarity in name, AHSA had no ties to the field marksmanship promoting organization, the [http://www.huntershooter.com Hunter's Shooting Association](HSA).

== History ==
In June 2006, Executive Director Bob Ricker formally introduced AHSA at a press conference at the annual conference of the Outdoor Writers Association of America.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. Ricker proclaimed at this conference that the NRA and other 2nd Amendment rights organizations did not address the specific concerns of hunters - protecting hunting lands and wildlife habitats - which led to the creation of AHSA.&lt;ref&gt;

==Position in D.C. v Heller (2008)==

AHSA joined in the amicus curiae brief of Maj. Gen. John D. Altenburg, Jr., et al., in the Supreme Court case of [[District of Columbia v. Heller|D.C. v Heller]], arguing that the individual right of the people to keep and bear arms enhances the collective goal of supporting national defense, and that the dichotomy between individual right argued by Heller and collective militia right argued by D.C. is false: the Second Amendment protects both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_07_08_07_290_RespondentAmCu11GeneralsAHSA.pdf District of Columbia v. Heller amicus curiae of Maj. Gen. John D. Altenburg Jr., etc al.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
* In August 2005, the gun-rights group, the [[National Rifle Association]], said about the AHSA &quot;they want to allow the [[FBI]] to keep records on law-abiding citizens who buy guns and put an end to gun shows as we know them.  Not to mention the fact that they want to regulate [[.50 caliber]] rifles in the same way that [[NFA34|machine guns are regulated]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

* ASHA officials testified in favor of gun control legislation, such as Washington State Bill SB-5197, which aims to restrict private transactions at gun shows and create a database of gun owners.&lt;ref&gt;

* ASHA supported the call by the coalition of [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns]] to repeal the [[Todd_Tiahrt#Tiahrt_Amendment|Tiahrt Amendment]], which restricts full access of cities and law enforcement to gun trace data.&lt;ref name=MayorsTiahrt&gt;{{cite web

* Two of the AHSA endorsed candidates for Congress received low ratings by the NRA, with Massa receiving a &quot;C&quot; and Minnick a &quot;D+&quot;.  Only one AHSA endorsed candidate, Teague, has received an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA. However, this was an &quot;AQ&quot; rating which means it is based solely on the NRA questionnaire. The grade disparity between the organizations is large enough to be called into question.&lt;ref&gt;
