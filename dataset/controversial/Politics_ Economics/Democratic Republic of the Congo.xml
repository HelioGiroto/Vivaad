The '''Democratic Republic of the Congo''' ({{lang-fr|République démocratique du Congo}}), commonly referred to as '''DR Congo''', '''Congo-Kinshasa''' or the '''DRC''', is a country located in central Africa. It is the second largest [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|country in Africa]] by area and the eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 71 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot; /&gt; the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in the world, the fourth most populous nation in Africa, as well as the most populous [[List of countries where French is an official language|officially Francophone country]].

It borders the [[Central African Republic]] and [[South Sudan]] to the north; [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]] in the east; [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]] to the south; the [[Republic of the Congo]], the Angolan exclave of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], and the Atlantic Ocean to the west; and is separated from [[Tanzania]] by [[Lake Tanganyika]] in the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot; /&gt; The country has access to the ocean through a {{convert|40|km|mi|sing=on}} stretch of Atlantic coastline at [[Muanda]] and the roughly 9&amp;nbsp;km wide mouth of the [[Congo River]] which opens into the [[Gulf of Guinea]].

The [[Second Congo War]], beginning in 1998, devastated the country and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;African world war&quot; because it involved nine African nations and some twenty armed groups.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0623/p01s04-woaf.html &quot;Rumblings of war in heart of Africa&quot;] by Abraham McLaughlin and Duncan Woodside ''The Christian Science Monitor'' 23 June 2004 and [http://www.mydd.com/story/2006/7/24/135222/827 &quot;World War Three&quot;] by Chris Bowers ''My Direct Democracy'' 24 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continues in the east of the country.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo was formerly, in chronological order, the '''[[Congo Free State]]''', '''[[Belgian Congo]]''', '''[[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Léopoldville]]''', Congo-Kinshasa, and '''[[Zaire]]''' (''Zaïre'' in French).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; These former names are sometimes referred to as unofficial names, with the exception of [[Mobuto Sese Seko|Mobutu]]'s discredited Zaire, along with various abbreviations such as ''DR Congo'' and ''DRC''. Though it is located in the [[Central Africa]]n [[United Nations geoscheme|UN subregion]], the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with [[Southern Africa]] as a member of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).

A wave of early people was identified in the northern and north-western parts of central Africa during the second millennium BC. They produced food (pearl millet), maintained domestic livestock and developed a kind of [[arboriculture]] mainly based on the [[oil palm]].
From {{Formatnum:1550}} BC to {{Formatnum:50}} BC, starting from a nucleus area in south Cameroon on both banks of the [[Sanaga River]], the first [[Neolithic]] peopling of northern and western central Africa can be followed south-eastwards and southwards.

In D.R. Congo, the first villages in the vicinity of [[Mbandaka]] and the [[Lake Tumba]] are known as the Imbonga Traditions, from around {{Formatnum:650}} BC. In Lower Congo, north of the Angolan border, it is the 'Ngovo Tradition' around {{Formatnum:350}} BC that shows the arrival of the Neolithic wave of advance.

In Kivu, across the country to the east, the [[Urewe]] Tradition villages first appeared about {{Formatnum:650}} BC. The few archaeological sites known in Congo are a western extension of the Urewe [[Archaeological culture|culture]] which has been found chiefly in [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]] and western [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]]. From the start of this tradition, the people knew iron smelting, as is evidenced by several iron-smelting furnaces excavated in Rwanda and Burundi.

The earliest evidence further to the west is known in [[Cameroon]] and near to the small town of [[Bouar]] in [[Central Africa]]. Though further studies are needed to establish a better chronology for the start of iron production in Central Africa, the Cameroonian data places iron smelting north of the [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] around {{Formatnum:650}} BC to {{Formatnum:550}} BC. This technology developed independently from the previous Neolithic expansion, some 900 years later. As fieldwork done by a German team shows, the Congo River network was slowly settled by food-producing villagers going upstream in the forest. Work from a Spanish project in the Ituri area further east suggests villages reached there only around {{Formatnum:1150}} BC.

The Bantu-speaking Neolithic and then iron-producing villagers added to and displaced the indigenous [[Pygmy]] populations (also known in the region as the &quot;Batwa&quot; or &quot;Twa&quot;) into secondary parts of the country. Subsequent migrations from the [[Darfur]] and [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]] regions of [[Sudan]] into the north-east, as well as East Africans migrating into the eastern [[Congo Basin|Congo]], added to the mix of ethnic groups. The Bantu-speakers imported a mixed economy made up of agriculture, small-stock raising, fishing, fruit collecting, hunting and arboriculture before {{Formatnum:3500}} BC; iron-working techniques, possibly from West Africa, a much later addition. The villagers established the [[Bantu languages|Bantu language family]] as the primary set of tongues for the Congolese.

The process in which the original Upemba society transitioned into the [[Kingdom of Luba]] was gradual and complex. This transition ran without interruption, with several distinct societies developing out of the Upemba culture prior to the genesis of the Luba. Each of these kingdoms became very wealthy due mainly to the region's mineral wealth, especially in [[ores]]. The civilization began to develop and implement [[iron]] and [[copper]] technology, in addition to trading in [[ivory]] and other goods. The Luba established a strong commercial demand for their metal technologies and were able to institute a long-range commercial net (the business connections extended over {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=off}}, all the way to the Indian Ocean). By the 16th century, the kingdom had an established strong central government based on chieftainship. The Eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant [[slave raiding]], mainly from [[Arab slave trade|Arab/Zanzibari slave traders]] such as the infamous [[Tippu Tip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page51.shtml The East African slave trade].

=== The African Congo Free State (1877–1908) ===
{{Main|Colonisation of the Congo|Congo Free State|Belgian Congo}}
[[File:Congo belge campagne 1918.jpg|thumb|[[Force Publique]] soldiers in the Belgian Congo in 1918. At its peak, the FP had 19,000 African soldiers, led by 420 white officers.]]
European exploration, exploitation, and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by [[Sir Henry Morton Stanley]], who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of [[King Leopold II of Belgium]]. Leopold had designs on what was to become the Congo as a colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfskeyes&quot;&gt;Keyes, Michael. [http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/als_page2/_Congo_Free_State_Colonialism_History.html ''The Congo Free State – a colony of gross excess''.] September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a succession of negotiations, Leopold – professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the [[front organization]] ''[[Association Internationale Africaine]]'' – played one European rival against another.

Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the [[Conference of Berlin]] in 1885 and made the land his private property and named it the Congo Free State.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfskeyes&quot; /&gt; Leopold's regime began various infrastructure projects, such as construction of the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway|railway that ran from the coast to the capital]] of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). It took years to complete. Nearly all such projects were aimed at increasing the capital which Leopold and his associates could extract from the colony, leading to exploitation of Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Adam (1999), ''King Leopold's Ghost'', Mariner Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Free State, colonists brutalized the local population to produce [[rubber]], for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market. The sale of rubber made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in [[Brussels]] and [[Ostend]] to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the army, the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (FP), was called in. The Force Publique made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives as a means of enforcing rubber quotas a matter of policy; this practice was widespread. During the period of 1885–1908, millions of Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population declined dramatically; it has been estimated that [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[smallpox]] killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower [[Congo River]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=8DSa_viBgsgC&amp;pg=PA748&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Cambridge history of Africa: From the earliest times to c. 500 BC]''.&quot; John D. Fage (1982). [[Cambridge University Press]]. p.748. ISBN 0-521-22803-4&lt;/ref&gt; A government commission later concluded that the population of the Congo had been &quot;reduced by half&quot; during this period,&lt;ref&gt;''King Leopold's Ghost'', Adam Hochschild (1999) ISBN 0-618-00190-5 Houghton Mifflin Books&lt;/ref&gt; but determining precisely how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist.

The actions of the Free State's administration sparked international protests led by British reporter [[E. D. Morel|Edmund Dene Morel]] and British diplomat/Irish rebel [[Roger Casement]], whose 1904 report on the Congo condemned the practice. Famous writers such as [[Mark Twain]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] also protested, and [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' was set in Congo Free State.

=== Belgian Congo (1908–1960) ===
In 1908, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] parliament, despite initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure (especially that from Great Britain) and took over the Free State from the king. From then on, as a Belgian colony, it was called the [[Belgian Congo]] and was under the rule of the elected Belgian government. The governing of the Congo improved significantly and considerable economic and social progress was achieved. The white colonial rulers had, however, generally a condescending, patronizing attitude toward the indigenous peoples, which led to bitter resentment from both sides.

During World War II, the Congolese army achieved several victories against the Italians in North Africa.

=== Independence and Political crisis (1960–1965) ===
{{Main|Congo Crisis}}

In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] or MNC Party, led by [[Patrice Lumumba]], won the parliamentary elections. The party appointed Lumumba as Prime Minister. The parliament elected as President [[Joseph Kasavubu]], of the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party. Other parties that emerged included the [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] (or PSA) led by [[Antoine Gizenga]], and the Parti National du Peuple (or PNP) led by Albert Delvaux and [[Laurent Mbariko]]. (Congo 1960, dossiers du CRISP, Belgium) The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name &quot;République du Congo&quot; (&quot;Republic of Congo&quot; or &quot;Republic of the Congo&quot; in English). Shortly after independence, the provinces of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] (led by [[Moise Tshombe]]) and [[South Kasai]] engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826488-4,00.html Jungle Shipwreck].&quot; ''Time'' 25 July 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 100,000 Europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm |title=UN |publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening the way for Congolese to replace the European military and administrative elite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/5/4/6/0/pages254609/p254609-19.php &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot;], allacademic.com&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PatricelumumbaIISG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Patrice Lumumba]]]]
As the French colony of Middle Congo (Moyen Congo) also chose the name &quot;Republic of Congo&quot; upon achieving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as &quot;Congo-Léopoldville&quot; and &quot;Congo-Brazzaville&quot;, after their capital cities. Another way they were often distinguished during the 1960s, such as in newspaper articles, was that &quot;Congo-Léopoldville&quot; was called &quot;The Congo&quot; and &quot;Congo-Brazzaville&quot; was called simply &quot;Congo&quot;.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

On 5 September 1960, Kasavubu dismissed Lumumba from office. Lumumba declared Kasavubu's action unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed. (cf. ''Sécession au Katanga'' – J.Gerald-Libois -Brussels- CRISP)
Lumumba had previously appointed [[Joseph Mobutu]] chief of staff of the new Congo army, [[Military of the Democratic Republic of Congo|Armée Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Lumumba, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to create mutiny. With financial support from the United States and Belgium, Mobutu paid his soldiers privately. The aversion of Western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance Mobutu's quest to maintain &quot;order&quot; in the new state by neutralizing Kasavubu and Lumumba in a [[coup d'état|coup]] by proxy. A [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) constitutional referendum, 1964|constitutional referendum]] after Mobutu's coup of 1965 resulted in the country's official name being changed to the &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; In 1971 it was changed again to &quot;Republic of Zaïre.&quot;

On 17 January 1961, Katangan forces and Belgian paratroops – supported by the United States and Belgium – kidnapped and executed Patrice Lumumba. Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (Collège des Commissaires) with [[Evariste Kimba]]. The Katanga secession was ended in January 1963 with the assistance of UN forces. Several short-lived governments, of [[Joseph Ileo]], [[Cyrille Adoula]], and [[Moise Tshombe]], took over in quick succession.

=== Zaire (1971–1997) ===
{{Main|Zaire}}
[[File:Mobutu Nixon.gif|thumb|250px|Mobutu Sese Seko and Richard Nixon in Washington, D.C., 1973]]
The new president [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] had the support of the United States because of his staunch opposition to Communism. Western powers appeared to believe this would make him a roadblock to Communist schemes in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A one-party system was established, and Mobutu declared himself head of state. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's government was guilty of severe [[human rights]] violations, political repression, a [[cult of personality]] and corruption. (Mobutu demanded every Congolese banknote be printed with his image, hanging of his portrait in all public buildings, most businesses, and on billboards. It was common for ordinary people to wear his likeness on their clothing.)

Corruption became so prevalent the term &quot;le mal Zairois&quot; or &quot;Zairean Sickness&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Aida/203/203_zaire.html|title=&quot;Zaire: The Hoax of Independence&quot;, The Aida Parker Newsletter #203, 4 August 1997|publisher=cycad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;,meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu himself.&lt;ref&gt;Young, C. &amp; Turner, T. (1985) ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State'', p. 74. ISBN 978-0-299-10110-7&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984, Mobutu was said to have $4 billion (USD), an amount close to the country's national debt, deposited in a personal [[Swiss bank account]]. International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaire became a &quot;[[kleptocracy]]&quot; as Mobutu and his associates [[embezzlement|embezzled]] government funds. 

In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: Léopoldville became Kinshasa [the country was now Democratic Republic of The Congo&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;Kinshasa], Stanleyville became Kisangani, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Coquihatville became Mbandaka. This renaming campaign was completed in the 1970s.

In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the ''Republic of Zaire'', its fourth name change in 11 years and its sixth overall. The Congo River was renamed the Zaire River. In 1972, Mobutu renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga (translated as &quot;the all powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, shall go from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gbadolite, Adam Zagorin|date=22 February 1993|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,977788,00.html|title=Leaving Fire in His Wake: MOBUTU SESE SEKO|publisher=Time magazine|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

During the 1970s and 1980s, Mobutu was invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. In June 1989, Mobutu was the first African head of state invited for a state visit with newly elected President Bush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/africa/upload/91612_1.pdf &quot;Zaire's Mobutu Visits America,&quot; by Michael Johns, Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum #239, 29 June 1989.]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], however, U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a [[Cold War]] ally.

Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until the conflict forced him to flee Zaire in 1997. Thereafter, the nation chose to reclaim its name of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, since the name ''Zaire'' carried such strong connections to the rule of Mobutu.

=== Rwandan/Ugandan invasions and civil wars ===

[[Image:Cimetière Mémorial de la guerre de 2000.JPG|thumb|250px|Memorial cemetery of the [[Six Day War (Kisangani)|Six Day War]] of June 2000]]
By 1996, tensions from the neighbouring [[Rwandan Civil War]] and [[Rwandan Genocide]] had spilled over to Zaire. Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]), who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government, had been using Hutu refugees camps in eastern Zaire as a basis for incursion against Rwanda. These Hutu militia forces soon allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;Thom, William G. [http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/bin/get5.cgi?directory=fall99/&amp;filename=THOM.htm#50 &quot;Congo-Zaire's 1996–97 civil war in the context of evolving patterns of military conflict in Africa in the era of independence.&quot;] ''Conflict Studies Journal at the University of New Brunswick'', Vol. XIX No. 2, Fall 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, a coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaire under the cover of a small group of Tutsi militia to fight the Hutu militia, overthrow the government of Mobutu, and ultimately control the mineral resources of Zaire. They were soon joined by various Zairean politicians, who had been unsuccessfully opposing the dictatorship of Mobutu for many years, and now saw an opportunity for them in the invasion of Zaire by two of the region's strongest military forces.

This new expanded coalition of two foreign armies and some longtime opposition figures, led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], became known as the [[Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre]] (AFDL). They were seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu and controlling his country's wealth. In May 1997, Mobutu fled the country and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

A few months later, President Laurent-Désiré Kabila thanked all the foreign military forces that helped him to overthrow Mobutu, and asked them to return back to their countries because he was concerned that the Rwandan military officers who were running his army were plotting a coup d'état against him in order to give the presidency to a Tutsi who would report directly to the President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame. This move was not well received by the Rwandan and Ugandan governments, who wanted to control their big neighbour.

Consequently, Rwandan troops in DRC retreated to Goma and launched a new militia group or rebel movement called the [[Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie]] (RCD), led by Tutsis, to fight against their former ally, President Kabila. To counterbalance the power and influence of Rwanda in DRC, the Ugandan troops instigated the creation of another rebel movement called the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC), led by the Congolese warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]], son of Congolese billionaire Bemba Saolona. The two rebel movements started the second war by attacking the DRC's still fragile army in 1998, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops. Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia became involved militarily on the side of the government to defend a fellow SADC member.

Kabila was assassinated in 2001 and was succeeded by his son [[Joseph Kabila]], who upon taking office called for multilateral peace talks to end the war. In February 2001 a peace deal was brokered between Kabila, Rwanda and Uganda, leading to the apparent withdrawal of foreign troops. [[UN]] peacekeepers, [[MONUC]], arrived in April 2001. The conflict was reignited in January 2002 by ethnic clashes in the northeast, and both Uganda and Rwanda then halted their withdrawal and sent in more troops. Talks between Kabila and the rebel leaders led to the signing of a peace accord in which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. Much of the conflict was focused on gaining control of substantial natural resources in the country, including [[diamond]]s, [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[coltan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1076399.stm |title=Country Profiles |publisher=BBC News |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Refugees in Congo.jpeg|thumb|250px|The people of the [[Congo River]] in 2008]]

DR Congo had a [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] until the election was over. A constitution was approved by voters, and on 30 July 2006 the Congo held its [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|first multi-party elections]] since independence in 1960. After this Joseph Kabila took 45% of the votes and his opponent, Jean-Pierre Bemba took 20%. The disputed results of this election turned into an all-out battle between the supporters of the two parties in the streets of the capital, [[Kinshasa]], from 20–22 August 2006 . Sixteen people died before police and the UN mission MONUC took control of the city. A new election was held on 29 October 2006, which Kabila won with 70% of the vote. Bemba made multiple public statements saying the election had &quot;irregularities&quot;, despite the fact that every neutral observer praised the elections. On 6 December 2006 the Transitional Government came to an end as Joseph Kabila was sworn in as President.

The fragility of the state government has allowed continued conflict and human rights abuses. In the ongoing [[Kivu conflict]], the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) continues to threaten the Rwandan border and the [[Banyarwanda]]; Rwanda supports [[RCD-Goma]] rebels against Kinshasa; a rebel offensive at the end of October 2008 caused a refugee crisis in [[Ituri Province|Ituri]], where MONUC has proved unable to contain the numerous militia and groups driving the [[Ituri conflict]]. In the northeast, [[Joseph Kony]]'s [[LRA]] moved from their original bases in Uganda (where they have fought a 20-year rebellion) and South Sudan to DR Congo in 2005 and set up camps in the Garamba National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fessy |first=Thomas |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7685235.stm |title=Congo terror after LRA rebel raids |publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7635719.stm |title=thousands flee LRA in DR Congo |publisher=BBC News |date=25 September 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In northern [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], the [[Mai-Mai]] created by Laurent Kabila slipped out of the control of Kinshasa.

VOA News, 21 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The death toll is due to widespread disease and famine; reports indicate that almost half of the individuals who have died are children under the age of 5.

The long and brutal conflict in the DRC has caused massive suffering for civilians, with estimates of millions dead either directly or indirectly as a result of the fighting. There have been frequent reports of weapon bearers killing civilians, destroying property, widespread sexual violence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=2104 &quot;IHL and Sexual Violence&quot;].

Few people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been unaffected by the armed conflict. A survey conducted in 2009 by the ICRC and Ipsos shows that three quarters (76%) of the people interviewed have been affected in some way–either personally or due to the wider consequences of armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/views-from-field-report-240609/$File/Our-World-Views-from-DRC-I-ICRC.pdf DRC, Opinion survey 2009], by ICRC and Ipsos&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of [[Mbuti]] [[pygmies]], told the UN's Indigenous People's Forum that during the war, his people were hunted down and eaten as though they were game animals. In neighbouring North Kivu province there has been [[cannibalism]] by a group known as ''Les Effaceurs'' (&quot;the erasers&quot;) who wanted to clear the land of people to open it up for mineral exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article402970.ece Pygmies struggle to survive].

====International Community Response ====
The response of the international community has been incommensurate with the scale of the disaster resulting from the war in the Congo. Its support for political and diplomatic efforts to end the war has been relatively
consistent, but it has taken no effective steps to abide by repeated pledges to demand accountability for the war crimes and crimes against humanity that were routinely committed in Congo. United Nations Security Council and the U.N. Secretary-General have frequently denounced human rights abuses and the humanitarian disaster that the war unleashed on the local population. But they had shown little will to tackle the responsibility of occupying powers for the atrocities taking place in areas under their control, areas where the worst violence in the country took place. Hence Rwanda, like Uganda, has escaped any significant sanction for its role. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2002/08/20/war-crimes-kisangani-0 |title=Human Rights Watch: War Crimes in Kisangani |publisher=Hrw.org |date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Cg-map.png|thumb|right|The map of Democratic Republic of Congo from the CIA World Factbook]]
{{Main|Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

The Congo is situated at the heart of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and is bounded by (clockwise from the southwest) [[Angola]], the South Atlantic Ocean, the [[Republic of Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Tanzania]] across [[Lake Tanganyika]], and [[Zambia]]. The country lies between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6°N]] and [[14th parallel south|14°S]], and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[32nd meridian east|32°E]]. It straddles the [[Equator]], with one-third to the North and two-thirds to the South. The size of Congo, {{convert|2345408|km2|sqmi}}, is slightly greater than the combined areas of Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway.

As a result of its equatorial location, the Congo experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world. The annual rainfall can total upwards of {{convert|80|in|mm}} in some places, and the area sustains the Congo Rainforest, the second largest rain forest in the world (after that of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]). This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast, low-lying central [[drainage basin|basin]] of the river, which slopes toward the Atlantic Ocean in the west. This area is surrounded by plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest, by mountainous terraces in the west, and dense grasslands extending beyond the [[Congo River]] in the north. High, glaciated mountains are found in the extreme eastern region ([[Rwenzori Mountains]]).

The [[tropical climate]] has also produced the Congo River system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through, though they are not mutually exclusive. The name for the Congo state is derived in part from the river. The river basin (meaning the Congo River and all of its myriad tributaries) occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The river and its tributaries (major offshoots include the [[Kasai River|Kasai]], [[Sangha]], [[Ubangi]], [[Aruwimi]], and [[Lulonga River|Lulonga]]) form the backbone of Congolese economics and transportation. They have a dramatic impact on the daily lives of the people.
{{MapLibrary|dem_congo_sat.jpg|Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

The sources of the Congo are in the [[Albertine Rift Mountains]] that flank the western branch of the [[East African Rift]], as well as [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Mweru]]. The river flows generally west from [[Kisangani]] just below [[Boyoma Falls]], then gradually bends southwest, passing by [[Mbandaka]], joining with the [[Ubangi River]], and running into the [[Pool Malebo]] (Stanley Pool). [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]] are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool (see NASA image).

Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons (collectively known as the [[Livingstone Falls]]), and then running past [[Boma, Congo|Boma]] into the Atlantic Ocean. The river also has the second-largest flow and the second-largest [[drainage basin|watershed]] of any river in the world (trailing the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] in both respects). The river and a 45&amp;nbsp;km wide strip of land on its north bank provide the country's only outlet to the Atlantic.

The previously mentioned [[Albertine Rift]] plays a key role in shaping the Congo's geography. Not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous, but due to the rift's [[tectonics|tectonic]] activities, this area also experiences [[volcanic]] activity, occasionally with loss of life. The geologic activity in this area also created the famous [[African Great Lakes]], three of which lie on the Congo's eastern frontier: [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] (known previously as Lake Mobutu), [[Lake Edward]], and Lake Tanganyika.

The Rift Valley has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the Congo, making it accessible to mining. Cobalt, copper, cadmium, industrial and gem-quality diamonds, gold, silver, zinc, manganese, tin, germanium, uranium, radium, bauxite, iron ore, and coal are all found in plentiful supply, especially in the Congo's southeastern Katanga region.
[[File:Nyiragongo2004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Nyiragongo]]]]
[[File:La rivière Lulilaka, parc national de Salonga, 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Salonga National Park]]]]
On 17 January 2002 [[Mount Nyiragongo]] erupted in Congo, with the lava running out at {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|50|yd|m}} wide. One of the three streams of extremely fluid lava flowed through the nearby city of [[Goma]], killing 45 and leaving 120,000 homeless. Four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the eruption. The lava poisoned the water of [[Lake Kivu]], killing fish. Only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol. The lava passed the airport but ruined the runway, entrapping several airplanes. Six months after the 2002 eruption, nearby [[Mount Nyamulagira]] also erupted. Mount Nyamulagira also erupted in 2006 and again in January 2010.

[[World Wide Fund for Nature]] [[ecoregion]]s located in the Congo include:
* [[Central Congolian lowland forests]] – home to the rare [[bonobo]] primate
* The [[Eastern Congolian swamp forests]] along the Congo River
* The [[Northeastern Congolian lowland forests]], with one of the richest concentrations of primates in the world
* [[Southern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]]
* A large section of the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]]
* The [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] region of high forest runs along the eastern borders of the country.

[[File:Joseph kabila.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Joseph Kabila]] (November 2003)]]
After a four-year interim between two constitutions that established new political institutions at the various levels of all branches of government, as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country, politics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have finally settled into a stable [[presidential system|presidential]] [[democratic republic]].
The 2003 transitional constitution&lt;ref&gt;[[s:fr:Constitution de la transition de la République démocratique du Congo (2003)|Full text of constitution (French)]]&lt;/ref&gt; established a system composed of a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] with a [[Senate of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Senate]] and a [[National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|National Assembly]]. The Senate had, among other things, the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country. The executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet, headed by a [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] and four vice presidents. The President was also the Commander-in Chief of the armed forces. 

The transition constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary, headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers.

The 2006 constitution, also known as the Constitution of the Third Republic, came into effect in February 2006. It had concurrent authority, however, with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the July 2006 elections. Under the new constitution, the legislature remained bicameral; the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government, led by a Prime Minister, appointed from the party with the majority at the National Assembly. The government&amp;nbsp; – not the President&amp;nbsp; – is responsible to the Parliament.

The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments with the creation of provincial parliaments, which have oversight over the Governor, head of the provincial government, whom they elect.

The new constitution also saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court, which was divided into three new institutions. The constitutional interpretation prerogative of the Supreme Court is now held by the [[Constitutional Court of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Constitutional Court]].

[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] ruled Zaire from 1965 to 1997. A relative explained how the government illicitly collected revenue: &quot;Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million.

== Foreign relations and military ==
{{See also|Foreign relations of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

The global growth in demand for scarce raw materials and the industrial surges in China, India, Russia, Brazil and other [[developing countries]] require that [[developed countries]] employ new, integrated and responsive strategies for identifying and ensuring, on a continual basis, an adequate supply of strategic and critical materials required for their security needs. Highlighting the DR Congo's importance to United States national security, the effort to establish an elite Congolese unit is the latest push by the U.S. to professionalize armed forces in this strategically important region.

There are economic and strategic incentives to bringing more security to the Congo, which is rich in natural resources such as [[cobalt]]. Cobalt is a strategic and critical metal used in many diverse industrial and military applications. The largest use of cobalt is in [[superalloys]], which are used to make [[jet engine]] parts. Cobalt is also used in [[magnetic alloys]] and in cutting and wear-resistant materials such as cemented [[carbides]]. The [[chemical industry]] consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical processing; drying agents for paints and inks; ground coats for porcelain enamels; decolourisers for ceramics and glass; and pigments for ceramics, paints, and plastics. The country contains 80 percent of the world's cobalt reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Vandiver |url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=69718 |title=An April 2009 report to Congress by the National Defense Stockpile Center |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although citizens of the DRC are among the poorest in the world, having the second lowest [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|nominal GDP per capita]], the Democratic Republic of Congo is widely considered to be the richest country in the world regarding natural resources; its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of US$ 24 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DR+Congo's+$24+trillion+fortune.-a0193800184 |title=DR Congo's $24 trillion fortune. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsaboutcongo.com/2009/03/congo-with-24-trillion-in-mineral-wealth-but-still-poor.html |title=Congo with $24 Trillion in Mineral Wealth BUT still Poor |publisher=News About Congo |date=15 March 2009 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuepper |first=Justin |url=http://theotcinvestor.com/mining-companies-could-see-big-profits-in-congo-855/ |title=Mining Companies Could See Big Profits in Congo « |publisher=Theotcinvestor.com |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a nation endowed with resources of vast potential wealth, has declined drastically since the mid-1980s. At the time of its independence in 1960, DRC was the second most industrialized country in Africa after [[South Africa]], it boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive.&lt;ref&gt;Elle &quot;[http://www.societecivile.cd/node/4243 pouvait se prévaloir]&lt;/ref&gt; The two recent conflicts (the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s), which began in 1996, have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, have increased external debt, and have resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war, and associated [[famine]] and disease. [[Malnutrition]] affects approximately two thirds of the country's population.

Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. The war has intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption, inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations.

Conditions improved in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. A number of [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] missions have met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President Joseph Kabila has begun implementing reforms. Much economic activity lies outside the GDP data. A [[United Nations Human Development Index]] report shows human development to be one of the worst in decades. Through 2011 the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the lowest Human Development Index of the 187 ranked countries, classified lower than [[Niger]] despite a higher margin of improvement than the latter country from 2010's numbers.

=== Largest cities ===

{{Largest cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

=== Ethnic groups ===
The United Nations 2009 estimated the population at 66 million people,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo Democratic Republic of the Congo]&quot;. UNdata.&lt;/ref&gt; having increased rapidly despite the war from 39.1 million in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+zr0053) Zaire - Population]&quot;. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 250 ethnic groups have been identified and named. The most numerous people are the [[Kongo people|Kongo]], [[Luba people|Luba]], and [[Mongo people|Mongo]]. About 600,000 [[Congo Pygmies|Pygmies]] are the aboriginal people of the DR Congo.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/22/1053585643490.html Pygmies want UN tribunal to address cannibalism].&quot; ''Sydney Morning Herald''. 23 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Although several hundred local languages and dialects are spoken, the linguistic variety is bridged both by widespread use of French and intermediary languages such as [[Kongo language|Kongo]], [[Tshiluba language|Tshiluba]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Lingala language|Lingala]].

=== Migration ===
[[File:IDPs at Kiwanja.jpg|thumb|Internally Displaced People in [[North Kivu]] in 2007]]
Given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable data. However, evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines. Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers – products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes Region]] – constituting an important subset of the population in the country. Additionally, the country's large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced. According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of [[immigration|immigrants]] in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers in particular, partly due to the predominance of the [[informal economy]] in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOMProfile&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=41_42&amp;products_id=592|publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=Migration en République Démocratique du Congo: Profil national 2009|year=2009|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Figures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. New destination countries include [[South Africa]] and various points en route to Europe. In addition to being a host country, the DRC has also produced a considerable number of [[refugees]] and [[asylum-seekers]] located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to [[UNHCR]], there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living in other African countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOMProfile&quot;/&gt;

According to Yakin Ertürk, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women who toured eastern Congo in July 2007, violence against women in North and South Kivu included 'unimaginable brutality'. 'Armed groups attack local communities, loot, rape, kidnap women and children, and make them work as sexual slaves,' Ertürk said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Kindu church.jpg|190px|thumb|right|Church in [[Kindu]], DRC.]]

[[Christianity]] is the majority religion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by about 95% of the population. [[Indigenous religion|Animism]] accounts for about 1%.&lt;ref name=DHS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minisanterdc.cd/fr/documents/eds.pdf |title=Republique Démocratique du Congo Enquête Démographique et de Santé (EDS-RDC) 2007 [FR208&amp;#93; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of a population of 71 million, there are about 35 million [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] in the country, representing about half of the total population&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cg.html The World Factbook- Congo, Democratic Republic of the.] Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; There are six [[archdiocese]]s and 41 [[dioceses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview5.html#cd The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church: Structured View of Dioceses in Africa - DRC]&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of the Roman Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of Congo is difficult to overestimate.

The church owns and manages an extensive network of hospitals, schools, and clinics, as well as many diocesan economic enterprises, including farms, ranches, stores, and artisans' shops.

[[Kimbanguism]] was seen as a threat to the colonial regime and was banned by the Belgians. Kimbanguism, officially &quot;the church of Christ on Earth by the prophet Simon Kimbangu&quot;, now has about three million members,&lt;ref name=Adherents&gt;[http://adherents.com/adhloc/Wh_365.html &quot;Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo)&quot;, Adherents.com – Religion by Location.] Sources quoted are ''CIA Factbook'' (1998), 'official government web site' of ''Democratic Republic of Congo''. Retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; primarily among the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] of [[Bas-Congo]] and [[Kinshasa]].

Sixty-two of the Protestant denominations in the country are federated under the umbrella of the [[Church of Christ in Congo]] or CCC (in French, ''Église du Christ au Congo'' or ECC). It is often simply referred to as 'The Protestant Church', since it covers most of the 35% of the population who are [[Protestants]]. 

[[Islam in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Islam]] is the faith of 1.5% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHS&quot; /&gt; Islam was introduced and mainly spread by Arab traders/merchants.&lt;ref&gt;referenced by the European Christian orientalist Timothy Insoll.

The first members of the [[Baha'i Faith]] to live in the country came from Uganda in 1953. Four years later the first local administrative council was elected. In 1970 the National Spiritual Assembly (national administrative council) was first elected.  Though the religion was banned in the 1970s and 80s, due to misrepresentations of foreign governments, the ban was lifted by the end of the 1980s.  In 2012 plans were announced to build a national [[Baha'i House of Worship]] in the country.

Traditional religions embody such concepts as [[monotheism]], [[animism]], [[vitalism]], [[spirit worship|spirit]] and [[ancestor worship]], [[witchcraft]], and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups. The syncretic sects often merge elements of Christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Under the weight of poverty, new and disturbing variants on ancient beliefs have become widespread, lead by US inspired Pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations particularly against children and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Kinshasa tales of the invisible City By Filip De Boeck&lt;/ref&gt; In these practices of children being accused of witchcraft and sent away from homes and family often to live on the street.

=== Languages ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
[[File:Map - DR Congo, major languages.svg|thumb|Major Bantu languages in the Congo]]
{{Main|Languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[French language|French]] is the [[official language]] of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is meant to be an ethnically neutral language, to ease communication among the many different ethnic groups of the Congo.

There are an estimated total of 242 languages spoken in the country. Out of these, only four have the status of national languages: [[Kikongo language|Kikongo]] ([[Kituba language|Kituba]]), [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Tshiluba language|Tshiluba]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. Although some people speak these regional, or trade languages, as first languages, most of the population speak them as a second language after their own tribal language. Primary education tends to be in the national Bantu language of the region, and secondary education, and beyond, tends to be in French.

Lingala was made the official language of the colonial army, the &quot;[[Force Publique]]&quot; under Belgian colonial rule. But since the recent rebellions, a good part of the army in the East also uses Swahili where it is prevalent.

When the country was a Belgian colony, it had already instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period. During the colonial period both Dutch and French were the official languages but French was by far the most important.

About 24,320,000 people of DRC speak French either as a first or second language.

== Culture ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
{{Main|Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:Hemba male figure1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Hemba]] male statue]]
The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s and their differing ways of life throughout the country&amp;nbsp; — from the mouth of the [[Congo River|River Congo]] on the coast, upriver through the [[rainforest]] and [[savanna]] in its centre, to the more densely populated mountains in the far east. Since the late 19th century, traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by [[colonialism]], the struggle for independence, the stagnation of the Mobutu era, and most recently, the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s. Despite these pressures, the [[convention (norm)|customs]] and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their individuality. The country's 60 million inhabitants are mainly rural. The 30 percent who live in urban areas have been the most open to [[Western culture|Western]] influences.
[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Yombe people|Yombe]]-sculpture, 19th century]]
Another notable feature in Congo culture is its [[sui generis]] music. The DROC has blended its ethnic musical sources with [[Cuba]]n [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]], and [[merengue music|merengue]] to give birth to [[soukous]]. Influential figures of soukous and its offshoots: [[N'dombolo]] and [[Rumba rock]], are [[Grand Kalle]], [[Nico Kasanda|Dr. Nico]], [[Franco Luambo]], [[Tabu Ley]], [[Lutumba Simaro]], [[King Kester Emeneya]], [[Tshala Muana]] [[Koffi Olomide]], [[JB Mpiana]], [[Werrason]], Kanda Bongo, [[Ray Lema]], Mpongo Love, Abeti Masikini, Reddy Amisi, [Pasnas] Pepe Kalle, [[Fally Ipupa]], [[Awilo Longomba]], [[Gatho Buvens]], [[Ferre Gola]] and [[Nyoka Longo]].

Other African nations produce music genres that are derived from Congolese soukous. Some of the African bands sing in [[Lingala]], one of the main languages in the DRC. The same Congolese soukous, under the guidance of &quot;le sapeur&quot;, [[Papa Wemba]], has set the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in expensive designers' clothes', they became to be known as the 4th generation of the congolese music and they mostly come from the former well known band Wenge Musica.

The Congo is also known for its art. Traditional art includes masks and wooden statues. Notable contemporary artists and fashion designers are [[Odette Maniema Krempin]], [[Lema Kusa]], Henri Kalama Akulez, Nshole, Mavinga, Claudy Khan et Chéri Samba.

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:DRC classroom.jpg|thumb|A classroom in Democratic Republic of the Congo]]
In 2001 the [[literacy]] rate was estimated to be 67.2% (80.9% male and 54.1% female).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html |title=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The education system in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is governed by three government ministries: the ''Ministère de l'Enseignement Primaire, Secondaire et Professionnel (MEPSP''), the ''Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et Universitaire (MESU)'' and the  ''Ministère des Affaires Sociales (MAS)''. The educational system in the DRC is similar to that of Belgium. In 2002, there were over 19,000 primary schools serving 160,000 students; and 8,000 [[secondary schools]] serving 110,000 students. Primary education is free and compulsory (Article 43 of the 2005 Congolese Constitution).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_d%C3%A9mocratique_du_Congo#Article_43 Constitution de la République démocratique du Congo - Wikisource&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; In 2000, 65 percent of children ages 10 to 14 years were attending school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; As a result of the 6-year civil war, over 5.2 million children in the country receive no education.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;&quot;Congo, Democratic Republic of the.&quot; [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2005/tda2005.pdf ''2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor''].

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:First train in Kindu, DRC.jpg|thumb|right|Train from [[Lubumbashi]] arriving in [[Kindu]] on newly refurbished line]]
Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been difficult. The terrain and climate of the [[Congo Basin]] present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country. Furthermore, chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflict has led to serious under-investment over many years.
On the other hand, the Democratic Republic of Congo has thousands of kilometres of [[navigable]] [[waterway]]s, and traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around approximately two-thirds of the country.

All air carriers certified by the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been banned from European Union airports by the European Commission, because of inadequate safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/doc/list_en.pdf List of airlines banned within the EU] – Official EC list, updated 2011-04-20. Retrieved 20 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
{{Main|Wildlife of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

The [[rainforest]]s of the Democratic Republic of the Congo contain great [[biodiversity]], including many rare and [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, such as the [[common chimpanzee]] and the [[bonobo]] (formerly known as the Pygmy Chimpanzee), the [[forest elephant]], [[mountain gorilla]], [[okapi]] and [[white rhino]]. Five of the country's [[national park]]s are listed as [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[Garamba National Park|Garumba]], [[Kahuzi-Biega National Park|Kahuzi-Biega]], [[Salonga National Park|Salonga]] and [[Virunga National Park]]s, and the [[Okapi Wildlife Reserve]]. 
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most biodiverse African country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/468283.html |title = Lambertini, A Naturalist's Guide to the Tropics, excerpt |accessdate =30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The civil war and resultant poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity. Many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work. All five sites are listed by [[UNESCO]] as World Heritage In Danger. The Democratic Republic of Congo is also home to some [[cryptid]]s, such as [[Mokele mbembe]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Jerome (1993) &quot;Unexplained! 347 Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences, and Puzzling Physical Phenomena.&quot; Visible Ink Press, ISBN 0-8103-9436-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackal, R.

Over the past century or so, the DRC has developed into the center of what has been called the Central African &quot;[[bushmeat]]&quot; problem, which is regarded by many as a major environmental as well as socio-economic crisis. &quot;Bushmeat&quot; is another word for the meat of wild animals. It is typically obtained through trapping, usually with wire snares, or otherwise with shotguns, poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the DRC's numerous military conflicts.

The &quot;bushmeat crisis&quot; has emerged in the DRC mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the Congolese people and a lack of education about the dangers of eating it. A rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions has forced many Congolese to become dependent on bushmeat, either as a means of acquiring income (hunting the meat and selling), or are dependent on it for food. Unemployment and urbanization throughout Central Africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of [[Kinshasa]] into the prime market for commercial bushmeat.
This combination has caused not only widespread endangerment of local fauna, but has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat. This overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans. The hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the Congo's [[rainforest]]s (from corporate [[logging]], in addition to farmers clearing out forest for agriculture), which allows hunters much easier access to previously unreachable jungle terrain, while simultaneously eroding away at the [[habitats]] of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.bushmeat.org/pdf/19%20May%2001%20AM%2001%20Policy-Fotabong%20and%20Gartlan.pdf &quot;The Bushman crisis: long term solutions – international, national and local policies&quot;]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}|67.9&amp;nbsp;KB}}, ''[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deforestation]] is accelerating in Central Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/news/deforestation-accelerating-in-central-africa.html Deforestation accelerating in Central Africa], 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A case that has particularly alarmed conservationists is that of [[primates]]. The Congo is inhabited by three distinct great ape species&amp;nbsp; — the [[Common chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes''), the [[bonobo]] (''Pan paniscus'') and the [[gorilla]]. It is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild. The chimpanzee and bonobo are the closest living evolutionary relatives to humans.

Much concern has been raised about [[ape extinction|Great ape extinction]]. Because of hunting and habitat destruction, the chimpanzee and the gorilla, both of whose population once numbered in the millions, have now dwindled down to only about 200,000&lt;ref name = &quot;gorillas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=556&amp;ArticleID=6033&amp;l=en&amp;t=long|title= Gorillas on Thin Ice|author= |date= 15 January 2009|work= |publisher= [[United Nations Environment Programme]]|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; gorillas, 100,000&lt;ref name = &quot;chimpanzees&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Linda Vigilant|year= 2004|title= Chimpanzees|journal= Current Biology|publisher= |volume= 14|issue= 10|pages= R369–R371|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VRT-4CKF2HJ-7&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F25%2F2004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=f28bbfa3f0610b7d3afc4aad7b522f61|doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2004.05.006|pmid= 15186757|pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; chimpanzees and possibly only about 10,000&lt;ref name=&quot;chimpanzees&quot;/&gt; bonobos.
