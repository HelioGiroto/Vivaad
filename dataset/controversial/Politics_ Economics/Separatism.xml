{{Selfref|For Wikipedia's meaning of separatism, see [[m:Separatism|Separatism]].}}
{{Politics}}

'''Separatism''' is the advocacy of a state of cultural, ethnic, tribal, religious, racial, governmental or gender separation from the larger group. While it often refers to full political [[secession]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/separatism Free Dictionary]; [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/separatism Merriam Webster dictionary]; [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-separatist.html ''The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current= English 2008''].&lt;/ref&gt; separatist groups may seek nothing more than greater autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;R. Harris, Jerry Harris, ''The Nation in the Global Era: Conflict and Transformation'', Brill, 2009,
[http://books.google.com/books?id=UQQujqyOJJIC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=separatism+greater+autonomy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h8nVTKHnOsP88AaEsNnWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=separatism%20greater%20autonomy&amp;f=false p. 320], ISBN 90-04-17690-X, 9789004176904&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups refer to their organizing as [[independence]], [[self-determination]], [[Partition (politics)|partition]] or [[decolonization]] movements instead of, or in addition to, [[autonomist]], separatist or secession movements.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  While some critics may equate separatism and [[religious segregation]], [[racial segregation]] or [[sexual segregation]], separatists argue that separation by choice is not the same as government-enforced segregation and may serve useful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;John Leo, [http://www.city-journal.org/html/eon2007-06-13jl.html &quot;Let the Segregation Commence, Separatist graduations proliferate at UCLA&quot;], [[City Journal (New York)|''City Journal'']], June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Levit, [http://home.law.uiuc.edu/lrev/publications/2000s/2005/2005_2/Levit.pdf Embracing Segregation: The Jurisprudence of Choice and Diversity in Race and Sex Separatism in Schools (PDF)], ''University of Illinois Law Review'', August 29, 2005, 455.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen W. Arenson, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/19/education/19male.html CUNY Program to Help Black Men Is Called Discriminatory], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Betty A. Dobratz, Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_200607/ai_n16855771 Strategy of White Separatism], ''Journal of Political and Military Sociology'', Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy B. Howell, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2773 Radical Relatedness and Feminist Separatism.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations for separatism==
Groups may have one or more motivations for separation, including&lt;ref&gt;Metta Spencer, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Dz6vDcL8Q90C ''Separatism: Democracy and Disintegration''], Rowan &amp; Littlefield, 1998, 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;:
* emotional resentment of rival communities
* protection from ethnic cleansing and genocide
* justified resistance by victims of oppression, including denigration of their language, culture or religion
* propaganda by those who hope to gain politically from intergroup conflict and hatred
* the economic and political dominance of one group that does not share power and privilege in an egalitarian fashion
* economic motivations: seeking to end economic exploitation by more powerful group or, conversely, to escape economic redistribution from a richer to a poorer group
* preservation of threatened religious, language or other cultural tradition
* destabilization from one separatist movement giving rise to others
* geopolitical power vacuum from breakup of larger states or empires
* continuing fragmentation as more and more states break up.
* feeling that the perceived nation was added to the larger state by illegitimate means
* the perception that the state can no longer support one's own group or has betrayed their interests

==Governmental responses==
How far separatist demands will go toward full independence, and whether groups pursue constitutional and nonviolent or armed violence, depend on a variety of economic, political, social and cultural factors, including movement leadership&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/one/prol/prol01/index.php?click_key=1 Link to:]
Chima, Jugdep. &quot;Effects of Political Leadership on Ethnic Separatist Movements in India&quot; Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association, Palmer House Hotel, Chicago, Illinois, April 12, 2007 (PDF); Chima, Jugdep. &quot;How Does Political Leadership Affect the Trajectories of Ethnic Separatist Insurgencies?: Comparative Evidence from Movements in India&quot; Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Marriott Wardman Park, [[Omni Shoreham]], Washington Hilton, Washington, D.C., September 01, 2005 (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; and the government's response.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot;&gt;See D.L. Horowitz's &quot;Patterns of Ethnic Separatism&quot;, originally published in ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', 1981, vol 23, 165-95. Republished in John A. Hall, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=9_matAX1z8cC  The State: Critical Concepts]'', Routledge, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Governments may respond in a number of ways, some of which are mutually exclusive. Some include:&lt;ref&gt;Metta Spencer, 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* accede to separatist demands
* improve the circumstances of disadvantaged minorities, be they religious, linguistic, territorial, economic or political
* adopt &quot;asymmetric federalism&quot; where different states have different relations to the central government depending on separatist demands or considerations
* allow minorities to win in political disputes about which they feel strongly, through parliamentary voting, referendum, etc.
* settle for a [[confederation]] or a [[commonwealth]] relationship where there are only limited ties among states.
Some governments suppress any separatist movement in their own country, but support separatism in other countries.

==Types of separatist groups==
Separatist groups practice a form of [[identity politics]] - &quot;political activity and theorizing founded in the shared experiences of injustice of members of certain social groups.&quot;  Such groups believe attempts at integration with dominant groups compromise their identity and ability to pursue greater self-determination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/ Identity Politics], [[Stanford University]] Encyclopedia of Philosophy, November 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, economic and political factors usually are critical in creating strong separatist movements as opposed to less ambitious identity movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot;/&gt;

''See more complete lists of [[List of historical autonomist and secessionist movements|historical]] and [[List of active autonomist and secessionist movements|active]] autonomist and secessionist movements, as well as a [[list of unrecognized countries]].''

===Religious===
[[Religion|Religious]] separatist groups and sects want to withdraw from some larger religious groups and/or believe they should interact primarily with co-religionists.
* English Christians in the 16th and 17th centuries who wished to separate from the [[Church of England]] and form independent local churches were influential politically under [[Oliver Cromwell]], who was himself a separatist. They were eventually called [[Congregationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042265/Separatist#277127.hook Encyclopædia Britannica on religious separatists.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] who established the first successful colony in [[New England]] were separatists.&lt;ref&gt;John Abbot Goodwin, ''The Pilgrim republic: an historical review of the colony of New Plymouth...'', Houghton Mifflin Company, 1888, [http://books.google.com/books?id=1h86ThQYxgEC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=pilgrims+separatists&amp;ei=6tt6SunrKJHyyAT46JnEDA&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=pilgrims separatists&amp;f=false p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Christian separatist groups in [[Maluku Sovereignty Front|Indonesia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2202709.stm Christian separatist on trial in Indonesia], [[BBC]], August 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Brummitt, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-51830871.html Christian separatist leader threatens to raise independence flags in Maluku], [[Associated Press]], April 5, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; India&lt;ref&gt;Syed Zarir Hussain, [http://www.mail-archive.com/goanet@goacom.com/msg03883.html Christian separatist group in Tripura target tribal Hindus], Indo-Asian News Service, December 31, 2002/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Carolina]] (United States).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/jun/09/no-headline---le1fcbottom09/?printer=1/ Christian separatist ready for new home], ''Ventura County Star'', June 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?S=3956568&amp;nav=0RaP Colorado Rep. disavows ties to SC Christian separatist group], [[Associated Press]], October 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Catholics]] in [[Northern Ireland]].
* [[Zionism]] sought the creation of the state of [[Israel]] as a [[Jewish]] homeland. This resulted in religious separatism between the Jewish Israelis, and Muslim and Christian Palestinians following the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]]. [[Simon Dubnow]], who was ambivalent toward Zionism, formulated [[Jewish Autonomism]] which was adopted in eastern Europe by Jewish political parties such as the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] and his own [[Folkspartei]] before World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Koppel S. Pinson, ''Simon Dubnow'', p. 13-69, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Partition of India|Partition]] of India and (later Pakistan ''and'' [[Bangladesh]]) arose as a result of separatism on the part of both Hindus and Muslims, as well as strong national identities on both sides.
* [[Religion in Russia|Russia]], [[Religion in China|China]], [[Religion in India|India]], [[Religion in Thailand|Thailand]] and the [[Religion in the Philippines|Philippines]] have Muslim-separatist groups.
* [[Sikh]]s in India sought an independent nation of [[Khalistan]] during the 1970s and 1980s. The [[Khalistan movement]] inside India largely ended with the Indian military [[Operation Blue Star]] against Sikh militants and the retaliatory assassination of the then [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Indira Gandhi]]. However, some in the Sikh diaspora still support such a movement.&lt;ref&gt;Blbir Punj, [http://www.sikhtimes.com/news_061605a.html The Ghost of Khalistan], [http://sikhtimes.com SikhTimes.com], June 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tibetan Buddhists]] in China.

[[Ethnic]] separatism is based more on cultural and linguistic differences than [[Religion|religious]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] differences, which also may exist.  Notable ethnic separatist movements include:

Today a small [[Raza Unida Party]] continues with similar goals.

===Racial===
{{Globalize|section|date = August 2011}}
Some groups seek to separate from others along [[Racism|racialist]] lines.  They oppose inter-marriage with other races and seek separate schools, businesses, churches and other institutions or even separate societies, territories and governments.[[image:Aztlán in United States (US48).svg|thumb|Territories considered for [[Reconquista (Mexico)|Republica del Norte]] (&quot;Aztlán&quot;)]]
* [[Black separatism]] (or [[black nationalism]]) is a reaction to slavery in the United states and has been advanced by black leaders like [[Marcus Garvey]] and the [[Nation of Islam]]. [[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] like [[New York University]]'s [[Derrick Bell]] and [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]'s [[Richard Delgado]] argue the American legal, education and political party systems are rife with racism. They support efforts like all-black schools and dorms and question the efficacy of government-enforced integration.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Foer, [http://www.slate.com/id/1080/ Racial Integration], [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']], November 23, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 statements by Barack Obama's former pastor [[Jeremiah Wright, Jr.]] revived the issue of the current relevance of black separatism.&lt;ref&gt;Rich Barlow, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/26/theological_topic_turns_to_wright_case/Theological Topic turns to Wright case], ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'', April 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Latin American]] concepts of racial identity such as the [[bronze race]] and [[La Raza Cósmica]] found in the small separatist [[Raza Unida Party]].

* [[White separatism]] in the United States and Western Europe seeks separation and survival of the white race and limits to [[immigration]] by non-whites. According to two sociologists writing in the year 2000, most separatists now reject any ideology of [[white supremacy]], though advocacy groups continue to demonize such separatist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Betty A.

*  Most [[North American]] and many other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] groups already have a high degree of autonomy. Complete separatism is advocated by some members of the Canadian [[First Nations]], [[American Indian Movement]], [[Republic of Lakotah]] ([[Lakota Sioux]] people in [[South Dakota]]), the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] or &quot;Na-Dene&quot; Nationalists in [[Arizona]] and tribal groups in [[Eastern Oklahoma]], most notably the [[Cherokee]] people of the [[Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[Separatist feminism]] is women's choosing to separate from ostensibly male-defined, male-dominated institutions, relationships, roles and activities.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Frye, &quot;Some Reflections on Separatism and Power&quot; in ''Feminist Social Thought: A Reader'', Diana Tietjens Meyers (ed.) Routledge, 1997, 406-414.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lesbian separatism]] advocates [[lesbian]]ism as the logical result of feminism.  Some separatist feminists and lesbian separatists have chosen to live apart in [[intentional community]], [[cooperatives]], and on [[land trust]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Cheney, ''Lesbian Land'', Word Weavers Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Gay&quot; separatism including both lesbians and gay men holds they should form a community distinct and separate from other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mark K.
