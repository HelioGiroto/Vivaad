'''Asian Americans''' are [[United States|Americans]] of [[Asian people|Asian descent]]. The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] definition of ''Asians'' refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the [[East Asia|Far East]], Southeast Asia, or the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It includes people who indicated their race(s) as &quot;Asian&quot; or reported entries such as &quot;[[Chinese American|Chinese]],&quot; &quot;[[Filipino American|Filipino]],&quot; &quot;[[Indian American|Indian]],&quot; &quot;[[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]],&quot; &quot;[[Korean American|Korean]],&quot; &quot;[[Japanese American|Japanese]],&quot; and &quot;Other Asian&quot; or provided other detailed Asian responses. They comprise 4.8% of the U.S. population alone, while people who are Asian combined with at least one other race make up 5.6%.&lt;ref name=c2010/&gt;

The term ''Asian American'' was used informally by activists in the 1960s who sought an alternative to the term ''[[Oriental]]'', arguing that the latter was derogatory and [[Colonialism|colonialist]]. Formal usage was introduced by academics in the early 1970s, notably by historian [[Yuji Ichioka]], who is credited with popularizing the term.&lt;ref&gt;K. Connie Kang, &quot;Yuji Ichioka, 66; Led Way in Studying Lives of Asian Americans,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'', September 7, 2002. [http://www.aasc.ucla.edu/archives/yuji66latimes.htm Reproduced at] ucla.edu by the [http://www.aasc.ucla.edu Asian American Studies Center].&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''Asian American'' is the accepted term for most formal purposes, such as government and academic research, although it is often shortened to ''Asian'' in common usage.

As with other [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] based [[ethnonym|terms]], formal and common usage have changed markedly through the short history of this term. The most significant change occurred when the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Hart-Celler Act]] of 1965 eliminated highly restrictive &quot;national origins&quot; quotas, designed, among other things, to restrict immigration of those of Asian racial background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1121504 Gabriel J. Chin, &quot;The Civil Rights Revolution Comes to Immigration Law: A New Look at the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,&quot; 75 North Carolina Law Review 273(1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; The new system, based on skills and family connections to U.S. residents, enabled significant immigration from every nation in Asia, which led to dramatic and ongoing changes in the Asian American population. As a result of these population changes, the formal and common understandings of what defines Asian American have expanded to include more of the peoples with ancestry from various parts of Asia. Because of their more recent immigration, new Asian immigrants also have had different educational, economic and other characteristics than early 20th century immigrants. They also tend to have different employment and settlement patterns in the United States.

{{As of|2008}}, Asian Americans had the highest educational attainment level and median household income of any racial demographic in the country, and they attained the highest median personal income overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Education2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2009pubs/p20-560.pdf|title=Educational Attainment in the United States: 2007|year=2009|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Income2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2009pubs/p60-236.pdf|title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2008|year=2009|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{See also|Asian_people#United_States|l1=Asian people}}
The most commonly used definition of ''Asian American'' is the US Census Bureau definition of ''Asian'',&lt;ref name=&quot;centech&quot;&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, ''[http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf1.pdf Census 2000 Summary File 1 Technical Documentation]'', 2001, at Appendix B-14. &quot;A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. It includes ''Asian Indian,'' ''Chinese,'' ''Filipino,'' ''Korean,'' ''Japanese,'' ''Vietnamese,'' and ''Other Asian.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; chiefly because the Census definitions determine many government classifications, notably for equal opportunity programs and measurements. People with origins in the Far East, Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent are included in the Census definition of Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, 2000 Census of Population, Public Law 94-171 Redistricting Data File.[http://web.archive.org/web/20011103175823/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm Race]. (archived from [http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm the original] on 2001-11-03).&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a separate &quot;Asian&quot; category in the Census is a recent addition, beginning in 1990. Since then, the Census definitions have varied. The 2000 census divided the ''[[Asian-Pacific Islander]]'' group and created ''[[Pacific Islander]]'' ethnicities as a separate category.

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], &quot;Asian person&quot; in the United States is sometimes thought of as a person of East Asian descent.&lt;ref name=Oxford1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_us1223255?rskey=D9mRoS&amp;result=2#m_en_us1223255 |title=Asian American |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/asian?view=get|title=Asian|publisher=AskOxford.com|accessdate=September 29, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080415110425/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/asian?view=get |archivedate = April 15, 2008}}{{citation broken|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0043470#m_en_gb0043470 works as of July 25, 2010, but there is no guarantee that it will remain stable as the dictionary content changes--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In vernacular usage, &quot;Asian&quot; is often used to refer to those of East Asian descent or anyone else of Asian descent with [[Epicanthic fold|epicanthic eyefolds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003030.htm Epicanthal folds]: MedicinePlus Medical Encyclopedia states that ''&quot;The presence of an epicanthal fold is normal in people of Asiatic descent&quot;'' assuming it the norm for all Asians&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Before 1980, Census forms listed particular Asian ancestries as separate groups, along with ''White'' and ''Black or Negro''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.ipums.org/usa/voliii/items1980.shtml 1980 Census: Instructions to Respondents], republished by [[IPUMS|Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]], [[Minnesota Population Center]], [[University of Minnesota]] at www.ipums.org Accessed November 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Asian Americans had also been classified as &quot;other&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GordonLee&quot;&gt;Lee, Gordon.

The definition of ''Asian American'' has variations that derive from the [[use of the word American|use of the word ''American'']] in different contexts. Immigration status, citizenship (by birthright and by naturalization), acculturation, and language ability are some variables that are used to define ''American'' for various purposes and may vary in formal and everyday usage.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Daniel B.

Asian American author Stewart Ikeda has noted, &quot;The definition of &quot;Asian American&quot; also frequently depends on who's asking, who's defining, in what context, and why...
the possible definitions of &quot;Asian-Pacific American&quot; are many, complex, and shifting...
some scholars in Asian American Studies conferences suggest that Russians, Iranians, and Israelis all might fit the field’s subject of study.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/dialogue_opinion_letters/archives/ikeda_apa_definition.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110610050512/http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/dialogue_opinion_letters/archives/ikeda_apa_definition.asp|archivedate=2011-06-10|title=What's an &quot;Asian American&quot; Now, Anyway?|author=S.

==Demographics==

{{Main|Demographics of Asian Americans|List of U.S. communities with Asian American majority populations}}

The demographics of Asian Americans describe a heterogeneous group of people in the United States who can trace their ancestry to one or more countries in Asia. Because Asian Americans total less than 6% of the entire U.S. population, the diversity of the group is often disregarded in media and news discussions of &quot;Asians&quot; or of &quot;Asian Americans.&quot; While there are some commonalities across ethnic sub-groups, there are significant differences among different Asian ethnicities that are related to each group's history.

Many settled and married [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] women. Some Island-born Chinese can claim to be 7th generation. Most Chinese, [[Koreans|Korean]] and Japanese immigrants in Hawaii arrived in the 19th century as laborers to work on sugar plantations. Later, Filipinos also came to work as laborers, attracted by the job opportunities, although they were limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opmanong.ssc.hawaii.edu/filipino/cali.html |title=Filipino Migrant Workers in California |author=The Office of Multicultural Student Services |year=1999 |publisher=University of Hawaii |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Castillo |first1=Adelaida |last2= |first2= |year=1976 |title=FILIPINO MIGRANTS IN SAN DIEGO 1900–1946 |journal=The Journal of San Diego History |volume=22 |issue=3 |publisher=San Diego Historical Society |url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/76summer/migrants.htm |accessdate=January 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous Chinese and Japanese began immigrating to the U.S. in the mid-19th century for work, because of poor economic conditions in their home nations. Many of the immigrants worked as laborers on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]]. Although the absolute numbers of Asian immigrants in the late 19th century were small compared to that of immigrants from other regions, much of it was concentrated in the West, and the increase caused some Americans to fear the change represented by the growing number of Asians. This fear was referred to as the &quot;[[yellow peril]]&quot;. The United States passed laws such as [[Asian Exclusion Act]] and [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] to sharply restrict Asian immigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1121119 Gabriel J.

===Immigration trends===
{{Main|History of Asian American immigration}}

Filipinos have been in the territories that would become the United States since the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://morro-bay.com/historical/Philippine-plaque/text-of-plaque.htm |title=Historical Landmark, declared by the Filipino American National Historical Society, California Central Coast Chapter, Dedicated October 21, 1995 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were thousands of Asians in Hawaii when it was annexed to the United States in 1898, and they all gained full US citizenship at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans'' (2nd ed. 1998) pp 133–78&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court in [[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]] (1898) interpreted the 14th amendment to mean that every person born in the United States, regardless of race or ancestry is a citizen of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Not including children of diplomats.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress passed restrictive legislation to nearly all Chinese immigration in the 1880s, which was in effect until the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Takaki, ''Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans'' (1998) pp 370–78&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese immigration was sharply curtailed by a gentleman's agreement brokered by President Theodore Roosevelt. The immigration restriction laws of the 1920s produced quotas for all countries, with Asian countries getting a zero quota.&lt;ref&gt;Takaki, ''Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans'' (1998) pp 197–211&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II legislation was passed, and judicial rulings gradually increased the ability of Asian Americans to immigrate and become [[United States nationality law|naturalized]] citizens. Immigration rapidly increased following the enactment of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965]] as well as naturalization of [[refugees#Southeast Asia (Vietnam War)|refugees]] from conflicts that occurred in the late 20th century in Southeast Asia. Asian American immigrants have a significant percentage of individuals who have already achieved professional status, a first among immigration groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php?id=19089

===Arts and entertainment===
{{Main|Asian Americans in arts and entertainment}}

Asian Americans have been involved in the [[entertainment industry]] since the first half of the 19th century, when [[Chang and Eng Bunker]] (the original &quot;Siamese Twins&quot;) became naturalized citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faizhao.blogdriver.com/faizhao/521445.html We Are Siamese Twins-Fai的分裂生活]&lt;/ref&gt; Acting roles in television, film, and theater were relatively few, and many available roles were for narrow, stereotypical characters. More recently, young Asian American comedians and film-makers have found an outlet on YouTube allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase among their fellow Asian Americans.

===Business===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|refimprove=August 2009|histinfo=August 2009}}
[[File:Jerry Yang.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Co-founder of [[Yahoo!]] [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]]]]
When Asian Americans were largely excluded from labor markets in the 19th century, they started their own businesses. They have started convenience and grocery stores, professional offices such as medical and law practices, laundries, restaurants, beauty-related ventures, hi-tech companies, and many other kinds of enterprises, becoming very successful and influential in American society. They have dramatically expanded their involvement across the American economy. Asian Americans have been disproportionately successful in the hi-tech sectors of California's Silicon Valley, as evidenced by the [[Goldsea]] 100 Compilation of America's Most Successful Asian Entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goldsea.com/Profiles/100/100.html | title=100 Most Successful Asian American Entrepreneurs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to their population base, Asian Americans today are well represented in the professional sector and tend to earn higher wages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broad racial disparities persist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15704759/|title=Broad racial disparities persist|accessdate=December 18, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061130102318/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15704759/| archivedate= November 30, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Goldsea]] compilation of Notable Asian American Professionals show that many have come to occupy high positions at leading U.S. corporations, including a surprising number as Chief Marketing Officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goldsea.com/Text/index.php?id=2457 | title=Notable Asian American Professionals }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian Americans have made major contributions to the American economy. Fashion designer and mogul [[Vera Wang]], who is famous for designing dresses for high-profile celebrities, started a clothing company, named after herself, which now offers a broad range of luxury fashion products. [[An Wang]] founded [[Wang Laboratories]] in June 1951. [[Amar Bose]] founded the [[Bose Corporation]] in 1964. [[Charles Wang]] founded [[CA, Inc.|Computer Associates]], later became its CEO and chairman. David Khym founded hip-hop fashion giant [[Southpole (clothing)]] in 1991. [[Jen-Hsun Huang]] co-founded the [[NVIDIA]] corporation in 1993. [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] co-founded [[Yahoo]]! Inc. in 1994 and became its CEO later. [[Andrea Jung]] serves as Chairman and CEO of [[Avon Products]]. [[Vinod Khosla]] was a founding CEO of [[Sun Microsystems]] and is a general partner of the prominent venture capital firm [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]]. [[Steve Chen (YouTube)|Steve Chen]] and [[Jawed Karim]] were co-creators of YouTube, and were beneficiaries of [[Google]]'s $1.65 billion acquisition of that company in 2006. In addition to contributing greatly to other fields, Asian Americans have made considerable contributions in science and technology in the United States, in such prominent innovative [[R&amp;D]] regions as [[Silicon Valley]] and [[Research Triangle|The Triangle]].

===Government and politics===

{{Main|Asian Americans in government and politics}}

Asian Americans have a high level of political incorporation in terms of their actual voting population. Since 1907, Asian Americans have been active at the national level and have had multiple officeholders at local, state and national levels. {{As of|2011|02}} the highest ranking Asian American is Senator and [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President Pro Tempore]] [[Daniel Inouye]].

===Journalism===

Asian immigrants are also changing the American medical landscape through increasing number of Asian medical practitioners in this country. Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, the US government invited a number of foreign physicians particularly from India and the Philippines to address the acute shortage of physicians in rural and medically-underserved urban areas. The trend in importing foreign medical practitioners, however, became a long-term, chronic solution as US medical schools failed to produce enough physicians to match the increasing American population. Amid decreasing interest in medicine among American college students due to high rates job dissatisfaction, loss of morale, stress, and lawsuits, Asian American immigrants maintained a supply of healthcare practitioners for millions of Americans. It is well documented that Asian American international medical graduates including highly skilled guest workers using the J1 Visa program for medical workers, tend to serve in health professions shortage areas (HPSA) and specialties that are not filled by US medical graduates especially primary care and rural medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMGPrimaryCare&quot;&gt;Koehn NN, Fryer GE Jr, Phillips RL, Miller JB, Green LA. (2007) The increase in international medical graduates in family practice residency programs. Journal of Family Medicine, 34(6):468–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IMGGeoDistribution&quot;&gt;Mick SS, Lee SY. (2007) Are there need-based geographical differences between international medical graduates and U.S. medical graduates in rural U.S. counties? J Rural Health. 1999 Winter;15(1):26–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Asian American immigrants play a key role in averting a medical crisis in the US.

A lasting legacy of Asian American involvement in medicine is the forcing of US medical establishment to accept minority medical practitioners. One could speculate that the introduction of Asian physicians and dentists to the American society could have triggered an acceptance of other minority groups by breaking down stereotypes and encouraging trust.&lt;ref&gt;Somnath Saha, MD, MPH; Gretchen Guiton, PhD; Paul F. Wimmers, PhD; LuAnn Wilkerson, EdD. (2008) Student Body Racial and Ethnic Composition and Diversity-Related Outcomes in US Medical Schools. JAMA. 2008;300(10):1135–1145&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Asian concepts and practices in health and medicine have attracted greater acceptance and are more widely adopted by American doctors. India’s [[Ayurveda]] and traditional [[Chinese medicine]] (which also includes [[acupuncture]]) are two alternative therapy systems that have been studied and adopted to a great extent. For instance, in the early 1970s the US medical establishment did not believe in the usefulness of acupuncture. Since then studies have proven the efficacy of acupuncture for different applications, especially for treatment of chronic pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO 2003.3&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Acupuncture: Review and Analysis of Reports on Controlled Clinical Trials | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | year = 2003 | last = Zhang | first = X | url = http://www.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4926e/#Js4926e.5 }} and&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E, Pittler MH, Wider B, Boddy K. |title=Acupuncture: its evidence-base is changing |journal=Am J Chin Med. |volume=35|issue=1 |pages=21–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17265547 |doi=10.1142/S0192415X07004588}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now covered by many health insurance plans.

[[Meditation]] and mindfulness practices are taught in mainstream medical schools and hospitals. Increasingly they are seen as part of a holistic approach to health. Doctors and hospitals treating diseases such as heart disease and cancer have adopted meditation as a practice recommended for patients.

[[Herbalism]] and [[massage]] therapy (from Ayurveda) are sweeping the spas across America. Meditation and [[yoga]] (from India) have also been widely adopted by health spas, and spiritual retreats of many religious bases. They are also part of the spiritual practice of the many Americans who are not affiliated with a mainline religious group.

Among America's major racial categories, Asian Americans have the highest educational qualifications. This varies, however, for individual ethnic groups. Dr. C.N. Le, Director of the Asian &amp; Asian American Studies Certificate Program at the University of Massachusetts, writes that although 42% of all Asian American adults have at least a college degree, Vietnamese Americans have a degree attainment rate of only 16% while Laotians and Cambodians only have rates around 5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/multicultural/le.htm A Closer Look at Asian Americans and Education], C.N. Le&lt;br /&gt;
^ [http://www.asian-nation.org/aboutme.shtml About me], C.N. Le, asian-nation.org.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the US Census Bureau, while the high school graduation rate for Asian Americans is on par with those of other ethnic groups, 48% of Asian Americans have attained at least a bachelor's degree as compared with the national average of 27%, and 29% for non-Hispanic Whites. Indian Americans have some of the highest education rates, with nearly 68% having attained at least a bachelor's degree.

Until the late 20th century, the term &quot;Asian American&quot; was adopted mostly by activists, while the average person of Asian ancestries identified with his specific ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;yip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/061397/feature.html |author=Alethea Yip|publisher=Asian Week |title=Remembering Vincent Chin |accessdate=March 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070318184237/http://www.asianweek.com/061397/feature.html| archivedate= March 18, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder of [[Vincent Chin]] in 1982 was a pivotal civil rights case, and it marked the emergence of Asian Americans as a distinct group in United States.&lt;ref name=yip/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ACAPAA_policy_recommendation_159211_7.pdf |format=PDF|author=ACAPAA |publisher=State of Michigan |title=Pilicy Recommendation Document. |accessdate=March 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070308150132/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ACAPAA_policy_recommendation_159211_7.pdf| archivedate= March 08 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian Americans are sometimes characterized as a [[model minority]] because many of their cultures encourage a strong work ethic, a respect for elders, a high degree of professional and academic success, a high valuation of family, education and religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asian-nation.org/model-minority.shtml The Model Minority Image], [http://www.asian-nation.org asian-nation.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics such as high household income and low incarceration rate,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://web.archive.org/web/20080716060754/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/crimoff.htm#jail Bureau of Justice Statistics: Criminal Offenders Statistics]'', November 13, 2005. (archived from [http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/crimoff.htm#jail the original] on July 16, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; low rates of many diseases and higher than average life expectancy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2114957/ The Soft Bigotry of Life Expectancy By William Saletan March 16, 2005 &quot;Asian-Americans were beating white life expectancy by six years among men and 6.5 years among women&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; are also discussed as positive aspects of Asian Americans.

The implicit advice is that the other minorities should stop protesting and emulate the Asian American work ethic and devotion to higher education. Some critics say the depiction replaces biological racism with cultural racism, and should be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Chih-Chieh Chou, &quot;Critique on the notion of model minority: an alternative racism to Asian American?,&quot; ''Asian Ethnicity'', Oct 2008, Vol. 9#3 Issue 3, pp 219–229&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept appears to elevate Asian Americans by portraying them as an elite group of successful, highly educated, intelligent, and wealthy individuals, but it can also be considered an overly narrow and overly one-dimensional portrayal of Asian Americans, leaving out other human qualities such as vocal leadership, negative emotions, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, and desire for creative expression. Furthermore, Asian Americans who do not fit into the model minority mold can face challenges when people's expectations based on the model minority myth do not match with reality. Traits outside of the model minority mold can be seen as negative character flaws for Asian Americans despite those very same traits being positive for the general American majority (e.g., risk taking, confidence, empowered). For this reason, some{{Who|date=October 2009}} believe Asian Americans encounter a &quot;bamboo ceiling,&quot; the Asian American equivalent of the [[glass ceiling]] in the workplace.

The model minority concept can also affect Asians' public education. By comparison with other minorities, Asians often achieve higher test scores and grades compared to other Americans.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Asian Americans outperform whites in terms of their overall or average grades (GPA), grades in math, and test scores in math&quot;, [http://www.mfas.ucr.edu/publications/Handbook_of_Asian_American_Psychology_Chapter-Ruth_6-27-05.doc School Performance], Tseng, V., Chao, R. K., &amp; Padmawidjaja, I. (2007). Asian Americans educational experiences. In F. Leong, A. Inman, A. Ebreo, L. Yang, L. Kinoshita, &amp; M. Fu (Eds.), Handbook of Asian American Psychology, (2nd Edition) Racial and Ethnic Minority Psychology (REMP) Series (pp. 102–123). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications (MS Word format, via [http://www.mfas.ucr.edu Multicultural Families and Adolescents Study], [http://www.mfas.ucr.edu/publications/ Publications]).&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotyping Asian American as over-achievers can lead to harm if school officials or peers expect all to perform higher than average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yellow_Wu&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Yellow|publisher=Basic Books|year=2002|author=Frank H. Wu|isbn=978-0-465-00639-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very high educational attainments of Asian Americans has often been noted; in 1980, for example, 74% of Chinese Americans, 62% of Japanese Americans, and 55% of Korean Americans aged 20–21 were in college, compared to a third of the whites. The disparity at postgraduate levels is even greater, and the differential is especially notable in fields making heavy use of mathematics. By 2000, a majority of undergraduates at such elite public California schools as UC Berkeley and UCLA, which are obligated by law to not consider race as a factor in admission, were Asian American. The pattern is rooted in the pre-World War II era. Native-born Chinese and Japanese Americans reached educational parity with majority whites in the early decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hirschman and Morrison G. Wong, &quot;The Extraordinary Educational Attainment of Asian-Americans: A Search for Historical Evidence and Explanations,&quot; ''Social Forces'', Sept 1986, Vol. 65#1 pp 1–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who consider Asian Americans a &quot;model minority&quot; fail to realize that Asian American is a broad category encompassing many different ethnic groups with different histories. When divided up by ethnicity, it can be seen that the economic and academic successes supposedly enjoyed by Asian Americans are concentrated into a few ethnic groups. Cambodians, Hmong, and Laotians (and to a lesser extent, Vietnamese), all of whose relatively low achievement rates are possibly due to their refugee status, and that they are non voluntary immigrants as other ethnicities are more likely to be.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asian-nation.org/demographics.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asian Americans to Pew Study: We’re Not Your ‘Model Minority’ |author=Julianne Hing |url=http://www.thehartfordguardian.com/2012/06/22/asian-americans-to-pew-study-were-not-your-model-minority/ |newspaper=The Hartford Guardian |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the model minority concept can be emotionally damaging to Asian Americans, particularly since they are expected to live up to those peers who fit the stereotype. Studies have shown that Asian Americans suffer from higher rates of stress, depression, mental illnesses, and suicides in comparison to other races,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Mental_Health_and_Depression_in_Asian_Americans.pdf &quot;Mental Health and Depression in Asian Americans&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the pressures to achieve and live up to the model minority image may take a mental and psychological toll on Asian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/05/16/asian.suicides/ &quot;Push to achieve tied to suicide in Asian American women&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
