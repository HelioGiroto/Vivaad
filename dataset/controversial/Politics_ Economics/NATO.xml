The '''North Atlantic Treaty Organization''' or '''NATO''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|n|eɪ|t|oʊ}} {{respell|NAY|toh}}; {{lang-fr|link=no|'''Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique Nord''' ('''OTAN''')}}), also called the '''(North) Atlantic Alliance''', is an [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] [[military alliance]] based on the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] which was signed on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of [[collective defence]] whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are in [[Brussels]], Belgium, one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22&amp;nbsp;countries participate in NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]], with 15&amp;nbsp;other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|the world's defence spending]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sipri1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=Milexdata.sipri.org |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its first few years, NATO was not much more than a political association. However, the [[Korean War]] galvanized the member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two U.S. supreme commanders. The course of the [[Cold War]] led to a rivalry with nations of the [[Warsaw Pact]], which formed in 1955. The first [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]], [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|Lord Ismay]], stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was &quot;to keep the [[Soviet Union|Russians]] out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.&quot;{{sfn|Reynolds|1994|p=13}} Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the [[Strike Force (France)|independent French nuclear deterrent]] and the withdrawal of the French from NATO's military structure in 1966.

After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, the organization became drawn into the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]], and conducted their first military interventions in [[NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia from 1991 to 1995]] and later [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia in 1999]]. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Cold War rivals, which culminated with several former Warsaw Pact states joining the alliance in 1999 and 2004. The [[September 2001 attacks]] signalled the only occasion in NATO's history that Article&amp;nbsp;5 of the North Atlantic treaty has been invoked as an attack on all NATO members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NATO and the fight against terrorism |url=http://www.nato.int/issues/terrorism/evolve02.html |work=North Atlantic Treaty Organization |accessdate=27 May 2011}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the attack, troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led [[ISAF]], and the organization continues to operate in a range of roles, including sending [[NATO Training Mission – Iraq|trainers to Iraq]], assisting in counter-piracy operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Counter-piracy operations |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_48815.htm |work=North Atlantic Treaty Organization |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently in 2011 enforcing a [[no-fly zone]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|over Libya]] in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|UN Security Council Resolution 1973]]. The less potent Article 4, which merely invokes consultation among NATO members has been invoked three times, and only by [[Turkey]]: once in 2003 over the [[Second Iraq War]], and twice in 2012 over the [[Syrian civil war]] after the [[June 2012 interception of Turkish aircraft|downing]] of an unarmed Turkish [[F-4]] reconnaissance jet and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/us-syria-crisis-alliance-idUSBRE8921F220121003 |title= NATO demands halt to Syria aggression against Turkey |work= [[Reuters]] |first= Adrian |last= Croft |date= 3 October 2012 |accessdate= 3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Beginnings===
[[File:Truman signing North Atlantic Treaty.jpg|thumb|The [[North Atlantic Treaty]] was signed in Washington, D.C., on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949 and was ratified by the United States that August.|alt=Eleven men in suits stand around a large desk at which another man is signing a document.]]
The [[Treaty of Brussels]], signed on 17&amp;nbsp;March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. The treaty and the Soviet [[Berlin Blockade]] led to the creation of the [[Western European Union]]'s Defence Organization in September 1948.{{sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|p=13}} However, participation of the United States was thought necessary both to counter the military power of the [[USSR]] and to prevent the revival of nationalist militarism, so talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately resulting in the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], which was signed in Washington, D.C. on 4&amp;nbsp;April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/history/nato-history.html |title= A short history of NATO |publisher= NATO |date= 2 April 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a [[1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland|pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot]] in March 1949.

The members agreed that an armed attack against any one of them in Europe or North America would be considered an attack against them all. Consequently they agreed that, if an armed attack occurred, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence, would assist the member being attacked, taking such action as it deemed necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. This differs from Article&amp;nbsp;IV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response will be military in nature. It is nonetheless assumed that NATO members will aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the member's territory and their &quot;vessels, forces or aircraft&quot; above the Tropic of Cancer, including some [[Overseas departments]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17245.htm |title= Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of Greece and Turkey |work= NATO |date= 4 April 1949 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of NATO brought about some [[standardization]] of allied [[military terminology]], procedures, and technology, which in many cases meant European countries adopting U.S. practices. The roughly 1300&amp;nbsp;[[STANAG|Standardization Agreements]] codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the [[7.62x51mm NATO|7.62×51 NATO]] rifle cartridge was introduced in the 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]]'s [[FN FAL|FAL]] became the most popular 7.62 NATO rifle in Europe and served into the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Also, [[aircraft marshalling|aircraft marshalling signals]] were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.

===Cold War===
{{Main|Cold War}}
The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 was crucial for NATO as it raised the apparent threat of all Communist countries working together, and forced the alliance to develop concrete military plans.{{sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|pp=13–14}} SHAPE, the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]], was formed as a consolidated command structure, and began work under Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in January 1951.&lt;ref name=pace&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/4.htm |title= NATO the first five years 1949-1954 |first= Hastings |last= Ismay |authorlink= Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay |publisher= NATO |date= 4 September 2001 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1952 Lisbon conference, seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO's Long-Term Defence Plan, called for an expansion to ninety-six [[division (military)|division]]s. However this requirement was dropped the following year to roughly thirty-five divisions with heavier use to be made of nuclear weapons. At this time, NATO could call on about fifteen ready divisions in Central Europe, and another ten in Italy and Scandinavia.{{sfn|Osgood|1962|p=76}}{{sfn|Park|1986|p=28}} Also at Lisbon, the post of [[Secretary General of NATO]] as the organization's chief civilian was created, and [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|Lord Ismay]] was eventually appointed to the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816183,00.html |title= NATO: The Man with the Oilcan |date= 24 March 1952 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:West German Bundeswehr 1960.jpg|thumb|left|The German Bundeswehr provided the largest element of the allied land forces guarding the frontier in Central Europe|alt=Two soldiers crouch under a tree while a tank sits on a road in front of them.]]

In September 1952, the first major NATO maritime exercises began; [[Exercise Mainbrace]] brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=Hanson |date= 28 September 1952 |title=Navies Meet the Test in Operation Mainbrace |journal=New York Times |pages=E7  |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20711FF3A5B117A93CAAB1782D85F468585F9 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major exercises that followed included [[Exercise Grand Slam]] and [[Exercise Longstep]], naval and amphibious exercises in the [[Mediterranean Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= U.S. Navymen Work on NATO Team |url= http://www.navy.mil/media/allhands/acrobat/ah195209.pdf |format=PDF |journal= [[All Hands]] |publisher= [[BUPERS]] - [[U.S. Navy]] |month= September |year= 1952 |accessdate=2 March 2010 |pages= 31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italic Weld, a combined air-naval-ground exercise in [[northern Italy]], Grand Repulse, involving the [[British Army on the Rhine]] (BAOR), the Netherlands Corps and [[Allied Air Forces Central Europe]] (AAFCE), Monte Carlo, a simulated atomic air-ground exercise involving the [[Central Army Group]], and Weldfast, a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving British, Greek, Italian, Turkish, and U.S. naval forces.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] also joined the alliance in 1952, forcing a series of controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure.&lt;ref name=pace/&gt; While this overt military preparation was going on, covert [[stay-behind]] arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including [[Operation Gladio]], were transferred to NATO control.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the [[NATO Tiger Association]] and competitions such as the [[Canadian Army Trophy]] for tank gunnery.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1954, the Soviet Union suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2009/04/03/f-nato-fast-facts.html |date= 6 April 2009 |title=Fast facts about NATO |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NATO countries, fearing that the Soviet Union's motive was to weaken the alliance, ultimately rejected this proposal. The incorporation of [[West Germany]] into the organization on 9&amp;nbsp;May 1955 was described as &quot;a decisive turning point in the history of our continent&quot; by [[Halvard Lange]], [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/9/newsid_2519000/2519979.stm |title= West Germany accepted into Nato |work=BBC News |date= 9 May 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major reason for Germany's entry into the alliance was that without German manpower, it would have been impossible to field enough conventional forces to resist a Soviet invasion.{{sfn|Isby|Kamps Jr.|1985|p=15}} One of its immediate results was the creation of the [[Warsaw Pact]], which was signed on 14&amp;nbsp;May 1955 by the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and East Germany, as a formal response to this event, thereby delineating the two opposing sides of the [[Cold War]].

Three major exercises were held concurrently in the northern autumn of 1957. Operation Counter Punch, [[Operation Strikeback]], and [[Operation Deep Water]] were the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance to date, involving more than 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891351,00.html |title=Emergency Call |accessdate=27 September 2008 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= 30 September 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French withdrawal===
[[File:NATO AB in France map-en.svg|thumb|Map of the NATO air bases in France before [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s 1966 withdrawal from NATO military integrated command|alt=A map of France with red and blue markings indicating air force bases as of 1966.]]
NATO's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s presidency of France. de Gaulle protested the United States' strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] between it and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK.{{sfn|Wenger|Nuenlist|Locher|2007|pp=67–69}}

Considering the response he received to his memorandum unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO-Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|Mediterranean Fleet]] from NATO command.{{sfn|National Defense University|1997|p=50}} He later banned the stationing of foreign [[nuclear weapon]]s on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the [[United States Air Force in France|air force bases]] that had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.

Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[English Channel|Channel]] fleets from NATO command.{{sfn|van der Eyden|2003|pp=104–106}} In 1966, all French armed forces were removed from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO troops were asked to leave France. This withdrawal forced the relocation of SHAPE from [[Rocquencourt]], near Paris, to [[Casteau]], north of [[Mons]], Belgium, by 16&amp;nbsp;October 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2007/issue2/english/history.html |title= The Big Move |work= NATO Review |first= François |last= Le Blévennec |date= 25 October 2011 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; France remained a member of the alliance, and committed to the defence of Europe from possible Communist attack with its own forces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany throughout the Cold War. A series of secret accords between US and French officials, the Lemnitzer-Ailleret Agreements, detailed how French forces would dovetail back into NATO's command structure should East-West hostilities break out.&lt;ref name=WP-France&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/11/AR2009031100547.html |title= After 43 Years, France to Rejoin NATO as Full Member |date= 12 March 2009 |first= Edward |last= Cody |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Détente and escalation===
{{Main|Détente}}
[[File:Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon talks in 1973.png|thumb|left|Détente led to many high level meetings between leaders from both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.|alt=Two older men in suits sit next to each other, while a third stands behind leaning in to listen to the right man talk.]]
During most of the Cold War, NATO's watch against the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not actually lead to direct military action. On 1&amp;nbsp;July 1968, the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] opened for signature: NATO argued that its [[nuclear sharing]] arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until a decision was made to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further [[arms race]].{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|pp=659–661}}

[[File:Cold war europe military alliances map en.png|thumb|During the Cold War, most of Europe was divided between two alliances. Members of NATO are shown in blue, with members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] in red.|alt=A map of Europe showing several countries on the left in blue, while ones on the right are in red. Other unaffiliated countries are in white.]]
On 12&amp;nbsp;December 1979, in light of a build-up of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US [[BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile|GLCM]] [[cruise missile]]s and [[Pershing&amp;nbsp;II]] theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the [[NATO Double-Track Decision|Dual Track]] policy.{{sfn|Njølstad|2004|pp=280–282}} Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of [[Warsaw Pact]] [[RSD-10 Pioneer|SS-20]] medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations in the event of war.{{sfn|Njølstad|2004|pp=278–279}} This action led to [[peace movement]] protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.

The membership of the organization at this time remained largely static. In 1974, as a consequence of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure but, with Turkish cooperation, were readmitted in 1980. The [[Falklands War]] between the United Kingdom and [[Argentina]] did not result in NATO involvement because of the limited scope of NATO.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} On 30&amp;nbsp;May 1982, NATO gained a new member when, following a referendum, the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance.

===After the Cold War===
The [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the dissolution of the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1991 removed the ''de facto'' main adversary of NATO. This caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and even geographic focus. The [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] agreed between NATO members and the Soviet Union and signed in Paris in 1990, mandated specific military reductions on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jul/15/russia.nato |title= Kremlin tears up arms pact with Nato |first= Luke |last= Harding |work=The Observer  |date= 14 July 2007 |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] in December 1991, European countries accounted for 34% of NATO's military spending; by 2012, that had fallen to 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21551491 |title= The future of NATO: Bad timing |date= 31 March 2012 |journal= [[The Economist]] |accessdate=3 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO also began a gradual expansion with newly autonomous Eastern European nations, and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.

[[File:Gorbachev Bush 19900601.jpg|thumb|left|Reforms made under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] led to the end of the [[Warsaw Pact]].|alt=Two men in suits sit signing documents at a large table in front of their country's flags. Two others stand outside watching them.]]
The first post–Cold War expansion of NATO came with [[German reunification]] on 3&amp;nbsp;October 1990, when the former [[East Germany]] became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance. This had been agreed in the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]] earlier in the year. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east. The scholar [[Stephen F. Cohen]] argued in 2005 that a commitment was given that NATO would never expand further east,&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite news |title=Gorbachev's Lost Legacy |first=Stephen F. |last=Cohen |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/gorbachevs-lost-legacy|publisher=[[The Nation]] |date=24 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Robert Zoellick]], then a [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, this appears to be a misperception; no formal commitment of the sort was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert B. |last=Zoellick |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-65576869.html |title=The Lessons of German Unification |publisher=[[The National Interest]] |date=22 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, Gorbachev repeated his view that such a commitment had been made, and that &quot;the Americans promised that NATO wouldn't move beyond the boundaries of Germany after the Cold War&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;me&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Gorbachev: US could start new Cold War |author=Blomfield A and Smith M |location=Paris |date=6 May 2009 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1933223/Gorbachev-US-could-start-new-Cold-War.html |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of post–Cold War restructuring, NATO's military structure was cut back and reorganized, with new forces such as the [[Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps|Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps]] established. The changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the [[Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty]], which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] have resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4&amp;nbsp;April 2009, which also included France rejoining the integrated military command of NATO, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.&lt;ref name=WP-France/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sarkozy military plan unveiled |last=Stratton |first=Allegra |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/17/france.military |work=The Guardian  |location=UK |date=17 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlargement and reform===

Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, like the [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] initiative and the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]]. In 1998, the [[NATO–Russia relations|NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council]] was established. On 8&amp;nbsp;July 1997, three former communist countries, [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Poland]], were invited to join NATO, which each did in 1999.  Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Northern and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO on 29&amp;nbsp;March 2004, shortly before the [[2004 Istanbul summit]]. In Istanbul, NATO launched the [[Istanbul Cooperation Initiative]] with four [[Persian Gulf]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/history/index.html |title= History |publisher= NATO |date= 15 December 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New NATO structures were also formed while old ones were abolished. The [[NATO Response Force]] (NRF) was launched at the [[2002 Prague summit]] on 21&amp;nbsp;November, the first summit in a former [[Comecon]] country. On 19&amp;nbsp;June 2003, a major restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT), was established in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], Virginia, United States, and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Allied Command Operations]] (ACO). ACT is responsible for driving transformation (future capabilities) in NATO, whilst ACO is responsible for current operations.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In March 2004, NATO's [[Baltic Air Policing]] began, which supported the sovereignty of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia by providing fighters to react to any unwanted aerial intrusions. Four fighters are based in Lithuania, provided in rotation by virtually all the NATO states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2012/03/29/nato_member_nations_should_share_military_systems/ |title= NATO: Member nations should share military systems |work=The Boston Globe |first= Don |last= Melvin |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= 29 March 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006 Riga summit]] was held in [[Riga]], Latvia, and highlighted the issue of energy security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nazemroaya|first=Mahdi Darius | title=The Globalization of Military Power: NATO Expansion | publisher=Centre for Research on Globalization |date=17 May 2007| url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=NAZ20070517&amp;articleId=5677}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[NATO summit]] to be held in a country that had been part of the [[Soviet Union]]. At the April 2008 summit in [[Bucharest]], Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/03/nato.members/index.html U.S. wins NATO backing for missile defense shield – CNN.com]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a [[NATO missile defence system|missile defence system]]. Studies for this system began in 2002, with negotiations centered on [[anti-ballistic missile]]s being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, both presidents [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] criticized it as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/medvedev-calls-missile-defense-a-threat-to-russia/2012/03/23/gIQA9Id2VS_story.html |title= Medvedev calls missile defense a threat to Russia |work=The Washington Post |first= Will |last= Englund |date= 23 March 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia and Herzegovina intervention===
{{Main|NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

The [[Bosnian War]] began in 1992, as a result of the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The deteriorating situation led to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 816]] on 9&amp;nbsp;October 1992, ordering a [[no-fly zone]] over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12&amp;nbsp;April 1993 with [[Operation Deny Flight]]. From June 1993 till October 1996, [[Operation Sharp Guard]] added maritime enforcement of the [[arms embargo]] and [[economic sanctions]] against the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 28&amp;nbsp;February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by [[Banja Luka incident|shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft]] violating the no-fly zone.{{sfn|Zenko|2010|pp=133–134}}

On 10 and 11 April 1994, during the [[Bosnian War]], the [[United Nations Protection Force]] called in air strikes to protect the [[Goražde]] safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Serbian military command outpost near Goražde by two US [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] jets acting under NATO direction.{{sfn|Zenko|2010|p=134}} This resulted in the taking of 150&amp;nbsp;U.N. personnel hostage on 14&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=NATO Handbook: Evolution of the Conflict|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb050102.htm}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report [http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/54/549 A/54/549], Report of the Secretary-General pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/35: The fall of Srebrenica&lt;/ref&gt; On 16&amp;nbsp;April a British [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces.{{sfn|Bethlehem|Weller|1997|p=liiv}} A two-week NATO bombing campaign, [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Operation Deliberate Force]], began in August 1995 against the [[Army of the Republika Srpska]], after the [[Srebrenica massacre]].&lt;ref name=zenko137&gt;{{harvnb|Zenko|2010|pp=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO air strikes that year helped bring the [[Yugoslav wars]] to an end, resulting in the [[Dayton Agreement]] in November 1995.&lt;ref name=zenko137/&gt; As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, under [[Operation Joint Endeavor]], named [[IFOR]]. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO nations in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller [[SFOR]], which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations where then passed onto [[EUFOR Althea|European Union Force Althea]].{{sfn|Clausson|2006|p=94–97}} Following the lead of its member nations, NATO began to award a service medal, the [[NATO Medal]], for these operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/02/army_natomedal_022209w/ |title= Thousands more now eligible for NATO Medal |work= [[Army Times]] |first= Jim |last= Tice |date= 22 February 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo intervention===

[[File:KFOR Kosovo2.jpg|thumb|German KFOR soldiers patrol southern Kosovo in 1999|alt=Three trucks of soldiers idle on a country road in front of trees and red roofed houses. The rear truck has KFOR painted on is back.]]
In an effort to stop [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s Serbian-led crackdown on Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199|Resolution 1199]] on 23&amp;nbsp;September 1998 to demand a ceasefire. Negotiations under UN Special Envoy [[Richard Holbrooke]] broke down on 23&amp;nbsp;March 1999, and he handed the matter to NATO, which started an 78-day bombing campaign on 24&amp;nbsp;March 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= UN Kosovo mission walks a tightrope |date= 24 March 2004 |work=BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3565799.stm |first= Nick |last= Thorpe |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of what was then the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the [[ACE Mobile Force (Land)]], to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/sustain_hope.htm |title= Operation Shining Hope |work= Global Security |date= 5 July 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the campaign was criticized for [[Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force|high civilian casualties]], including for bombs that landed on the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|Chinese embassy in Belgrade]], Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3&amp;nbsp;June 1999, ending the [[Kosovo War]]. On 11&amp;nbsp;June, Milošević further accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN resolution 1244]], under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/media-releases/2000/kosovo-report-card.aspx |title= Kosovo Report Card |date= 28 August 2000 |work= [[International Crisis Group]] |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; In August–September 2001, the alliance also mounted [[Operation Essential Harvest]], a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/macedonia/1357773/Macedonia-mission-a-success-says-Nato.html |title= Macedonia mission a success, says Nato |work=The Daily Telegraph  |first= Toby |last= Helm |date= 27 September 2001 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012|3|30}}, 6,226&amp;nbsp;KFOR soldiers continue to operate in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/kfor/structur/nations/placemap/kfor_placemat.pdf |title= NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR) |publisher= NATO |format= PDF |date= 30 March 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US, the UK, and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on [[Yugoslavia]], and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post–Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its [[1999 Washington summit|Washington summit]] in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.&lt;ref name=&quot;nato.int&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb120704.htm |title= Allied Command Atlantic |accessdate=3 September 2008 |work=NATO Handbook |publisher=NATO |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080813225955/http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb120704.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[11 September attacks]] in the United States caused NATO to invoke Article&amp;nbsp;5 of the NATO Charter for the first time in its history. The Article says that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4&amp;nbsp;October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm |title=NATO Update: Invocation of Article 5 confirmed – 2 October 2001 |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included [[Operation Eagle Assist]] and [[Operation Active Endeavour]], a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea and is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general which began on 4&amp;nbsp;October 2001.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Despite this early show of solidarity, NATO faced a crisis little more than a year later, when on 10&amp;nbsp;February 2003, France and Belgium vetoed the procedure of silent approval concerning the timing of protective measures for Turkey in case of a possible war with Iraq. Germany did not use its right to break the procedure but said it supported the veto.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} On the issue of Afghanistan on the other hand, the alliance showed greater unity: on 16 April 2003, NATO agreed to take command of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF), which includes troops from 42 countries. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two nations leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on 11&amp;nbsp;August, and marked the first time in NATO's history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/world/asia/23afghan.htm NATO Chief Promises to Stand by Afghanistan] New York Times, 22 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAF was initially charged with securing [[Kabul]] and surrounding areas from the [[Taliban]], [[al Qaeda]] and factional warlords, so as to allow for the establishment of the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] headed by [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/708/55/PDF/N0170855.pdf?OpenElement Official Documents System of the United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/topics/mandate/unscr/resolution_1510.pdf |title=UNSC Resolution 1510, October 13, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISAF Chronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/isaf/topics/chronology/index.html |title=ISAF Chronology |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31&amp;nbsp;July 2006, the ISAF additionally took over [[Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan in 2006|military operations in the south of Afghanistan]] from a US-led anti-terrorism coalition.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Due to the intensity of the fighting in the south, in 2011 France allowed a squadron of [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]] fighter/attack aircraft to be moved into the area, to [[Kandahar International Airport|Kandahar]], in order to reinforce the alliance's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1002456&amp;clef=ARC-TRK-NC_01 |title=La France et l'OTAN |work=Le Monde  |language=French |location=France |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its [[2012 Chicago Summit]], NATO endorsed a plan to end the Afghanistan war and to remove the NATO-led ISAF Forces by the end of December 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 20120521&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO sets &quot;irreversible&quot; but risky course to end Afghan war|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE84J02C20120521?sp=true|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=22 May 2012|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2004, during the [[Iraq War]], NATO formed the [[NATO Training Mission – Iraq]], a training mission to assist the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the US led [[Multinational Force – Iraq|MNF-I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsouth.nato.int/JFCN_Missions/NTM-I/NTMI_intro.htm Introduction]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}, 17 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established at the request of the [[Iraqi Interim Government]] under the provisions of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546]]. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who is also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17&amp;nbsp;December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/17/us-iraq-withdrawal-nato-idUSTRE7BG0IK20111217 |title= NATO closes up training mission in Iraq |agency=Reuters |first= Rania |last= El Gamal |date= 17 December 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 17&amp;nbsp;August 2009, NATO deployed warships in an operation to protect maritime traffic in the [[Gulf of Aden]] and the Indian Ocean from [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]], and help strengthen the navies and coast guards of regional states. The operation was  approved by the [[North Atlantic Council]] and involves warships primarily from the United States though vessels from many other nations are also included. Operation Ocean Shield focuses on protecting the ships of [[Operation Allied Provider]] which are distributing aid as part of the [[World Food Programme]] mission in [[Somalia]].

===Libya intervention===
{{Main|2011 military intervention in Libya}}
During the [[Libyan civil war]], violence between protestors and the Libyan government under Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] escalated, and on 17&amp;nbsp;March 2011 led to the passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], which called for a ceasefire, and authorized military action to protect civilians. A&amp;nbsp;coalition that included several NATO members began enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya shortly afterwards.

NATO has added new members seven times since first forming in 1949, and now comprises 28 nations.

At the 2008 summit in Bucharest, three countries were promised future invitations: the [[Republic of Macedonia]],&lt;ref&gt;In NATO official statements, the country is always referred to as the &quot;former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with a footnote stating that &quot;Turkey recognizes the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name&quot;; see [[Macedonia naming dispute]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=George J, Teigen JM |year=2008 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a907490331~db=all?jumptype=alert |title=NATO Enlargement and Institution Building: Military Personnel Policy Challenges in the Post-Soviet Context |journal=European Security |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=346 |doi=10.1080/09662830802642512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Macedonia completed its requirements for membership at the same time as [[Croatia]] and [[Albania]], NATO's most recent members, its accession was blocked by Greece pending a resolution of the [[Macedonia naming dispute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;balkaninsight&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Croatia &amp; Albania Invited Into NATO |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/9102/|publisher=BalkanInsight |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=3 April 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080407170352/http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/9102/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprus]] also has not progressed toward further relations, in part because of opposition from Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2007/06/14/feature-03 |title= Cyprus a sticking point in EU-NATO co-operation |date=14 June 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2010 |first= Ayhan |last= Simsek |work=[[Southeast European Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other candidate countries include [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which joined the [[Adriatic Charter]] of potential members in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/12/09/feature-02 |title= Montenegro, BiH join Adriatic Charter |date=12 September 2008 |first= Jusuf |last= Ramadanovic |coauthors= Nedjeljko Rudovic |work=[[Southeast European Times]] |accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their accession to the alliance is governed with individual [[Membership Action Plan]]s, and will require approval by each current member.

NATO and the [[European Union]] signed a comprehensive package of arrangements under the [[Berlin Plus agreement]] on 16&amp;nbsp;December 2002. With this agreement the EU was given the possibility to use NATO assets in case it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, on the condition that NATO itself did not want to act—the so-called &quot;[[right of first refusal]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bram Boxhoorn, ''Broad Support for NATO in the Netherlands'', 21 September 2005, [http://www.ataedu.org/article_new.php?id=107 ATAedu.org] {{Dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A double framework has been established to help further co-operation between the 28 NATO members and 22 &quot;partner countries&quot;.

* The [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) program was established in 1994 and is based on individual bilateral relations between each partner country and NATO: each country may choose the extent of its participation. The PfP program is considered the operational wing of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/issues/pfp/index.html |title=Partnership for Peace |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members include all current and former members of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forsecurity.org/nato-and-belarus-partnership-past-tensions-and-future-possibilities |title=Nato and Belarus – partnership, past tensions and future possibilities |publisher=Foreign Policy and Security Research Center |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC) was first established on 29 May 1997, and is a forum for regular coordination, consultation and dialogue between all fifty participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/issues/eapc/index.html |title=NATO Topics: The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council |publisher=Nato.int |accessdate=22 August 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, NATO cooperates and discusses their activities with numerous other non-NATO members.
* The [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] was established in 1994 to coordinate in a similar way with Israel and countries in North Africa.
* The [[Istanbul Cooperation Initiative]] was announced in 2004 as a dialog forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the [[Mediterranean Dialogue]]. The four participants are also linked through the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-4CA2943D-E00ED2BF/natolive/51288.htm |title=NATO Partner countries |publisher=Nato.int |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990–91, the Alliance has gradually increased its contact with countries that do not form part of any of the above cooperative groupings. Political dialogue with Japan began in 1990, and a range of non-NATO countries have contributed to peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. The Allies established a set of general guidelines on relations with other countries, beyond the above groupings in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;NATO, [http://www.nato.int/issues/contact_countries/index.html Relations with Contact Countries]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}. Retrieved 18 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines do not allow for a formal institutionalization of relations, but reflect the Allies' desire to increase cooperation. Following extensive debate, the term &quot;Contact Countries&quot; was agreed by the Allies in 2000. By 2012, the Alliance had broadened this group, which meets to discuss issues such as counter-piracy and technology exchange, under the names &quot;partners across the globe&quot; or &quot;global partners.&quot;&lt;ref name=oped&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.opednews.com/articles/Partners-Across-the-Asia-P-by-Rick-Rozoff-120925-23.html |title= Partners Across the Asia-Pacific: NATO Reinforces U.S. Shift to East |work= Op-Ed News |date= 25 September 2012 |first= Rick |last= Rozoff |accessdate= 12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/51288.htm |title= Partners |publisher= NATO |date= 2 April 2012 |accessdate= 12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are also members of the [[AUSCANNZUKUS]] strategic alliance.

The main headquarters of NATO is located on Boulevard Léopold&amp;nbsp;III, B-1110 Brussels, which is in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], part of the [[Brussels (municipality)|City of Brussels]] municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/|title=NATO homepage|accessdate=12 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new headquarters building is, {{as of|2010|lc=on}}, under construction nearby, due for completion by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-8B0474DB-C84BF8E1/natolive/news_69421.htm?selectedLocale=en |title=Work starts on new NATO Headquarters |author=NATO |date=16 December 2010 |publisher=NATO |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is an adaptation of the original award-winning scheme designed by [[Michel Mossessian]] and his team when he was a Design Partner with SOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europe.org.uk/index/-/id/426/ |title=Michel Mossessian talks to Lucy Lethbridge |author=European Council | accessdate=12 September 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110725025703/http://www.europe.org.uk/index/-/id/426/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff at the Headquarters is composed of national delegations of member countries and includes civilian and military liaison offices and officers or diplomatic missions and diplomats of partner countries, as well as the International Staff and International Military Staff filled from serving members of the armed forces of member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49284.htm |title=NATO Headquarters |publisher=Nato.int |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-governmental citizens' groups have also grown up in support of NATO, broadly under the banner of the [[Atlantic Council]]/[[Atlantic Treaty Association]] movement.

===NATO Council===
Like any alliance, NATO is ultimately governed by its 28 member states. However, the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], and other agreements, outline how decisions are to be made within NATO. Each of the 28 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National delegations to NATO What is their role? | publisher=NATO | date = 18 June 2007 | url = http://www.nato.int/issues/national_delegations/tasks.html | accessdate =15 July 2007 | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070714120337/http://www.nato.int/issues/national_delegations/tasks.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate =14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior permanent member of each delegation is known as the Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that diplomatic rank). Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO [[List of diplomatic missions to NATO|through embassies in Belgium]].

Together, the Permanent Members form the [[North Atlantic Council]] (NAC), a body which meets together at least once a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving [[foreign minister]]s, [[Defense Minister|defence minister]]s or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. [[NATO summit]]s also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.

The meetings of the North Atlantic Council are chaired by the [[Secretary General of NATO]] and, when decisions have to be made, action is agreed upon on the basis of unanimity and common accord. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each nation represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions.

===NATO Parliamentary Assembly===
{{Main|NATO Parliamentary Assembly}}
[[File:NATO Ministers of Defense and of Foreign Affairs meet at NATO headquarters in Brussels 2010.jpg|thumb|NATO Ministers of Defense and of Foreign Affairs meet at NATO headquarters in Brussels.|alt=A room with a massive circular table at which dozens of men and women sit. Inside the table is a carpet with a blue and white logo.]]
The body that sets broad strategic goals for NATO is the [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]] (NATO-PA) which meets at the Annual Session, and one other during the year, and is the organ that directly interacts with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly is made up of legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. [[Karl A. Lamers]], German Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee of the [[Bundestag]] and a member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], became president of the assembly in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato-pa.int/default.asp?SHORTCUT=2294 ''Press Statement: German MP Karl A. Lamers elected President of NATO PA'']. [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]], 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is however officially a different structure from NATO, and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council.

The Assembly is the political integration body of NATO that generates political policy [[Political agenda|agenda setting]] for the NATO Council via reports of its five committees:
* Committee on the Civil Dimension of Security
* Defence and Security Committee
* Economics and Security Committee
* Political Committee
* Science and Technology Committee
These reports provide impetus and direction as agreed upon by the national governments of the member states through their own [[Political system|national political processes]] and influencers to the NATO administrative and executive organizational entities.

===Military structures===
{{Main|Military units and formations of NATO}}
[[File:Nato awacs.jpg|thumb|NATO [[E-3 Sentry|E-3A]] flying with [[United States Air Force|US]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] in a NATO exercise|alt=Three fighter jets fly in formation through puffs of clouds to the left of a larger gray airplane.]]
The NATO command structure evolved throughout the [[Cold War]] and its aftermath.

An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 as it became
clear that NATO would need to enhance its defenses for the longer term against a
potential Soviet attack. In April 1951, [[Allied Command Europe]] and its headquarters ([[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]]) were established; later, four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean.

At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of
5,252,800 active military, including as many as 435,000 forward deployed U.S. forces,
under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organized into four
echelons.

After the Cold War ended, new countries emerged, and crises erupted along NATO
boundaries and beyond. The most significant new NATO mission was participation in [[peace enforcement]] and [[peacekeeping]] operations beyond NATO territory. In 1997 NATO reached agreement on a significant downsizing of its command structure from 65 headquarters to just 20.

In 2010 28 NATO members maintained strength of 3,793,778 active military,
including 137,836 forward deployed U.S. troops. The command structure was reduced to 11
headquarters organized in three echelons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndu.edu/CTNSP/docUploaded/DTP%2075%20NATO%20Command%20Structure.pdf NATO Command Structure.Considerations for the Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second pivotal member of each country's delegation is the Military Representative, a senior officer from each country's armed forces, supported by the International Military Staff. Together the Military Representatives form the Military Committee, a body responsible for recommending to NATO's political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and is responsible for the overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council. The [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]] is [[Knud Bartels]] of Denmark, since 2012.

Like the Council, from time to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior military officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from NATO's integrated military structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. Such was the case in the lead up to [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Thomas | last = Fuller | title = Reaching accord, EU warns Saddam of his 'last chance' | work=International Herald Tribune | date = 18 February 2003 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/02/18/eu_ed3__1.php | accessdate =15 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012115843/http://iht.com/articles/2003/02/18/eu_ed3__1.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.

NATO's military operations are directed by the [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]], and split into two Strategic Commands commanded by a senior US officer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aco.nato.int/page181313621.aspx |title=Admiral James Stavridis, United States Navy, assumed duties as Supreme Allied Commander Europe in summer 2009 |publisher=Aco.nato.int |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a senior French officer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.act.nato.int/organization/hq-sact/whos-who/300-supreme-allied-commander-transformation |title=General Stéphane Abrial, French Air Force, assumed duties as Supreme Allied Commander Transformation in summer 2009 |publisher=Act.nato.int |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by a staff drawn from across NATO. The Strategic Commanders are responsible to the [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee|Military Committee]] for the overall direction and conduct of all Alliance military matters within their areas of command.

In 1997-2003 the Strategic Commanders were the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe#Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR) and the [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] (SACLANT) but the current arrangement is to separate [[command responsibility]] between [[Allied Command Transformation]] (ACT), responsible for transformation and training of NATO forces, and [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Allied Command Operations]] (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Eide | last = Espen Barth | coauthors = Frédéric Bozo | title = Should NATO play a more political role? | work=Nato Review| publisher=NATO | date = Spring 2005 | url = http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2005/issue1/english/debate.html | accessdate =15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of post–Cold War restructuring of national forces, intervention in the Balkan conflicts, and subsequent participation in Afghanistan, starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps ([[Eurocorps]], [[I. German/Dutch Corps]], [[Multinational Corps Northeast]], [[NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps]], [[NATO Rapid Deployable Corps - Spain]], [[NATO Deployable Corps - Greece]], [[NATO Rapid Deployable Turkish Corps]]) and naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.
