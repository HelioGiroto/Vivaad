The EU traces its origins from the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) and the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), formed by the [[Inner Six]] countries in 1951 and 1958 respectively. In the intervening years the community and its successors have grown in size by [[enlargement of the European Union|the accession of new member states]] and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The [[Maastricht Treaty]] established the European Union under its current name in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU1993&quot;/&gt; The latest amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], came into force in 2009.

The EU has developed a [[single market]] through a standardised system of laws which apply in all member states.

Through the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] the EU has developed a role in [[Foreign relations of the European Union|external relations]] and [[Military of the European Union|defence]]. Permanent [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|diplomatic missions]] have been established around the world. The EU is represented at the [[European Union and the United Nations|United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], the [[European Union and the G8|G8]] and the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]].

[[File:Schuman Declaration.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=9|left|[[Robert Schuman]] [[Schuman Declaration|proposing]] the [[European Coal and Steel Community|Coal and Steel Community]] on [[Europe Day|9 May]] 1950.]]
After World War II, moves towards European integration were seen by many as an escape from the extreme forms of nationalism that had devastated the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The political consequences|publisher=European NAvigator|url=http://www.ena.lu/?doc=242&amp;lang=3|accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 [[Hague Congress (1948)|Hague Congress]] was a pivotal moment in European federal history, as it led to the creation of the [[European Movement]] and also of the [[College of Europe]], a place where Europe's future leaders would live and study together.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Mahncke]], [[Léonce Bekemans]], [[Robert Picht]], ''The College of Europe. Fifty Years of Service to Europe'', Bruges, 1999. ISBN 9080498319.&lt;/ref&gt; 1951 saw the creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which was declared to be &quot;a first step in the federation of Europe&quot;, starting with the aim of eliminating the possibility of further wars between its member states by means of pooling the national heavy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of 9 May 1950|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/9-may/decl_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding members of the Community were [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[West Germany]]. The originators and supporters of the Community include [[Jean Monnet]], [[Robert Schuman]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], and [[Alcide De Gasperi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa History 45-59&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A peaceful Europe – the beginnings of cooperation|publisher=European Commission|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/1945-1959/index_en.htm|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the six countries signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], which extended the earlier cooperation within the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and created the [[European Economic Community]], (EEC) establishing a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]]. They also signed another treaty on the same day creating the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) for cooperation in developing nuclear energy. Both treaties came into force in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa History 45-59&quot;/&gt;

The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The executives of the new communities were called Commissions, as opposed to the &quot;High Authority&quot;. The EEC was headed by [[Walter Hallstein]] ([[Hallstein Commission]]) and Euratom was headed by [[Louis Armand]] ([[Armand Commission]]) and then [[Étienne Hirsch]]. Euratom would integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union between members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=3054 A European Atomic Energy Community] ena.lu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=3056 A European Customs Union] ena.lu&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout the 1960s tensions began to show with France seeking to limit supranational power. However, in 1965 an agreement was reached and hence in 1967 the [[Merger Treaty]] was signed in Brussels. It came into force on 1 July 1967 and created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the ''[[European Communities]]'' (EC), although commonly just as the ''European Community''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Merge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Merging the executives|publisher=European NAvigator|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=473|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=473 Merging the executives] ena.lu&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Rey (politician)|Jean Rey]] [[President of the European Commission|presided over]] the first merged Commission ([[Rey Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/rey/index_en.htm Discover the former Presidents: The Rey Commission], Europa (web portal).

In 1973 the Communities enlarged to include Denmark (including [[Greenland]], which later left the Community in 1985), Ireland, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA First enlargement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The first enlargement|publisher=European NAvigator|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=555|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway had negotiated to join at the same time but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum and so Norway remained outside. In 1979, the [[European Parliament election, 1979|first direct, democratic elections]] to the European Parliament were held.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA New Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The new European Parliament|publisher=European NAvigator|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=571|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece joined in 1981, Portugal and Spain in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Enlargement negotiations&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Negotiations for enlargement|publisher=European NAvigator|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&amp;doc=6525|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the [[Schengen Agreement]] led the way toward the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schengen agreement |date=30 April 2001 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=18 September 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/euro-glossary/1230052.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the [[Flag of Europe|European flag]] began to be used by the Community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the flag|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/emblem/index_en.htm|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Single European Act]] was signed.

In 1990, after the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], the former [[East Germany]] became part of the Community as part of a newly united Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa History 80-89&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1980–1989 The changing face of Europe – the fall of the Berlin Wall|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1980-1989/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With enlargement towards European formerly communist countries as well as Cyprus and Malta on the agenda, the [[Copenhagen criteria]] for candidate members to join the European Union were agreed.

[[File:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|left|The introduction of the euro in 2002 replaced several national currencies.]]

The European Union was formally established when the [[Maastricht Treaty]]—whose main architects were [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[François Mitterrand]]—came into force on 1 November 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;EU1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Craig|first=Paul|coauthors=Grainne De Burca , P.

In 2002, euro notes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the [[eurozone]] has increased to encompass 17 countries. In 2004, the EU saw [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|its biggest enlargement to date]] when [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], Estonia, [[Hungary]], Latvia, [[Lithuania]], Malta, [[Poland]], Slovakia and [[Slovenia]] joined the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa History 00&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A decade of further expansion|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070615031714/http://europa.eu/abc/history/2000_today/index_en.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2007, Romania and Bulgaria became the EU's members. In the same year Slovenia adopted the euro,&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa History 00&quot;/&gt; followed in 2008 by Cyprus and Malta, by Slovakia in 2009 and by Estonia in 2011. In June 2009, the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 Parliament elections]] were held leading to a renewal of Barroso's Commission Presidency, and in July 2009 Iceland formally applied for EU membership.

On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the [[Three pillars of the European Union|EU three pillars]] system into a single legal entity provisioned with [[legal personality]], and it created a permanent [[President of the European Council]], the first of which is [[Herman Van Rompuy]], and a strengthened [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]], [[Catherine Ashton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://government.zdnet.com/?p=6266|title=European Parliament announces new President and Foreign Affairs Minister|accessdate=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2011, [[Croatia]] signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|EU accession treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5giqv7YlB-BYuVf-JM2zmRUNyiK3w?docId=c2caeea189fd4bcd8f7e1942b8a8166e|title=Croatia signs EU accession treaty|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatian European Union membership referendum, 2012|The EU accession referendum]] was held in Croatia on 22 January 2012, with the majority voting for [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia's accession to the European Union]] making it the 28th member state as of July 2013.

The European Union received the [[2012 Nobel Peace Prize]] for having &quot;contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2012|publisher=Nobelprize.org|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Nobel Committee Awards Peace Prize to E.U.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/nobel-peace-prize.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=12 October 2012|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Committee stated that &quot;that dreadful suffering in [[World War II]] demonstrated the need for a new Europe [...] today war between Germany and France is unthinkable.

Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside of the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most [[Köppen climate classification|types of climate]] from [[Polar climate|Arctic]] (North-East Europe) to tropical (French Guyana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the people live in areas with a temperate [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or [[hemiboreal]] climate (Northern [[Balkans]] and Central Europe).&lt;ref name=&quot;Humid Continental climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Humid Continental Climate |work=The physical environment |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |year=2007 |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |accessdate=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants (and growing, projected to be 90% in 7 states by 2020) living in urban areas. Cities are largely spread out across the EU, although with a large grouping in and around the [[Benelux]]. An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas. In some cases this urban growth has been due to the influx of EU funds into a region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/eea_report_2006_10/eea_report_10_2006.pdf Urban sprawl in Europe: The ignored challenge] European Environmental Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union is composed of 27 [[sovereign state|sovereign]] member states: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Countries|url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/index_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union's membership has grown from the original [[Inner Six|six founding states]]—Belgium, France, (then-[[West Germany|West) Germany]], Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands—to the present-day 27 by successive enlargements as countries acceded to the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]] and by doing so, pooled their sovereignty in exchange for representation in the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU institutions and other bodies|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm|publisher=Europa|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To join the EU a country must meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]], defined at the 1993 Copenhagen European Council. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the [[rule of law]]; a functioning [[market economy]] capable of competition within the EU; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Accession Criteria&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria)|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm|accessdate=26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No member state has ever left the Union, although [[Greenland]] (an [[autonomous area|autonomous province]] of Denmark) withdrew in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Greenland Treaty of 1985 |work=The European Union and Greenland |publisher=Greenland Home Rule Government |url=http://eu.nanoq.gl/Emner/EuGl/The%20Greenland%20Treaty.aspx |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] now provides a clause dealing with how a member leaves the EU.&lt;ref&gt;Article 50 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Croatia]] is expected to become the 28th member state of the EU on 1 July 2013 after a [[Croatian European Union membership referendum, 2012|referendum on EU membership]] was approved by Croatian voters on 22 January 2012. The Croatian accession treaty still has to be ratified by all current EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=As EU’s luster fades, Croats vote in favor of joining European Union |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/as-eus-luster-fades-croats-vote-in-referendum-on-eu-membership/2012/01/22/gIQASrinHQ_story.html |accessdate=25 January 2012 |newspaper=Washington Post |date=22 January 2012 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five candidate countries: [[Iceland]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]],&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Referred to by the EU as the &quot;former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Enlargement&quot;/&gt; [[Albania]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are officially recognised as potential candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Enlargement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=European Commission – Enlargement – Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/index_en.htm |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kosovo]] is also listed as a potential candidate but the European Commission does not list it as an independent country because [[International recognition of Kosovo|not all member states recognise it as an independent country separate from Serbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EC Kosovo Newsletter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlargement Newsletter|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/press_corner/newsletter/081120_en.htm|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four countries forming the [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] (that are not EU members) have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland (a candidate country for EU membership), [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Norway]], which are a part of the [[single market]] through the [[European Economic Area]], and [[Switzerland]], which has similar ties through [[Switzerland–European Union relations|bilateral treaties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EEA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU's relations with Switzerland|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/switzerland/index_en.htm|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships of the [[Microstates and the European Union|European microstates]], [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] include the use of the euro and other areas of cooperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;euro use world&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/world/outside_euro_area/index_en.htm|title=Use of the euro in the world|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|work=The euro outside the euro area|accessdate=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of the European Union}}

The EU operates solely within those competencies conferred on it upon the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]] and according to the principle of [[Subsidiarity#European Union law|subsidiarity]] (which dictates that action by the EU should only be taken where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states alone). [[European Union law|Laws made by the EU institutions]] are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures, and those which specifically require national implementation measures.&lt;ref&gt;These groups refer to regulations and directives respectively. These legislative instruments are dealt with in more detail [[#Acts|below]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance===
{{Main|EU institutions|Legislature of the European Union}}
{{Politics of the European Union}}

The European Union has seven institutions: the [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], the [[European Council]], the [[European Central Bank]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Competencies in scrutinising and amending legislation are divided between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union while executive tasks are carried out by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The [[monetary policy]] of the [[eurozone]] is governed by the [[European Central Bank]]. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.

====European Council====
[[File:Herman Van Rompuy at the 37th G8 Summit in Deauville 030.jpg|thumb|upright|125px|left|[[President of the European Council]], [[Herman Van Rompuy]]]]

The European Council gives direction to the EU, and convenes at least four times a year. It comprises the [[President of the European Council]], the [[President of the European Commission]] and one representative per [[member state of the European Union|member state]]; either its [[head of state]] or [[head of government]]. The European Council has been described by some as the Union's &quot;supreme political authority&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;How work&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the EU work|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_4/index_en.htm|accessdate=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is actively involved in the negotiation of the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaty changes]] and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.

The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a &quot;collective [[head of state]]&quot; and [[ratification|ratifies]] important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=aMsWxEnaqrUC&amp;pg=PA146 ''With US or against US?: European trends in American perspective''] Parsons, Jabko. European Union Studies Association, p.146:&lt;br&gt;''Fourth, the European Council acts a &quot;collective head of state&quot; for the EU.''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 2009, [[Herman Van Rompuy]] was chosen as the first permanent [[President of the European Council]]. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force and he assumed office. Ensuring the external representation of the EU,&lt;ref name=&quot;Council Press Release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/111298.pdf|title=President of the European Council|accessdate=24 November 2009|date=24 November 2009|format=PDF|publisher=General Secretariat of the Council of the EU}}&lt;/ref&gt; driving consensus and settling divergences among members are tasks for the President both during the convocations of the European Council and in the time periods between them. The European Council should not be mistaken for the [[Council of Europe]], an international organisation independent from the EU.

====Commission====
[[File:José Manuel Barroso at the 37th G8 Summit in Deauville 028.jpg|135px|left|thumb|[[President of the European Commission|Commission President]] [[José Manuel Barroso]]]]

The [[European Commission]] acts as the EU's [[executive (government)|executive arm]] and is responsible for [[Right of initiative (legislative)|initiating legislation]] and the day-to-day running of the EU. The Commission is also seen as the motor of [[European integration]]. It operates as a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet government]], with 27 [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]] for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.

One of the 27 is the [[President of the European Commission|Commission President]] (currently [[José Manuel Barroso|José Manuel Durão Barroso]]) appointed by the [[European Council]]. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] who is ''ex-officio'' [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice President of the Commission]] and is chosen by the European Council too.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 17|Treaty on European Union: Article 17:7]]&lt;/ref&gt; The other 25 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the [[Council of the European Union]] in agreement with the nominated President. The 27 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the [[European Parliament]].

====Parliament====
[[File:Institutions europeennes IMG 4300.jpg|thumb|left|The [[European Parliament]] building in [[Strasbourg]], France]]

The European Parliament (EP) forms one half of the [[Legislature of the European Union|EU's legislature]] (the other half is the Council of the European Union, see below). The 736 (soon to be 751) [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) are directly [[Elections in the European Union|elected]] by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] every five years on the basis of [[proportional representation]]. Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into [[European Parliament constituency|sub-national constituencies]] where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wellfire Interactive |url=http://www.fairvote.org/european-parliament-to-be-elected-with-proportional-representation-systems |title=MEPs must be elected on the basis of proportional representation, the threshold must not exceed 5%, and the electoral area may be subdivided in constituencies if this will not generally affect the proportional nature of the voting system |publisher=Fairvote.org |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:European Union legislative triangle.svg|thumb|180px|upright|right|The [[ordinary legislative procedure]] of the European Union.]]

The Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the [[ordinary legislative procedure]]. This also applies to the [[budget of the European Union|EU budget]]. Finally, the Commission is accountable to Parliament, requiring its approval to take office, having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it. The [[President of the European Parliament]] carries out the role of speaker in parliament and represents it externally. The EP President and [[Vice President of the European Parliament|Vice Presidents]] are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Institutions Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions: The European Parliament|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Council====
The [[Council of the European Union]] (also called the &quot;Council&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Latin word ''consilium'' is occasionally used when a single identifier is required, as on [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ the Council Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes referred to as the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/pol/inst/index_en.htm |title=Institutional affairs: Council of the European Union |date=6 January 2010 |work=Europa |publisher=European Commission |quote=It is commonly called the Council of Ministers}}&lt;/ref&gt; forms the other half of the EU's legislature. It consists of a [[minister (government)|government minister]] from each member state and meets in [[Council of the European Union#Configurations|different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed]]. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Institutions Council&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises [[executive functions]] in relations to the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]].

===Budget===

The 27 member state EU had an agreed budget of €120.7&amp;nbsp;billion for the year 2007 and €864.3&amp;nbsp;billion for the period 2007–2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/06/204&amp;format=HTML|title=Q&amp;A on Interinstitutional Agreement on Budgetary Discipline and Sound Financial Management 2007–2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 1.10% and 1.05% of the EU-27's [[Gross national income|GNI]] forecast for the respective periods. By comparison, the United Kingdom's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759&amp;nbsp;billion, and France was estimated to have spent €801&amp;nbsp;billion. In 1960, the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0.03% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |publisher=Profile Books |place=London |year=1999 |isbn=1-86197-102-8 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |author=David Smith. |title=Will Europe work? |last1=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 budget of €141.5&amp;nbsp;billion, the largest single expenditure item is &quot;''[[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|cohesion &amp; competitiveness]]''&quot; with around 45% of the total budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Budget in detail 2010|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|format=PDF|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_detail/current_year_en.htm|accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next comes &quot;''[[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]]''&quot; with approximately 31% of the total.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;/&gt; &quot;''Rural development, environment and [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]]''&quot; takes up around 11%.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;/&gt; &quot;''Administration''&quot; accounts for around 6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;/&gt; The &quot;''EU as a global partner''&quot; and &quot;''citizenship, freedom, security and justice''&quot; bring up the rear with approximately 6% and 1% respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUBudget2010&quot;/&gt;

The [[Court of Auditors]] aims to ensure that the [[budget of the European Union]] has been properly accounted for. The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and the European Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Institutions Auditors&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Auditors is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with &quot;a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (ex Article 248 TEC).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court has refused to do so every year since 1993, qualifying their report of the Union's accounts every year since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoA-Budget&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=EU accounts failed for 13th year |date=13 November 2007 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7092102.stm |accessdate=18 December 2010}} {{cite web |title=Court of Auditors gives qualified verdict on EU budget |first=Martin |last=Banks |publisher=TheParliament.com |date=10 November 2009 |url=http://www.theparliament.com/no_cache/latestnews/news-article/newsarticle/court-of-auditors-gives-qualified-verdict-on-eu-budget/ |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]] and the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|cohesion fund]], were materially affected by error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/5926723.PDF |title=Annual Report of the Court of Auditors on the implementation of the budget concerning the financial year 2009, together with the institutions' replies |page=12 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission estimated that the financial impact of irregularities was €1,863&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2009/en.pdf |title=Protection of the European Union's financial interests – Fight against fraud – Annual Report 2009 (''vid.'' pp. 6, 15) |publisher=Europa |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competences===
EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/events/2009/index.html|title=Competences and consumers|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what [[Legislature of the European Union|legislative procedure]] is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.

The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:
{{EU competences}}

==Legal system==
{{Further|European Union law|Treaties of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}

The EU is based on a series of [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]]. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources of EU law|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080228193407/http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm|archivedate=28 February 2008|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;art249&quot;&gt;See Article 288 (ex Article 249 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;Direct Effect&quot;&gt;According to the principle of Direct Effect first invoked in the Court of Justice's decision in {{cite court|litigants=Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen|reporter=Eur-Lex|court=European Court of Justice|year=1963|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:NOT}} See: Craig and de Búrca, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has [[legal personality]], with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |unused_data=author2-lastAndoura |editor1-first=Philippe |author2=lastAndoura |author1-link=de Schoutheete |first2=Sami |title=The Legal Personality of the European Union |journal=Studia Diplomatica |volume=LX |year=2007 |issue=1 |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/9083/01/Legal.Personality.EU-PDS-SA.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2010}} Its examples are the ratifications of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] and [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] by EU. And Article 47 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principle of [[Supremacy (European Union law)|supremacy]], national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;Supremacy&quot;&gt;According to the principle of [[Law of the European Union#Supremacy|Supremacy]] as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, ''Falminio Costa v. ENEL'' [1964] ECR 585. See Craig and de Búrca, ch. 7. See also: [[Factortame litigation]]: ''Factortame Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603'', ''Solange II'' (''Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft'', BVerfG decision of 22 October 1986 [1987] 3 CMLR 225,265) and ''Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze'' [1974] 2 CMLR 372; ''Raoul George Nicolo'' [1990] 1 CMLR 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courts of Justice===
The [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of the EU—formally called the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]]—consists of three courts: the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]], the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]], and the [[European Union Civil Service Tribunal]]. Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF |title=Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union |publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and [[Preliminary ruling|cases referred to it]] by the courts of member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Court of Justice: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/#competences |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Court: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/#compet |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and [[European Civil Service|its civil service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil Service Tribunal: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/T5_5230/#compétence |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.&lt;ref&gt;Article 256(1) (ex article 225(1)) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental rights===
[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|right|The last amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU came into force in 2009 and was the [[Lisbon Treaty]].]]

The treaties declare that the EU itself is &quot;founded on the values of respect for [[human dignity]], [[liberty|freedom]], [[democracy]], [[equality before the law|equality]], the [[rule of law]] and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to [[minority group|minorities]]... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title I: Common Provisions#Article 2|Article 2, Treaty on European Union (consolidated 01/12/09)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[Lisbon Treaty]] gave legal effect to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. The charter is a codified catalogue of [[fundamental right]]s against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the &quot;constitutional traditions common to the member states.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Case 11/70, Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v.

Although originally not legally binding the Charter was frequently cited by the EU's courts as encapsulating rights which the courts had long recognised as the fundamental principles of EU law.
Although signing the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership,&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;It is effectively treated as one of the Copenhagen criteria, [http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta08/ERES1610.htm Assembly.coe.int.] It should be noted that this is a political and not a legal requirement for membership.&lt;/ref&gt; previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a state&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;The European Convention on Human Rights was previously only open to members of the [[Council of Europe]] ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm Article 59.1 of the Convention]), and even now only states may become member of the Council of Europe ([http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm Article 4 of the Statute of the Council of Europe]).&lt;/ref&gt; nor had the competence to accede.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Opinion (2/92) of the European Court of Justice on &quot;Accession by the Community to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms&quot; [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994V0002:FR:NOT 1996 E.C.R. I-1759] (in French), ruled that the European Community did not have the competence to accede to the ECHR.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.

Althorugh, the EU is independent from [[Council of Europe]], they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law, human rights and democracy. Further [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and [[European Social Charter]], the [[source of law]] of [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fudamantal Rights]] are created by Council of Europe. The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the [[death penalty]] and has proposed its worldwide abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Policy on Death Penalty|author=European Commission|publisher=Europa Web Portal|accessdate=27 August 2009|url=http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/human_rights/adp/index_en.htm}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The death penalty in Europe|author=European Commission|publisher=Europa Web Portal|accessdate=27 August 2009|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/news/information_dossiers/conference_death_penalty/page_2_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts===
The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], and [[Decision (European Union)|decisions]]. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;See: Case 34/73, ''Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze'' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61973J0034:EN:NOT &lt;nowiki&gt;[1973]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ECR 981].&lt;/ref&gt; and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;art249&quot;/&gt; Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 27 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have [[direct effect]] in national law against member states.

Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in [[competition law]], or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|title=How EU takes decisions|accessdate=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice and home affairs==
{{Further|Area of freedom, security and justice}}
[[File:OffeneGrenzeNiederndorf-Oberaudorf.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Schengen Area]] comprises most member states ensuring open borders.]]

Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: [[Europol]] for co-operation of police forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European police office now in full swing|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/police/europol/fsj_police_europol_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurojust]] for co-operation between prosecutors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurojust coordinating cross-border prosecutions at EU level|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/eurojust/fsj_criminal_eurojust_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frontex]] for co-operation between border control authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Frontex?|url=http://www.frontex.europa.eu/|author=Frontex|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU also operates the [[Schengen Information System]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Internal borders&quot;/&gt; which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This cooperation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the [[Schengen Agreement]] and the associated cross border crime.

Furthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European arrest warrant replaces extradition between EU Member States|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; family law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33194_en.htm|title=Jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility (Brussels II)|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; asylum law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33150_en.htm|title=Minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_criminal_matters/l10110_en.htm|title=Specific Programme: 'Criminal Justice'|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;art39/141 Rome&quot;&gt;See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot; name=&quot;art2(7) Amsterdam&quot;&gt;See Article 2(7) of the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on [[sexism|sexual discrimination]] in the work-place, [[ageism|age discrimination]], and [[racism|racial discrimination]].&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, p. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16–22).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baroness Ashton headshot.jpg|thumb|left|upright|125px|[[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], [[Catherine Ashton]].]]

Foreign policy cooperation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common [[Commercial policy|Commercial Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy|url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm|accessdate=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps for a more wide ranging coordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of [[European Political Cooperation]] which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the [[Single European Act]]. EPC was renamed as the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP) by the [[Maastricht Treaty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EPC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm|title=European political co-operation (EPC)|accessdate=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal|author=The European commission|work=Europa Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the [[international community]] as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.&lt;ref name=&quot;art11 Union&quot;&gt;Article 21 of the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] (as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon), on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP makes disagreements, such as those which occurred over the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Iraq statement&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Divided EU agrees Iraq statement|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=27 January 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2697667.stm|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; not uncommon.

The co-ordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] (currently [[Catherine Ashton]]) who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The High Representative heads up the [[European External Action Service]] (EEAS), a unique EU department&lt;ref name=&quot;23Oct&quot;&gt;Rettman, Andrew (23 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28878 EU states envisage new foreign policy giant], EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt; that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isria.com/pages/2_December_2010_82.php &quot;Germany – Foreign Minister Westerwelle: European External Action Service gives Europe voice on world stage&quot;] –  Copyright 2010 – ISRIA – The European External Action Service today (1 December) officially came into operation.

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enlargement voice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=EU enlargement – voices from the debate|publisher=British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1139992114487|accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as &quot;[[soft power]]&quot;, as opposed to military &quot;hard power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soft Power&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bildt|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Bildt|title=Europe must keep its 'soft power'|work=Financial Times on [[Centre for European Reform]]|year=2005|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/bildt_ft_1june05.html|accessdate=26 June 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070609135542/http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/bildt_ft_1june05.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, the [[European Council]] agreed that &quot;the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO&quot;. To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the [[Helsinki Headline Goal]] process.

===Humanitarian aid===
{{Further|ECHO (European Commission)}}
[[File:ECHO plane.jpg|thumb|left|The EU is a large contributor of [[ECHO (European Commission)|foreign aid]]]]

The [[ECHO (European Commission)|European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office]], or &quot;ECHO&quot;, provides [[humanitarian aid]] from the EU to [[developing country|developing countries]]. In 2006 its budget amounted to €671&amp;nbsp;million, 48% of which went to the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|African, Caribbean and Pacific countries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ECHO 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=DG for humanitarian aid – ECHO, financial report 2006|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|year=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/echo/pdf_files/financial_report.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307042553/http://ec.europa.eu/echo/pdf_files/financial_report.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2008|accessdate=13 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70%) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the [[European Development Fund]] (30%).&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Mikaela Gavas 2010.

===Internal market===
{{Main|Internal Market}}

(Ireland model)]]

Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the [[single market]], and a [[European Union Customs Union|customs union]] between its member states. The single market involves [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|the free circulation of goods, capital, people and services within the EU]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Single Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the customs union involves the application of a [[common external tariff]] on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or [[import quota]]s, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of [[Iceland]], Norway, [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]] participate in the single market but not in the customs union.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/eea/ |title=The European Economic Area (EEA) |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market G&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Market for goods|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Single Market for Capital|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the drive towards [[economic and monetary union]] the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.

The free movement of persons means that [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market P&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Living and working in the Single Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm|author=European Commission|accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Single Market S&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A Single Market for Services |publisher=Europa |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |author=European Commission |accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.

===Competition===
{{Further|European Union competition law|European Commissioner for Competition}}

The EU operates a [[European Union competition law|competition policy]] intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues, approving [[mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], breaking up cartels, working for [[economic liberalism|economic liberalisation]] and preventing [[subsidy|state aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Europa web portal|title=Competition: making markets work better|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/index_en.html|accessdate=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition Commissioner]], currently [[Joaquín Almunia]], is one of the most powerful positions in the Commission, notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lungescu|first=Oana|publisher=BBC News|title=Examining the EU executive|date=23 July 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/3921303.stm|accessdate=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2001 the Commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States ([[General Electric|GE]] and [[Honeywell]]) which had already been approved by their national authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Europa web portal|title=The Commission prohibits GE's acquisition of Honeywell|date=3 July 2001|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/01/939|accessdate=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another high profile case [[European Union Microsoft competition case|against Microsoft]], resulted in the Commission fining [[Microsoft]] over €777&amp;nbsp;million following nine years of legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gow|first=David|work=The Guardian  |title=Microsoft caves in to European Commission|date=22 October 2007|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/oct/22/microsoft.microsoft|accessdate=12 November 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of a [[European Currency Unit|European single currency]] became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. However, it was only with the advent of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1993 that member states were legally bound to start the [[Currency union|monetary union]] no later than 1 January 1999. On this date the euro was duly [[History of the euro|launched by eleven]] of the then 15 member states of the EU. It remained an accounting currency until 1 January 2002, when [[euro banknotes|euro notes]] and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 17 countries, the most recent being Estonia which joined on 1 January 2011.

All other EU member states, except Denmark and the United Kingdom, are legally bound to join the euro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Almunia says 'undesirable' to act on Sweden's euro refusal |first1=Lucia |last1=Kubosova |first1=Teresa |last1=Kuchler |publisher=EUobserver.com |date=25 October 2006 |url=http://euobserver.com/9/22733 |accessdate=26 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] are met, however only a few countries have set target dates for accession. Sweden has circumvented the requirement to join the euro by not meeting the membership criteria.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;In order to meet the euro convergence criteria it is necessary first to join the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], something Sweden has declined to do: {{cite web |title=ERM II |publisher=Danish Finance Ministry |date=20 March 2009 |url=http://uk.fm.dk/Portfolio/International%20cooperation/EU%20economic%20and%20political%20coordination/ERM2.aspx |accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The euro is designed to help build a single market by, for example: easing travel of citizens and goods, eliminating [[exchange rate]] problems, providing price transparency, creating a single [[financial market]], price stability and low [[interest rate]]s, and providing a currency used internationally and protected against shocks by the large amount of internal trade within the eurozone. It is also intended as a political symbol of integration and stimulus for more.&lt;ref name=&quot;euro website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/index_en.htm|title=The Euro|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its launch the euro has become the second [[reserve currency]] in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_DE-PROD/PROD0000000000209994.PDF|title=Euro riding high as an inter- national reserve currency|date=4 May 2007|publisher=Deutsche Bank AG|format=PDF|author=DB Research|accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls [[monetary policy]] in that area with an agenda to maintain [[price stability]]. It is at the centre of the [[European System of Central Banks]], which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the [[President of the European Central Bank|President of the ECB]], who is appointed by the European Council, the Vice-President of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 27 EU member states.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECB org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ECB, ESCB and the Eurosystem|publisher=European Central Bank|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/escb/html/index.en.html|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monetary union has been shaken by the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] since 2009.

===Financial supervision===
The [[European System of Financial Supervisors]] is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the [[European Banking Authority]], the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]]. To complement this framework, there is also a [[European Systemic Risk Board]] under the responsibility of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/?aid=30866 EUobserver.com], [[EUobserver]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the 27 member states of the EU had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe).&lt;ref name=&quot;EurostatEnergy&quot;&gt;
{{cite press release|title=Energy consumption and production: EU27 energy dependence rate at 54% in 2006: Energy consumption stable|publisher=Eurostat|date=10 July 2008|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PGP_PRD_CAT_PREREL/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2008/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2008_MONTH_07/8-10072008-EN-AP.PDF|accessdate=12 September 2008|quote=&lt;br/&gt;

Gross inland consumption is defined as primary production plus imports, recovered products and stock change, less exports and fuel supply to maritime bunkers (for seagoing ships of all flags)...
&lt;br/&gt;

The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Energy Q&amp;A&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A: EU energy plans |publisher=BBC |date=9 March 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4783996.stm |accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the [[Internal Market (European Union)|internal market]], encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with [[Russia]] while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia&lt;ref name=oies&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shamil Midkhatovich Yenikeyeff|url=http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NG25-KazakhstansgasExportMarketsandExportRoutes-ShamilYenikeyeff-2008.pdf|title=Kazakhstan's Gas: Export Markets and Export Routes|publisher=[[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]]|format=PDF|date=November 2008|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing use of renewable energy; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Energy Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;

The EU currently imports 82% of its oil, 57% of its natural gas&lt;ref name=&quot;low carb prop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title='Low-carbon economy' proposed for Europe|publisher=MSNBC|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16560106/|accessdate=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 97.48% of its uranium&lt;ref name=&quot;Euratom2007&quot;/&gt; demands. There are concerns that [[Russia in the European energy sector|Europe's dependence on Russian energy]] is endangering the Union and its member countries.

The EU is working to improve cross-border infrastructure within the EU, for example through the [[Trans-European Networks]] (TEN). Projects under TEN include the [[Channel Tunnel]], [[LGV Est]], the [[Fréjus Rail Tunnel]], the [[Øresund Bridge|Öresund Bridge]], the [[Brenner Base Tunnel]] and the [[Strait of Messina Bridge]].

The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network. In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution. After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Paper on Transport|publisher=Euractiv|date=22 September 2004|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/transport/white-paper-transport/article-129628|accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Highways in Poland|Polish road network]] in particular was in poor condition: at Poland's accession to the EU, a number of roads needed to be upgraded, particularly the [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 autostrada]], requiring approximately €13&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EUR 650 million for the Polish Road Network|url=http://www.eib.org/projects/press/2006/2006-113-poland-eur-650-million-for-the-polish-road-network.htm|accessdate=Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU regional policy: Poland en route for growth|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/projects/stories/details_new.cfm?sto=1486|accessdate=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Common Agricultural Policy}}
[[File:ClosLaPlanaEdit.jpg|thumb|EU farms are supported by the [[Common Agricultural Policy|CAP]], the largest [[Budget of the European Union|budgetary]] expenditure. (Vineyard in Spain)]]

The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) is one of the oldest policies of the European Community, and was one of its core aims.&lt;ref name=&quot;stead&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Stead|first=David|coauthors=Robert Whaples (eds)|title=Common Agricultural Policy|publisher=EH.Net Encyclopedia|date=22 June 2007|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Stead.CAP|accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;Article 39 (ex Article 33) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then [[European Economic Community|European Community]]'s annual budget, and still accounts for around 34%.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU_CAP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/index_en.htm|title=Agriculture: Meeting the needs of farmers and consumers |date=26 August 2011|work=Europa: Gateway to the European Union|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=4 November 2011|quote=... the common agricultural policy is the most integrated of all EU policies and consequently takes a large share of the EU budget.

The policy's [[Incomes policy|price controls]] and market interventions led to considerable overproduction, resulting in so-called ''butter mountains'' and ''wine lakes''. These were [[Buffer stock scheme|intervention stores]] of produce bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. In order to dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their produce outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside of Europe, especially those in the [[Third World|developing world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian CAP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|title=The EU common agricultural policy|work=The Guardian  |date=26 June 2007|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/26/eu.politics1|accessdate=30 August 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overproduction has also been criticised for encouraging environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian CAP&quot;/&gt; Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living, in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life. However, the EU's small farmers receive only 8% of CAP's available subsidies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian CAP&quot;/&gt;

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially these reforms included the introduction of [[set-aside]] in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels, while maintaining agricultural income levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;stead&quot;/&gt; One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;EC CAP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime|publisher=Europa|date=14 April 2007|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
{{Further|European Commissioner for the Environment|European Climate Change Programme}}

In 1957 when the EU was founded, it had no environmental policy, no environmental bureaucracy, and no environmental laws.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds)(2012) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the EU has some of the most progressive environmental policies of any state in the world.  The environmental policy of the EU has therefore developed in remarkable fashion in the past four decades. An increasingly dense network of legislation has emerged, which now extends to all areas of environmental protection, including: air pollution control; water protection; waste management; nature conservation; and the control of chemicals, biotechnology and other industrial risks.&lt;ref&gt;Knill, C. and Liefferink, D.(2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute for European Environmental Policy]] estimates the body of EU environmental law amounts to well over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Environmental Policy 2012&quot;&gt;Institute for European Environmental Policy (2012) Manual of European Environmental Policy, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental policy has thus become a core area of European politics.

Such dynamic developments are surprising in light of the legal and institutional conditions which existed in the late 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref&gt;Knill, C. and Liefferink, D.(2012) The etsbalishment of EU environmental policy, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt; Acting without any legislative authority, European policy-makers initially increased the EU’s capacity to act by defining environmental policy as a trade problem. The most important reason for the introduction of a common environmental policy was the fear that trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S.P. and Corcelle, G. (1989) The Environmental Policy of the European Communities, Graham &amp; Trotman, London&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the course of time, EU environmental policy emerged as a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, policy principles and procedures. The legal basis of EU environmental policy was not more explicitly established until the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Environmental Policy 2012&quot;/&gt;

Initially, EU environmental policy was rather inward looking. More recently, however, the Union has demonstrated a growing leadership in global environmental governance. The role of the EU in securing the ratification and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in the face of US opposition is an example in this regard. This international dimension is reflected in the EU’s Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which recognizes that its strategic objectives can only be achieved if a series of key international environmental agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at an EU level and worldwide. The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty further strengthens the EU's global environmental leadership ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, D. and Adelle, C. (2012) European Union environmental policy after the Lisbon Treaty, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast body of EU environmental law which now exists has played a vital role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe as well as contributed to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for European Environmental Policy (2012) Manual of European Environmental Policy, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt; However, significant challenges remain, both to meet existing EU targets and aspirations and to agree new targets and actions that will further improve the environment and the quality of life in Europe and beyond. 

One of the top priorities of EU environmental policy is combatting climate change. In 2007, member states agreed that the EU is to use 20% [[renewable energy]] in the future and that it has to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;EUO energy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jan/23/climatechange.eu1|title=EU sets 20% target for carbon cuts|accessdate=29 February 2008|work=The Guardian |first=Jessica|last=Aldred|location=London|date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes measures that in 2020, 10% of the overall fuel quantity used by cars and trucks in [[Treaty of Accession 2005|EU 27]] should be running on renewable energy such as [[biofuel]]s. This is considered to be one of the most ambitious moves of an important industrialised region to fight [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Discovery energy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=how the eu plans to fight global warming|url=http://www.environmentconservation.org/environmental-global-warming/how-the-eu-plans-to-fight-global-warming/|accessdate=Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Windkraftanlagen Dänemark gross.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Renewable energy]] is one priority in transnational research activities such as the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|seventh framework programme]]]]

Education and science are areas where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In education, the policy was mainly developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the [[Erasmus Programme]], a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20&amp;nbsp;years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th anniversary|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html|accessdate=21 July 2007}}; {{cite web|last=Jean-Sébastien|first=Lefebvre|title=Erasmus turns 20 – time to grow up?|date=22 January 2007|publisher=Café Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/19702/erasmus-turns-20-time-to-grow-up.html|accessdate=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in [[vocational education|vocational education and training]], and for adult learners in the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EACEA|title=About the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm|accessdate=21 July 2007}}; {{cite web|title=Lifelong Learning Programme|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html|accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its support of the [[Bologna Process|Bologna process]] the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.

Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent [[European Research Council]] allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the ERC?|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Research Council|url=http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&amp;topicID=12|accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|research and technological framework programmes]] deal in a number of areas, for example energy where it aims to develop a diverse mix of [[renewable energy]] for the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm?pg=energy|accessdate=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care==
{{further|Healthcare in Europe}}
[[File:Carte Européenne d'Assurance Maladie France.jpg|thumb|[[European Health Insurance Card]].&lt;br&gt; (French version pictured)]]

Although the EU has no major competences in the field of health care, Article 35 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] affirms that &quot;A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities&quot;. All the member states have either publicly sponsored and regulated [[universal health care]] or publicly provided universal health care. The [[European Commission]]'s [[Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Health and Consumers]] seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/about_us/our_vision_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/index_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu/index_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily [[Publicly-funded health care|publicly funded]] through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance. 

All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free [[European Health Insurance Card]] which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcareabroad/pages/Healthcareabroad.aspx |title=info about health care and EHIC |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting cooperation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/lsa/119514.pdf Consilium.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:0045:0065:EN:PDF Eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Factsheets/Pages/Cross-border-healthcare-commissioners.aspx NHSconfed.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 47.3 million people lived in the EU, who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad], Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, the EU had an estimated [[List of countries by Muslim population|Muslim population]] of 13&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=&quot;mgmpPRC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim Population |publisher=europa web portal|url=http://www.fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/Manifestations_EN.pdf|accessdate=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated [[Jewish population]] of over a million.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish population figures may be unreliable. {{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/concepts/demography/demjpop.html|title=World Jewish Population (2002)|accessdate=3 May 2007|author=Sergio DellaPergola|work=American Jewish Year Book|publisher=The Jewish Agency for Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurostat]]'s [[Eurobarometer]] opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52% of EU citizens believed in a god, 27% in &quot;some sort of spirit or life force&quot;, and 18% had no form of belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurostat Religion&quot;/&gt; Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;About SecE&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-02-21-god-europe_x.htm|title=What place for God in Europe|accessdate=24 July 2009|date=22 February 2005|first=Peter|last=Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16%) and the Czech Republic (19%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurostat Religion&quot;/&gt; The most religious countries are Malta (95%; predominantly Roman Catholic), and Cyprus and Romania both with about 90% of the citizens believing in God (both predominantly Orthodox). Across the EU, belief was higher among women, increased with age, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 with a basic education, and those &quot;positioning themselves on the right of the political scale (57%).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurostat Religion&quot;/&gt;

Sport is mainly the responsibility of an individual member states or other international organisations rather than that of the EU. However, there are some EU policies that have had an impact on sport, such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the [[Bosman ruling]], which prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with European citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Boseman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Fordyce |first=Tom |title=10&amp;nbsp;years since Bosman|publisher=BBC News |date=11 July 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4528732.stm|accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity.&lt;ref&gt;Cases C-403/08 and C-429/08, Opinon of Advocate General Kokott, para 207&lt;/ref&gt; This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[FIFA]], due to objections over the applications of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;IHT RT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=IOC, FIFA presidents welcomes new EU treaty, call it breakthrough to give sports more power|work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=19 October 2007 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/19/sports/EU-SPT-OLY-EU-Treaty.php |accessdate=21 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU does fund a program for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/israel/press_corner/all_news/news/2011/20110329_01_en.htm Sports coaches from Israel travel to UK for training]&lt;/ref&gt;
