'''Affirmative action''' refers to policies that take factors including &quot;race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or national origin&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Federal Register&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| title = Affirmative Action
| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/
| accessdate =4/6/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually justified as countering the effects of a history of discrimination.

==Origins==
The term &quot;affirmative action&quot; was first used in the United States in [[Executive Order 10925]] and was signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] on 6 March 1961; it was used to promote actions that achieve non-discrimination. In 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] enacted [[Executive Order 11246]] which required government employers to take &quot;affirmative action&quot; to hire without regard to race, religion and national origin. In 1968, gender was added to the anti-discrimination list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/aa/aa02.html |title=Affirmative Action: History and Rationale |publisher=Clinton Administration's Affirmative Action Review: Report to the President |date=19 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable procedures in other countries are also known as [[reservation in India]], [[United Kingdom employment equality law|positive discrimination in the United Kingdom]], and [[Employment equity (Canada)|employment equity in Canada]].

==Purpose==

Affirmative action is intended to promote 
[[equal opportunity]]. It is often instituted in government and educational settings to ensure that [[minority group]]s within a society are included in all programs. The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or [[exploitation]] by the ruling class of a culture,&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (2004). Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study, Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-10199-6&lt;/ref&gt; and to address existing discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Affirmative Action&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/|title=Affirmative Action|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of affirmative action, especially in the United States, is considered by its proponents to be justified by [[disparate impact]].

==Quotas==

Quotas are not legal in the United States. No employer, university, or other entity may create a set number required for each race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labor-employment-law.lawyers.com/employment-discrimination/Affirmative-Action.html |title=Affirmative Action |publisher=Labor-employment-law.lawyers.com |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that &quot;affirmative action&quot; ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful. It said that the requirements for the intake should be the same for all. The Justice Chancellor said that the decision left no room for uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/5871/20061221/ Uppsala discriminated against Swedes], The Local, 21 December 06&lt;/ref&gt;

==International policies==
The International [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] stipulates (in Article 2.2) that affirmative action programs may be required of countries that  ratified the convention, in order to rectify systematic discrimination. It states, however, that such programs &quot;shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.&quot; The United Nations Human/Animals Rights Committee states that &quot;the principle of equality sometimes requires States parties to take affirmative action in order to diminish or eliminate conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination prohibited by the Covenant. For example, in a State where the general conditions of a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a time to the part of the population concerned certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination, in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on Human Rights, [http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/3888b0541f8501c9c12563ed004b8d0e?Opendocument General Comment 18 on Non-discrimination, Paragraph 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National approaches==
In some countries which have laws on racial equality, affirmative action is rendered illegal because it does not treat all races equally. This approach of equal treatment is sometimes described as being &quot;[[Color blindness (race)|color blind]]&quot;, in hopes that it is effective against discrimination without engaging in [[reverse discrimination]].

In such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force. This is sometimes described as &quot;positive action.&quot;

===The Americas===

====Brazil====
Some Brazilian Universities (State and Federal) have created systems of preferred admissions (quotas) for racial minorities (blacks and native Brazilians), the poor and people with disabilities. There are also quotas of up to 20% of vacancies reserved for the disabled in the civil public services.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, Robert. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5357842.stm &quot;Black Brazil Seeks a Better Future.&quot;] BBC News São Paulo, 25 September 2006. 16 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] party, accusing the board of directors of the [[University of Brasília]] of &quot;Nazism&quot;, appealed to the [[Supreme Federal Court]] the [[constitutionality]] of the quotas the University reserves for minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Por Rodrigo Haidar e Filipe Coutinho |url=http://www.conjur.com.br/2009-jul-20/dem-unb-ressuscitou-ideais-nazistas-suspensao-matriculas |title=DEM entra com ADPF contra cotas raciais |language={{pt icon}} |publisher=Conjur.com.br |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court refused to overturn the quotas and unanimously approved their constitutionality on 26 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Débora Santos |url =http://g1.globo.com/vestibular-e-educacao/noticia/2012/04/stf-decide-por-unanimidade-pela-constitucionalidade-das-cotas-raciais.html | title=Supremo decide pro unanimidade pela constiucionalidade das cotas |language={{pt icon}}| publisher=g1.globo.com | accessdate=3June2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
The equality section of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] explicitly permits affirmative action type legislation, although the Charter does not ''require'' legislation that gives preferential treatment. Subsection 2 of [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] states that the equality provisions do &quot;not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.&quot; The [[Canadian Employment Equity Act]] requires employers in federally-regulated industries to give preferential treatment to four designated groups: Women, people with disabilities, aboriginal people, and [[visible minorities]]. In most Canadian Universities, people of Aboriginal background normally have lower entrance requirements and are eligible to receive exclusive scholarships. Some provinces and territories also have affirmative action-type policies. For example, in [[Northwest Territories]] in the Canadian north, aboriginal people are given preference for jobs and education and are considered to have P1 status. Non-aboriginal people who were born in the NWT or have resided half of their life there are considered a P2, as well as women and disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hr.gov.nt.ca/employment/affirmativeaction/ |title=GNWT – Human Resources – Affirmative Action |publisher=Hr.gov.nt.ca |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also, [[Employment equity (Canada)|Employment equity in Canada]].

====United States====
{{Main|Affirmative action in the United States}}
Affirmative action was first created from [[Executive Order 10925]], which was signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] on 6 March 1961 and required that government employers &quot;not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin&quot; and &quot;take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Johnson]] signed [[Executive Order 11246]], thereby replacing [[Executive Order 10925]] and affirming Federal Government's commitment &quot;to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a positive, continuing program in each executive department and agency&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Federal Register&quot;/&gt; It is notable that affirmative action was not extended to women until [[Executive Order 11375]] amended Executive Order 11246 on 13 October 1967, expanding the definition to include &quot;sex.&quot; Presently, affirmative action expressed through Executive Order 11246 considers factors of &quot;race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot; In the U.S., affirmative action's original purpose was to pressure institutions into compliance with the nondiscrimination mandate of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Affirmative Action&quot;/&gt; The Civil Rights Acts do not cover veterans, people with disabilities, or people over 40. These groups are protected from discrimination under different laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://employeeissues.com/discrimination_laws.htm|title=Federal Employment Discrimination Laws|publisher=EmployeeIssues.com|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative action has been the subject of numerous court cases,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080205/LOCAL/80205048 Indy fire-fighters sue city, charge bias; also see [[Norma M. Riccucci]]. Managing Diversity in Public Sector Workforces. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been questioned upon its [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] legitimacy. In 2003, a Supreme Court decision (Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 US 244 – Supreme Court 2003) regarding affirmative action in higher education permitted educational institutions to consider race as a factor; a small plus factor, when admitting students, but ruled that strict point systems are unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/03highlts.html#2 Highlights of the 2002–2003 Supreme Court Term]&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, some colleges use financial criteria to attract racial groups that have typically been under-represented and typically have lower living conditions. Some states such as California ([[California Civil Rights Initiative]]), Michigan ([[Michigan Civil Rights Initiative]]), and Washington ([[Initiative 200]]) have passed constitutional amendments banning affirmative action within their respective states.  Conservative activists have alleged that colleges quietly use illegal quotas and have launched numerous lawsuits to stop them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven M. Teles|title=The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement: The Battle for Control of the Law|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MTps-NK20jAC&amp;pg=PA235|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=235–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
*Israel
In attempt to close the gap between Arab and Jewish education sectors, the Israeli education minister announced an affirmative action policy, promising that Arabs would be granted 25% of the education budget, more than their proportional share in the population (18%). He also added that the ministry would support the creations of an Arab academic college.&lt;ref&gt;^ Middle East Contemporary Survey, Volume 23; By Bruce Maddy-Weitzman. p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Asia===

*India{{Main|Reservation in India}}

*Sri Lanka. In 1971 the Standardization policy of Sri Lankan universities was introduced as an affirmative action program for students from areas which had poor educational facilities due to 200 years purposeful discrimination by British [[colonialist]]s. The British had practised [[communal]] favoritism towards Christians and the minority [[Tamil people|Tamil community]] for the entire 200 years they had controlled Sri Lanka, as part of a policy of [[divide and conquer]].

===East Asia===

*Japan. Admission to universities as well as all government positions (including teachers) are determined by the entrance exam, which is extremely competitive at the top level. It is illegal to include sex, ethnicity or other social background (but not nationality) in criteria; however, there are informal policies to provide employment and long term welfare (which is usually not available to general public) to [[Burakumin]] at municipality level.

*People's Republic of China. &quot;Preferential policies&quot; required some of the top positions in governments be distributed to [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] and women. Also, many universities are required by government to give preferred admissions to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.cn/edoas/website18/30/info26630.htm2007 Graduate Student Admission Ordainment – Ministry of Education, PRC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzzjw.gd.gov.cn/mzjy/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=541 |title=Ethnic and Religious Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province |publisher=Mzzjw.gd.gov.cn |date=15 October 2007 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*South Korea. Admission to universities is also determined by the strict entrance exam, which is extremely competitive at the top level. But most of all Korean universities at the top level are adapting some affirmative actions in cases of Chinese ethnic minority, North Korean refugees, etc. in their recruiting new students. Besides, national universities have been pressed by the Korean government, so now they are trying to meet the governmental goal which is to recruit a proportion of female professors.

===South East Asia and Oceania===

*Malaysia. The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of affirmative action. Malaysia provides affirmative action to the majority because in general, the Malays have lower income than the Chinese who have traditionally been involved in businesses and industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Malaysia-POVERTY-AND-WEALTH.html |title=Encyclopedia of the Nations, &quot;Malaysia Poverty and Wealth&quot; |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia is a multi-ethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]]s making up the majority of close to 52% of the population. About 30% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysians of Chinese descent]], while [[Indian Malaysian|Malaysians of Indian descent]] comprise about 8% of the population. Government policy provides preferential placement for ethnic Malays, and 95% of all new intakes for the army, hospital nurses, police, and other government institutions are Malays. As of 2004, only 7% of all government servants are ethnic Chinese, a drop from 30% in 1960. All eight of the  directors of the national petroleum company, [[Petronas]], are Malays, and only 3% of Petronas employees are Chinese. Additionally, 95% of all government contracts are awarded to ethnic Malays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perspectives.com/forums/view_topic.php?id=128113&amp;forum_id=89 Bumiputra Policy in Malaysia]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''See also [[Bumiputra]]'') The mean income for Malays, Chinese and Indians in 1957/58 were 134, 288 and 228 respectively. In 1967/68 it was 154, 329 and 245, and in 1970 it was 170, 390 and 300.  Mean income disparity ratio for Chinese/Malays rose from 2.1 in 1957/58 to 2.3 in 1970, whereas for Indians/Malays the disparity ratio also rose from 1.7 to 1.8 in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perumal |first=M. |year=1989 |title=Economic Growth and Income Inequality in Malaysia, 1957–1984 |journal=Singapore Economic Review |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=33–46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malays viewed Independence as restoring their proper place in their own country's socioeconomic order while the non-Malays were opposing government efforts to advance Malay political primacy and economic welfare.

*New Zealand. Individuals of [[Māori people|Māori]] or other [[Polynesia]]n descent are often afforded improved access to university courses, or have scholarships earmarked specifically for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;cre&quot;&gt;UK [[Commission for Racial Equality]] website [http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0l0.RefLocID-0hg01b001006009.Lang-EN.htm &quot;Affirmative action around the world&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative action is provided for under section 73 of the Human Rights Act 1993&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304672.html&lt;/ref&gt; and section 19(2) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225519.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Europe===
*Finland. In certain university education programs, including legal and medical education, there are quotas for persons who reach a certain standard of skills in the [[Swedish language]]; for students admitted in these quotas, the education is partially arranged in Swedish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helsinki med&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hakuopas 2011.

In addition to these linguistic quotas, women may get preferential treatment in recruitment for certain public sector jobs if there is a gender imbalance in the field.

*France. No distinctions based on race, religion or sex are allowed under the 1958 [[French Constitution]].&lt;http://thisnation.com/library/france.html&gt; Since the 1980s, a French version of affirmative action based on neighborhood is in place for primary and secondary education. Some schools, in neighborhoods labeled &quot;Priority Education Zones&quot;, are granted more funds than the others. Students from these schools also benefit from special policies in certain  institutions (such as [[Sciences Po]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The French Ministry of Defence tried in 1990 to give more easily higher ranks and driving licenses to young French soldiers with North-African ancestry. After a strong protest by a young French lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Steinhofer: &quot;Beur ou ordinaire&quot; in ''Armée d'Ajourd'hui'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Ministry of Defence newspaper (''Armées d'aujourd'hui''), this driving license and rank project was cancelled. After the Sarkozy election, a new attempt in favour of Arabian-French students was made but Sarkozy did not gain enough political support to change the French constitution. However, highly ranked French schools do implement affirmative action in that they are obligated to take a certain amount of students from impoverished families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2008/12/17/le-plan-sarkozy-pour-favoriser-l-egalite-reelle-des-chances_1132074_823448.html#ens_id=1128487° |title=&quot;Le Plan Sarkozy&quot;, '&amp;#39;Le Monde'&amp;#39; |work=Le Monde  |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt; Additionally, following the Norwegian example, after 27 January 2014, women must represent at least 20% of board members in all stock exchange listed or state owned companies. After 27 January 2017, the proportion will increase to 40%. All male director nominations will be invalid as long as the condition is not met, and financial penalties may apply for other directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/actualite/panorama/texte-discussion/proposition-loi-relative-representation-equilibree-femmes-hommes-au-sein-conseils-administration-surveillance-egalite-professionnelle.html |title=Vie Publique |publisher=Vie-publique.fr |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dahrendorf.jpg|thumb|[[Ralf Dahrendorf]] was in favour of affirmative action]]
*Germany. Article 3 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] provides for equal rights of all people regardless of sex, race or social background. There are programs stating that if men and women have equal qualifications, women have to be preferred for a job; moreover, the handicapped should be preferred to healthy people. This is typical for all positions in state and university service as of 2007, typically using the phrase &quot;We try to increase diversity in this line of work&quot;. In recent years, there has been a long public debate about whether to issue programs that would grant women a privileged access to jobs in order to fight discrimination. Germany's ''[[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]]'' brought up the discussion about affirmative action in [[Education in Germany|Germany's school system]]. According to [[Stefan Zillich]], quotas should be &quot;a possibility&quot; to help working class children who did not do well in school gain access to a ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'' (University-preparatory school).&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Vieth-Entus (29. December 2008): &quot;Sozialquote: Berliner Gymnasien sollen mehr Schüler aus armen Familien aufnehmen&quot;. Der Tagesspiegel&lt;/ref&gt; Headmasters of ''Gymnasien'' have objected, saying that this type of policy would &quot;be a disservice&quot; to poor children.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Klesmann (23 February 2009). &quot;'Kinder aus Neukölln würden sich nicht integrieren lassen' – Ein Politiker und ein Schulleiter streiten über Sozialquoten an Gymnasien&quot;. Berliner Zeitung&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Berlin Senate]] decided that Berlin's Gymnasium should no longer be allowed to handpick all of their students. It was ruled that while Gymnasien should be able to pick 70% to 65% of their students, the other places at the Gymnasien are to be allocated by lottery. Every child will be able to enter the lottery, no matter how he or she performed in primary school. It is hoped that this policy will increase the number of working class students attending a Gymnasium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heinz-Peter Meidinger 2009&quot;&gt;Heinz-Peter Meidinger: &quot;Berliner Schullotterie&quot;. Profil 07-08/2009 (24 August. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] proposed that Berlin Gymnasien should no longer be allowed to expel students who perform poorly so that the students who won a Gymnasium place in the lottery have a fair chance of graduating from that school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heinz-Peter Meidinger 2009&quot;/&gt; It is not clear yet if Berlin's senate will decide in favour of [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]s proposal. There is also a discussion going on if affirmative action should be employed to help the children and grandchildren of the so-called ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' gain better access to German universities.

====Apartheid====
The [[Apartheid]] government, as a matter of state policy, favoured white-owned companies and as a result, the majority of employers in South Africa were white people. The aforementioned policies achieved the desired results, but in the process they marginalised and excluded black people. Skilled jobs were also reserved for white people, and blacks were largely used as unskilled labour, enforced by legislation including the [[Mines and Works Act]], the [[Job Reservations Act]], the [[Native Building Workers Act]], the [[Apprenticeship Act]] and the [[Bantu Education Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southendmuseum.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=20 |title=Job Reservations Act |publisher=South End Museum |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating and extending the &quot;colour bar&quot; in South African labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/onlinebooks/Luli/Gold-and-workers/part%203/unit15.htm#1 |title=White Workers and the Colour Bar |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in early 20th century South Africa mine owners preferred hiring black workers because they were cheaper.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Discrimination.html Discrimination], The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, Library of Economics&lt;/ref&gt; Then the whites successfully persuaded the government to enact laws that highly restricted the blacks' employment opportunities.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

Since the 1960s the Apartheid laws had been weakened. Consequently, from 1975 to 1990 the real wages of black manufacturing workers rose by 50%, that of whites by 1%.&lt;ref name=africa&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/244570 Race, law and poverty in the new South Africa], The Economist, 30 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-apartheid Employment Equity====
Following the transition to democracy in 1994, the [[African National Congress]]-led government chose to implement affirmative action legislation to correct previous imbalances (a policy known as '''Employment Equity'''). As such, all employers were compelled by law to employ previously disenfranchised groups (blacks, [[Indian South Africans|Indians]], and [[Coloureds]]). A related, but distinct concept is [[Black Economic Empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecsecc.org/files/publications/120307130010.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Employment Equity Act]] and the [[Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment]] Act aim to promote and achieve equality in the workplace (in South Africa termed &quot;equity&quot;), by advancing people from designated groups. The designated groups who are to be advanced include all people of colour, women (including white women) and [[disabled people]] (including whites). Employment Equity legislation requires companies employing more than 50 people to design and implement plans to improve the representativity of workforce demographics, and report them to the [[Department of Labour (South Africa)|Department of Labour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/services/rights/employmentequity.htm |title=Employment Equity FAQ |publisher=Southafrica.info |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment Equity also forms part of a company's [[Black Economic Empowerment]] scorecard: in a relatively complex scoring system, which allows for some flexibility in the manner in which each company meets its legal commitments, each company is required to meet minimum requirements in terms of representation by previously disadvantaged groups. The matters covered include equity ownership, representation at employee and management level (up to board of director level), procurement from black-owned businesses and social investment programs, amongst others.

The policies of Employment Equity and, particularly, Black Economic empowerment have been criticised both by those who view them as discriminatory against white people, and by those who view them as ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-02-03-bees-glass-slipper |title=BEE's Glass Slipper |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page292679?oid=346519&amp;sn=2009+Detail+no+image&amp;pid=295799 |title=BEE: A man made disaster |publisher=Moneyweb.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fin24.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-24_2564628 |title='SAB deal to enrich black elite': Fin24: Companies |publisher=Fin24 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=5340048 |title=Business Report – Home – Motlanthe warns BEE council has failed |publisher=Busrep.co.za |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-11-20-manyi-vows-to-get-tough-over-bee |title=Manyi vows to get tough over BEE – Mail &amp; Guardian Online: The smart news source |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws cause disproportionally high costs for small companies and reduce economic growth and employment.&lt;ref name=africa/&gt; The laws may give the black middle-class some advantage but can make the worse-off blacks even poorer.&lt;ref name=africa/&gt; Moreover, the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] has ruled that in principle blacks may be favored, but in practice this should not lead to unfair discrimination against the others.&lt;ref name=africa/&gt; Yet it is impossible to favor somebody without discriminating against others.&lt;ref name=africa/&gt;

==Alternative views==
A 2009 [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] survey found American voters opposed to the application of affirmative action to gay people, 65 over 27 percent. African-Americans were found to be in favor by 54 over 38 percent.&lt;ref name=qui&gt;[http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1307 U.S. Voters Disagree 3-1 With Sotomayor On Key Case]. [[Quinnipiac University]]. Published 3 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=May 2010}}

===Polls===
According to a poll taken by ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2005, majority of Americans support affirmative action for women, while with [[minority group]]s though, it is more split.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/polls/tables/live/0623.htm | work=USA Today | date=20 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are only slightly more likely to support affirmative action for women; though a majority of both do.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday.com&quot;/&gt; However, a slight majority of Americans do believe that affirmative action goes beyond ensuring access and goes into the realm of preferential treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday.com&quot;/&gt; More recently, a Quinnipiac poll from June 2009 finds that 55% of Americans feel that affirmative action should be discontinued, yet 55% support affirmative action for disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Quinnipiac University – Office of Public Affairs |url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1307 |title=National (US) Poll * June 3, 2009 * U.S. Voters Disagree 3-1 With – Quinnipiac University – Hamden, Connecticut |publisher=Quinnipiac.edu |date=3 June 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A Leger poll taken in 2010 finds 59% of Canadians oppose considering race, gender, or ethnicity when hiring for government jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[David Akin]], QMI Agency Parliamentary Bureau Chief |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/08/12/14998311.html |title=Canadians against job hiring quotas &amp;#124; Canada &amp;#124; News |work=Toronto Sun |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
The principle of affirmative action is to promote societal equality through the preferential treatment of socioeconomically disadvantaged people. Often, these people are disadvantaged for historical reasons, such as oppression or slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Jaffrelot , India's Silent Revolution : The rise of lower castes in northern India, pg. 321 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws.

===Opposition===
Opponents of affirmative action such as [[George Sher]] believe that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who are chosen based on the social group to which they belong rather than their qualifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher, George 1983, p.40&quot;&gt;Sher, George, &quot;Preferential Hiring&quot;, in Tom Regan (ed.), Just Business: New Introductory Essays In Business Ethics, Philadelphia, Temple University Press, 1983, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents also contend that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of all those who belong to groups it is intended to help, therefore making affirmative action counterproductive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher, George 1983, p.40&quot;/&gt;  Opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acri.org/ |title=American Civil Rights Institute |publisher=Acri.org |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sometimes say that affirmative action is &quot;[[reverse discrimination]]&quot;, further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals. They argue that it hinders reconciliation, replaces old wrongs with new wrongs, undermines the achievements of minorities, and encourages individuals to identify themselves as disadvantaged, even if they are not. It may increase racial tension and benefit the more privileged people within [[minority group]]s at the expense of the least fortunate within majority groups (such as lower-class whites).&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural Whiplash: Unforeseen Consequences of America's Crusade Against Racial Discrimination'' / Patrick Garry (2006) ISBN 1-58182-569-2&lt;/ref&gt;
American economist, social and political commentator, Dr. [[Thomas Sowell]] identified some negative results of race-based affirmative action in his book, ''[[Affirmative Action Around the World|Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study]]''.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 0-300-10199-6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups (i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action) to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor whites or Asians); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they increase animosity toward preferred groups.

==Mismatching==
'''Mismatching''' is the term given to the negative effect that affirmative action has when it places a student into a college that is too difficult for him or her. For example, according to the theory, in the absence of affirmative action, a student will be admitted to a college that matches his or her academic ability and have a good chance of graduating. However, according to the mismatching theory, affirmative action often places a student into a college that is too difficult, and this increases the student's chance of dropping out. Thus, according to the theory, affirmative action hurts its intended beneficiaries, because it increases their dropout rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-sander26sep26,0,3998908.story?coll=la-opinion-center Does affirmative action hurt minorities?], ''Los Angeles Times'', 26 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell010803.asp  Quotas on trial], by Thomas Sowell, 8 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence in support of the mismatching theory was presented by Gail Heriot, a professor of law at the [[University of San Diego]] and a member of the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]], in an 24 August 2007 article published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. The article reported on a 2004 study that was conducted by [[UCLA]] law professor Richard Sander and published in the ''[[Stanford Law Review]]''. The study concluded that there were 7.9% fewer black attorneys than there would have been if there was no affirmative action. The study was titled, &quot;A Systemic Analysis of Affirmative Action in American Law Schools.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118792252575507571.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries Affirmative Action Backfires], by Gail Heriot, ''Wall Street Journal'', 24 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The article also states that because of mismatching, blacks are more likely to drop out of law school and fail bar exams.&lt;ref name=Sander&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sander|first=Richard|title=A SYSTEMIC ANALYSIS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS|journal=Stanford Law Review|year=2004|pages=367–483|url=http://www2.law.ucla.edu/sander/Systemic/final/SanderFINAL.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sander's paper on mismatching has been criticized by several law professors, including Ian Ayres and Richard Brooks from Yale who argue that eliminating affirmative action would actually reduce the number of black lawyers by 12.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisman |first=Ray |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2005/04/sanding_down_sander.html |title=Slate.com |publisher=Slate.com |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
