==History of national reform efforts==
{{Main|History of health care reform in the United States}}

Here is a summary of reform achievements at the national level in the United States. For failed efforts, State based efforts, native tribes services and more details generally, see the main article [[History of health care reform in the United States]].

*'''1965''' President [[Lyndon Johnson]] enacted legislation that introduced [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], covering both hospital and general medical insurance for senior citizens paid for by a Federal employment tax over the working life of the retiree, and [[Medicaid]] permitted the Federal government to partially fund a program for the poor, with the program managed and co-financed by the individual states.&lt;ref name=&quot;MedHist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= |year=2010 |title=Brief history of the Medicare program |publisher=SeniorJournal.org |location=San Antonio, Tex. |publisher=New Tech Media |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/2000%20Files/Aug%2000/FTR-08-04-00MedCarHistry.htm |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ball, Robert M. |date=October 24, 1961 |title=The role of social insurance in preventing economic dependency (address at the Second National Conference on the Churches and Social Welfare, Cleveland, Ohio) |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Social Security Administration|U.S. Social Security Administration]] |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/churches.html |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}
* Robert M. Ball, the then Deputy Director of the Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance in the Social Security Administration had defined the major obstacle to financing health insurance for the elderly several years earlier: the high cost of care for the aged and the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger, employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance in the same way as cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1985''' The [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985]] (COBRA) amended the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA) to give some employees the ability to continue [[health insurance]] coverage after leaving employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |year=2010 |title=An employee's guide to health benefits under COBRA - The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Employee Benefits Security Administration]], [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf |accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1997''' The [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], or SCHIP, was established by the federal government in 1997 to provide health insurance to children in families at or below 200&amp;nbsp;percent of the federal poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |year=2007 |title=What is SCHIP? |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Center for Public Policy Research]] |url=http://www.schip-info.org/42.html |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2010''' The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] is enacted by President [[Barack Obama]], providing for the purhased introduction over four years of a comprehensive system of mandated health insurance with reforms designed to eliminate &quot;some of the worst practices of the insurance companies&quot; &amp;mdash; pre-condition screening and premium loadings, policy rescinds on technicalities when illness seems imminent, annual and lifetime coverage caps. It also sets a minimum ratio of direct health care spending to premium income, and creates price competition bolstered by the creation of three standard insurance coverage levels to enable like-for-like comparisons by consumers, and a web-based health insurance exchange where consumers can compare prices and purchase plans. The system preserves private insurance and private health care providers and provides more subsidies to enable the poor to buy insurance.

==The 2010 Federal Reform Legislation==
In March 2010, President Obama gave a speech at a rally in Pennsylvania explaining the necessity of health insurance reform and calling on Congress to hold a final up or down vote on reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/fighting-for-health-insurance-reform President's speech prior to passage of the legislation]&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012}}, the legislation remains [[controversial]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/us/jan-june10/healthcare_03-23.html NewsHour Extra: Democrats Push Through Historic, Controversial Health Care Legislation | March 23, 2010 | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/one-year-later-health-care-reform-still-controversial/Content?oid=2146332 One Year Later, Health-Care Reform Still Controversial | Some lawmakers still pushing to nullify federal policy | Unda' the Rotunda | Boise Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700121160/Wednesday-marks-birth-of-controversial-Obamacare.html Wednesday marks birth of controversial Obamacare | Deseret News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/20/will-the-supreme-court-strike-down-health-care-reform.html Will the Supreme Court Strike Down Health-Care Reform? - The Daily Beast&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=13787 MMS: Error&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with some states challenging it in federal court and opposition from some voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/six-more-states-join-floridas-lawsuit-over-health-care-law/1146132 Florida's lawsuit over health care law swells to 26 states - Tampa Bay Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/30/healthplan_n_725503.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Emily | last=Swanson | title=Health Care Plan: Favor / Oppose | date=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html RealClearPolitics - Election Other - Obama and Democrats' Health Care Plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, in a 5–4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court found the law to be constitutional.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-upheld&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html|title=Supreme Court Lets Health Law Largely Stand, in Victory for Obama|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=June 28, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:U.S. Uninsured and Uninsured Rate (1987 to 2008).JPG|thumb|right|400px|Uninsured Americans, with the numbers shown here from 1987 to 2008, are a major driver for reform efforts]]

=== Expanding Medicaid and subsidizing insurance ===

The law includes health-related provisions that take effect over several years, including expanding [[Medicaid]] eligibility for people making up to 133% of the [[federal poverty level]] (FPL),&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_ref1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/03/25/health.care.law.basics/index.html|title=5 key things to remember about health care reform|publisher=CNN|date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of 4 in 2010) so their maximum &quot;out-of-pocket&quot; payment for annual premiums will be on [[Sliding scale fees|sliding scale]] from 2% to 9.5% of income,&lt;ref name=&quot;hip-dhhs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcare.gov/law/resources/reports/premiums01282011a.pdf|title=Health Insurance Premiums (DHHS)|publisher=[[DHHS]], see history at http://www.samhsa.gov/Financing/post/Health-Insurance-Premiums-Past-High-Costs-Will-Become-the-Present-and-Future-Without-Health-Reform.aspx|date=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;private_pp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bingaman.senate.gov/policy/crs_privhins.pdf|title=Private Health Insurance Provisions in PPACA (P.L. 111-148)|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|date=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hipc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrsa.dshs.wa.gov/MedicaidHealthCareReform/CRS/HealthInsurancePremiumCredits.pdf|title=Health Insurance Premium Credits Under PPACA|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/health-care-meeting/proposal/whatsnew/affordability|title=Policies to Improve Affordability and Accountability|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0320/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-gets-subsidized-insurance|title=Health Care Reform Bill 101|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing [[health insurance exchange]]s, prohibiting insurers from establishing annual coverage caps, and support for medical research.

=== Guaranteed issue, community rating, individual mandate ===
Starting in 2014,{{update after|2014}} the law will prohibit insurers from denying coverage (see [[guaranteed issue]]) to sicker applicants, or imposing special conditions such as higher premiums or payments (see [[community rating]]). Health care expenditures are highly concentrated with the most expensive 5% of the population accounting for half of aggregate health care spending, whereas the bottom 50% of spenders account for only 3%, which means that insurers' gains to be had from avoiding the sick greatly outweigh any possible gains from managing their care.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi_10.1056/NEJMp0904729&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMp0904729}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, insurers devoted resources to such avoidance at a direct cost to effective care management which is against the interests of the insured.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi_10.1056/NEJMp0904729&quot; /&gt; Instead of providing health security, the health insurance industry had, since the 1970s begun to compete by becoming risk differentiators, seeking to insure only those with good or normal health profiles and excluding those considered to be or likely to become unhealthy and therefore less profitable. According to a study from [[Cambridge Hospital]], [[Harvard Law School]] and [[Ohio University]], 62% of all 2007 personal [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcies in the United States]] &quot;were driven by medical incidents, with [75% having had] health insurance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Himmelstein DU, Thorne D, Warren E, Woolhandler S

&lt;/ref&gt;

Also starting in 2014,{{update after|2014}} the law will generally require uninsured individuals to buy government-approved health insurance — the [[Health insurance mandate|individual mandate]]. Government-run exchanges may present information to facilitate comparison among competing plans, if available, but previous attempts at creating similar exchanges &quot;produced only mixed results.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/Files/Publications/Fund%20Report/2010/Jul/1426_Jost_hlt_insurance_exchanges_ACA.pdf Health Insurance Exchanges And The Affordable Care Act: Key Policy Issues ''The Commonwealth Fund'']&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is expected to reduce the number of the uninsured from 19% of all residents in 2010 to 8% by 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBORec&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/113xx/doc11355/hr4872.pdf CBO reconciliation bill adjustments]&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts believe that the 8% figure of uninsured are expected to be mostly illegal immigrants (5%), with the rest paying the fine unless exempted.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBORec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Trumbull, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0323/Obama-signs-health-care-bill-Who-won-t-be-covered &quot;Obama signs health care bill: Who won't be covered?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this is true remains unclear based on presently available data.

Some analysts have argued that the insurance premium structure may shift more costs onto younger and healthier people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/22/AR2009112201237.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Robert J. | last=Samuelson | title=Robert J.

=== Efficacy of health insurance ===

The 2010 Acts require insurers to cover more costs, requiring that at least 80% of premiums must be spent on medical care or &quot;quality improvement&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/medical_loss_ratio.html Medical Loss Ratio: Getting Your Money's Worth on Health Insurance | HealthCare.gov&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[loss ratio]]) and requiring full coverage for screenings and immunizations, and by prohibiting lifetime and annual caps. Some insurance schemes had been considered inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/ConsumerNews/elisabeth-leamy-inadequate-health-insurance-deals/story?id=9722179&amp;page=1 ABC news report on inadequate health benefit plans]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that expanding insurance coverage may lead to better health, while other studies claim the opposite. A 2009 Harvard study published in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'' found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States associated with lack of insurance.&lt;ref name=&quot;pnhp.org&quot;&gt;[http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf American Journal of Public Health | December 2009, Vol 99, No.12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/excess-deaths-state-by-state.pdf State-by-state breakout of excess deaths from lack of insurance]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies found less correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7979836 | volume=154 | issue=21 | title=Mortality in the uninsured compared with that in persons with public and private health insurance | year=1994 | month=November | author=Sorlie PD, Johnson NJ, Backlund E, Bradham DD | journal=Arch.

Some opponents to the Act have claimed that &quot;80,000 people a year are killed just by &quot;nosocomial infections&quot;—infections that arise as a result of medical treatment.&quot; These claims however are tenuous at best since the incidence of nosocomical infections is not causally linked to expanded insurance coverage, especially when preventative measures are a key component of the new proposed regime, includiing numerous measures aimed to reduce the rate of hospitalization and re-hospitalization and improve primary prevention efforts in the outpatient setting. Opponents to the Act also point to a randomized study of almost 4,000 subjects done by Rand and concluded in 1982, which purportedly found that increasing the generosity of people's health insurance caused them to use more health care, but made almost no difference in their health status.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic.com&quot;/&gt; The actual summary of the Rand study by Rand itself is quite different: &quot;The poorest and sickest 6 percent of the sample at the start of the experiment had better outcomes under the free plan for 4 of the 30 conditions measured. Specifically, •Free care improved the control of hypertension. The poorest patients in the free care group who entered the experiment with hypertension saw greater reductions in blood pressure than did their counterparts with cost sharing. The projected effect was about a 10 percent reduction in mortality for those with hypertension. •Free care marginally improved vision for the poorest patients. •Free care also increased the likelihood among the poorest patients of receiving needed dental care.•Serious symptoms were less prevalent for poorer people on the free plan. •Cost sharing also had some beneficial effects. Participants in cost sharing plans worried less about their health and had fewer restricted-activity days (including time spent in seeking medical care).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/2006/RAND_RB9174.pdf &quot;The Health Insurance Experiment&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduce the deficit ===
[[File:CBO - Budget Impact of Affordable Care Act - March 2012.png|thumb|300px|right|CBO - Deficit reduction under the Affordable Care Act]]
Reducing the deficit was another driver in health care reform. The reform legislation that passed was estimated by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to reduce the deficit by $138&amp;nbsp;billion over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/index.html | work=The New York Times | first=Walecia | last=Konrad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurers and provide benefits over and above coverage in Medicare Parts A and B and receive funding from the Medicare fund for taking on Part A and B coverage. However, under a revised contract made during the previous Bush presidency, Medicare was overpaying the private insurers. [[MedPAC]] estimated the overpayment as being approximately $12&amp;nbsp;billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medpac.gov/chapters/Jun09_ExecutiveSummary.pdf 2009 MedPAC Report Executive Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the average person in traditional Medicare was paying $90 a year as a subsidy to private insurers for which they received zero benefit and eliminating this overpayment would save $177&amp;nbsp;billion over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthreform.gov/reports/seniors/index.html Health Care eform info for Seniors] HHS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions of the main parties==
{{POV-section|date=July 2012}}
The Democratic Party supports the amended 2010 legislation. The Act aims to ensure health insurance is available to all citizens; to make more employers responsible for their workers' health insurance; to extend subsidies to middle income persons who have no employer insurance; and extend Medicaid to more people than had been the case previously. The Act directs federal spending to community health centers and to computerize health care records to encourage accurate sharing of data between health providers and reduce errors. The Act taxes expensive insurance plans and adjusts the split of Medicare funding between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans. The Act reforms payment systems and Medicare, which may reduce the [[perverse incentive]] system that pays hospitals with poor recovery records more than hospitals with better recovery records. The Act increases Medicare prescription drug coverage. President Obama said he had heard from Americans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting insurance coverage; stories of patients being denied coverage, and of families ''with insurance'' who are just one illness away from financial ruin. He said that the Act would protect people from the worst practices of the insurance industry. He said it would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. He claimed that if they did nothing, millions of Americans would lose their health care and the deficit would grow. He said that premiums would increase and patients would be denied the care they need, and that small business owners would continue to drop coverage altogether. He said he would not walk away from those Americans, and he urged others in Congress not to do so either. He highlighted that the [[American Medical Association]] considers the Act an improvement over the status quo. He challenged anyone, from either party, with a better plan that would bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, to let him know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=9683034 ABC news video of the section of the State of the Union Address on health care.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]]'s official current position as represented by the House majority is that the Affordable Care Act should simply be repealed, leaving the law as it was previously. The House of Representatives voted for this in January 2011, though it is unlikely that the Senate would pass it and some expect that the President would veto any attempt at repeal. The Republicans' previous proposal for health care reform in 2009 would have placed people with pre-existing conditions who are unable to get affordable coverage into high risk insurance pools and would have continued the previous practice of allowing insurers to discriminate against them in terms of coverage and premiums. Republicans opposed the Affordable Care Act during passage. Not a single representative in the House or Senate voted in favor of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthreformvotes.org/ How members of Congress voted on health reform ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/03/the-health-care-vote-by-the-nu.html?hpid=topnews House vote] and [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/21/AR2009122100248.html Senate vote] had zero Republican support. ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; This opposition was broadly based on objections to rises in taxation, especially of the so-called &quot;Cadillac insurance plans&quot; and the corollary increase in government spending on affordability subsidies. The GOP also objected to a new Health Insurance Rate Authority that would determine whether rate increases were &quot;unreasonable&quot; and to enforced rebates or premium reductions, and to any proposal that might have allowed government funds to subsidize [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gop.gov/policy-news/10/02/22/latest-white-house-health-care Latest White House Health Care Proposal: The Same Big Government Takeover] ''GOP statement of objection.

One version of an original draft prepared in the House of Representatives did call for a &quot;[[public option]]&quot; (a public insurer as one extra choice for consumers, competing against private insurers). Some Republicans have contested the constitutionality of the individual [[health insurance mandate]] (a requirement to have medical insurance or else pay a fine). Both the government and the insurance industry have argued that this is a necessary prerequisite to achieve universality and equity for other insurance payers and to prevent people buying insurance only in time of need. The government argues that its constitutionality is covered under the [[Commerce Clause]], whereas detractors argue that this is wrong. {{As of|2010}}, this matter is still before the courts and so far{{when|date=January 2012}} three out of five federal court decisions have ruled in favor of it being constitutional and two against.{{update-small|date=July 2012}} [[Mitt Romney]] has said that the new law does not resemble the Massachusetts health care plan and did not support it.

A lot of the political debate centered on the prevention of the Federal funding of abortion with some groups claiming that abortion would become easier or would be financed by the government. In the legislation that was finally passed the existing law preserved the principle of no federal funding for abortion (except in cases of rape, incest, or to preserve the life of the mother).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/03/19/us/politics/20100319-health-care-reconciliation.html Prohibit use of federal money for abortions, except as allowed by current law] ''The New York Times'' March 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The law requires people to pay for that element of coverage with a separate check to create a specific fund which is not subsidized and which is used to fund these services. State insurance commissioners are charged with policing this &quot;segregation of funds&quot;. Whether insurers in the exchanges can offer abortion coverage at all was left as a matter for individual States to decide. The default is that insurers will be allowed to offer abortion coverage as they do now unless a State passes legislation to the contrary.

==Lobbying==
According to President Obama, America's health insurance industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to block the introduction of public medical insurance and stall other proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barackobama.com/2007/06/22/remarks_of_senator_barack_obam_17.php|title=Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Taking Our Government Back}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six registered health care lobbyists for every member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Salant, Jonathon and O'Leary, Lizzie.

[[America's Health Insurance Plans]], a lobby group funded by American private health insurance companies published its plans for health care reform in December 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHIP&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanhealthsolution.org/assets/Uploads/healthcarereformproposal.pdf Now is the Time for Health Care Reform: A Proposal to Achieve Universal Coverage, Affordability, Quality Improvement and Market Reform]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}, America's Health Insurance Plans, Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The key elements called for co-ordinated national strategy for health care with insurance regulation set in a national framework but enforced by the states.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHIP&quot;/&gt; It also called for a personal health care mandate requiring every American to have health insurance or face penalties. This, it said, was a necessary pre-requisite for guaranteed issue policies to prevent insurers from having to pre-screen applicants and set limits on coverage for pre-existing conditions, otherwise healthy people would put off buying insurance until they get sick.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHIP&quot;/&gt; It also called for the establishment of body to reform the payment system (including a shift from fee-for-service to fee-for-quality-outcomes), and a body to undertake [[Comparative effectiveness research]] because it admitted that the current system was not effective at providing value for money or even best practice and computerization and standardization of health care records and claims processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHIP&quot;/&gt; Most of the issues which AHIP called for in its plans have been implemented by the Obama administration and Congress in the reform process with the exception of a completely national framework for health care insurance regulation. Though the bill does place certain national rules for insurance to qualify as being &quot;coverage&quot; acceptable within the meaning of the individual mandate, states have retained the power under the reforms to regulate the industry and this was not put in a national framework.

==Possible future reforms==
The Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act 2010 contained provisions which allows the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) to undertake pilot projects which, if they are successful could be implemented in future.

===Single-payer health care===

The single-payer proposal pending{{when|date=January 2012}} in Congress is called the [[United States National Health Care Act]] (H.R. 676, formerly the &quot;Medicare for All Act.&quot;) The [[Congressional Budget Office]] and related government agencies scored the cost of a universal health care system several times since 1991, and have uniformly predicted cost savings,&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for a National Health Program (January, 2008) [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single_payer_system_cost.php?page=all &quot;Single Payer System Cost?&quot;] ''pnhp.org''&lt;/ref&gt; probably because of the 40% cost savings associated with universal preventative care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hogg W.

===Balancing doctor supply and demand===
The [[Medicare (United States)#Graduate Medical Education|Medicare Graduate Medical Education]] program regulates the supply of [[medical doctor]]s in the U.S. By adjusting the reimbursement rates to establish more [[Economic inequality|income equality]] among the medical professions, the effective cost of medical care can be lowered.

===Bundled payments===
A key project is one that could radically change the way the medical profession is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as [[fee-for-service]] because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which generates more income) which may not be in the patients' best long term interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking, or follow-ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost. The current fee-for-service system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service. Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} have noted that the best hospitals have fewer re-admission rates than others, which benefits patients, but some of the worst hospitals have high re-admission rates which is bad for patients but is perversely rewarded under the fee-for-service system.

Projects at CMS are examining the possibility of rewarding health care providers through a process known as &quot;[[bundled payment]]s&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfma.org/Templates/InteriorMaster.aspx?id=22682 The Medicare Bundled Payment Pilot Program: Participation Considerations]&lt;/ref&gt; by which local doctors and hospitals in an area would be paid not on a fee for service basis but on a capitation system linked to outcomes. The areas with the best outcomes would get more. This system, it is argued, makes medical practitioners much more concerned to focus on activities that deliver real health benefits at a lower cost to the system by removing the perversities inherent in the fee-for-service system.

Though aimed as a model for health care funded by CMS, if the project is successful it is thought that the model could be followed by the commercial health insurance industry also.

==2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act details==
{{Main|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010}}

Key provisions of the health-care legislation passed in March 2010 are:&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;/&gt;

===Within one year of enactment (2010–2011)===
*Insurance companies barred from dropping people from coverage when they get sick, ending the practice of [[rescission]]. Lifetime coverage limits eliminated and annual limits restricted.
*Young adults able to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26. Many health plans previously dropped dependents from coverage when they turned 19 or finished college.
*Uninsured adults with pre-existing conditions will be able to obtain health coverage through a new program for high risk pools that will expire once new insurance exchanges begin operating in 2014.
*Insurance companies cannot deny group or ''new (non-[[grandfather clause|grandfathered]])'' individual coverage to children under age 19 due to a pre-existing condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;FR 28 June 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=June 28, 2010 |title=Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Requirements for Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Relating to Preexisting Condition Exclusions, Lifetime and Annual Limits, Rescissions, and Patient Protections; Final Rule and Proposed Rule |journal=[[Federal Register]] |volume=75 |issue=123 |pages=37187–37241 |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/2010-15278.htm |accessdate=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A temporary reinsurance program is created to help companies maintain health coverage for early retirees between the ages of 55 and 64. This also expires in 2014.
*[[Medicare Part D|Medicare drug plan]] beneficiaries who fall into the [[Medicare Part D coverage gap]] (the so-called &quot;doughnut hole&quot;) will get a $250 rebate. The new law eventually closes that gap completely. (The old law required the sick person to pay 100% of their own annual medicine costs after $2,700 was spent in the coverage year and did not start again until after $6,154 was spent).
*A tax credit becomes available for some small businesses to help provide coverage for workers.
*A 10% tax on indoor tanning services that use [[ultraviolet light|ultraviolet]] lamps goes into effect on July 1.

===Effective during 2011===
{{update after|2012}}
*Medicare provides 10% bonus payments to primary care physicians and general surgeons.
*Medicare will cover the full cost of [http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/pdf/07-14-10_prevention_seniors_fact_sheet.pdf annual wellness visits]{{dead link|date=January 2012}} and personalized prevention plan services for beneficiaries. New health plans will be required to cover preventive services with little or no direct cost to patients.
*A new program under the Medicaid plan for the poor goes into effect in October that allows states to offer home and community based care for the disabled that might otherwise require institutional care.
*Payments to insurers offering [[Medicare Advantage]] services are frozen at 2010 levels. These payments are to be gradually reduced to bring them more in line with traditional Medicare.
*Employers are required to disclose the value of health benefits on employees' W-2 tax forms.
*An annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical companies according to market share. The fee does not apply to companies with sales of $5&amp;nbsp;million or less.

===Effective as of 2012===
{{update after|2013}}
*Physician payment reforms are implemented in Medicare to enhance primary care services and encourage doctors to form &quot;[[accountable care organization]]s&quot; to improve quality and efficiency of care.
*An incentive program is established in Medicare for acute care hospitals to improve quality outcomes.
*The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the government programs, begins tracking hospital readmission rates and puts in place financial incentives to reduce preventable readmissions.
*New tax reporting changes were to come in effect to prevent tax evasion by corporations and individuals. However, in April 2011 President Barack Obama signed a bill repealing this provision, because it was burdensome to small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/04/14/repealing-1099-reporting-requirement-big-win-small-business|title=Repealing the 1099 Reporting Requirement: A Big Win for Small Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;repeal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-14/obama-signs-law-repealing-business-tax-reporting-mandate-1-.html|title=Obama Signs Law Repealing Business Tax Reporting Mandate | work=Bloomberg | first=Richard|last=Rubin|date=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the existing law, businesses have to notify the IRS on 1099 form of certain payments to individuals for certain services or property over a reporting threshold of $600.&lt;ref name=irs1099&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1099msc.pdf|title=Instructions for Form 1099-MISC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Government Printing Office&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/html/PLAW-111publ148.htm|title=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement was going to be changed so that payments to corporations and individuals must also be reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppbmag.com/Article.aspx?id=5436|title=Healthcare Law Includes Tax Credit, Form 1099 Requirement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapchannel.com/accounts-payable/node/522|title=Health Care Bill Brings Major 1099 Changes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was expected to raise $17&amp;nbsp;billion over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingweb.com/topic/tax/costly-changes-1099-reporting-health-care-bill|title=Costly changes to 1099 reporting in health care law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments made by Section 9006 of the Act were originally intended to apply to payments made by businesses after December 31, 2011, but will no longer apply because of the repeal of the section.&lt;ref name=&quot;repeal&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Government Printing Office&quot;/&gt;
