      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18785">'''Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey''' looks at the [[human rights]] of [[Kurds in Turkey]].

== Issues ==
=== Education ===

In Turkey, the only language of instruction in the [[education in Turkey|education system]] is [[Turkish language|Turkish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ETPR&quot;&gt;{{cite web 
 | title =  Turkey 2006 Progress Report

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kurdish population of Turkey has long sought to have [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] included as a language of instruction in public schools as well as a subject. Several attempts at opening Kurdish instruction centers were stopped on technical grounds, such as wrong dimensions of doors. An experiment at running Kurdish-language schools was wound up in 2004 because of an apparent lack of interest.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurdish is permitted as a subject in universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=163330

=== Multiculturalism, Assimilation ===

Due to the large number of Turkish Kurds, successive governments have viewed the expression of a Kurdish identity as a potential threat to Turkish unity, a feeling that has been compounded since the armed rebellion initiated by the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] in 1984. One of the main accusations of cultural assimilation relates to the state's historic suppression of the Kurdish language. Kurdish publications created throughout the 1960s and 1970s were shut down under various legal pretexts.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Chapin Metz, ed. [http://countrystudies.us/turkey/28.htm Kurds], ''Turkey: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the military coup of 1980, the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in government institutions.&lt;ref name=NYTK&gt;Toumani, Meline. [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17turkey-t.html?ex=1361854800&amp;en=df64cf85326e2103&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Minority Rules], ''[[New York Times]]'', 17 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

US Congressman [[Bob Filner]] spoke of a &quot;[[cultural genocide]]&quot;, stressing that &quot;a way of life known as Kurdish is disappearing at an alarming rate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kurdish Question in U.S. Foreign Policy: A Documentary Sourcebook |first=Lokman I|last=Meho |year=2004|publisher=Praeger/Greenwood|isbn=0-313-31435-7|chapter=Congressional Record|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BD7imPDFto0C&amp;dq=The+Kurdish+Question+in+U.S.+Foreign+Policy:+A+Documentary+Sourcebook&amp;pg=PP1 | page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Levene suggests that the genocidal practices were not limited to cultural genocide, and that the events of the late 19th century continued until 1990.&lt;ref name=Levene /&gt;

Certain academics have claimed that successive Turkish governments adopted a sustained [[genocide]] program against Kurds, aimed at their [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]].&lt;ref name=Skutnabb-kangas2008&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genocide hypothesis remains, however, a minority view among historians, and is not endorsed by any nation or major organisation. [[Desmond Fernandes]], a Senior Lecturer at [[De Montfort University]], breaks the policy of the Turkish authorities into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gomidas.org/forum/af4kurds.htm Kurdish and Armenian Genocides Focus of London Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Forced assimilation program, which involved, among other things, a ban of the [[Kurdish language]], and the forced relocation of Kurds to non-Kurdish areas of Turkey.
# The banning of any organizations opposed to category one.
# The violent repression of any Kurdish resistance.

=== Cultural expression ===
Between 1983 and 1991, it was forbidden to publicize, publish and/or broadcast in any language other than [[Turkish language|Turkish]], unless that language was the first official language of a country that Turkey has diplomatic relations with.&lt;ref name=paris&gt;[http://www.institutkurde.org/en/language/ Institut Kurde de Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; Though this ban technically applied to any language, it had the largest effect on the [[Kurdish language]], which is not the first official language of any country, despite being widely spoken in the [[Kurdistan]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Article 2932&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Evrensel|url=http://www.evrensel.net/03/04/15/kose.html |title=Kürtçe yabancı dil mi?|language=Turkish|accessdate=2007-07-08|date=2003-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, Turkey's public television TRT began broadcasting a half-hour Kurdish program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kurdish broadcast ends Turkish TV taboo |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200406/s1128444.htm |work= ABC News Online|id= |date=2004-06-10|accessdate=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 8, 2006, the Radio and Television Supreme Council ([[RTÜK]]) allowed two TV channels (Gün TV and Söz TV) and one radio channel (Medya FM) to have limited service in the Kurdish language. This legislation came into force as an effort to meet one of the [[European Union]]’s requirements for membership in its talks with Turkey. The new regulation will allot five hours of weekly radio broadcast and four of television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[NTV-MSNBC]]|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/news/362107.asp|date=2006-02-21|accessdate=2007-09-12 |language= Turkish|quote=English summary: [http://www.tusiad.us/specific_page.cfm?CONTENT_ID=584 Private Channels to Broadcast in Kurdish in March]|title=Yerel kanallarda Kürtçe Mart’ta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these reforms, use of Kurdish in the public sphere and government institutions is still severely restricted. On June 14, 2007, the Interior Ministry took a decision to remove [[Abdullah Demirbaş]] from his office as elected mayor of the Sur district of [[Diyarbakir]]. They also removed elected members of the municipal council. The high court endorsed the decision of the ministry and ruled that &quot;giving information on various municipal services such as culture, art, environment, city cleaning and health in languages other than Turkish is against the Constitution.&lt;ref name=lagendijk&gt;{{cite news |first=Joost |last= Lagendijk|authorlink= Joost Lagendijk|title= Kurdish: A different language|url= http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=115171&amp;bolum=109 |work=[[Today's Zaman]]|date= 2007-06-28|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is despite the fact that according to the above-mentioned municipality, 72% of the people of the district use [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in their daily lives. In another case, the mayor of Diyarbakır, [[Osman Baydemir]], is being subjected to a similar set of interrogations and judicial processes. His case is related to the use of the Kurdish phrase ''Sersala We Pîroz Be'' (Happy New Year) in the new year celebration cards issued by the municipality.  The prosecutor wrote: &quot;It was determined that the suspect used a Kurdish sentence in the celebration card, ‘Sersala We Piroz Be’ (Happy New Year). I, on behalf of the public, demand that he be punished under Article 222/1 of the Turkish Penal Code&quot;.&lt;ref name=lagendijk/&gt;

=== Political representation ===

The [[Turkish Constitution]] bans the formation of political parties on an ethnic basis. Several Kurdish political parties have been shut down by the [[Turkish Constitutional Court]] under excuse of supporting the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]], which is listed as a terrorist organization by [[NATO]] members like Turkey, USA, the European Union

== History ==
{{further2|[[Kurdish rebellions]]}}

=== Ottoman era ===
Following the [[Young Turk Revolution]] at the beginning of this century and the flowering of Turkish nationalism, the destruction or assimilation of minority populations (particularly [[Armenians]] and Kurds) has been a recurring pattern.&lt;ref name=Levene&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1093/hgs/12.3.393
 | quote = The persistence of genocide or near-genocidal incidents from the 1890s through the 1990s, committed by Ottoman and successor Turkish and Iraqi states against Armenian, Kurdish, Assyrian, and Pontic Greek communities in Eastern Anatolia, is striking. ... the creation of this &quot;zone of genocide&quot; in Eastern Anatolia cannot be understood in isolation, but only in light of the role played by the Great Powers in the emergence of a Western-led international system.&lt;br /&gt; In the last hundred years, four Eastern Anatolian groups—Armenians, Kurds, Assyrians, and Greeks—have fallen victim to state-sponsored attempts by the Ottoman authorities or their Turkish or Iraqi successors to eradicate them. Because of space limitations, I have concentrated here on the genocidal sequence affecting Armenians and Kurds only, though my approach would also be pertinent to the Pontic Greek and Assyrian cases.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PKK era ===

During the 1980s and 1990s, Turkey displaced a large number of its citizens in southeastern Anatolia from rural areas, allegedly to protect them from guerrilla violence of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK),{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that is considered a terrorist organization by the [[United States of America|US]] and the European Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;USTerrorList&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/2002/12535.htm |title=Foreign Terrorist Organizations List |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date={{Date|2002-10-23}} |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080215104313/http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/2002/12535.htm |archivedate={{Date|2008-02-15}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4690181.stm |title=PKK 'behind' Turkey resort bomb|date=2008-06-29 |work=[[BBC News]] |date={{Date|2005-07-17}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkey has claimed that the actions of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] (TAF) included burning of 'deserted' villages in order for the PKK not to use them as outposts or hiding places.

Clashes between Turkish and PKK militants have resulted in some 30,000 casualties according a report by the US Department of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nps.edu/Library/Research/SubjectGuides/SpecialTopics/TerroristProfile/Current/PKK.html |title = Terrorist Group Profiles |publisher = [[United States Department of State]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selected incidents ==
&lt;!-- we need to develop a criterion for deciding what gets listed here --&gt;

=== Leyla Zana ===

In 1994 [[Leyla Zana]]&amp;mdash;who, three years prior, had been the first [[Kurdish woman]] elected to the Turkish parliament&amp;mdash;was sentenced to 15 years for &quot;separatist speech&quot;. At her inauguration as an MP, she reportedly identified herself as a Kurd. She took the oath of loyalty in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as required by law, then added in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], &quot;I have completed this formality under duress. I shall struggle so that the Kurdish and Turkish peoples may live together in a democratic framework.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament erupted with shouts of &quot;Separatist&quot;, &quot;Terrorist&quot;, and &quot;Arrest her&quot;.

In April 2008, she was sentenced to two years in prison for allegedly &quot;spreading terrorist propaganda&quot; by saying in a speech, &quot;Kurds have three leaders, namely [[Massoud Barzani]], [[Celal Talabani]] and [[Abdullah Ocalan]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/198103,kurdish-politiican-zana-sentenced-to-prison-in-turkey.html Kurdish politiican Zana sentenced to prison in Turkey], ''Middle East World''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Akin Birdal ===
In 2000, the chairman of the [[Turkish Human Rights Association]] Akin Birdal was imprisoned under Article 312 for a speech in which he called for &quot;peace and understanding&quot; between Kurds and Turks. He was forced to resign from his post, as the Law on Associations forbids persons who breach this and several other laws from serving as association officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2000/03/27/turkey-government-sends-human-rights-leader-back-prison

=== Diyarbakır detentions (2006) ===

Violent disturbances took place in several cities in the southeast in March and April 2006. Over 550 people were detained as a result of these events, including over 200 children. The [[Diyarbakır]] Bar Association submitted more than 70 complaints of ill-treatment to the authorities. Investigations were launched into 39 of these claims. During the events in Diyarbakır, forensic examinations of detained were carried out in places of detention. According to the Report of the Commission, &quot;this contravenes the rules and the circulars issued by the Ministries of Justice and Health as well as the independence of the medical profession&quot;. The Commission also believes that &quot;the new provisions introduced in June 2006 to amend the anti-terror law could undermine the fight against torture and ill-treatment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETPR&quot; /&gt; The Commission also stresses that &quot;a return to normality in Southeast can only be achieved be opening dialogue with local counterparts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETPR&quot; /&gt; &quot;A comprehensive strategy should be pursued to achieve the socio-economic development of the region and the establishment of conditions for the Kurdish population to enjoy full rights and freedoms. Issues that need to be addressed include the return of internally displaced persons, compensation for losses incurred by victims of terrorism, [[landmine]]s as well as the issue of village guards&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETPR&quot; /&gt;

==Status quo==

In 2009, the state-run broadcaster, [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]], launched a channel (TRT 6) in the Kurdish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=161690

''Comparative Education, Terrorism and Human Security''. 2003, page 167.&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen when [[Leyla Zana]] spoke Kurdish in her inauguration as an MP she was arrested in 1994 and charged with treason and membership in the armed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
