'''Harry's Place''' is a British political blog. It has been nominated for a number of awards, including a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' award for [[political blog]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/redbox/page/0,9030,1135418,00.html The Guardian political blog awards]&lt;/ref&gt; the 2005 Weblog awards for UK blogs,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogawards.org/2005/12/best_uk_blog.php Weblog awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
''Harry's Place'' was supportive of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the concept of [[liberal interventionism]], and liberal dissident movements in the [[Islamic world]]. It is a supporter of a [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. It is opposed to [[Islamism]] and of what it characterises as totalitarian, pro-Islamist and antisemitic tendencies. Figures it associates with these tendencies are often strongly criticised, including [[Raed Salah]] (whom it calls &quot;a racist, an extremist and a funder of Hamas&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Lips, ''Friends of Raed Salah: Is the Guardian a Newspaper?'', 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Gilad Atzmon]] (&quot;an outspoken antisemite who promotes Holocaust denial&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alan A, ''Gilad Atzmon: Honorary Raelian Priest'', 7 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] (&quot;a hate preacher who admires Hitler and who hopes one day to be able to complete his work&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Lips, ''Qaradawi: Now Banned From France'', 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the context of [[UK]] politics, the site is particularly critical of [[Ken Livingstone]], [[George Galloway]], the [[British National Party]], [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|RESPECT]], the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]], and the [[Stop the War Coalition]]. It defines itself as a staunch opponent of religious and political censorship of all kinds and was supportive of the 2006 London March for Free Expression. The site was also one of the main backers of the [[Euston Manifesto]].  [[Nick Cohen]] has argued that ''Harry's Place'' was one of only few places where it was being noted that &quot;a section of the left is allied with religious fanaticism and, for the first time since the Hitler-Stalin pact, [&amp;hellip;] has gone soft on fascism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Cohen, &quot;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200406070018 Saddam's very own party]&quot;, ''[[New Statesman]]'', 7 June 2004, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Harry Hatchet&quot; has had several guest columns in ''The Guardian's'' technology and online commentary sections.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hatchet, [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/egovernment/story/0,,998616,00.html &quot;A Blogger Writes&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 15 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/harry_hatchet Comment is Free]&lt;/ref&gt; However Guardian editorial policies are commonly criticised by Harry's Place contributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2006/03/29/bunting_cant.php Bunting cant. (29 March 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributors==
Harry's Place was originally started by a blogger, using the nom de plumes Harry Steele and Harry Hatchet or just Harry, who was originally the sole writer. The [[11 September 2001 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center]] served as a &quot;wake up call&quot; according to Harry, prompting him to try to better understand what political forces led up to it. In 2002, he began blogging as a way to clarify his own thoughts on political issues such as the impending war in Iraq, moving away from his Communism to embrace a more moderate [[social-democratic]] worldview. He made a public break with his former views in a [[Workers' Liberty]] [[message board]] discussion in October 2002, where he said [[Stalinism]] was a viewpoint &quot;I now reject totally&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workersliberty.org/node/110 &quot;Workers' Liberty discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid growth in the site's audience led him to include other like-minded writers so that the blog could be updated more regularly. Harry ceased to contribute regularly at the end of September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1582745,00.html Media Matters], ''[[The Observer]]'', 2 October 2005, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other contributors include Marcus, Gene Zitver (aka &quot;Gene&quot;), David Toube, and more recently, Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, Adam LeBor, Brett Lock, Brian Meredith, Edmund Standing, Hasan Afzal, Michael Ezra, 'Lucy Lips' and others. Marcus attended the [[15 February 2003 anti-war protest#London|15 February]], 2003 [[anti-war]] protest in London, and came away with the opinion that &quot;I don't know if I can consider myself left-wing anymore if this is the left&quot;. Marcus wrote about his views on the politics behind the 15 February demonstration, and soon became a regular contributor.  Gene is a resident of the United States from a trade union background, who has spent several years living in Israel. Harry came across Gene's posts on a [[George Orwell]] discussion list, and invited him to start posting on his blog.  Gene is a strong opponent of President [[Hugo Chavez]] of Venezuela, whom he accuses of being [[authoritarian]]. Some Harry's Place writers post under pseudonyms: the pseudonyms used include Lucy Lips, habibi, Libby T, Israelinurse, and Alan A.

David Toube is a lawyer and former lecturer. He also came to blogging after the 11 September attacks. One of his close childhood friends was among those killed in the [[World Trade Center]], while another close childhood friend became a militant Islamist, and appeared in the media applauding the attacks. Toube claims that he took up reading and writing blogs as a way of trying to making sense of these events.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Burkeman, &quot;The new commentariat&quot;, ''The Guardian'', 17 November 2005, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Johann Hari]] also contributed articles to the weblog until Autumn 2004, when he left to start his own blog.

==Controversy==
The comments pages on Harry's Place are an open forum where debates can frequently become heated. 

''Harry's Place'' has been accused of [[Islamophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bob Pitt, Harry's Place and Islamophobia Watch, ''Islamophobia Watch'', 24 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The site's contributors reply that they are criticizing what they see as a [[reactionary]] interpretation of Islam, not Muslims in general, and that they are expressing solidarity with Muslims who are oppressed by Islamists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2005/01/19/on_islamophobia.php On Islamophobia (19 January 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2005/03/23/islamophobia_watch.php Islamophobia Watch (23 March 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The blog is frequently critical of prominent [[anti-Zionist]] activists such as [[Gilad Atzmon]], [[Keith Burstein]] and [[Alexei Sayle]] and in particular academics who criticise Israel such as [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Schlomo Sand]].

In July 2008 Harry's Place posted on an [[Al Jazeera]] report, translated by one of its contributors, in which the director of the British Muslim Initiative, Mohamed Sawalha, appeared to speak of the &quot;evil Jew&quot;.  Al Jazeera subsequently changed the phrase to &quot;Jewish Lobby&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The British Muslim Initiative claimed that the translation of the original phrase was &quot;malevolent&quot; and implied that their President, Mohammed Sawalha was &quot;anti-semitic and hateful&quot;. Mohamed Sawalha had been identified by the [[BBC]] in 2006 as a senior Hamas activist.

On 26 August 2008, Harry's Place was briefly offline following a complaint to its [[Domain Name System|DNS]] provider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jennadelich.blogspot.com/2008/08/dont-panic-if-harrys-place-disappears.html Don't panic if Harry's Place disappears briefly] Explanations on back-up blog.&lt;/ref&gt; The site had reported that a member of the University and College Union's discussion list had posted links to American white nationalist [[David Duke]]'s website to support the call for a boycott on Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1219572143539&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurryupharry.org/2008/08/27/going-nowhere Going Nowhere]&lt;/ref&gt;
