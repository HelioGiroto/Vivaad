==History==
{{Main|History of Chicago}}

{{See also|Origin of the name &quot;Windy City&quot;}}
During the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by a Native American tribe known as the [[Potawatomi people|Potawatomi]], who had taken the place of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]] and [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sauk and Fox]] peoples. The 1780s saw the arrival of the first known non-indigenous permanent settler in Chicago, [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]], who is believed to be of African and European (French) descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swenson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=John W|title=Jean Baptiste Point de Sable—The Founder of Modern Chicago|url=http://www.earlychicago.com/essays.php?essay=7|work=Early Chicago|publisher=Early Chicago, Inc.|accessdate=August 8, 2010|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795, following the [[Northwest Indian War]], an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over to the United States for a military post by native tribes in concordance with the [[Treaty of Greenville]].

In 1803, the [[United States Army]] built [[Fort Dearborn]], which was destroyed in the [[War of 1812]], [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]]. The [[Odawa people|Ottawa]], [[Ojibwe]], and Potawatomi tribes had ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 [[Treaty of St.&amp;nbsp;Louis]]. The Potawatomi were eventually forcibly removed from their land following the [[Treaty of Chicago]] in 1833. On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of around 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Timeline: Early Chicago History| url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/timeline/index.html| archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5h38n983V| work=Chicago: City of the Century | publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation And Window to the World Communications, Inc.| archivedate= May 26, 2009| year= 2003| accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within seven years it would grow to a population of over 4,000. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales commenced with [[Edmund Dick Taylor]] as U.S. receiver of public moneys.  The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-03-04/news/0303040230_1_first-inaugural-address-iran-contra-affair-comic-actor-john-candy|title=On March 4, 1837, the city of Chicago was incorporated and...|publisher=Copyright © 2011 Tribune Company|date=2003-03-04|accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Chicago&quot; is derived from a French rendering of the Native American word ''shikaakwa'', translated as &quot;wild onion&quot; or &quot;wild garlic&quot;, from the [[Miami-Illinois language]].&lt;ref&gt;For a historical account of interest, see the section entitled &quot;Origin of the word Chicago&quot; in Andreas, Alfred Theodore, ''History of Chicago,'' A.&amp;nbsp;T.&amp;nbsp;Andreas, Chicago (1884) pp 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Swenson, John F.  | title = Chicagoua/Chicago: The origin, meaning, and etymology of a place name | journal=Illinois Historical Journal | volume = 84 | issue = 4   | date = Winter 1991 | pages = 235–248   | issn = 0748-8149 | oclc = 25174749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://linguistlist.org/issues/12/12-3157.html|title= &quot;Chicago&quot; Etymology|author=McCafferty, Michael|date=December 21, 2001|publisher=The LINGUIST List |accessdate=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCafferty|first=Michael|date=Summer 2003|title=A Fresh Look at the Place Name Chicago|journal=Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society|volume=96|issue=2|publisher=Illinois State Historical Society|issn=1522-1067|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3945/is_200307/ai_n9266765/?tag=content;col1|accessdate=October 22, 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as &quot;Checagou&quot; was by [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert de LaSalle]] around 1679 in a memoir written about the time.&lt;ref&gt;Quaife, Milton M. ''Checagou'', (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]]., 1933).&lt;/ref&gt; The wild garlic plants, ''[[Allium tricoccum]]'', were described by LaSalle's comrade, naturalist-diarist [[Henri Joutel]], in his journal of LaSalle's last expedition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web| last = Swenson | first = John F.|title = Chicago: Meaning of the Name and Location of Pre-1800 European Settlements  | work=Early Chicago |  date = Winter 1991 | url = http://www.earlychicago.com/essays.php?essay=1 | accessdate =May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Zeldes | first = Leah A.| title = Ramping up: Chicago by any other name would smell as sweet  | work=Dining Chicago | publisher=Chicago's Restaurant &amp; Entertainment Guide, Inc.  | date = April 5, 2010 | url = http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/04/05/ramping-up-chicago-by-any-other-name-would-smell-as-sweet/ | accessdate =May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid growth and development===
[[File:Chicago - State St at Madison Ave, 1897.ogv|left|thumb|[[State Street (Chicago)|State]] and [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Streets]], the busiest corner in Chicago (1897)]]
As the site of the [[Chicago Portage]], the city emerged as an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]], opened in 1848, which also marked the opening of the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]. The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the [[Great Lakes]] to connect to the [[Mississippi River]]. A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] abroad. Manufacturing and retail sectors became dominant among Midwestern cities, influencing the American economy, particularly in meatpacking, with the advent of the [[refrigerator car|refrigerated rail car]] and the regional centrality of the city's [[Union Stock Yards]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Elizabeth and Rodolfo Estrada. (1994) [http://www.oznet.ksu.edu/meatscience/column/industry.htm/ &quot;Development of the U.S. Meat Industry&quot;]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} – Kansas State University Department of Animal Sciences and Industry.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator [[Stephen Douglas]], the champion of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] and &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; approach to the issue of the spread of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Douglas|url=http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/spcl/excat/douglas5.html|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, [[Abraham Lincoln]], to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for the nation's presidency at the [[1860 Republican National Convention]] and went on to defeat Douglas in the general election, setting the stage for the [[American Civil War]].

To accommodate [[Chicago#Demographics|rapid population growth]] and demand for better sanitation, the city implemented various infrastructural improvements. In February 1856, the Chesbrough plan for the building of the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system was approved by the Common Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonathanriley.net/chn.html#y1856_m02_d14 |title=Chicago Daily Tribune, Thursday Morning, February 14 |publisher=Jonathanriley.net |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project [[Raising of Chicago|raised much of central Chicago]] to a new grade. While raising Chicago, and at first improving the health of the city, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the [[Chicago River]], then into [[Lake Michigan]], polluting the primary source of fresh water for the city. The city responded by tunneling two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) out into Lake Michigan to newly built [[water crib]]s. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that it flowed away from Lake Michigan, rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] that connects to the [[Illinois River]], which flows into the [[Mississippi River]].
[[File:Chicago-fire1.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's rendering of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]]]]
In 1871, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] broke out, destroying an area of about 4 miles long and 1 mile wide, a large section of the city at the time. Much of the city, including railroads and [[Union Stock Yard|stockyards]], survived intact, and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone which would set the precedent for worldwide construction.&lt;ref&gt;Bruegmann, Robert (2004–2005). [http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/181.html Built Environment of the Chicago Region]. ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]] (online version)''.&lt;/ref&gt; During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's [[Home Insurance Building|first skyscraper]] in 1885, using [[steel frame|steel-skeleton]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Frederick E. (March 2003). &quot;[http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2003/1/2003_1_68.shtml Where They Went to See the Future]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&quot; ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''. Retrieved 7-29-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from [[Europe]] and migrants from the eastern states. Of the total population in 1900 not less than 77% were foreign-born, or born in the United States of foreign parentage. [[Germans]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Poles]], [[Swedes]] and [[Czechs]] made up nearly two-thirds of the foreign-born population (by 1900, whites were 98.1% of the city's population).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Chicago#Population Chicago]&quot;. 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Labor history of the United States|Labor conflicts]] followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the [[Haymarket affair]] on May 4, 1886. Concern for social problems among Chicago's immigrant poor led [[Jane Addams]] to co‑found [[Hull House]] in 1889. Programs developed there became a model for the new field of social work.

During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later state laws, that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera, small pox, and yellow fever were not only passed, but also enforced. These in turn became templates for public health reform in many other cities and states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Clinton |last=Sandvick |year=2009 |title=Enforcing Medical Licensing in Illinois: 1877–1890 |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |pmid=19562006 |pmc=2701151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city invested in many large, well-landscaped [[Chicago Park District|municipal parks]], which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate and driving force for improving public health in Chicago was [[John Henry Rauch|Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D.]], who established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866, created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with festering, shallow graves, and helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health in 1867 in response to an outbreak of cholera. Ten years later he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William K. |last=Beatty |year=1991 |title=John H. Rauch – Public Health, Parks and Politics |journal=Proceedings of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago |volume=44 |pages=97–118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center, a title it still holds. In 1883, the standardized system of North American [[Time Zones]] was adopted by the general time convention of railway managers in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=GmfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 Annual report of the Commissioner of Railroads made to the Secretary of the Interior for the year ending June 30, 1883],'' pp. 19–20. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the continent its uniform system for telling time.

In 1893, Chicago hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] on former marshland at the present location of [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. The Exposition drew 27.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;Rich History&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Chicago's Rich History| url=http://www.choosechicago.com/attendees/about_chicago/Pages/chicago_history.aspx| publisher=Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau| accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[University of Chicago]] was founded in 1892 on the same South Side location. The term &quot;midway&quot; for a fair or carnival referred originally to the [[Midway Plaisance]], a strip of park land that still runs through the University of Chicago campus and connects [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington]] and Jackson Parks.

===20th and 21st centuries===
The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States.  This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when the Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw [[American gangsters during the 1920s|gangsters]], including [[Al Capone]],Dion O’Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gang (crime) – History |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/225308/gang|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|year=2009|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago was the location of the famous (or infamous) St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1929 where Al Capone sent men to gun down members of his rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.
In 1924, Chicago was the first [[United States of America|American]] city to have a homosexual-rights organization, the [[Society for Human Rights]]. This organization produced the first American publication for gays, ''[[Friendship and Freedom]]''.

The 1920s also saw a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted blacks from the South. Between 1910 and 1930, the black population of Chicago dramatically increased from 44,103 to 233,903.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://bentley.umich.edu/research/publications/migration/ch1.php Detroit and the Great Migration, 1916–1929 by Elizabeth Anne Martin]&quot;. Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving in the hundreds of thousands during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the newcomers had an immense cultural impact. It was during this wave that Chicago became a center for [[jazz]], with [[Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver|King Oliver]] leading the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotjazz.com/bessie.html |title=Bessie Smith |accessdate=October 29, 2007 |publisher=The Red Hot Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Chicago Mayor [[Anton Cermak]] was fatally wounded in [[Miami, Florida]] during a [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots#Franklin D. Roosevelt|failed assassination]] attempt on President-elect [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In 1933 and 1934, the city celebrated its centennial by hosting the [[Century of Progress]] International Exposition [[Worlds Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm4/index_uic_cop.php?CISOROOT=/uic_cop |title=Century of Progress World's Fair, 1933–1934 (University of Illinois at Chicago) : Home |publisher=Collections.carli.illinois.edu |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago's founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/225.html |title=Century of Progress Exposition |publisher=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1942, physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] conducted the world's first controlled nuclear reaction at the [[University of Chicago]] as part of the top-secret [[Manhattan Project]]. This led to the creation of the atomic bomb by the United States, which it used in [[World War II]] in 1945.

Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was elected in 1955, in the era of [[political machine|machine politics]]. Starting in the early 1960s due to blockbusting, many white residents, as in most American cities, left the city for the suburbs. Whole neighborhoods were completely changed based on race. Structural changes in industry caused heavy losses of jobs for lower skilled workers. In 1966, [[James Bevel]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Albert Raby]] led the Chicago Open Housing Movement, which culminated in agreements between Mayor Richard J. Daley and the movement leaders. Two years later, the city hosted the tumultuous [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall, including full-scale [[riot]]s, or in some cases [[police riot]]s, in city streets. Major construction projects, including the Sears Tower (now known as the [[Willis Tower]], which in 1974 became the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|world's tallest building]]), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[McCormick Place]], and O'Hare International Airport, were undertaken during Richard J. Daley's tenure. In 1979, [[Jane Byrne]], the city's first female mayor, was elected. She popularized the city further as a [[filming location|movie location]] and [[Tourism in the United States|tourist]] destination.

In 1983, [[Harold Washington]] became the first black mayor of the city of Chicago. Washington's first term in office saw attention given to poor and previously neglected minority neighborhoods. He was re‑elected in 1987 but died of a heart attack a short time later. The balance of Washington's second term was served by 6th ward Alderman Eugene Sawyer. [[Richard M. Daley]], son of Richard J. Daley, was elected in 1989. His accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for [[sustainable development]]. After successfully standing for re-election five times, and becoming Chicago's longest serving mayor, Richard M. Daley announced he would step down at the end of his final term in 2011.

On February 23, 2011, former [[United States House of Representatives|Illinois Congressman]] and White House Chief of Staff, [[Rahm Emanuel]], won the municipal election to become mayor of Chicago, heavily beating five rivals with 55 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41715205/ns/politics-more_politics/ |title=News: Rahm Emanuel wins Chicago mayoral race |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel was sworn in as Mayor on May 16, 2011.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Chicago}}

===Topography===
[[File:Full chicago skyline.jpg|thumb|Downtown and the North Side with beaches lining the waterfront]]
Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of [[Lake Michigan]]. It is the principal city in [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]] situated in the [[Midwestern United States]] and the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]].  Chicago rests on a [[continental divide]] at the site of the [[Chicago Portage]], connecting the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] [[drainage basin|watersheds]]. The city lies beside huge freshwater Lake Michigan, and two rivers—the [[Chicago River]] in downtown and the [[Calumet River]] in the industrial far South Side—flow entirely or partially through Chicago. Chicago is a world port city as the [[St Lawrence Seaway]] connects Lake Michigan with the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], which runs to the west of the City, connects the Chicago River with the [[Mississippi River]], the fourth-longest river in the world. Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge [[lake freighter]]s use the city's [[Port of Chicago|Lake Calumet Harbor]] on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.

When Chicago was founded in 1833, most of the early building began around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html|title=Thompson's Plat of 1830|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2004|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall [[Land grading|grade]] of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is {{convert|579|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The lowest points are along the lake shore at {{convert|577|ft|abbr=on}}, while the highest point, at {{convert|735|ft|abbr=on}}, is a landfill located in the [[Hegewisch, Chicago|Hegewisch]] community area on the city's far south side.

[[File:20070909 Chicago Half Marathon.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chicago Half Marathon]] on [[Lake Shore Drive]] next to [[Harold Washington Park]] on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]]]]
The [[Chicago Loop]] is the central business district, but Chicago is also a city of [[Chicago#Neighborhoods|neighborhoods]]. [[Lake Shore Drive]] runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's lakefront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include [[Lincoln Park]], [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]] and [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]]. 29 public [[Chicago beaches|beaches]] are also found along the shore. Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for [[Navy Pier]], [[Northerly Island]], the [[Museum Campus Chicago|Museum Campus]], and large portions of the [[McCormick Place]] Convention Center. Most of the city's high-rise commercial and residential buildings can be found close to the waterfront.

An informal name for the entire [[Chicago metropolitan area]] is &quot;Chicagoland&quot;. There is no precise definition for the term &quot;Chicagoland&quot;, but it generally means the city and its suburbs combined together. The [[Chicago Tribune]], which coined the term, includes the city of Chicago, the rest of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], eight nearby Illinois counties: [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake]], [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry]], [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]], [[Grundy County, Illinois|Grundy]], [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] and [[Kankakee County, Illinois|Kankakee]], and three counties in [[Indiana]]: [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake]], [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter]] and [[LaPorte County, Indiana|LaPorte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/ |title=Chicago Tribune Classifieds map of Chicagoland |work=Chicago Tribune  |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County without the city of Chicago, and only Lake, DuPage, Kane and Will counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicagoland Region|url=http://www.enjoyillinois.com/topSpots/region.aspx?area=chicagoland|year=2009|work=EnjoyIllinois.com|publisher=Illinois Department of Tourism|accessdate=August 14, 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce]] defines it as all of Cook and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagolandchamber.org/sub/fast_facts.asp Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Chicago}}

The city lies within the [[humid continental climate]] zone, and experiences four distinct seasons. [[Summer]]s are hot and humid, with a July daily average of {{convert|84.7|°F|1}}. In a normal summer, temperatures exceed {{convert|90|°F|0|abbr=on}} on 21&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago monthly averages&quot;&gt;[http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/ORD:9 Monthly Averages for O'Hare International Airport]. The Weather Channel. Retrieved December 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winter]]s are cold, snowy, and windy, with some sunny days, and with a January average of {{convert|23.5|°F|1}}. Temperatures often (for 43&amp;nbsp;days on average) stay below freezing for an entire day, and lows below {{convert|0|°F|0|abbr=on}} occur on eight nights per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago monthly averages&quot;/&gt; [[Spring (season)|Spring]] and [[Autumn]] are mild seasons with low humidity.

According to the [[National Weather Service]], Chicago's highest official temperature reading of {{convert|107|F|abbr=on}} was recorded on June 1, 1934, and July 11, 1936, both at [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]]. The lowest temperature of {{convert|−27|°F|0}} was recorded on January 20, 1985,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago monthly averages&quot;/&gt; at O'Hare Airport. The city can experience extreme winter [[cold wave]]s and summer [[heat wave]]s that may last for several consecutive days. Severe weather is uncommon in the Chicago area, though there have been some exceptions such as the [[1967 Oak Lawn tornado outbreak|F4&amp;nbsp;tornado]] that devastated the south side of the city on April 21, 1967.

The destruction caused by the Great Chicago Fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation. In 1885, the first [[steel frame|steel-framed high-rise building]], the [[Home Insurance Building]], rose in the city as Chicago ushered in the [[Early skyscrapers|skyscraper era]], which would then be followed by many other cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/timeline/skyscraper1.html Chicago (2004)]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}. ''Chicago Public Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Chicago's skyline is among the world's tallest and most dense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultrapolisproject.com/ultrapolis_017.htm World's Tallest Cities]. ''UltrapolisProject.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' two tallest towers are both located in Chicago; [[Willis Tower]] (formerly Sears Tower, and the tallest building in the [[Western Hemisphere]]), and [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]]. The Loop's historic buildings include the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], the [[Fine Arts Building (Chicago)|Fine Arts Building]], [[35&amp;nbsp;East Wacker]], and the [[Chicago Building]], [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] by [[Mies van der Rohe]]. Many other architects have left their impression on the Chicago skyline such as Daniel Burnham, Louis Sullivan, Charles B. Atwood, John Root, and Helmut Jahn.  The [[Merchandise Mart]], once first on the [[list of largest buildings in the world]], and still listed as 20th, has its own [[zip&amp;nbsp;code]], and stands near the junction of the North and South branches of the Chicago River. Presently, the four tallest buildings in the city are [[Willis Tower]] (formerly the Sears Tower, also a building with its own zip code), [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]], the [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]] (previously the Standard Oil Building), and the [[John Hancock Center]]. [[Industrial district]]s, such as some areas on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], the areas along the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], and [[Northwest Indiana]] are clustered.

Chicago gave its name to the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]] and was home to the [[Prairie School]], movements in architecture. Multiple kinds and scales of houses, townhouses, condominiums, and apartment buildings can be found throughout Chicago. Large swaths of the city's residential areas away from the lake are characterized by brick [[bungalow]]s built from the early 20th century through the end of World War II. Chicago is also a prominent center of the [[Polish Cathedral style]] of [[church architecture]]. The Chicago suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] was home to famous architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who had designed The [[Robie House]] located near the [[University of Chicago]] as well as many prominent buildings across the country.

Unlike many Midwestern and East Coast cities, Chicago tends to have wider streets. A positive effect of this is that it alleviates the feeling of being engulfed by the city's large skyscrapers. Most of the city's residential streets also tend to have a wide patch of grass and/or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself. This has the effect of keeping pedestrians walking on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's [[Western Avenue (Chicago)|Western Avenue]] is the longest continuous urban street in the world. Other famous streets include [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|North Michigan Avenue]], [[State Street (Chicago)|North State Street]], [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark]], and [[Belmont Avenue (Chicago)|Belmont Avenue]]. The [[City Beautiful movement]] inspired Chicago's boulevards and parkways.

===Monuments and public art===
{{prose|date=August 2012}}

Chicago is famous for its outdoor [[public art]], including works by [[Chagall]], [[Picasso]], [[Joan Miró|Miro]], and [[Magdalena Abakanowicz|Abakanowicz]].

City sculptures additionally honor the many people and topics reflecting the rich [[history of Chicago]]. There are monuments to:
&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;
* '''[[Tadeusz Kościuszko]]''' by [[Kazimierz Chodzinski]]

When Chicago was incorporated in 1837, it chose the motto ''Urbs in Horto'', a [[Latin]] phrase which translates into English as &quot;City in a Garden&quot;. Today, the [[Chicago Park District]] consists of 552 parks with over {{convert|7300|acre}} of [[municipal park]]land. There are 33 sand [[Chicago beaches]], a plethora of museums, two world-class conservatories, 16 historic lagoons, and 10 bird and wildlife gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/docs/7fb8e301-0cdd-431b-9dcb-78b2cd6ac348_document.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 29430CHIdoc.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lincoln Park]], the largest of the city's parks, covers {{convert|1200|acre}} and has over 20&amp;nbsp;million visitors each year, making it second only to [[Central Park]] in New York City in number of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Park Facts |publisher=The Trust for Public Land, Center for City Park Excellence |month=June | year=2006 |url=http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=20531&amp;folder_id=3208|accessdate=July 19, 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With berths for more than 5,000 boats, the Chicago Park District operates the nation's largest municipal harbor system; even larger than systems in cities such as New York City, Los Angeles, or Miami. In addition to ongoing beautification and renewal projects for the existing parks, a number of new parks have been added in recent years, such as the [[Ping Tom Memorial Park]] in Chinatown, [[DuSable Park (Chicago)|DuSable Park]] on the Near North Side, and most notably, [[Millennium Park]] in a section of one of Chicago's oldest parks, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in the Chicago Loop.

The wealth of greenspace afforded by Chicago's parks is further augmented by the [[Cook County Forest Preserves]], a network of open spaces containing forest, [[prairie]], [[wetland]], streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie along the city's periphery, home to both the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]] in Glencoe and the [[Brookfield Zoo]] in Brookfield.

===Communities===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
{{See also|Community areas in Chicago}}
[[File:Chicago community areas map.svg|thumb|[[Community areas in Chicago|Community areas]] of the City of Chicago]]
Chicago has four main sections: Downtown (which contains the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]), the North Side, the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], and the West Side. The three sides of the city are represented on the [[Flag of Chicago]] by three horizontal white strips. These sections can further be informally subdivided or grouped, for example as shown on the map (right). Further sectional references are the Northwest side and the Southwest side. In the late 1920s, sociologists at the University of Chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct [[Community areas in Chicago|community areas]], which can further be subdivided into over [[Neighborhoods in Chicago|200 neighborhoods]].

The central commercial area often is portrayed, as in the map at right, to include parts of [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] and [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]], as well as the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]. The North Side is the most densely populated residential section of the city and many high-rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront.
The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60% of the city's land area. The South Side contains the [[University of Chicago]] and most of the facilities of the [[Port of Chicago]].

[[Roads and freeways in Chicago|Chicago's streets]] were laid out in a [[Grid plan|street grid]] that grew from the city's original townsite plat. Streets following the [[Public Land Survey System]] section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction. The grid's regularity would provide an efficient means to develop new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Indian trails, also cross the city. Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the [[Burnham Plan|Plan of Chicago]], but only the extension of [[Ogden Avenue (Chicago)|Ogden Avenue]] was ever constructed.

==Culture and contemporary life==
{{Further|Culture of Chicago|List of people from Chicago|List of museums and cultural institutions in Chicago}}

[[File:New National Hellenic Museum during the day.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The new [[National Hellenic Museum]], one of a plethora of ethnic museums making up the [[Chicago Cultural Alliance]].]]
The city's waterfront allure and nightlife has attracted residents and tourists alike. Over one-third of the city population is concentrated in the lakefront neighborhoods (from [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]] in the north to [[South Shore, Chicago|South Shore]] in the south). The city has many upscale dining establishments as well as many ethnic restaurant districts. These districts include the Mexican villages, such as Pilsen along 18th street, and ''La Villita'' along 26th Street; the [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] enclave ''Paseo Boricua'' in the [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]] neighborhood; &quot;Greektown&quot;, along South Halsted St, immediately west of downtown; &quot;Little Italy&quot;, along Taylor St; &quot;[[Chinatown, Chicago|Chinatown]]&quot;; &quot;[[Polish Patches]]&quot;; &quot;Little Seoul&quot;, around Lawrence Avenue; a cluster of Vietnamese restaurants along Argyle Avenue near Broadway, and [[South Asian|Indian/Pakistani]] along Devon Avenue.

Downtown is the center of Chicago's financial, cultural, and commercial institutions and home to [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] and many of the city's skyscrapers. Many of the city's financial institutions (for example, [[Chicago Board of Trade|CBOT]], [[Chicago Fed]]) are located within a section of downtown called &quot;The Loop&quot;, which is an eight-block by five-block square of city streets that are encircled by elevated rail tracks. The term &quot;The Loop&quot; is largely used by locals to refer to the entire downtown area as well. The central area includes the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]], and the [[Near West Side, Chicago#West Loop Gate / West Loop|Near West Side]], as well as the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]]. These areas contribute famous [[tallest buildings in Chicago|skyscrapers]], abundant restaurants, [[Magnificent Mile|shopping]], [[Museum Campus|museums]], a [[Soldier Field|stadium]] for the [[Chicago Bears]], [[McCormick Place|convention facilities]], [[Grant Park (Chicago)|parkland]], and [[Oak Street Beach|beaches]].

The North Side is the most densely populated section of the city outside of downtown and many high-rises line this side of the city along the lakefront. [[Lincoln Park]] is a {{convert|1200|acre|abbr=on|sing=on}} park stretching for {{convert|5.5|mi|abbr=on}} along the waterfront and containing the [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] and the [[Lincoln Park Conservatory]]. The [[River North Gallery District, Near North Side, Chicago|River North]] neighborhood features the nation's largest concentration of contemporary art galleries outside of New York City. As a [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]] center, due to the city's having a very large Polish population, Chicago celebrates every Labor Day weekend at the [[Taste of Polonia]] Festival in the [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago's Polish neighborhoods&quot; &gt;{{cite web| title=Chicago's Polish neighborhoods | url=http://www.usaweekend.com/05_issues/050515/050515travel_diverse.html#chicago | publisher=USA Weekend Magazine | date=May 15, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Cubs]] play in the North Side's [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]] neighborhood, in the [[Wrigleyville]] district. Lakeview is also home to [[Boystown, Chicago|Boystown]], which, along with [[Andersonville, Chicago|Andersonville]], are the best known LGBT neighborhoods.

The South Side is home to the [[University of Chicago]] (UC), ranked one of the world's top ten universities; and the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]]. [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]] stretches along the waterfront of the South Side. Two of the city's largest parks are also located on this side of the city: [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], bordering the waterfront, hosted the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893, and is home of the aforementioned museum; and slightly west sits [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]]. The two parks themselves are connected by a wide strip of parkland called the [[Midway Plaisance]], running adjacent to the UC. The South Side hosts one of the city's largest parades, the annual African American [[Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic|Bud Billiken Day]] parade. The American automaker [[Ford Motor Company]] has an assembly plant located on the South Side, and most of the facilities of the [[Port of Chicago]] are here. The [[Chicago White Sox]] play in the South Side's [[Armour Square, Chicago|Armour Square]] neighborhood.

The West Side holds the [[Garfield Park Conservatory]], one of the largest collections of tropical plants in any US city. Prominent Latino cultural attractions found here include [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]]'s Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Puerto Rican Day Parade, as well as the [[National Museum of Mexican Art]] and [[St. Adalbert's in Chicago|St. Adalbert's Church]] in [[Pilsen, Chicago|Pilsen]]. The Near West Side holds the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] and television production company of [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Studios]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks]] play on Madison Street.

Chicago's theatre community spawned modern improvisational theater. Two renowned comedy troupes emerged: [[The Second City]] and [[I.O.]] (formerly known as ImprovOlympic). Renowned Chicago theater companies include the [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company]] (on the city's north side), the [[Goodman Theatre]], and the [[Victory Gardens Theater]]. Chicago offers Broadway-style entertainment at theaters such as [[Broadway In Chicago]]'s [[Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre]], [[Broadway In Chicago]]'s [[Bank of America Theatre]], [[Broadway In Chicago]]'s [[Cadillac Palace Theatre]], [[Auditorium Building]] of Roosevelt University, and [[Broadway In Chicago]]'s  Broadway Playhouse at Water Tower Place. [[Polish language]] productions for [[Poles in Chicago|Chicago's large Polish speaking population]] can be seen at the historic [[Gateway Theatre (Chicago, Illinois)|Gateway Theatre]] in [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]]. Since 1968, the [[Joseph Jefferson Awards]] are given annually to acknowledge excellence in theater in the Chicago area.

Classical music offerings include the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], recognized as one of the best orchestras in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97291390 | title=Chicago Symphony Tops U.S. Orchestras | author=Tom Huizenga | work=NPR | date=November 21, 2008 | accessdate=December 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which performs at [[Symphony Center]]. Also performing regularly at [[Symphony Center]] is the [[Chicago Sinfonietta]], a more diverse and multicultural counterpart to the CSO. A new and interesting addition to the Chicago classical music scene is also the Renovo String Orchestra of Chicago.&lt;ref name=Renovo&gt;[http://evanstonnow.com/story/entertainment/bill-smith/2012-01-30/47564/renovo-invites-romantic-abandon-for-valentines Renovo Strings at the  Music Institute of Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, many outdoor concerts are given in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] and [[Millennium Park]]. [[Ravinia Park]], located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of Chicago, is also a favorite destination for many Chicagoans, with performances occasionally given in Chicago locations such as the [[Harris Theater (Chicago, Illinois)|Harris Theater]]. The [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]] is home to the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]]. The [[Lithuanian Opera Company of Chicago]] was founded by [[Lithuanians in the Chicago area|Lithuanian Chicagoans]] in 1956,&lt;ref name=&quot;lithopera&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The [[Joffrey Ballet]] and [[Chicago Festival Ballet]] perform in various venues, including the [[Harris Theater (Chicago, Illinois)|Harris Theater]] in [[Millennium Park]]. Chicago is home to several other modern and jazz dance troupes, such as the [[Hubbard Street Dance Chicago]].

Other live-music genre which are part of the city's cultural heritage include [[Chicago blues]], [[Chicago soul]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. The city is the birthplace of [[house music]] and is the site of an influential [[Chicago hip hop|hip-hop scene]]. In the 1980s, the city was a center for industrial, [[punk rock|punk]] and new wave. This influence continued into the [[alternative rock]] of the 1990s. The city has been an epicenter for [[rave]] culture since the 1980s. A flourishing independent rock music culture brought forth Chicago [[independent music|indie]]. Annual festivals feature various acts such as [[Lollapalooza]] and [[Pitchfork Music Festival]].

Chicago has a distinctive fine art tradition. For much of the twentieth century it nurtured a strong style of figurative [[surrealism]], as in the works of [[Ivan Albright]] and [[Ed Paschke]]. In 1968 and 1969, members of the [[Chicago Imagists]], such as [[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]], [[Leon Golub]], [[Robert Lostutter]], [[Jim Nutt]], and [[Barbara Rossi]] produced bizarre representational paintings.

Chicago is home to a number of large, outdoor works by well-known artists. These include the [[Chicago Picasso]], ''[[Miró's Chicago]]'', ''[[Flamingo (sculpture)|Flamingo]]'' and ''[[Flying Dragon (Calder)|Flying Dragon]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]], ''[[Agora (sculpture)|Agora]]'' by [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], ''[[Monument with Standing Beast]]'' by [[Jean Dubuffet]], ''[[Batcolumn]]'' by [[Claes Oldenburg]], ''[[Cloud Gate]]'' by [[Anish Kapoor]], ''[[Crown Fountain]]'' by [[Jaume Plensa]], and the ''[[Four Seasons (Chagall)|Four Seasons]]'' mosaic by [[Marc Chagall]].

The historic [[Chicago Cultural Center]] (1897), originally serving as the [[Chicago Public Library]], now houses the city's Visitor Information Center, galleries and exhibit halls. The ceiling of its Preston Bradley Hall includes a {{convert|38|ft|abbr=on}} [[Tiffany glass]] dome. [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] holds [[Millennium Park]], [[Buckingham Fountain]] (1927), and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The park also hosts the annual [[Taste of Chicago]] festival. In Millennium Park, there is the reflective ''[[Cloud Gate]]'' sculpture. Also, an outdoor restaurant transforms into an [[ice rink]] in the winter season. Two tall glass sculptures make up the [[Crown Fountain]]. The fountain's two towers display visual effects from LED images of Chicagoans' faces, along with water spouting from their lips. [[Frank Gehry]]'s detailed, stainless steel band shell, the [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]], hosts the classical [[Grant Park Music Festival]] concert series. Behind the pavilion's stage is the [[Harris Theater (Chicago, Illinois)|Harris Theater for Music and Dance]], an indoor venue for mid-sized performing arts companies, including the [[Chicago Opera Theater]] and Music of the Baroque.

[[Navy Pier]], located just east of [[Streeterville]], is {{convert|3000|ft|abbr=on}} long and houses retail stores, restaurants, museums, exhibition halls and auditoriums. Its {{convert|150|ft|m|0|sing=on}} tall [[Ferris wheel]] is one of the most visited landmarks in the Midwest, attracting about 8 million people annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navypier.com/about/ov_pier.html|title=About Navy Pier – The Pier|publisher=Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority|year=2007|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago was the first city in the world to ever erect a ferris wheel.

Chicago lays claim to a large number of regional specialties, all of which reflect the city's ethnic and working class roots. Included among these are its nationally renowned [[Chicago-style pizza|deep-dish pizza]], this style is said to have originated at [[Uno Chicago Grill|Pizzeria Uno]]. The Chicago-style thin crust is also popular in the city.

The [[Chicago-style hot dog]], typically a [[Vienna Beef]] dog, is loaded with an array of fixings that often includes neon green pickle [[relish]], yellow mustard, pickled [[Chili pepper|sport peppers]], tomato wedges, dill pickle spear and topped off with celery salt on an S.

There are several distinctly Chicago sandwiches, among them the [[Italian beef]] sandwich, which is thinly sliced beef slowly simmered [[au jus]] and served on an Italian roll with sweet peppers or spicy giardiniera. A popular modification is the Combo—an Italian beef sandwich with the addition of an Italian sausage. Another is the [[Maxwell Street Polish]], a grilled or deep-fried [[kielbasa]] — on a hot dog roll, topped with grilled onions, yellow mustard, and hot sport peppers.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandwich&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | authorlink = Leah A.

===Literature===
[[File:Carl Sandburg NYWTS.jpg|thumb|upright|Much of [[Carl Sandburg]]'s poetry focused on Chicago. His most famous description of the city is as ''&quot;Hog Butcher for the World/Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat/Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler,/Stormy, Husky, Brawling, City of the Big Shoulders.&quot;'']]
{{Further|Chicago literature}}

Chicago literature finds its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of [[social realism]]. In the ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', [[Northwestern University]] Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to ''&quot;capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people.&quot;'' The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of &quot;high-flown romance&quot; and &quot;genteel realism&quot;, needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of  Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/448.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, &quot;Fiction.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would stand the test of time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/755.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, &quot;Literary Cultures.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and create a &quot;city of feeling&quot; out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1390.html Encyclopedia of Chicago, &quot;Literary Images of Chicago&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check.

At least, three short periods in the [[history of Chicago]] have had a lasting influence on [[American Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/257.html Encyclopedia of Chicago History, &quot;Chicago Literary Renaissance.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  These include from the time of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] to about 1900, what became known as the Chicago Literary Renaissance in the 1910s and early 1920s, and the period of the [[Great Depression]] through the 1940s.

What would become the influential ''[[Poetry Magazine]]'' was founded in [[1912 in poetry|1912]] by [[Harriet Monroe]], who was working as an [[art]] [[critic]] for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. The magazine discovered such poets as [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], [[James Merrill]], and [[John Ashbery]].&lt;ref name=ny&gt;Goodyear, Dana, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/02/19/070219fa_fact_goodyear &quot;The Moneyed Muse: What can two hundred million dollars do for poetry?&quot;], article, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', February 19 and February 26 double issue, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  [[T.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Eliot]]'s first professionally published poem, &quot;[[The Love Song of J.&amp;nbsp;Alfred Prufrock]]&quot;, was first published by ''Poetry''.  Contributors have included [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Langston Hughes]], and [[Carl Sandburg]], among others. The magazine was instrumental in launching the [[Imagist]] and [[Objectivist poets|Objectivist]] poetic movements.

Christianity is predominant among the city's population. The [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]] also includes adherents of [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], among others.

The wealth of Chicago's religious heritage is evident in its many noted examples of [[sacred architecture]] and institutions. Many of these religious edifices are Christian in origin, with [[Roman Catholic]] structures particularly prevalent. However, the city of [[Polish Cathedral style|Polish Cathedrals]] is rife with numerous historic synagogues, as well as the noteworthy sacred spaces of other religions.

}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is home to two [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams: the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[National League]] (NL), who play in [[Wrigley Field]] on the North Side; and the [[Chicago White Sox]] of the [[American League]] (AL), who play in [[U.S. Cellular Field]] on the South Side. Chicago is the only city that has had more than one MLB franchise every year since the AL began in 1901. The [[Chicago Bears]], one of the last two remaining charter members of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), have won nine [[List of NFL champions|NFL Championships]], including [[Super Bowl&amp;nbsp;XX]]. The other remaining charter franchise, the Chicago Cardinals, also started out in the city, but are now known as the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The Bears play their home games at [[Soldier Field]] just off the shore of Lake Michigan. Once a home to stock car racing, Soldier field was an aging stadium and was in dire need of renovation by the end of the 20th century. In 2003, Soldier Field re-opened after an extensive renovation, which increased the number of luxury boxes in the stadium and dramatically improved the day of game experience for Bears fans.

The [[Chicago Bulls]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) are one of the most recognized basketball teams in the world. During the 1990s with [[Michael Jordan]] leading them, the Bulls took six NBA championships in eight seasons. The [[Chicago Blackhawks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), who began play in 1926, and are one of the &quot;[[Original Six]]&quot;, teams of the National Hockey League (NHL), have won four [[Stanley Cup]]s. The Blackhawks are the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals|2010 Stanley Cup champion]]s, and hosted the [[2009 NHL Winter Classic]] at Wrigley Field. Both the Bulls and Blackhawks play at the [[United Center]] on the Near West Side. The [[Chicago Rush]] has been a member of the [[Arena Football League]] since 2001 and won [[ArenaBowl&amp;nbsp;XX]], playing in suburban [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]]. The [[Arena Football]] League front office is also in Chicago. The [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] are members of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and reside at [[Toyota Park (Bridgeview)|Toyota Park]] in suburban [[Bridgeview, Illinois|Bridgeview]], after playing its first eight seasons at [[Soldier Field]]. The Fire have won one league title and four [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Open Cups]] since their founding in 1997.

While four of the five major franchises have won championships within recent time – the Bears (1985), the Bulls (91, '92, '93, '96, '97, and '98), the White Sox (2005), and the Blackhawks (2010) — the Chicago Cubs are known for their drought of over 100 years without a championship (currently 103 years as of the 2011 MLB season). The last time the Cubs were in a World Series was 1945. Some fans claim the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]] is responsible for the drought.

Manufacturing, printing, publishing and food processing also play major roles in the city's economy. Several medical products and services companies are headquartered in the Chicago area, including [[Baxter International]], [[Boeing]], [[Abbott Laboratories]], and the Healthcare Financial Services division of [[General Electric]]. Moreover, the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which helped move goods from the [[Great Lakes]] south on the [[Mississippi River]], and of the railroads in the 19th century made the city a major transportation center in the United States. In the 1840s, Chicago became a major [[cereal|grain]] port, and in the 1850s and 1860s Chicago's pork and beef industry expanded.

Chicago has been a hub of the [[Retail]] sector since its early development in America, when it was the home of [[Montgomery Ward]], [[Sears]], and [[Marshall Field's]].

{{Main|Demographics of Chicago}}

During its first 100 years, Chicago was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. When founded in 1833, less than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. Within the span of forty years, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 in 1850 to over 1&amp;nbsp;million by 1890. By the close of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201f.htm |title=Top 10 Cities of the Year 1900 |publisher=Geography.about.com |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within sixty years of the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Chicago Fire of 1871]], the population went from about 300,000 to over 3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=University Illinois Chicago
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its highest ever-recorded population of 3.6&amp;nbsp;million for the 1950 census.

From the last two decades of the 19th Century, Chicago was the destination of waves of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, including (but by no means limited to) [[Italians]], [[Jews]], [[Poles]], and [[Czechs]].&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;Lizabeth Cohen, ''Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919-1939''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1990; pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; To these ethnic groups, the basis of the city's industrial [[working class]], was added an additional influx of [[African-Americans]] from the [[Southern United States|American South]] — with Chicago's black population doubling between 1910 and 1920 and doubling again between 1920 and 1930.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

The great majority of American blacks moving to Chicago in these years were clustered in a so‑called &quot;[[Black Belt (region of Chicago)|Black Belt]]&quot; on the city's South Side.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; By 1930, two-thirds of Chicago's African-American population lived in sections of the city which were 90% black in racial composition.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; Chicago's South Side emerged as America's second largest urban black concentration, following New York's [[Harlem]].&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_QTPL&amp;prodType=table American Community Survey: Chicago city]. Retrieved March 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; there were 2,695,598 people with 1,045,560 households living in Chicago. More than half the population of the state of Illinois lives in the Chicago metropolitan area. Chicago is also one of the United States' most densely populated major cities. The racial composition of the city was:
* 45.0% [[White American|White]] (31.7% [[non-Hispanic whites]]);
* 32.9% [[African American|Black or African American]];
* 13.4% from some other race;
* 5.5% [[Asian American|Asian]] (1.6% Chinese, 1.1% Indian, 1.1% Filipino, 0.4% Korean, 0.3% Pakistani, 0.3% Vietnamese, 0.2% Japanese, 0.1% Thai);
* 2.7% from [[Multiracial American|two or more races]];
* 0.5% [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]].

(Its members may belong to any race; 21.4% Mexican, 3.8% Puerto Rican, 0.7% Guatemalan, 0.6% Ecuadorian, 0.3% Cuban, 0.3% Colombian, 0.2% Honduran, 0.2% Salvadoran, 0.2% Peruvian)&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_QTPL&amp;prodType=table Factfinder2census.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; The Guatemalan, Colombian and Peruvian communities have skyrocketed in the 2000s, and some estimates give higher percentages.

Based on Census data from 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $38,625, and the median income for a family was $42,724. Males had a median income of $35,907 versus $30,536 for females. About 16.6% of families and 19.6% of the population lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US1714000&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP3&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_sse=on |title=Chicago city, Illinois – DP-3.

==Law and government==
{{Main|Law and government of Chicago|Political history of Chicago}}
[[File:Daley Plaza 060716.jpg|thumb|Daley Plaza with [[Picasso]] statue and City Hall in background. State law courts are in the building at right]]
Chicago is the [[county seat]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]]. The government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and [[legislature|legislative]] branches. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the [[Cook County Circuit Court]] of the State of Illinois court system, or in the [[Northern District of Illinois]], in the federal system. In the former, the public prosecutor is the Illinois [[State's Attorney]], in the latter, the United States [[District Attorney|Attorney]].

The [[Mayor of Chicago]] is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. In addition to the mayor, Chicago's two other citywide elected officials are the clerk and the treasurer. The [[Chicago City Council|City Council]] is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each [[wards of the United States|ward]] in the city. The council enacts local ordinances and approves the city budget. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance usually adopted each November. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions.

During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] organization dominated by ethnic ward-heelers. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, [[anarchism|anarchist]] and labor organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Schneirov 1998, pp 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been &quot;[[Red states and blue states|solid blue]]&quot; in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] since 1992.  Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago.  The citizens of Chicago have not elected a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] mayor since 1927, when [[William Hale Thompson|William Thompson]] was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent the rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding. Chicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but 8 of Illinois' 19 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Representatives]] have part of Chicago in their [[Illinois's congressional districts|districts]].

Former Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]'s (in office
1955–1976) mastery of [[political machine|machine politics]] preserved the [[Chicago Democratic Machine]] long after the demise of similar machines in other large U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;Montejano 1998, pp 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal &quot;independent&quot; faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of [[Harold Washington]] (in office 1983–1987). From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest serving mayor, [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of Richard J. Daley.  On May 16, 2011, [[Rahm Emanuel]] was sworn in as the 55th mayor of Chicago. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats.  The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.

===Crime===
{{Main|Crime in Chicago|Organized crime in Chicago}}
Murders in the city peaked first in 1974, with 970 murders when the city's population was ''over'' 3&amp;nbsp;million people (resulting in a murder rate of around 29 per 100,000), and again in 1992 with 943 murders, resulting in a murder rate of 34 per 100,000!&lt;ref&gt;Heinzmann, David (January 1, 2003).

''Chicago Tribune'', found at qrc.depaul.edu/djabon/Articles/ChicagoCrime20030101.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, along with other major US cities, experienced a significant reduction in violent crime rates through the 1990s, eventually recording 448 [[homicide]]s in 2004, the lowest total since 1965 (15.65 per 100,000.) Chicago's homicide tally remained steady throughout 2005, 2006, and 2007 with 449, 452, and 435 respectively.

In 2008, murders rebounded to 510, 2nd highest in the country (though not in per capita rate), breaking 500 for the first time since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6580432 |title=Murder rate jumps in 2008 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tressugar.com/1919267 |title=Chicago's Murder Rate Double American Soldiers Killed in Iraq |publisher=Tres Sugar |date= September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2009 the murder count was down about 10% for the year, to 458.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI 2005 UCR data|url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_08_il.html|publisher=FBI|accessdate=August 18, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressways===
{{Further|Roads and expressways in Chicago}}
Seven mainline and four auxiliary [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] ([[Interstate 55 in Illinois|55]], [[Interstate 57|57]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|65]] (only in Indiana), [[Interstate 80 in Illinois|80]] (also in [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 88 (west)|88]], [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|90]] (also in [[Indiana Toll Road|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 94 in Illinois|94]] (also in [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|Indiana]]), [[Interstate 190 (Illinois)|190]], [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|290]], [[Interstate 294|294]], and [[Interstate 355|355]]) run through Chicago and its suburbs.

===Transit systems===
The '''[[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|Regional Transportation Authority]] (RTA)''' coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace.

* The '''[[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA)''' handles public transportation in the city of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a [[rapid transit]] elevated and subway system known as the [[Chicago 'L'|'L']] (for &quot;elevated&quot;), with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]]s. The CTA's rail lines consist of the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue]], [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]], [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange]], [[Brown Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Brown]], [[Purple Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Purple]], [[Pink Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Pink]], and [[Yellow Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Yellow]] lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24‑hour service which makes Chicago one of a handful of cities around the world (and one of two in the United States, the other being New York City) to offer rail service 24 hours a day, every day of the year, within the city's limits.

* '''[[Metra]]''', the nation's second-most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11-line [[commuter rail]] service in Chicago and throughout the Chicago suburbs. The [[Metra Electric Line]] shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]], which provides commuter service between [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and Chicago.

* '''[[Pace (transit)|Pace]]''' provides bus and [[paratransit]] service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm &quot;New Yorkers are top transit users&quot;], by Les Christie,''CNNmoney.com'', 2007-6-29. Retrieved 2009-9-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Greyhound Lines]]''' provides inter-city bus service to and from the city, and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of [[Megabus (North America)]].

'''[[Amtrak]]''' long distance services originate from [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]]. Chicago is one of the largest hubs of passenger rail service in the nation. The services terminate in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City, [[Indianapolis]], New Orleans, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Seattle]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St.&amp;nbsp;Louis]], [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], Boston, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], Los Angeles, and [[San Antonio]]. An attempt was made in the early 20th century to link Chicago with New York City via the [[Chicago – New York Electric Air Line Railroad]]. Parts of this were built, but it was ultimately never completed.

Chicago is served by [[O'Hare International Airport]], the world's second busiest airport, on the far Northwest Side, and [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway International Airport]] on the Southwest Side. In 2005, O'Hare was the world's busiest airport by aircraft movements and the second busiest by total passenger traffic (due to government enforced flight caps).&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.airports.org/aci/aci/file/Press%20Releases/PR140306_2005_Prelim_Results.pdf Preliminary Traffic Results for 2005 Show Firm Rebound (March 14, 2006)]|520&amp;nbsp;KB}}. ''Airports Council International''.&lt;/ref&gt; Both O'Hare and Midway are owned and operated by the City of Chicago. [[Gary/Chicago International Airport]] and [[Chicago Rockford International Airport]], located in [[Gary, Indiana]] and [[Rockford, Illinois]], respectively, can serve as alternate Chicago area airports, however they do not offer as many commercial flights as O'Hare and Midway. Both Gary and Rockford are vying to become Chicago's third major airport, although the state of Illinois in recent years has been leaning towards building an entirely new airport in the Illinois suburbs of Chicago. The City of Chicago is the world headquarters for [[United Airlines]], the world's largest airline. O'Hare is also a hub for [[American Airlines]]. Chicago is a focus city for [[Southwest Airlines]] at Midway.

===Port authority===
{{Main|Port of Chicago}}
'''The Port of Chicago''' consists of several major port facilities within the city of Chicago operated by the '''Illinois International Port District''' (formerly known as the '''Chicago Regional Port District'''). The central element of the Port District, '''Calumet Harbor''', is maintained by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (November 2007).

==Infrastructure==

===Utilities===
Electricity for most of [[northern Illinois]] is provided by [[Commonwealth Edison]], also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders [[Iroquois County, Illinois|Iroquois County]] to the south, the [[Wisconsin]] border to the north, the [[Iowa]] border to the west and the [[Indiana]] border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of [[Exelon]]) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any US state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city started the installation of wind turbines on government buildings with the aim to promote the use of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |title=IIT.edu |publisher=IIT.edu |date=June 20, 2003 |accessdate=May 4, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080605021018/http://www.iit.edu/~ipro307f/faq.html |archivedate = June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/news/advisory/adv030707.html |title=KentLaw.edu |publisher=KentLaw.edu |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Martin LaMonica Staff Writer, CNET News |url=http://news.com.com/Micro+wind+turbines+are+coming+to+town/2100-11398_3-6037539.html |title='Micro' wind turbines are coming to town &amp;#124; CNET News.com |publisher=News.com.com |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural Gas is provided by Peoples Gas, a subsidiary of [[Integrys Energy Group]], which is headquartered in Chicago.

Domestic and industrial waste was once incinerated but it is now [[landfill]]ed, mainly in the [[Lake Calumet|Calumet area]]. From 1995 to 2008, the city had a [[blue bag]] program to divert certain refuse from landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1322.html |title=Waste Disposal |publisher=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2007 the city began a pilot program for blue bin recycling similar to that of other cities due to low participation rates in the blue bag program. After completion of the pilot the city will determine whether to roll it out to all wards.

To celebrate the sister cities, Chicago hosts a yearly festival in [[Daley Plaza]], which features cultural acts and food tastings from the other cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;sistercities&quot; /&gt; In addition, the Chicago Sister Cities program hosts a number of delegation and formal exchanges.&lt;ref name=&quot;sistercities&quot; /&gt; In some cases, these exchanges have led to further informal collaborations, such as the academic relationship between the Buehler Center on Aging, Health &amp; Society at the [[Feinberg School of Medicine]] of Northwestern University and the Institute of Gerontology of Ukraine (originally of the [[Soviet Union]]), that was originally established as part of the Chicago-Kiev sister cities program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Celia|last=Berdes, PhD|coauthors=Levin, Andrew|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/aging/pdf/Annual2008.pdf|work=Annual Report 2008|pages=5–7|publisher=Buehler Center on Aging, Health &amp; Society|title=Director Emeritus James Webster Looks Backward, Forward|accessdate=July 1, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
