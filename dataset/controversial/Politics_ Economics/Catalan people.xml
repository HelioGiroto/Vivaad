The '''Catalans''' are an ethnic group; the people from, or with origins in, [[Catalonia]] who form a historical nationality in northern [[Spain]]. The inhabitants of the adjacent portion of southern France (known in Catalonia proper as ''[[Northern Catalonia|Catalunya Nord]]'', and in France as the ''[[Pays Catalan]]'') are included in this definition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.mairie-perpignan.fr/index.php?np=1&amp;cd=1660] Présentation Perpinyà 2008&quot; {{fr}} {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/catalanite/catalanitat.html#llocs Culture et catalanité] Conseil Général des Pyrénées-Orientales {{fr}} {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Extended concept==

The other [[Catalan language|Catalan-speaking]] people, namely [[Andorran]]s, [[Valencian Community|Valencians]], [[Balearic islands|Balearics]], [[la Franja|some Aragonese]], and [[Alghero|Alguerese]] are sometimes identified as a distinct Catalan ethnic group by certain nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0167848 Definition of &quot;Catalan people&quot; in GREC]&quot;. Accessed: 29 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The latter assertion is especially rooted in [[Catalan nationalism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
In the aforementioned territories (often designated ''[[Països Catalans]]'', &quot;Catalan Countries&quot;, by [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalists]]). This extended concept is controversial in those territories and eventually brings conflict, most of all in the [[Valencian Community]] where it is a great issue involving discrimination of the language and mediatic manipulation.

==Historical background==
{{See also|History of Catalonia}}
{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}}
The earliest reference to Catalans (''Catalanenses''), treated as an [[ethnic group]], is found in the [[Latin]] ''[[Liber maiolichinus]]'', an Italian epic poem of ''c''.1120. This also contains the earliest reference to Catalonia (''Catalania'') as the name for their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usuarios.lycos.es/guerradesucesion/Textos/1114%20Dux%20Catalanesis-Catalanicus%20Heros-Catalania.pdf Latin text of the ''Liber maiolichinus'' with Spanish introduction.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The area that now is known primarily as Catalonia, was invaded in 1500 BCE by [[Proto-Celtic]] [[Urnfield Culture|Urnfield people]] who brought the rite of burning the dead. These Indo-European people were absorbed by the [[Iberians]] beginning in 600 BCE in a process that would not complete until the fourth century BCE. These groups came under the rule of various invading groups starting with the [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], who set up colonies along the coast, including [[Barcelona|Barcino]] (present-day Barcelona) itself. Following the [[Punic Wars]], the Romans replaced the Carthaginians as the dominant power in Catalonia by 206 BCE. Rome established [[Latin]] as the official language and imparted a distinctly [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture upon the local population, which merged with Roman colonists from the [[Italian peninsula]]. An early precursor to the Catalan language began to develop from a local form of popular Latin before and during the collapse of the Roman Empire. Various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes arrived following nearly six centuries of Roman rule, which had completely transformed the area into the Roman [[province]] of [[Tarraconensis]]. The [[Visigoth]]s established themselves in the fifth century and would rule the area until 718 when Muslim [[Arab]]s and [[Berber people|Berbers]] conquered the region and held it for close to a century. The [[Franks]] held back small Muslim raiding parties, which had penetrated virtually unchallenged as far as central France; Frankish [[suzerainty]] extended over much of present-day Catalonia. Larger wars with the Muslims began with the [[Marca Hispanica|Spanish March]] which led to the beginnings of the ''[[reconquista]]'' (reconquest) by Catalan forces over most of Catalonia by the year 801. Barcelona became an important center for [[Christian]] forces in the Iberian peninsula.

Catalonia emerged from the conflicts in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Spain]] as a regional power, as Christian rulers entrenched themselves in the region during the [[Carolingian]] period. Rulers such as [[Wilfred the Hairy]] became masters of a larger territory encompassing Catalonia. The [[Crown of Aragon]] included Catalonia, [[Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and the [[Balearic Islands]]. The marriage of [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and the conquest of the last Muslim kingdom of [[Granada]] in 1492 tied Catalonia politically to the fate of the new Spanish kingdom, while a regional culture continued to survive and thrive.

Some sporadic regional unrest led to conflicts such as the [[Revolt of the Germanies]] in Valencia and Majorca, and the 1640 revolt in Catalonia known as the [[Reapers' War]]. This latter conflict embroiled Spain in a larger war with France as many Catalan nobles allied themselves with [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. The war continued until 1659 and ended with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees|Peace of the Pyrenees]], which effectively partitioned Catalonia as the northern strip of the March came under French rule, while the rest remained under Spanish [[hegemony]]. The Catalan government took sides with the Habsburg pretender against the Bourbon one during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] that started in 1705 and ended in 1714. The Catalan failure to defend the perpetuation of Habsburg dynasty in Spain culminated in the surrender of Barcelona on September 11, 1714, which came to be commemorated as [[National Day of Catalonia|Catalonia's national day]].

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], much of Catalonia was seized by French forces by 1808, as France ruled the entire region briefly until Napoleon's surrender to Allied Armies. In France, strong assimilationist policies integrated many Catalans into French society, while in Spain a Catalan identity was increasingly suppressed in favor of a national identity. The Catalans regained autonomy during the [[Spanish Second Republic]] from 1932 until [[Francisco Franco]]'s nationalist forces retook Catalonia by 1939. It was not until 1975 and the death of Franco that the Catalans began to regain their right to cultural expression, which was restarted by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. Since this period, a balance between a sense of local identity versus the broader Spanish one has emerged as the dominant political force in Catalonia. The former tends to advocate for even greater autonomy and independence; the latter tends to argue for maintaining the status quo. As a result, there tends to be much fluctuation depending on regional and national politics during a given election cycle. Given the stronger centralist tendencies in France, however, French Catalans display a much less dynamic sense of uniqueness, having been integrated more consistently into the unitary French national identity.

==Geography==
The vast majority of Catalans reside in the autonomous community of Catalonia, within Spain. At least 100,000 Catalan speakers live in the ''pays catalan'' in France. An indeterminate number of Catalans emigrated to other countries during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] and in the years following the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Culture and society==
Described by author [[Walter Starkie]] in ''The Road to Santiago'' as a subtle people, he sums up their national character with a local term ''[[seny]]'' meaning &quot;common sense&quot; or a pragmatic attitude toward life. The ''masia'' or ''mas'' is a defining characteristic of the Catalan countryside and includes a large house, land, cattle, and an extended family, but this tradition is in decline as the nuclear family has largely replaced the extended family, as in the rest of western Europe. Catalans in Spain are recognised as a &quot;nationality&quot; and enjoy a high degree of political autonomy, leading to reinforcement of a Catalan identity.

===Language===

{{Main|Languages of Catalonia}}

The [[Catalan language]] is a [[Romance language]] of the [[Gallo-Iberian]] group. It is the language closest to [[Occitan language|Occitan]], as well as sharing many features with other [[Western Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]. There are a number of linguistic varieties that are considered [[Catalan_language#Dialects|dialects of Catalan]]; among them, the dialect group with the most speakers, [[Central Catalan]].

The number of Catalan speakers is more than 7 million, but very few Catalan [[monoglot]]s exist; basically, virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with a sizeable population of Spanish-only speakers of immigrant origin (typically born outside Catalonia or with both parents born outside Catalonia) {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} existing in the major Catalan urban areas as well. In the Roussillon, nowadays only a minority of the French Catalans do speak Catalan, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of [[language shift]].

The inhabitants of the [[Aran valley]] count [[Aranese]] –an [[Occitan]] dialect– rather than Catalan as their own language. These Catalans are also bilingual in Spanish.

In September 2005, the [[.cat]] TLD, the first Internet language-based top-level domain, was approved for all web pages intending to serve the needs of the Catalan linguistic and cultural community on the Internet. This community is made up of those who use the Catalan language for their online communications or promote the different aspects of Catalan culture online.

===Traditional clothes===
The traditional dress (now, practically only used in folkloric celebrations) included the ''[[barretina]]'' (a sort of woollen, long cap usually red or purple color) and the ''faixa'' (a sort of wide belt) among men, and ''ret'' (a fine net bag to contain hair) among women. The traditional footwear was the ''espardenya'' or [[espadrille]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Catalan cuisine}}

====Traditional diet====

The Catalan diet is part of the [[Mediterranean diet]] and includes the use of [[olive oil]]. Catalan people like to eat veal (''vedella'') and lamb (''xai'').

There are three main daily meals:
* In the morning: a very light breakfast, consisting of fruit or fruit juice, milk, coffee, or ''[[pa amb tomàquet]]'' &quot;bread with tomato&quot;. Catalans tend to divide their breakfast into two parts: one early in the morning before going to work or study (first breakfast), and the other one between 10:00 and 12:00 (second breakfast)
* In the afternoon (roughly from 13:00 to 14:30): the main meal of the day, usually comprising three dishes. The first consists of pasta or vegetables, the second of meat or fish, and the third of fruit or yogurt
* In the evening (roughly from 20:00 to 22:30): more food than in the morning, but less than at lunch; very often only a single main dish and fruit; it is common to drink moderate quantities of wine.

In Catalan gastronomy, ''embotits'' (a wide variety of Catalan sausages and cold meats) are very important; these are pork sausages such as ''[[botifarra]]'' or ''[[fuet]]''. In the past, bread (similar to French bread) figured heavily in the Catalan diet; now it is used mainly in the morning (second breakfast, especially among young students and some workers) and supplements the noon meal, at home and in restaurants. Bread is still popular among Catalans; some Catalan fast-food restaurants don't serve hamburgers, but offer a wide variety of sandwiches.

In the past, the poor ate [[soup]] every day and [[rice]] on Thursday and Sunday.

The discipline of abstinence, not eating [[meat]] during [[Lent]], once was very strong, but practically disappeared in the twentieth century.

Spicy food is rare in the Catalan diet, but there are quite garlicky sauces such as ''[[aioli|allioli]]'' or ''[[romesco]]''.

====Traditional dishes====
{{Main|Catalan cuisine}}
One type of Catalan dish is ''[[escudella]]'', a soup which contains chick peas, potatoes, and vegetables such as green cabbage, celery, carrots, turnips, and meats such as ''botifarra'' (a Catalan sausage), pork feet, salted ham, chicken, and veal. In Northern Catalonia, it is sometimes called ''ollada''.

Other Catalan dishes are ''[[calçots]]'' (similar to [[leek]]s and often eaten with a [[romesco sauce]]) and ''[[escalivada]]''.

===Music===
{{Main|Catalan music}}
Catalan music has one of the oldest documented musical traditions in [[Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Religion===
The majority of Catalans are of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition.

===Social conditions===
Catalonia is one of the richest and most well developed regions in [[Southern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ara.cat/economia/kenneth-rogoff-FMI-Catalunya-paisos-rics-mon_0_456555186.html Notícia diari Ara]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barcelona]] is among the most industrialized metropolises and is both a regional capital and a magnet for various migrants from other regions in Spain, as well as from foreign countries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Identity and nationalism===
Due to the continued identification with a distinct identity, many Catalans support [[Catalan nationalism]] or [[Catalan independentism]] in Spain. This is only seen to a much lesser extent in France.
