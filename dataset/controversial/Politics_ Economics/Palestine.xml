{{Further|Definitions of Palestine|History of the name Palestine}}

The term ''Peleset'' ([[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliterated]] from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] as ''P-r-s-t'') is found in numerous Egyptian documents referring to a neighboring people or land starting from c.1150 BCE during the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt]]. The first mention is thought to be in texts of the temple at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]] which record a people called the Peleset among the [[Sea Peoples]] who invaded [[Egypt]] in [[Ramesses III]]'s reign.&lt;ref name=Fahlbuschp185&gt;Fahlbusch et al., 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assyria]]ns called the same region ''Palashtu'' or ''Pilistu'', beginning with [[Adad-nirari III]] in the Nimrud Slab in c.800 BCE through to emperor [[Sargon II]] in his Annals approximately a century later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehrlich&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharonp4&gt;Sharon, 1988, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roomp285/&gt; Neither the Egyptian or Assyrian sources provided clear regional boundaries for the term.

The first clear use of the term Palestine to refer to the entire area between Phoenicia and Egypt was in 5th century BC [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Palestine and Israel |journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |first=David M. |last=Jacobson |editor-first=James M. |editor-last=Weinstein |number=313 |year=1999 |month=February |publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research |issn=0003097X |pages=65–74 |jstor=1357617 |accessdate=February 28, 2012|quote=&quot;The earliest occurrence of this name in a Greek text is in the mid-fifth century b.c., Histories of Herodotus, where it is applied to the area of the Levant between Phoenicia and Egypt.&quot;...&quot;The first known occurrence of the Greek word Palaistine is in the Histories of Herodotus, written near the mid-fifth century B.C.

Although some of Herodotus' references to Palestine are compatible with a narrow definition of the coastal strip of the Land of Israel, it is clear that Herodotus does call the &quot;whole land by the name of the coastal strip.&quot;...&quot;It is believed that Herodotus visited Palestine in the fifth decade of the fifth century B.C.&quot;...&quot;In the earliest Classical literature references to Palestine generally applied to the Land of Israel in the wider sense.&quot;}} and {{cite web |url= http://cojs.org/cojswiki/When_Palestine_Meant_Israel,_David_Jacobson,_BAR_27:03,_May/Jun_2001.|title= When Palestine Meant Israel|author= David Jacobson|date= May/Jun 2001|publisher= BAR 27:03|accessdate=2 March 2012|quote= As early as the Histories of Herodotus, written in the second half of the fifth century B.C.E., the term Palaistinê is used to describe not just the geographical area where the Philistines lived, but the entire area between Phoenicia and Egypt—in other words, the Land of Israel.

Yet he used Palaistinê to refer not to the Land of the Philistines, but to the Land of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] wrote of a 'district of Syria, called ''Palaistinê''&quot; in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', the first historical work clearly defining the region, which included the [[Judean mountains]] and the [[Jordan Rift Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, David M., ''Palestine and Israel'', Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 313 (Feb., 1999), pp. 65–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Southern and Eastern Borders of Abar-Nahara Steven S.

Rainey Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 321 (Feb., 2001), pp. 57–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his work, Herodotus referred to the practice of [[History of male circumcision|male circumcision]] associated with the Hebrew people: &quot;the [[Colchis|Colchians]], the [[Egyptians]], and the [[Ethiopians]], are the only nations who have practised circumcision from the earliest times. The [[Phoenicians]] and the Syrians of Palestine themselves confess that they learnt the custom of the Egyptians.... Now these are the only nations who use circumcision.&quot; [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txt The History of Herodotus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beloe, W., Rev., ''Herodotus'', (tr. from Greek), with notes, Vol.II, London, 1821, p.269 &quot;It should be remembered that Syria is always regarded by Herodotus as synonymous with [[Assyria]]. What the Greeks called Palestine the Arabs call Falastin, which is the Philistines of Scripture.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losttrails.com/herald/messages/33.shtml Elyahu Green, Geographic names of places in Israel in Herodotos] This is confirmed by [[George Rawlinson]] in the third book (Thalia) of ''The Histories'' where ''Palaestinian Syrians'' are part of the fifth tax district spanning the territory from [[Phoenicia]] to the borders of Egypt, but excludes the ''kingdom of Arabs'' who were exempt from tax for providing the Assyrian army with water on its march to Egypt. These people had a large city called Cadytis, identified as Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately a century later, [[Aristotle]] used a similar definition in ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', writing &quot;Again if, as is fabled, there is a lake in Palestine, such that if you bind a man or beast and throw it in it floats and does not sink, this would bear out what we have said. They say that this lake is so bitter and salt that no fish live in it and that if you soak clothes in it and shake them it cleans them,&quot; understood by scholars to be a reference to the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html |title=Meteorology By Aristotle |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers such as [[Polemon of Athens|Polemon]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] also used the term to refer to the same region. This usage was followed by Roman writers such as [[Ovid]], [[Tibullus]], [[Pomponius Mela]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Dio Chrysostom]], [[Statius]], [[Plutarch]] as well as Roman Judean writers [[Philo of Alexandria]] and [[Josephus]].&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; Other writers, such as [[Strabo]], a prominent Roman-era geographer (although he wrote in Greek), referred to the region as ''Coele-Syria'' around 10–20 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Hellenistic Judaism  ：Louis H. Feldman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Hellenistic settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa ：Getzel M. Cohen&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used to denote an official province in c.135 CE, when the [[Roman Empire|Roman authorities]], following the suppression of the [[Bar Kokhba Revolt]], combined [[Iudaea Province]] with [[Galilee]] and other surrounding cities such as [[Ashkelon]] to form &quot;[[Syria Palaestina]]&quot; ({{lang|la|Syria Palaestina}}), which some scholars state was in order to complete the dissociation with Judaea.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lehmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name ''Peleshet'' ({{lang|he|פלשת}} ''Pəlésheth'') – usually translated as ''Philistia'' in English, is used in the [[Bible]] more than 250 times. The Greek word ''Palaistinē'' (Παλαιστίνη, &quot;''Palaistine''&quot;) is generally accepted to be a translation of the Semitic name for Philistia; however another term – ''land of the Philistieim'' (''γῆ τῶν Φυλιστιεἰμ '', transliteration from Hebrew) – was used in the [[Septuagint]], the second century BCE Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], to refer to Philistia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Palestine and Israel |journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |first=David M. |last=Jacobson |editor-first=James M. |editor-last=Weinstein |number=313 |year=1999 |month=February |publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research |issn=0003097X |pages=65–74, p.70 n.2 |jstor=1357617 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Torah]] / [[Pentateuch]] the term Philistia is used 10 times and its boundaries are undefined. The later [[Books of the Bible|Historical books]] (see [[Deuteronomistic history]]) include most of the biblical references, almost 200 of which are in the [[Book of Judges]] and the [[Books of Samuel]], where the term is used to denote the southern coastal region to the west of the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref name=Sharonp4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roomp285&gt;Room, 1997, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;Robinson, Edward, ''Physical geography of the Holy Land'', Crocker &amp; Brewster, Boston, 1865, p.15. Robinson, writing in 1865 when travel by Europeans to the Ottoman Empire became common asserts that, &quot;Palestine, or Palestina, now the most common name for the Holy Land, occurs three times in the English version of the Old Testament; and is there put for the [[Hebrew]] name פלשת, elsewhere rendered Philistia. As thus used, it refers strictly and only to the country of the [[Philistines]], in the southwest corner of the land. So, too, in the Greek form, Παλαςτίνη), it is used by [[Josephus]]. But both Josephus and [[Philo]] apply the name to the whole land of the Hebrews ; and Greek and Roman writers employed it in the like extent.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 1993, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], the entire region (Syria Palestine, [[Samaria]], and the [[Galilee]]) was named ''Palaestina'', subdivided into provinces Palaestina I and II.&lt;ref name=Kaegip41/&gt; The Byzantines also renamed an area of land including the [[Negev]], [[Sinai]], and the west coast of the Arabian Peninsula as ''Palaestina Salutaris'', sometimes called ''Palaestina III''.&lt;ref name=Kaegip41&gt;Kaegi, 1995, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for Palestine is فلسطين (commonly transcribed in English as ''Filistin'', ''Filastin'', or ''Falastin'').&lt;ref name=Marshallp559&gt;Marshall Cavendish, 2007, p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; Moshe Sharon writes that when the [[Arab]]s took over [[Greater Syria]] in the 7th century, [[Place names of Palestine|place names]] that were in use by the Byzantine administration before them, generally continued to be used. Hence, he traces the emergence of the Arabic form ''Filastin'' to this adoption, with Arabic inflection, of Roman and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ([[Semitic]]) names.&lt;ref name=Sharonp4/&gt; Jacob Lassner and Selwyn Ilan Troen offer a different view, writing that ''Jund Filastin'', the full name for the administrative province under the rule of the Arab [[caliphates]], was traced by Muslim geographers back to the Philistines of the Bible.&lt;ref name=Lassnerp54&gt;Lassner and Troen, 2007, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the name &quot;Palestine&quot; in English became more common after the European renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Krämer (2008) ''A History of Palestine: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Founding of the State of Israel'' Translated by Gudrun Krämer and Graham Harman Princeton University Press, ISBN 0-691-11897-3 p 16&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially revived by the British after the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and applied to the territory that was placed under [[British Mandate for Palestine|The Palestine Mandate]].

Some other terms that have been used to refer to all or part of this land include [[Canaan]], [[Greater Israel]], [[Greater Syria]], the [[Holy Land]], [[Iudaea Province]], [[Judea]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761579829 Judea]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel]], &quot;Israel HaShlema&quot;, [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Land of Israel]] (Eretz Yisrael or Ha'aretz), [[Zion]], ''Retenu'' (Ancient Egyptian), [[Southern Syria]], and [[Syria Palestina]].

{{Main|History of Palestine}} {{Further|Time periods in the region of Palestine}}

=== Overview ===
Situated at a strategic location between [[Egypt]], [[Greater Syria|Syria]] and [[Arabia]], and the birthplace of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous different peoples, including [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Canaan|Canaanites]], [[Israelites]], [[Assyrians]], [[Babylonians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Sunni]] [[Arab Caliphate]]s, the [[Shia]] [[Fatimid Caliphate]], [[Crusaders]], [[Ayyubids]], [[Mameluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] and modern [[Israelis]] and [[Palestinians]]. Modern archaeologists and historians of the region refer to their field of study as [[Syro-Palestinian archaeology]].

=== Ancient period ===
[[File:Palestine 1020BC Smith 1915.jpg|thumb|200px|Depiction of Biblical Palestine in c.1020 BCE according to [[George Adam Smith]]'s 1915 ''Atlas of the Historical Geography of the Holy Land''. Smith's book was used as a reference by [[Lloyd George]] during the negotiations for the [[British Mandate for Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yqk3XE196GsC&amp;pg=PA33 |title=The Legal Foundation and Borders Of Israel Under International Law, Howard Grief |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and [[civilization]]. During the [[Bronze Age]], independent [[Canaan]]ite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Crete, and Syria. Between 1550–1400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]] who held power until the 1178 BCE [[Battle of Djahy|Battle of Djahy (Canaan)]] during the wider [[Bronze Age collapse]]. The [[Philistines]] arrived and mingled with the local population, and according to Biblical tradition, the [[United Monarchy|United Kingdom of Israel]] was established in 1020 BCE and split within a century to form the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], and the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]]. The region became part of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] from c.740 BCE, which was itself replaced by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in c.627 BCE. According to the Bible, a war with Egypt culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and the local leaders of the region of Judea were [[Babylonian captivity|deported to Babylonia]]. In 539 BCE, the Babylonian empire was replaced by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. According to the [[bible]] and implications from the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], the exiled population of Judea was allowed to [[The Return to Zion|return to Jerusalem]].

=== Classical antiquity ===
[[File:Palestine, Ptolemy, Claude R Conder, 1889.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Palestine in c.100CE according to [[Ptolemy]] (map by [[Claude Reignier Conder]] of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]])]]
In the [[330s BCE]], Macedonian ruler [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region, and the region changed hands numerous times during the [[wars of the Diadochi]]. ultimately joining the [[Seleucid Empire]] between 219–200 BCE. In 116 BCE, a Seleucid civil war resulted in the independence of certain regions including the minor [[Hasmonean]] principality in the [[Judean Mountains]]. From 110 BCE, the [[Hasmoneans]] extended their authority over much of Palestine, creating a [[Judean]]-[[Samaritan]]-[[Idumaean]]-[[Ituraean]]-[[Galilean]] alliance. The Judean (Jewish, see [[Ioudaioi]]) control over the wider region resulted in it also becoming known as [[Judaea]], a term which had previously only referred to the smaller region of the [[Judean Mountains]]. Between 73-63 BCE, the [[Roman Republic]] extended its influence in to the region in the [[Third Mithridatic War]], conquering of Judea in 63 BCE, and splitting the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts. The three year [[Ministry of Jesus]], culminating in his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], is estimated to have occurred from 28–30 CE, although the [[historicity of Jesus]] is disputed by scholars. In 70 CE, [[Titus]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|sacked Jerusalem]], resulting in the dispersal of the city's Jews and Christians to [[Yavne]] and [[Pella]]. In 132 CE, [[Hadrian]] joined the province of Iudaea with [[Galilee]] to form new province of [[Syria Palaestina]], and Jerusalem was renamed &quot;[[Aelia Capitolina]]&quot;. Between 259–272, the region fell under the rule of [[Odaenathus]] as King of the [[Palmyrene Empire]]. Following the victory of Christian emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in the [[Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy (306–324)]], the Christianization of the Roman Empire began, and in 326, [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s mother [[Saint Helena]] visited [[Jerusalem]] and began the construction of churches and shrines. Palestine became a center of [[Christianity]], attracting numerous monks and religious scholars. The [[Samaritan Revolts]] during this period caused their near extinction. In 614 CE, Palestine was annexed by another Persian dynasty; the [[Sassanids]], until returning to Byzantine control in 628 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Greatrex-Lieu(2002), II, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:White to.jpg|thumb|upright|Tower of Ramla, constructed in 1318]]
Palestine was conquered by the Islamic Empire, beginning in 634 CE. In 636 CE, the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] symbolized the complete Muslim takeover of the region, which was regarded as Bilad a-Sham (Greater Syria). The word 'Arab at the time referred to Bedouin, nomads with an Arabian ancestry. The local population, engaged in farming, which was considered demeaning, were called ''Nabaț,'' referring to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] speaking villagers. A [[hadith|ḥadīth]], brought in the name of a Muslim freedman who settled in Palestine ordered them not to settle in the villages, for he who abides in villages it is as if he abides in graves.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Moshe Gil]], ''A History of Palestine, 634-1099,'' Cambridge University Press, 1997 pp. 134–136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 661 CE, with the assassination of [[Ali]], [[Muawiyah I]] became the uncontested Caliph of the Islamic World after being crowned in [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Dome of the Rock]], completed in 691,  was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Brown,''A New Introduction to Islam,'' Wiley-Blackwell, 2nd.ed. 2011 p.122:'the first great Islamic architectural achievement.'&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Umayyad]] were replaced by the [[Abbasids]] in 750. [[Ramla]], the major city, became the administrative centre for the following centuries. Tiberias became a thriving centre of Muslim scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moshe Gil]], ''A History of Palestine, 634–1099,'' Cambridge University Press, 1997 p.329.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 878 Palestine was ruled from Egypt by semi-autonomous rulers for almost a century, beginning with the Turkish freeman [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], for whom both Jews and Christians prayed when he lay dying &lt;ref&gt;Gil, ''A History of Palestine,'' pp.306ff. and p.307  n.71; p.308 n.73&lt;/ref&gt;  and ending with the [[Ikhshidid]] rulers, characterized by persecution of Christians as the threat from Byzantium grew.&lt;ref&gt;Gil, ''A History of Palestine,'' p.324.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Fatimid]]s, with a predominantly [[Berber people|Berber]] army, invaded the region in 970, a date that marks the beginning of a period of unceasing warfare between numerous enemies, which destroyed Palestine, and in particular devastating its Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Gil, ''A History of Palestine,'' p.336.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1073 Palestine was captured by the [[Great Seljuq Empire]], only to be recaptured by the [[Fatimid]]s in 1098, who then lost the region to the [[Crusaders]] in 1099. Their control of Jerusalem and most of Palestine lasted almost a century until defeat by [[Saladin]]'s forces in 1187, after which most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids. A rump crusader state in the northern coastal cities survived for another century, but, despite seven further crusades the crusaders were no longer a significant power in the region. The [[Fourth Crusade]] led directly to the decline of the [[Byzantine Empire]], dramatically reducing Christian influence throughout the region. 

The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was indirectly created in [[Egypt]] as a result of the [[Seventh Crusade]]. The [[Mongol Empire]] reached Palestine for the first time in 1260, beginning with the [[Mongol raids into Palestine]] under [[Nestorian Christian]] general [[Kitbuqa]] and reaching an apex at the pivotal [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the [[Ottoman Turks]] in a battle for control over western Asia and the Ottomans captured Palestine in 1516.

In 1830, on the eve of [[Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s invasion, the [[Ottoman Porte]] transferred control of the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. According to Silverburg, in regional and cultural terms this move was important for creating an Arab Palestine detached from Syria (''bilad al-Shams''). According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of Muhammad Ali's invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford R.

The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of [[Zionist]] immigration and the [[Revival of the Hebrew language]]. The movement was publicly supported by [[Great Britain]] during [[World War I]] with the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. 

The British began their [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] in 1915. The war reached [[Palestine_campaign#Southern_Palestine_Campaign_begins|southern Palestine in 1917]] progressing to Gaza and around [[Palestine_campaign#Jerusalem_Campaign_November.E2.80.93December_1917|Jerusalem by the end of the year]] 

The British [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|secured Jerusalem in December 1917]]. The British moved into the Jordan valley [[Occupation_of_the_Jordan_Valley_(1918)|in 1918]] and a campaign by the Entente into northern Palestine led to victory at [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Megiddo in September]].

The British were formally awarded [[British Mandate for Palestine|the mandate to govern the region]] in 1922. The non-Jewish Palestinians revolted in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]], [[1929 Palestine riots|1929]] and [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936]]. In 1947, following [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], the British Government announced their desire to terminate the Mandate, and the [[United Nations]] [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] voted to [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition]] the territory into a Jewish state and an Arab state. The Jewish leadership accepted the proposal but the Arab Higher Committee rejected it; a [[1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] began immediately, and [[Israel]] was declared in 1948. The [[1948 Palestinian exodus|700,000 Palestinians]] who fled or were driven from their homes were unable to return following the [[Lausanne Conference, 1949]]. In the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], Israel captured and incorporated a further 26% of the Mandate territory, Jordan [[Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|captured the region today known as the West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] was [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|captured by Egypt]]. In the course of the [[Six Day War]] in June 1967, Israel captured the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of [[Israeli settlement]]s. From 1987 to 1993, the [[First Intifada|First Palestinian Intifada]] against Israel took place, ending with the [[1993 Oslo Peace Accords]]. In 2000, the Second or [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] began, and Israel built a [[Israeli West Bank barrier|security barrier]]. Following  [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004]], it withdrew all settlers and most of the military presence from the Gaza strip, but maintained control of the air space and coast.

== Boundaries ==
The boundaries of Palestine have varied throughout history.&lt;ref name=Note1&gt;According to the Jewish Encyclopedia published between 1901 and 1906: &quot;Palestine extends, from 31° to 33° 20′ N. latitude. Its southwest point (at Raphia = Tell Rifaḥ, southwest of Gaza) is about 34° 15′ E. longitude, and its northwest point (mouth of the Liṭani) is at 35° 15′ E. longitude, while the course of the Jordan reaches 35° 35′ to the east. The west-Jordan country has, consequently, a length of about 150 English miles from north to south, and a breadth of about 23 miles at the north and 80 miles at the south. The area of this region, as measured by the surveyors of the English Palestine Exploration Fund, is about 6,040 square miles. The east-Jordan district is now being surveyed by the German Palästina-Verein, and although the work is not yet completed, its area may be estimated at 4,000 square miles. This entire region, as stated above, was not occupied exclusively by the Israelites, for the plain along the coast in the south belonged to the Philistines, and that in the north to the Phoenicians, while in the east-Jordan country the Israelitic possessions never extended farther than the Arnon (Wadi al-Mujib) in the south, nor did the Israelites ever settle in the most northerly and easterly portions of the plain of Bashan. To-day the number of inhabitants does not exceed 650,000. Palestine, and especially the Israelitic state, covered, therefore, a very small area, approximating that of the state of Vermont.&quot; From the Jewish Encyclopedia [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=31&amp;letter=P&amp;search=palestine#133 Boundaries and Extent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Note2&gt;According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1911), [http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tim_Starling/ScanSet_TIFF_demo&amp;vol=20&amp;page=ED0A639] Palestine is:

:&quot;[A] geographical name of rather loose application. Etymological strictness would require it to denote exclusively the narrow strip of coast-land once occupied by the Philistines, from whose name it is derived. It is, however, conventionally used as a name for the territory which, in the Old Testament, is claimed as the inheritance of the pre-exilic Hebrews; thus it may be said generally to denote the southern third of the province of Syria.
:Except in the west, where the country is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea, the limit of this territory cannot be laid down on the map as a definite line. The modern subdivisions under the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire are in no sense conterminous with those of antiquity, and hence do not afford a boundary by which Palestine can be separated exactly from the rest of Syria in the north, or from the Sinaitic and Arabian deserts in the south and east; nor are the records of ancient boundaries sufficiently full and definite to make possible the complete demarcation of the country. Even the convention above referred to is inexact: it includes the Philistine territory, claimed but never settled by the Hebrews, and excludes the outlying parts of the large area claimed in Num. xxxiv. as the Hebrew possession (from the &quot; River of Egypt &quot; to Hamath). However, the Hebrews themselves have preserved, in the proverbial expression &quot; from Dan to Beersheba &quot; (Judg. xx.i, &amp;c.), an indication of the normal north-and-south limits of their land; and in defining the area of the country under discussion it is this indication which is generally followed.
:Taking as a guide the natural features most nearly corresponding to these outlying points, we may describe Palestine as the strip of land extending along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea from the mouth of the Litany or Kasimiya River (33° 20' N.) southward to the mouth of the Wadi Ghuzza; the latter joins the sea in 31° 28' N., a short distance south of Gaza, and runs thence in a south-easterly direction so as to include on its northern side the site of Beersheba. Eastward there is no such definite border. The River Jordan, it is true, marks a line of [[delimitation]] between Western and Eastern Palestine; but it is practically impossible to say where the latter ends and the Arabian desert begins. Perhaps the line of the pilgrim road from Damascus to Mecca is the most convenient possible boundary. The total length of the region is about {{convert|140|m|2|abbr=on}}; its breadth west of the Jordan ranges from about {{convert|23|m|2|abbr=on}} in the north to about {{convert|80|m|2|abbr=on}} in the south.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jordan Rift Valley]] (comprising Wadi Arabah, the [[Dead Sea]] and [[River Jordan]]) has at times formed a political and administrative frontier, even within [[empire]]s that have controlled both territories. At other times, such as during certain periods during the [[Hasmonean]] and [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader]] states for example, as well as during the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|biblical period]], territories on both sides of the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the [[Arab]] [[Caliphate]] period, parts of southern [[Lebanon]] and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as ''[[Jund al-Urdunn|Jund al-Urdun]]'', while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of ''[[Jund Dimashq]]'', which during the ninth century was attached to the administrative unit of ''[[Jund Filasteen]]'' ({{lang-ar|جند فلسطين}}).&lt;ref name=Salibi&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Modern History of Jordan''|author=Kamal Suleiman Salibi|publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=1993|pages=17–18|isbn=1-86064-331-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of the area and the ethnic nature of the people referred to by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE as Palaestina vary according to context. Sometimes, he uses it to refer to the coast north of [[Mount Carmel]]. Elsewhere, distinguishing the Syrians in Palestine from the Phoenicians, he refers to their land as extending down all the coast from Phoenicia to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' Bk.7.89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], writing in [[Latin language|Latin]] in the 1st century CE, describes a region of Syria that was &quot;formerly called ''Palaestina''&quot; among the areas of the Eastern Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' V.66 and 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Byzantine Period, the Byzantine borders of ''Palaestina'' (''I'' and ''II'', also known as ''Palaestina Prima'', &quot;First Palestine&quot;, and ''Palaestina Secunda'', &quot;Second Palestine&quot;), have served as a name for the geographic area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Under Arab rule, ''Filastin'' (or ''Jund Filastin'') was used administratively to refer to what was under the Byzantines ''Palaestina Secunda'' (comprising [[Judaea and Samaria]]), while ''Palaestina Prima'' (comprising the [[Galilee]] region) was renamed ''Urdunn'' (&quot;Jordan&quot; or ''Jund al-Urdunn'').&lt;ref name=Sharonp4/&gt;

Nineteenth century sources refer to Palestine as extending from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route east of the Jordan River valley. Others refer to it as extending from the sea to the desert. Prior to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] victory in World War I and the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], which created the British mandate in the [[Levant]], most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Vilayet of Damascus]] ([[Syria]]), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the [[Vilayet of Hejaz]]. What later became part of British Mandate Palestine was in Ottoman times divided between the [[Vilayet of Beirut]] ([[Lebanon]]) and the [[Sanjak of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Palestinim, Am Behivatsrut,&quot; by Kimmerling, Baruch, and Joel S.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Palestine}}

=== Early demographics ===
Estimating the population of Palestine in antiquity relies on two methods – censuses and writings made at the times, and the scientific method based on excavations and statistical methods that consider the number of settlements at the particular age, area of each settlement, density factor for each settlement.

According to Magen Broshi, an [[Israeli archaeology|Israeli archaeologist]] &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the population of Palestine in antiquity did not exceed a million persons. It can also be shown, moreover, that this was more or less the size of the population in the peak period—the late [[Byzantine]] period, around AD 600&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Magen Broshi, The Population of Western Palestine in the Roman-Byzantine Period, ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', No. 236, p.7, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study by Yigal Shiloh of [[The Hebrew University]] suggests that the population of Palestine in the Iron Age could have never exceeded a million. He writes: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the population of the country in the Roman-Byzantine period greatly exceeded that in the Iron Age...If we accept Broshi's population estimates, which appear to be confirmed by the results of recent research, it follows that the estimates for the population during the Iron Age must be set at a lower figure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yigal Shiloh, The Population of Iron Age Palestine in the Light of a Sample Analysis of Urban Plans, Areas, and Population Density, ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', No. 239, p.33, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late Ottoman and British Mandate periods ===
[[File:Palestine, by S Munk, Vilna 1913.jpg|thumb|250px|''Palestine'', by S. Munk, Vilna 1913.]]
In the middle of the 1st century of the Ottoman rule, i.e. 1550 AD, [[Bernard Lewis]] in a study of Ottoman registers of the early Ottoman Rule of Palestine reports:&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, Studies in the Ottoman Archives—I, ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 469–501, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a general picture of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of [[Jerusalem]], [[Gaza]], [[Safed]], [[Nablus]], [[Ramla|Ramle]], and [[Hebron]]. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants, living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Alexander Scholch, the population of Palestine in 1850 had about 350,000 inhabitants, 30% of whom lived in 13 towns; roughly 85% were Muslims, 11% were Christians and 4% Jews&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/view/00207438/ap010071/01a00050/0 Scholch], 1985, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] statistics studied by [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]],&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, 1990, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; the population of Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of which 94% were [[Arabs]]. In 1914 Palestine had a population of 657,000 Muslim Arabs, 81,000 Christian Arabs, and 59,000 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy estimates the non-Jewish population of Palestine at 452,789 in 1882, 737,389 in 1914, 725,507 in 1922, 880,746 in 1931 and 1,339,763 in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, 1990, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the League of Nations' ''Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine'' stated that there were 700,000 people living in Palestine:

{{quote|Of these 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or—a small number—are Protestants.

The Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/349b02280a930813052565e90048ed1c!OpenDocument Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1948, the population had risen to 1,900,000, of whom 68% were Arabs, and 32% were Jews ([[UNSCOP]] report, including [[bedouin]]).

According to Palestinian evaluations, The [[West Bank]] is inhabited by approximately 2.4 million [[Palestinians]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] by another 1.4 million.

According to these Israeli and Palestinian estimates, the total population in Israel and the Palestinian Territories stands between  9.8 and 10.8 million.

Jordan has a population of around 6,000,000 (2007 estimate).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070411092217/http://encarta.msn.com/fact_631504791/Jordan_Facts_and_Figures.html Jordan: Facts &amp; Figures], accessed 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jo.html CIA World Factbook], accessed 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Long term Palestinian war refugees constitute approximately half of this number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=66302 Assessment for Palestinians in Jordan], Minorities at Risk, accessed 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
