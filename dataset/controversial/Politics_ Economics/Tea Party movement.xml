==Agenda==
According to the New York Times, &quot;The Tea Party agenda is not well defined, though it is anti-government, anti-spending, anti-immigration and anti-compromise politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27iht-letter.html Tea Party Doesn't Need Votes to Win U.S. Elections]; New York Times; September 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur C. Brooks]], president of the [[American Enterprise Institute]], a conservative think tank, America is locked in a culture war between the country as being an &quot;exceptional nation organized around the principles of free enterprise—limited government, a reliance on entrepreneurship and rewards determined by market forces&quot; or as a country determined by &quot;European-style statism&quot;. Brooks states that while some have tried to criticize the tea party, they are part of an ideological movement to preserve the former and oppose the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/21/AR2010052101854.html?sid=ST2010052103072 |title=America's new culture war: Free enterprise vs. government control |author=Arthur C. Brooks |work=The Washington Post |date=May 23, 2010 |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ned Ryun]], president of [[American Majority]], an organization that offers training for many Tea Party activists, believes this movement is not about political parties, stating, &quot;It's very much anti-establishment at both parties&amp;nbsp;... They don't care about party labels.&quot; He has also said that &quot;I think we're getting to the point where you can truly say we're entering a post-party era. They aren't going to be necessarily wed to a certain party—they want to see leadership that reflects their values first&amp;nbsp;... They don't care what party you're in; they just want to know if you reflect their values—limited government, fixing the economy.&quot;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/21/mass.independent.vote/index.html?iref=allsearch |title=Independents' anger in Massachusetts a sign of things to come? |first=Ed |last=Hornick |publisher=CNN |date=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract from America===
{{Main|Contract from America}}
The Contract from America was the idea of Houston-based lawyer Ryan Hecker. He stated that he developed the concept of creating a [[grassroots]] call for reform prior to the April 15, 2009, Tax Day Tea Party rallies. To promote his idea, he launched a website, ContractFromAmerica.com, which encouraged people to offer possible [[Party platform|planks]] for the contract.

# '''Identify constitutionality of every new law''': Require each bill to identify the specific provision of the Constitution that gives Congress the power to do what the bill does (82.03%).
# '''Reject emissions trading''': Stop the [[Emissions trading|&quot;cap and trade&quot;]] administrative approach used to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants. (72.20%).
# '''Demand a balanced federal budget''': Begin the Constitutional amendment process to require a balanced budget with a two-thirds majority needed for any tax modification. (69.69%)
# '''Simplify the tax system''': Adopt a simple and fair single-rate tax system by scrapping the internal revenue code and replacing it with one that is no longer than 4,543 words&amp;nbsp;– the length of the original Constitution. (64.9%).
# '''Audit federal government agencies for constitutionality''': Create a Blue Ribbon taskforce that engages in an audit of federal agencies and programs, assessing their Constitutionality, and identifying duplication, waste, ineffectiveness, and agencies and programs better left for the states or local authorities. (63.37%).
# '''Limit annual growth in federal spending''': Impose a statutory cap limiting the annual growth in total federal spending to the sum of the inflation rate plus the percentage of population growth. (56.57%).
# '''Repeal the health care legislation passed on March 23, 2010''': De-fund, repeal, and replace the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. (56.39%).
# '''Pass an &quot;all-of-the-above&quot; energy policy''': Authorize the exploration of additional energy reserves to reduce American dependence on foreign energy sources and reduce regulatory barriers to all other forms of energy creation. (55.5%).
# '''Reduce earmarks''': Place a moratorium on all [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]] until the budget is balanced, and then require a two-thirds majority to pass any earmark. (55.47%).
# '''Reduce taxes''': Permanently repeal all recent tax increases, and extend permanently the George W. Bush temporary reductions in [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]], [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax]], and [[Estate tax in the United States|estate taxes]], currently scheduled to end in 2011. (53.38%).

The [[Tea Party Patriots]] have asked both Democrats and Republicans to sign on to the Contract. No Democrats signed on, and the contract met resistance from some Republicans who since created &quot;Commitment to America&quot;. Candidates in the 2010 elections who signed the Contract from America included Utah's [[Mike Lee (Utah politician)|Mike Lee]], Nevada's [[Sharron Angle]], Sen. [[Tom Coburn|Coburn]] (R-OK), and Sen. [[Jim DeMint|DeMint]] (R-SC).&lt;ref name=&quot;supporters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete List of Signatories Running for U.S. Congress or Governor|url=http://www.thecontractfromamerica.org/repreport.aspx|accessdate=September 18, 2010|publisher=Contract from America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
{{relevance-section|reason=Ron Paul is not the Tea Party|date=September 2012}}
In an August 2010 article for ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine, Ron Paul outlined foreign policy views the Tea Party movement should emphasize: &quot;[W]e cannot stand against big government at home while supporting it abroad. We cannot talk about fiscal responsibility while spending trillions on occupying and bullying the rest of the world&amp;nbsp;... I see tremendous opportunities for movements like the Tea Party to prosper by capitalizing on the Democrats' broken promises to overturn the George W. Bush administration's civil liberties abuses and end the disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A return to the traditional U.S. foreign policy of active private engagement but government noninterventionism is the only alternative that can restore our moral and fiscal health.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A Tea Party Foreign Policy |url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/27/a_tea_party_foreign_policy |date=August 27, 2010 |first=Ron |last=Paul |authorlink=Ron Paul |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |separator=, |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Russell Mead]] analyzes the foreign policy views of the Tea Party movement in a 2011 essay published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''. Mead says that [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] populists, such as the Tea Party, combine a belief in ''[[American exceptionalism]]'' and its role in the world with skepticism of American's &quot;ability to create a liberal world order&quot;. When necessary, they favor total war and unconditional surrender over &quot;limited wars for limited goals&quot;. Mead identifies two main trends, one somewhat personified by Ron Paul and the other by Sarah Palin. &quot;Paulites&quot; have a [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]], &quot;neo-isolationist&quot; approach that seeks to avoid foreign military involvement. &quot;Palinites&quot;, while seeking to avoid being drawn into unnecessary conflicts, favor a more aggressive response to maintaining America's primacy in international relations. Mead says that both groups share a distaste for &quot;liberal internationalism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Tea Party and American Foreign Policy: What Populism Means for Globalism |first =Walter Russell |last=Mead |authorlink=Walter Russell Mead |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67455/walter-russell-mead/the-tea-party-and-american-foreign-policy |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=March/April 2011 |pages=28–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Tea Party movement is composed of a loose affiliation of national and local groups that determine their own platforms and agendas without central leadership. The Tea Party movement has been cited as an example of [[grassroots]] political activity, although it has also been described as an example of ''[[astroturfing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Rasmussen | first1 = Scott W. | last2 = Schoen | first2 = Doug | title = Mad As Hell: How the Tea Party Movement Is Fundamentally Remaking Our Two-Party System | publisher=Harper | isbn = 978-0-06-199523-1 | pages = 132–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tea Party movement is not a national political party; polls show that most Tea Partiers consider themselves to be Republicans&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallup Poll&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/141098/Tea-Party-Supporters-Overlap-Republican-Base.aspx?version=print |title=Tea Party Supporters Overlap Republican Base |date=July 2, 2010 |publisher=Gallup Poll |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/republican-party/tea-party-as-the-republican-pa.html |title=The Fix – Tea Party = Republican party? |agency=The Washington Post |date=July 6, 2010 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement's supporters have tended to endorse Republican candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Scott |last1=Rasmussen |first2=Doug |last2=Schoen |title=Mad As Hell: How the Tea Party Movement Is Fundamentally Remaking Our Two-Party System |year=2010 |page=12 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-199523-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators, including Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport, have suggested that the movement is not a new political group but simply a re-branding of traditional Republican candidates and policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallup Poll&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/25/opinion/la-oe-0725-mcmanus-column-tea-party-20100725 The GOP Takes its Tea]; ''Los Angeles Times''; July 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2263063/ Five Myths About the Tea Party] Slate; August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An October 2010 ''Washington Post'' canvass of local Tea Party organizers found 87% saying &quot;dissatisfaction with mainstream Republican Party leaders&quot; was &quot;an important factor in the support the group has received so far&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;agwpostface&quot;/&gt;

The Tea Party movement's membership includes notable [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians [[Ron Paul]], his son [[Rand Paul]], [[Sarah Palin]], [[Dick Armey]], and [[Michele Bachmann]].

The name &quot;Tea Party&quot; is a reference to the [[Boston Tea Party]], a protest by colonists who objected to a British tax on tea in 1773 and demonstrated by dumping British tea taken from docked ships into the harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jill |last=Lepore |title=The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle over American History |year=2010 |pages=77–79 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have referred to the ''Tea'' in &quot;Tea Party&quot; as the [[backronym]] &quot;Taxed Enough Already&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schroeder |first=Anne |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/anneschroeder/0409/TEA__Taxed_Enough_Already.html |title= T.E.A. = Taxed Enough Already |publisher=Politico.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCnjT8ORAM This World: Tea Party America, BBC 2, November 1, 2010]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fox News]] commentator [[Juan Williams]] argues that the Tea Party movement emerged from the &quot;ashes&quot; of [[Ron Paul]]'s 2008 presidential primary campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/05/10/juan-williams-surprising-rise-rep-ron-paul/ |publisher=Fox News | title=Juan Williams: The Surprising Rise of Rep.

===Early local protest events===
Perhaps the first &quot;Tea Party&quot; event on record was an event for Ron Paul dubbed &quot;Boston TeaParty07&quot; on December 16, 2007.  This event included the throwing of boxes labeled &quot;tea&quot; and &quot;IRS&quot; among others, into the bay.  This event was also notable in making online &quot;Money Bomb&quot; history as the largest one-day fundraising event at $6.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2007/12/ron_pauls_tea_p.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2009, Trevor Leach, chairman of the [[Young Americans for Liberty]] in New York State organized a &quot;Tea Party&quot; to protest [[Fat tax|obesity taxes]] proposed by New York Governor [[David Paterson]] and call for fiscal responsibility on the part of the government. Several of the protesters wore Native American headdresses similar to the band of 18th century colonists who dumped tea in Boston Harbor to express outrage about British taxes.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, Neil (January 24, 2009).

According to pollster [[Scott Rasmussen]], the bailouts of banks by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush]] and [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama]] administrations triggered the Tea Party's rise. The interviewer{{clarify|date=September 2011}} added that the movement's anger centers on two issues, quoting Rasmussen as saying, &quot;They think federal spending, deficits and taxes are too high, and they think no one in Washington is listening to them, and that latter point is really, really important.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Weil, [http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/ScottRasmussenReportspollster/2010/09/18/id/370770 &quot;Rasmussen: Tea Party Shows Weakness of GOP Establishment&quot;], Newsmax.com, September 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 election===
In 2010 Tea Party-endorsed candidates upset established Republicans in several primaries, such as Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Nevada, New York, South Carolina, and Utah, giving a new momentum to the conservative cause in the 2010 elections. In the 2010 midterm elections, ''The New York Times'' identified 138 candidates for Congress with significant Tea Party support, and reported that all of them were running as Republicans—of whom 129 were running for the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and 9 for the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Kate Zernike, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/us/politics/15teaparty.html?_r=1&amp;hp &quot;Tea Party Set to Win Enough Races for Wide Influence&quot;] ''The New York Times'', October 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal''–NBC News poll in mid October showed 35% of likely voters were Tea-party supporters, and they favored the Republicans by 84% to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Weisman, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303550904575562493014465942.html?mod=WSJ_hps_MIDDLESecondNews &quot;GOP in Lead in Final Lap&quot;] ''Wall Street Journal, October 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some question the effectiveness of the Tea Party to endorse candidates; according to Alexandra Moe, only 32% of the candidates that were backed by the Tea Party, or were on a ballot line with a &quot;Tea Party&quot; name, won the election. Especially the Tea-party backed Senate Republican nominees for: [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 2010|Colorado]], [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|Nevada]] and [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2010|Delaware]], who had all defeated &quot;establishment&quot; Republicans that were expected to win the Senate races. The three Senate nominees were seen by many in America and the media as either amateurs or too far-out there to be electable as their positions on certain aspects were viewed as extreme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/09/01/4208642/commentary-todd-akin-answered.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/11/03/5403120-just-32-of-tea-party-candidates-win Just 32% of Tea Party candidates win]&quot;, MSNBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local tea party groups, like the Racine tea party, and national groups, such as Americans for Prosperity, have hosted dozens of rallies for Walker, recruiting volunteers from around the country and pouring in campaign donations in unparalleled numbers. Any rumors of a tea party demise have been short-lived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett |first=William |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/06/opinion/bennett-walker-victory/index.html |title=Walker's win bolsters tea party, weakens Democrats. |publisher=CNN |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of Tea Party candidate [[Richard Mourdock]] over long-time establishment incumbent Sen. [[Richard Lugar]] has put the Republican party in jeopardy of losing their once safe seat in Indiana. Polling shows Mourdock to be in a statistical tie with Democratic challenger Rep.

Whilst in [[Missouri]], a seat that the GOP needs to win in order to retake the Senate and where the Incumbent Senator [[Claire McCaskill]] is seen as very vulnerable, the Republican nominee [[Todd Akin]], once surging ahead of McCaskill in the polls, caused controversy with his [[Todd Akin 'legitimate rape' and pregnancy comment controversy|legitimate rape remarks]]. The once easily winnable seat for the Republicans, has now turned into a deadheat.

The tea party's involvement in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries|2012 GOP presidential primaries]] was minimal, owing to divisions over whom to endorse as well as lack of enthusiasm for all the candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;DBDec&quot;/&gt; Which is not to say the 2012 GOP ticket hasn't had an influence on the Tea Party: following the selection of [[Paul Ryan]] as [[Mitt Romney]]'s vice-presidential running mate, the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared that the once fringe of the conservative coalition, Tea Party lawmakers are now &quot;indisputably at the core of the modern Republican Party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/ryan-brings-the-tea-party-to-the-ticket/?smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;seid=auto Ryan Brings the Tea Party to the Ticket]; The New York Times; August 12, 2012; Retrieved 2012-08-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership and demographics===
Several polls have been conducted on the demographics of the movement. Though the various polls sometimes turn up slightly different results, they tend to show that Tea Party supporters are mainly [[White American|white]] and slightly more likely to be male, married, older than 45, more conservative than the general population, and likely to be more wealthy and have more education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html?src=me&amp;ref=general |title=Poll Finds Tea Party Backers Wealthier and More Educated |last=Zernike |first=Kate |coauthors=Megan Thee-Brenan |date=April 14, 2010 |work=New York Times |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.nytimes.com/new-york-timescbs-news-poll-national-survey-of-tea-party-supporters?ref=politics National Survey of Tea Party Supporters] ''New York Times''/CBS News Poll; April 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G2000_B02001&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-SubjectID=15233308|title= Data Set: 2008 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |work=Survey: American Community Survey |author=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vogel1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=8E3F7732-18FE-70B2-A8C52111DA960902 |title=Poll: Tea Partiers Like GOP |first=Kenneth P. |last=Vogel |publisher=Politico |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;quinnipiac1&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1436 |title=Tea Party Could Hurt GOP In Congressional Races, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Dems Trail 2-Way Races, But Win If Tea Party Runs |publisher=Quinnipiac University |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Atlantic]]'', the three main groups that provide guidance and organization for the protests, [[FreedomWorks]], [[dontGO]], and Americans for Prosperity, state that the demonstrations are an organic movement.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/04/the-tea-party-movement-whos-in-charge/13041/ |title=The Tea Party Movement: Who's In Charge? |first=Chris |last=Good | date=April 13, 2000 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law professor and commentator [[Glenn Reynolds]], best known as author of the [[Instapundit]] political blog, argued in the ''[[New York Post]]'' that: &quot;These aren't the usual semiprofessional protesters who attend [[antiwar]] and pro-union marches.

&quot;Tea Party supporters&quot;, says Patrik Jonsson of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', &quot;have been called neo-Klansmen and knuckle-dragging hillbillies&quot;. Jonsson adds, &quot;demonizing tea party activists tends to energize the Democrats' left-of-center base&quot;. He notes that &quot;polls suggest that tea party activists are not only more mainstream than many critics suggest, but that a majority of them are women (primarily mothers), not angry white men&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jonsson040310&gt;Patrik Jonsson, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0403/Amid-harsh-criticisms-tea-party-slips-into-the-mainstream &quot;Amid harsh criticisms, 'tea party' slips into the mainstream] ''Christian Science Monitor'', April 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Jonsson quotes [[Juan Williams]] saying that Tea Party's opposition to health reform was based on self-interest rather than racism.&lt;ref name=Jonsson040310/&gt;

A [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll conducted in March 2010 found that—other than gender, income and politics—self-described Tea Party members were demographically similar to the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/127181/tea-partiers-fairly-mainstream-demographics.aspx |title=Tea Partiers Are Fairly Mainstream in Their Demographics |publisher=Gallup.com |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When surveying supporters or participants of the Tea Party movement, polls have shown that they are to a very great extent more likely to be registered Republican, have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party and an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;quinnipiac1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=CBS/NY Times Poll: National Survey of Tea Party Supporters|url=http://documents.nytimes.com/new-york-timescbs-news-poll-national-survey-of-tea-party-supporters?ref=politics|work=New York Times |date=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WinstonPoll/&gt;
The [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg National Poll]] of adults 18 and over showed that 40% of Tea Party supporters are 55 or older, compared with 32% of all poll respondents; 79% are white, 61% are men and 44% identify as &quot;[[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christians]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;bloomberg 03-2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aLBZwxqgYgwI&amp;pos=8 |title=Tea Party Advocates Who Scorn Socialism Want a Government Job |last=Przybyla |first=Heidi |date=March 26, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with 75%,&lt;ref&gt;This number includes [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans]].

According to Susan Page and Naomi Jagoda of ''USA Today'' in 2010, the Tea Party was more &quot;a frustrated state of mind&quot; than &quot;a classic political movement&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;PageNaomi&quot;&gt;Page Susan; Jagoda Naomi (July 1, 2010).

===Polling of supporters===
An October 2010 ''Washington Post'' canvass of local Tea Party organizers found 99% said &quot;concern about the economy&quot; was an &quot;important factor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;agwpostface&quot;/&gt;  Various polls have also probed Tea Party supporters for their views on a variety of political and controversial issues. On the question of whether they think their own income taxes this year are fair, 52% of Tea Party supporters told pollsters for [[CBS]]/''New York Times'' that they were, versus 62% in the general population (including tea party supporters).&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt; A [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]] poll found that Tea Partiers are not against increased government action in all cases. &quot;The ideas that find nearly universal agreement among Tea Party supporters are rather vague,&quot; says J. Ann Selzer, the pollster who created the survey. &quot;You would think any idea that involves more government action would be anathema, and that is just not the case.&quot;

In advance of a new edition of their book ''American Grace'', political scientists David E. Campbell of Notre Dame and [[Robert D. Putnam]] of Harvard published in a ''[[The New York Times]]'' opinion the results of their research into the political attitudes and background of Tea Party supporters.  Using a pre-Tea Party poll in 2006 and going back to the same respondents in 2011, they found the supporters to be not &quot;nonpartisan political neophytes&quot; as often described, but largely &quot;overwhelmingly partisan Republicans&quot; who were politically active prior to the Tea Party.  The survey found Tea Party supporters &quot;no more likely than anyone else&quot; to have suffered hardship during the [[2007–present recession in the United States|2007-2010 recession]]. Additionally, the respondents were more concerned about &quot;putting God in government&quot; than with trying to shrink government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Campbell, David E. and Putnam, Robert D.|title=Crashing the Tea Party|date=August 16, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 17, 2011|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/opinion/crashing-the-tea-party.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=God&gt;David E.

The [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]] demonstrated considerable skepticism within the Tea Party movement with respect to the dangers and the reality of [[global warming]]. A ''New York Times''/CBS News Poll during the election revealed that only a small percentage of Tea Party supporters considered global warming a serious problem, much less than the portion of the general public that does. The Tea Party is strongly opposed to government-imposed limits on carbon dioxide emissions as part of [[emissions trading]] legislation to encourage use of fuels that emit less [[Carbon emissions|carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;John M.

Many of the movement's members also favor stricter measures against [[illegal immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/10/AR2010081003383.html {{&quot;'}}Tea party' groups plan Arizona rally against illegal immigration&quot;], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership and groups===
An October 2010 ''Washington Post'' canvass of 647 local Tea Party organizers asked &quot;which national figure best represents your groups?&quot; and got the following responses: no one 34%, [[Sarah Palin]] 14%, [[Glenn Beck]] 7%, [[Jim DeMint]] 6%, [[Ron Paul]] 6%, [[Michele Bachmann]] 4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;agwpostface&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/tea-party-canvass/ Tea Party canvass results, Category: &quot;What They Believe&quot; A Party Face] ''Washington Post'' October 24, 2010.

==Ground game and Get Out The Vote (GOTV) efforts==

===Tea Party ground game/GOTV before 2012===
[[File:Scott P. Brown.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Scott Brown on the campaign trail.]]
The Tea Party began life as a protest movement, not as an organization that works on political ground games or Get Out The Vote (GOTV) efforts.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} One of the first national signs of the Tea Party's efforts to organize voters came with the election of [[Scott Brown]] in the contest to fill the remaining two-year term of the late Sen.

On November 2, 2010 [[Fox News]] reported that the Democrats did not dispute expectations that they would lose the House, and that their vaunted campaign operation faced a less polished ground game infused with the energy of the new Tea Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/02/voters-poised-punish-democrats-ballot-box/|title=Control of Congress at Stake on Election Day|publisher=FOX News|date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tea Party helped deliver to Democrats what President Obama called a &quot;shellacking&quot; in the mid-term elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson |first=David|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/11/obamas-shellacking----how-badly-will-it-bruise-his-agenda/1#.UC9gViqF-K4|title=Obama's 'shellacking' -- how badly will it bruise his agenda|publisher=USA Today|date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 2010, [[FreedomWorks]] announced the national rollout of “FreedomConnect” which they touted as a &quot;grassroots action center that will revolutionize the ways in which FreedomWorks members, 9/12ers and tea party groups across the country communicate and organize in 2011 and beyond.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bodnar |first=Jacqueline|url=http://www.freedomworks.org/press-releases/freedomworks-launches-tea-party-action-center-“fre|title=FreedomWorks Launches Tea Party Action Center &quot;FreedomConnect&quot; In Ohio|publisher=FreedomWorks|date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the election cycle, Democratic allies had expressed confidence in the strength of their own ground game. In September 2011, [[Teamsters]] President [[James P. Hoffa|Jimmy Hoffa]] delivering a speech to introduce President [[Obama]] to the gathered crowd, said &quot;We got to keep an eye on the battle that we face: The war on workers.

When challenging GOP &quot;establishment&quot; opponents, the Tea Party faced opposing ground games of various size and sophistication. In Texas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst hired &quot;ground game expert&quot; Kevin Lindley, who had run Gov. [[Rick Perry]]'s campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Root|first=Jay|url=http://www.texastribune.org/texas-politics/2012-elections/ricks-perry-senate-race/|title=Risks For Perry In Senate Race|publisher=Texas Weekly |date=2011-07-13|accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Indiana [[Richard Lugar]] no longer lived in the state and developed a reputation for being out of touch with voters there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Writer|first=Staff|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Senate/2012/0509/In-Richard-Lugar-defeat-a-tea-party-road-map-for-revamping-Washington|title=In Richard Lugar defeat, a tea party road map for revamping Washington?|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=2011-05-09|accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tea Party shifts focus from demonstrations to ground game/GOTV ===
The ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted in July 2012 that the Tea Party &quot;is no longer the rising tsunami it appeared to be in 2010. Largely gone are the disorderly rallies, colonial-era costumes and fixations on fringe issues, such as the provenance of the president’s birth certificate. Instead, the movement has retooled into a loosely organized network of field operations that, as in Texas, pushes Republicans toward more strident conservative positions and candidates, while supplying ground troops across the country for candidates and big-money conservative groups, such as the [[Club for Growth]] and [[Americans for Prosperity]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;retool&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Blackmon |first=Douglas |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tea-party-retools-itself-pushing-republicans-toward-more-strident-conservative-positions/2012/07/30/gJQAGuG1KX_print.html|title=Tea party retools as network of field operatives, keeps pushing GOP rightward|publisher=Washington Post |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of term &quot;teabagger&quot;===
The term ''[[wikt:teabagger|teabagger]]'' was initially used to refer to Tea Partiers after conservatives used ''tea bag'' as a verb on protest signs and websites.  Shortly thereafter, some started using the phrase mockingly, alluding to the [[Tea bag (sexual act)|sexual connotation of the term]] when referring to Tea Party protesters. Most conservatives do not, for the most part, use the term with its [[double entendre]] meaning; rather it seems the political left has adopted the joke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonindependent.com/31868/scenes-from-the-new-american-tea-party &quot;Scenes from the New American Tea Party&quot;] Washington Independent, February 27, 2009; Retrieved April 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Koppelman [http://web.archive.org/web/20100712033549/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2009/04/14/teabagging_guide Your guide to teabagging] Salon.com; April 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;[http://theweek.com/article/index/202620/the-evolution-of-the-word-tea-bagger The evolution of the word 'tea bagger']; The Week; May 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been used by several media outlets to humorously refer to Tea Party-affiliated protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/16/cable-anchors-guests-use-tea-parties-platform-frat-house-humor/ |title=Cable Anchors, Guests Use Tea Parties as Platform for Frat House Humor |publisher=FOX News |date=April 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservatives initially embraced the term, and some have since advocated that the non-vulgar meaning of the word be reclaimed.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;/&gt;  [[Grant Barrett]], co-host of the ''&quot;[[A Way with Words]]&quot;'' radio program, has listed ''teabagger'' as a 2009 buzzword meaning, &quot;a derogatory name for attendees of Tea Parties, probably coined in allusion to a sexual practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/weekinreview/20buzz.html The Buzzwords of 2009] By MARK LEIBOVICH and GRANT BARRETT,  December 19, 2009, [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries on the movement==

===Commentary by the Obama administration===

On April 29, 2009, Obama commented on the Tea Party protests publicly during a townhall meeting in [[Arnold, Missouri]], saying: &quot;let me just remind them that I am happy to have a serious conversation about how we are going to cut our health care costs down over the long term, how we're going to stabilize [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. [[Claire McCaskill|Claire (McCaskill)]] and I are working diligently to do basically a thorough audit of federal spending. But let's not play games and pretend that the reason is because of the recovery act, because that's just a fraction of the overall problem that we've got. We are going to have to tighten our belts, but we're going to have to do it in an intelligent way. And we've got to make sure that the people who are helped are working American families, and we're not suddenly saying that the way to do this is to eliminate programs that help ordinary people and give more tax cuts to the wealthy. We tried that formula for eight years. It did not work. And I don't intend to go back to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/29/obama_100_days_townhall_in_missouri_96272.html Obama's 100 Days Townhall in Missouri] [[Real Clear Politics]]; April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/04/29/obama-responds-to-tea-party-movement/ Obama responds to tea party movement] CNN Political Ticker; April 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2010, Obama touted his administration's tax cuts, noting the passage of 25 different tax cuts over the past year, including tax cuts for 95% of working Americans. He then remarked, &quot;So I've been a little amused over the last couple of days where people have been having these rallies about taxes. You would think they would be saying thank you. That's what you'd think.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC pol punch&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/04/obama-at-democratic-fundraiser-tea-partiers-should-be-thanking-him-for-tax-cuts.html |title=Obama at Democratic Fundraiser: Tea Partiers Should Be Thanking Him for Tax Cuts |last=Travers |first=Karen |coauthors=Rachel Martin |date=April 15, 2010 |work=Political Punch |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-dnc-reception-41510 &quot;Remarks by the President at DNC Reception, April 15, 2010&quot;] (Transcript). White House Press Office. April 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2010, at a townhall discussion sponsored by CNBC, Obama said healthy skepticism about government and spending was good, but it was not enough to just say &quot;Get control of spending&quot;, and he challenged the Tea Party movement to get specific about how they would cut government debt and spending: &quot;And so the challenge, I think, for the Tea Party movement is to identify specifically what would you do. It's not enough just to say, get control of spending. I think it's important for you to say, I'm willing to cut veterans' benefits, or I'm willing to cut Medicare or Social Security benefits, or I'm willing to see these taxes go up. What you can't do—which is what I've been hearing a lot from the other side—is say we're going to control government spending, we're going to propose $4&amp;nbsp;trillion of additional tax cuts, and that magically somehow things are going to work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/09/obama-to-tea-party-what-would-you-do/1 Obama to Tea Party: 'What would you do?'] USA Today; September 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/37814131/President-Obama-s-townhall-with-CNBC-John-Harwood-September-20-2010 President Obama's Townhall with CNBC John Harwood] Scribd Transcript; September 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|Tea Party protesters walk towards the [[United States Capitol]] during the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], September 12, 2009.]]

According to [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]], a [[progressivism|progressive]] media watchdog, there is a disparity between large coverage of the Tea Party movement and minimal coverage of larger movements. In 2009, the major Tea Party protests were quoted twice as often as the [[National Equality March]] despite a much lower turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 2010, a Tea Party protest was covered 59 times more than the [[US Social Forum]] (177 Tea Party mentions versus 3 for Social Forum) despite an attendance that was 25 times smaller in size (600 Tea Party attendees versus at least 15,000 for Social Forum).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In April 2010, responding to a question from the media watchdog group [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]] posed the previous week, [[Rupert Murdoch]], the chief executive of [[News Corporation]], which owns Fox News, said, &quot;I don't think we should be supporting the Tea Party or any other party.&quot; That same week Fox News canceled an appearance by [[Sean Hannity]] at a [[Cincinnati]] Tea Party rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/us/17fox.html |work=The New York Times |title=Fox Canceled Hannity's Attendance at Tea Party's Tax Day Rally in Cincinnati |first=Brian |last=Stelter |date=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the September 12 [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], Fox News said it was the only cable news outlet to cover the emerging protests and took out full-page ads in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' with a prominent headline reading, &quot;How did [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], CBS, NBC, MSNBC, and CNN miss this story?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Krakauer |first =Steve |title =Internal Fox News Email Addresses &quot;Standards&quot; After 9/12 Flap |publisher=Mediaite |date =September 21, 2009 |url =http://www.mediaite.com/tv/internal-fox-email-addresses-standards-after-912-flap/ |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN news anchor [[Rick Sanchez]] disputed Fox's assertion, pointing to various coverage of the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/18/networks-respond-to-false-fox-ad/ |title=Networks respond to false Fox ad |date=September 18, 2009 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0909/WaPo_defends_running_Fox_ad.html |title=WaPo defends running Fox ad |last=Calderone |first=Michael |date=September 18, 2009 |publisher=Politico |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mediabistro.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/in_full_page_ad_fox_asks_where_were_other_media_on_912_the_answer_they_were_there_136133.asp?c=rss |title=In Full Page Ad, Fox Asks Where Were Other Media on 9/12.

James Rainey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said MSNBC's attacks on the tea parties paled compared to Fox's support, but that MSNBC personalities [[Keith Olbermann]], [[Rachel Maddow]] and [[Chris Matthews]] were hardly subtle in disparaging the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Fox News, MSNBC prejudge 'tea parties' |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 15, 2009 |url =http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-onthemedia15-2009apr15,0,189873.column |last=Rainey |first=James |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Kurtz]] has said that, &quot;These [FOX] hosts said little or nothing about the huge deficits run up by [[George W.

In the January/February 2012 issue of [[Foreign Affairs]], [[Francis Fukuyama]] stated the Tea Party is supporting &quot;politicians who serve the interests of precisely those [[financiers]] and [[corporate]] [[elites]] they claim to despise&quot; and [[Economic inequality|inequality]] while comparing and contrasting it with the [[occupy movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fukuyama |first=Francis |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136782/francis-fukuyama/the-future-of-history |title=The Future of History; Can Liberal Democracy Survive the Decline of the Middle Class? |publisher=Foreignaffairs.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/blog/2012/01/06/francis-fukuyama-on-the-decline-of-the-middle-class/ |title=Francis Fukuyama on the decline of the middle class - PNHP's Official Blog |publisher=Pnhp.org |date=2012-01-06 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tea Party's views of media coverage====
In October 2010, a survey conducted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' found that the majority of local Tea Party organizers consider the media coverage of their groups to be fair. 76 percent of the local organizers said media coverage has been fair while 23 percent have said coverage was unfair. This was based on responses from all 647 local Tea Party organizers the ''Post'' was able to contact and verify, from a list of more than 1,400 possible groups identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;agwpostmedia&quot;&gt;Gardner, Amy [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/26/AR2010102602796.html &quot;Tea party groups say media have been fair, survey finds&quot;], ''The Washington Post'', October 26, 2010.

==On issues of race, bigotry and public perception==
Since its inception, the Tea Party movement has struggled with charges of racism.  Opponents cite a number of events as proof that the movement is, at least in part, motivated by bigotry and intolerance.  Supporters, however, say the incidents are the work of &quot;a few bad apples&quot;, a small fringe that have unfairly maligned the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek1&quot;&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/04/25/are-tea-partiers-racist.html Are Tea Partiers Racist?]; Newsweek; April 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;extremists&quot;/&gt; Examples include:

After each incident, other prominent Tea Partiers were quick to denounce the actions.  In each case, public announcements were made strongly stating that the controversial actions were neither condoned by, nor representative of, the Tea Party movement. Where Tea Party leaders were involved, they were forced to relinquish their position, or were ostracized from the movement.
[[File:TeaPartyDC2009Sept12PennAve.JPG|thumb|left|Tea Party protesters during the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], September 12, 2009.]] Some Tea Party organizers have started taking steps to prevent potentially controversial situations from arising, including hiring off-duty police officers and restricting attendance at their events, uninviting speakers espousing controversial views, and urging attendees to self-police events for troublemakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;extremists&quot;/&gt;
  
Polls, surveys and studies have been conducted to examine Tea Party supporters' views on racial issues. The University of Washington poll of registered voters in Washington State found that 74% of Tea Party supporters agreed with the statement &quot;[w]hile equal opportunity for blacks and minorities to succeed is important, it's not really the government's job to guarantee it&quot;, while a CBS/''New York Times'' poll found that 25% think that the administration favors blacks over whites, compared with just 11% of the general public, and that they are more likely to believe Obama was born outside the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nwsource1&quot;/&gt; A seven state study conducted from the [[University of Washington]] Institute for the Study of Ethnicity, Race &amp; Sexuality found that Tea Party movement supporters studied were &quot;more likely to be racially resentful&quot; than the population as a whole, even when controlling for partisanship and ideology.&lt;ref name=NewsweekAreTea&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/236996 |title=Are Tea Partiers Racist? |last=Campo-Flores |first=Arian |date=April 26, 2010 |work=Newsweek |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2010/04/pollster-responds-to-your-questions.html &quot;Pollster Responds to Your Questions&quot;].

''The Washington Post'' reported that an analysis of the signs displayed at a September 2010 Tea Party rally found that &quot;the vast majority of activists expressed narrow concerns about the government's economic and spending policies and steered clear of the racially charged anti-Obama messages that have helped define some media coverage of such events&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner 10-14-2010&quot;&gt;Gardner, Amy (October 14, 2010), [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/13/AR2010101303634.html?hpid=topnews &quot;Few signs at tea party rally expressed racially charged anti-Obama themes&quot;], ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly a quarter of the signs &quot;reflected direct anger with Obama&quot;, 5 percent &quot;mentioned the president's race or religion, and slightly more than 1 percent questioned his American citizenship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner 10-14-2010&quot;/&gt; The researcher, Emily Elkins, did not conclude that &quot;the racially charged messages&quot; were &quot;unimportant&quot;, but she did conclude that &quot;media coverage of tea party rallies over the past year have focused so heavily on the more controversial signs that it has contributed to the perception that such content dominates the tea party movement more than it actually does&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner 10-14-2010&quot;/&gt; A report published in the fall 2010 by the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights and backed by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] has found what it says are efforts by white nationalist groups and militias to link themselves to the Tea Party movement.&lt;ref&gt;Burghart, Devin; Zeskind, Leonard (Fall 2010), [http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/11246-irehrreport.html &quot;Tea Party Nationalism: A Critical Examination of the Tea Party Movement and the Size, Scope, and Focus of Its National Factions&quot;], Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Krissah (October 20, 2010), [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/20/AR2010102004020.html &quot;NAACP backs report that ties racist groups to tea party&quot;], ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; White nationalists have attempted to recruit new members at Tea Party events.

Black conservatives have expressed varied opinions about the Tea Party's inclusiveness and concerns about racism. Brandon Brice, a primary black speaker at a tax-day Tea Party rally, expressed worry about the movement, saying, &quot;It's strayed away from the message of wasteful spending and Washington not listening to its constituents, and it's become more of this rally of hate.&quot;&lt;ref name=WapoThompson/&gt; [[Lenny McAllister]], a Republican commentator, author and Tea Party supporter, said he has seen racism within the movement and has confronted it by approaching people with racially derogatory signs of President Obama and asking them to take the signs down. Like Brice, McAllister thinks leaders of the Tea Party movement must not ignore the issue. McAllister told ''[[The Washington Post]]'', &quot;The people are speaking up and becoming more educated on the issues, but you have fringe elements that are defining this good thing with their negative, hateful behavior.&quot; He said the movement is more diverse than news clips show, commenting that &quot;There is this perception that these are all old, white racists and that's not the case.&quot;&lt;ref name=WapoThompson/&gt;  During an interview on [[NPR]] with [[Michel Martin]], McAllister and columnist [[Cynthia Tucker]] discussed racism and the Tea Parties; Tucker wrote about the interview, concluding that McAllister's take on racism was that &quot;he'd seen enough racist signs at other Tea Party gatherings to know that racism is associated with the movement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Another prominent African-American conservative, [[Ward Connerly]], decried accusations of Tea Party racism and defended the movement in a ''[[National Review]]'' column: &quot;Race is the engine that drives the political Left. In the courtrooms, on college campuses, and, most especially, in our politics, race is a central theme. Where it does not naturally rise to the surface, there are those who will manufacture and amplify it,&quot; Connerly said. &quot;I am convinced beyond any doubt that all of this is part of the strategic plan being implemented by the Left in its current campaign to remake America.&quot; His comments were supported by [[Fox News]] [[Political commentator]] &amp; black republican [[Angela McGlowan]], a former [[Miss District of Columbia USA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WapoThompson&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/07/AR2010040703402.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Some black conservatives question tea party's inclusiveness | first=Krissah | last=Thompson | date=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2012}}

==Other events==
The final round of debate before voting on the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care bill]] was marked with vandalism and widespread threats of violence to at least ten Democratic lawmakers across the country, which created public relations problems for the fledgeling Tea Party movement. On March 22, 2010, in what the New York Times called &quot;potentially the most dangerous of many acts of violence and threats against supporters of the bill,&quot; a [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] Tea Party organizer and the [[Danville, Virginia]] Tea Party Chairman both posted the home address of Representative [[Tom Perriello]]'s brother (mistakenly believing it was the Congressman's address) on their websites, and encouraged readers to &quot;drop by&quot; to express their anger against Representative Perriello's vote in favor of the healthcare bill. The following day, after smelling gas in his house, a severed gas line that connected to a [[propane tank]] was discovered on Perriello's brother's screened-in porch. Local police and [[FBI]] investigators determined that it was intentionally cut as a deliberate act of vandalism. Perriello's brother also received a threatening letter referencing the legislation.  Attorney General Cuccinelli stated that posting a home address on a website and encouraging people to visit is &quot;an appalling approach. It's not civil discourse, it's an invitation to intimidation and it's totally unacceptable.&quot;  Leaders of the Tea Party movement tried to contain the public relations damage by denouncing the violent acts and distancing themselves from those behind the acts. One Tea Party website issued a response saying the Tea Party member's action of posting the address &quot;was not requested, sanctioned or endorsed by the Lynchburg Tea Party&quot;.  The director of the Northern Colorado Tea Party said, &quot;Although many are frustrated by the passage of such controversial legislation, threats are absolutely not acceptable in any form, to any lawmaker, of any party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/03/fbi_investigating_the_severing.html &quot;FBI investigating cut gas line at Perriello's brother's home&quot;], ''The Washington Post'', March 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/us/politics/26threat.html &quot;Accusations Fly Between Parties Over Threats and Vandalism&quot;], ''The New York Times'', March 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, Brian (March 24, 2010), [http://www2.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/crime/article/damage_at_home_of_perriello_brother_under_investigation/54038/ &quot;Severed gas line found at home of Perriello brother&quot;], ''[[The Daily Progress]]'' (Charlottesville, VA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/35040.html#ixzz0lC0cMKi7 &quot;Tom Perriello gas line 'intentionally cut{{'&quot;}}] ''Politico'', March 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34843.html Tea partiers told to 'drop by' Tom Perriello's home]; ''Politico''; March 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July 2010, the North Iowa Tea Party (NITP) posted a billboard showing a photo of [[Adolf Hitler]] with the heading &quot;National Socialism&quot;, one of Barack Obama with the heading &quot;Democrat Socialism&quot;,  and one of [[Vladimir Lenin]] with the heading &quot;Marxist Socialism&quot;,  all three marked with the word &quot;change&quot; and the statement &quot;Radical leaders prey on the fearful and naive&quot;. It received sharp criticism, including some from other Tea Party activists. NITP co-founder Bob Johnson acknowledged the anti-socialist message may have gotten lost amid the fascist and communist images.
