{{Main|CIA leak grand jury investigation|Plame affair}}
The '''CIA leak scandal timeline''' (also known as the '''CIA leak case timeline''', the '''Plamegate scandal timeline''', and the '''Plame affair timeline''') pertains to the controversy leading to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] and ensuing criminal trial ''[[United States v. Libby]]'', following [[Robert Novak]]'s public disclosure of the then-still [[Classified information|classified]] [[Non-official cover|covert]] identity of [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] officer [[Valerie Plame|Valerie Plame Wilson]] (known as the &quot;[[CIA leak scandal]]&quot; and also known as &quot;[[Plamegate]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Plame affair]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=TimelinesLinks&gt;[http://www.wilsonsupport.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=32 &quot;Timelines/Links&quot;], compiled by ''The Joe and Valerie Wilson Legal Support Trust''. Retrieved June 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerie Plame Wilson is the wife of former U.S. Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson]], author of a controversial [[op-ed]] entitled [[Joseph C. Wilson#&quot;What I Didn't Find in Africa&quot;|&quot;What I Didn't Find in Africa&quot;]] published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on July 3, 2003, questioning the accuracy of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]'s rationale for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Responding to that op-ed, [[Robert Novak]] publicly revealed Wilson's wife to be a CIA &quot;operative&quot; named &quot;[[Valerie Plame]]&quot; in his ''[[Washington Post]]'' column on July 14, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Novak|Robert D. Novak]], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102000874.html &quot;Mission to Niger,]&quot; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' July 14, 2003: A21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cf.]] ''[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/07/eveningnews/main1981433.shtml CBS Evening News]'' September 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003 and 2007, the [[United States Department of Justice]] directed the [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel]], headed by Special Counsel [[Patrick Fitzgerald]], to conduct a special investigation into the original source for the leak of Plame's then-still classified CIA covert identity and any possible violations of criminal statutes requiring government officials to use [[classified information]] responsibly and to testify truthfully in such federal investigations. The [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] resulted in the indictment and conviction of [[Lewis Libby]] in [[United States v. Libby]] and the later [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] of his prison sentence by [[United States President]] [[George W. Bush]].

In late August 2006, former [[United States Deputy Secretary of State|U.S. Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] revealed publicly that Novak had based his disclosure of Mrs. Wilson's CIA identity on then still-classified information that Armitage initially gave him while Armitage was still serving in the State Department.&lt;ref name=armitageny/&gt;

The &quot;Timeline/Links&quot; section of ''The Joe and Valerie Wilson Legal Support Trust'' provides links to &quot;several timelines assembled by various national publications, which should help to shed some light on the events as they transpired,&quot; including this timeline, while observing: &quot;Understanding the series of events that occurred around the exposure of Valerie Wilson's covert CIA status is somewhat difficult due to the misleading and contradictory statements given by various [administration] officials regarding the leak.&quot;&lt;ref name=WilsonTimelinesLinks&gt;[http://www.wilsonsupport.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=32 &quot;Timelines/Links&quot;], compiled by ''The Joe and Valerie Wilson Legal Support Trust'', accessed June 10, 2008.  [Corrects typographical error within brackets.] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--NOTE: Timeline style should be more consistent with the subheadings. A subheading of &quot;Month Year&quot; is generally used, but the exceptions should be fixed. Additionally, bullets are used in some months and not others. All fixed? See Talk--&gt;
&lt;!--NOTE: Citations still need fixing below and throughout; notes need to include authors, titles, places and dates of publications, pages if known, etc.--&gt;
&lt;!--Headings and chronological order throughout are not clear or consistent, and they need further revising. There is currently too much duplication and unnecessary repetition throughout this &quot;timeline&quot;; it needs re-organization; thorough clean-up as well as more consistent documentation formatting.--&gt;

==Key background events==

===1988===
* A [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] report notes that South Africa illicitly sells Uranium to Iraq through [[Uday Hussein]]. This sale is unverified by other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2278019.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iraq 'sought African uranium' | date=24 September 2002 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991===
* The [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] ends with Iraq being forced to concede to the demands of the [[United Nations]] after a coalition led by the [[United States]] expels the armies of [[Saddam Hussein]] from [[Kuwait]].

===1999===
* June: (According to a 2002 conversation between [[Joseph C. Wilson]] and former Prime Minister of Niger [[Ibrahim Assane Mayaki]]) An Iraqi businessman approached Mayaki and insisted that Mayaki meet with an Iraqi delegation to discuss &quot;expanding commercial relations&quot; between the Iraqi government of [[Saddam Hussein]] and Niger. Mayaki interpreted the overture as an attempt to discuss uranium sales, but steered the conversation away from trade because of [[Iraq disarmament crisis|UN sanctions against Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39834-2004Jul9.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Plame's Input Is Cited on Niger Mission | date=10 July 2004 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 conversation with Wilson, Wilson's &quot;Nigerien &lt;!-- of Niger! not Nigerian! --&gt; source&quot; (presumably, Mayaki), told Wilson that the &quot;Iraqi businessman&quot; he had met in June 1999 was [[Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf]], the former Iraqi Information Minister, sometimes referred to in the [[United States|U.S.]] press as &quot;Baghdad Bob.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph C. Wilson]], ''The Politics of Truth'' 12, 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000===
DIA agent William Bultemeier killed in Niamey, Niger. Bultemeier had acted as a liaison between Nigerien and US defense intelligence agencies in an effort to curtail illicit uranium mining in Niger.

===2001===
* New Years 2001: Over the holiday, a gang of burglars break into the embassy of Niger in Rome and steal some letterhead and official stamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2005/j/sezioni/esteri/iraq69/sismicia/sismicia.html] [http://nuralcubicle.blogspot.com/2005/10/berlusconi-behind-fake-yellowcake.html] [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/29/AR2005102901478_pf.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 2001 – Early 2002===
* According to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Director [[George Tenet]]: &quot;There was fragmentary intelligence gathered in late 2001 and early 2002 on the allegations of Saddam's efforts to obtain additional raw uranium from Africa, beyond the 550 [[metric ton]]s already in Iraq. In an effort to inquire about certain reports involving Niger, CIA's [[counter-proliferation]] experts, on their own initiative, asked an individual with ties to the region to make a visit to see what he could learn. He reported back to us that one of the former Nigerien &lt;!-- of Niger! not Nigerian! --&gt; officials he met stated that he was unaware of any contract being signed between Niger and rogue states for the sale of uranium during his tenure in office.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-07-11-tenet-text_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=What CIA Director George Tenet had to say | date=11 July 2003 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 2002===
* 12 February 2002: Vice President Cheney reads a [[DIA]] report on alleged Niger-Iraq uranium sale and asks for the CIA’s analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/2004_rpt/iraq-wmd-intell_chapter2.htm Report On The U.S. Intelligence Community'S Prewar Intelligence Assessments On Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12 February 2002: Valerie E. Wilson (aka [[Valerie Plame]]), a [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] analyst working in its Counterproliferation Division, sends a [[memorandum|memo]] to the deputy chief of the C.I.A.'s Directorate of Operations stating that her husband has good contact with the former Prime Minister and Director of Mines in Niger as well as other contacts who might prove useful in shedding light on the supposed Niger-Iraq uranium contract.&lt;ref name = &quot;counterpunch.org-Leupp&quot;&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp11092005.html Gary Leupp: the Niger Uranium Deception and Plame Affair, a Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 13 February 2002: An operations official cables an overseas officer seeking approval of Joe Wilson investigation.&lt;ref name = &quot;counterpunch.org-Leupp&quot;/&gt;
* 26 February 2002: [[Joseph C. Wilson]] travels to [[Niger]] at the request of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Joe Wilson meets with the former minister of mines, Mai Manga, who said he knew of no sales of uranium between Niger and rogue states. He states the mines are closely monitored from mining to transport loading making it at least very difficult if not impossible for a rogue state to obtain uranium through this channel.&lt;ref name = &quot;counterpunch.org-Leupp&quot;/&gt;
:Joe Wilson indicates that in his conversation with former Niger Prime Minister, Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, the [[Prime minister|PM]] indicated that he was not aware of any sales contract with Iraq but that in June 1999 he was approached by a businessman, asking that he meet with an Iraqi delegation to discuss expanding commercial relations. (Note: Niger's two largest exports are uranium and livestock [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ng.html]). Wilson indicated he thought the meeting took place but that Mayaki, who was aware of the illegality of such activities, let the matter drop due to the sanctions on Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/may/may200407121105.asp Clifford D. May on Joe Wilson on National Review Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to the report of the U.S. Senate Select Intelligence Committee, (July 2004, pages 43–46), former Prime Minister of Niger Mayaki told Wilson in Niger that Mayaki interpreted the June 1999 proposal of a businessman for &quot;expanding commercial relations&quot; as an offer to buy uranium [[yellowcake]]. However, this was only an interpretation. The Iraqi did not mention the word &quot;uranium&quot; or &quot;yellowcake.&quot;

* The Senate report's exact words on Mayaki's suspicions of Iraq's interest in uranium:&lt;blockquote&gt;Mayaki said, however, that in June 1999, [A few words blacked out] businessman, approached him and insisted that Mayaki meet with an Iraqi delegation to discuss &quot;expanding commercial relations' between Niger and Iraq. The [CIA] intelligence report [on Wilson's trip] said that Mayaki interpreted 'expanding commercial relations&quot; to mean that the delegation wanted to discuss uranium yellowcake sales. The intelligence report also said that &quot;although the meeting took place, Mayaki let the matter drop due to the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] faulted the C.I.A. for not fully investigating Iraqi efforts to obtain uranium from Niger, citing reports from both a foreign service and the United States Navy about uranium from Niger destined for Iraq and stored in a warehouse in [[Benin]], a country located between Niger and Togo.

===March 2002===
* 5 March 2002:Wilson is debriefed by two C.I.A. officials at his home. He never files a written report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=6217&amp;R=C7AA2ED PREVIEW: The White House, the CIA, and the Wilsons] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Wilson says he reported to the CIA that [[Iraq]]i attempts to purchase [[uranium]] from Niger are unlikely. Any deal about uranium could not possibly have taken place. Nobody at the State Department African Bureau had ever believed in the Niger story. Two other reports supported his views. Some CIA officials told the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] that Wilson's information was neutral, others said Wilson's information lent support to the contention Iraqi sought uranium from Niger.

===September 2002===
* 9 September 2002: According to Italian newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]'', the head of Italy's military intelligence agency ([[SISMI]]), [[Nicolò Pollari]], meets secretly with [[Stephen Hadley]], then Bush's Deputy National Security Adviser; the purpose of the meeting, as reported by ''La Repubblica'', was to bypass a skeptical CIA and get documents purporting to detail an Iraqi attempt to purchase Niger uranium directly to the White House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2005/j/sezioni/esteri/iraq69/bodv/bodv.html Repubblica.it » esteri » &quot;Pollari andò alla Casa Bianca per offrire la sua verità sull'Iraq&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hadley and others who attended this meeting say they have little memory of the details of what was discussed, and in a press conference Hadley characterized the meeting as a &quot;courtesy call&quot; that lasted less than 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051102-10.html Press Briefing with National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Italian Prime Minister's office, the meeting was between the then National Security Advisor, [[Condoleezza Rice]], and [[Nicolò Pollari]], in the presence of an Italian and US delegation that included Stephen Hadley.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agi.it/english/news.pl?doc=200510291505-1085-RT1-CRO-0-NF82&amp;page=0&amp;id=agionline-eng.italyonline {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2002===
* 6 October 2002: The National Security Council sent a sixth draft of a speech President Bush was to give in Cincinnati to the CIA. The draft contained the statement about Iraq &quot;having been caught attempting to purchase up to 500 metric tons of uranium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1115/p01s04b-uspo.htm Yellowcake to 'Plamegate' | csmonitor.com] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenet and other CIA officials directed the text be removed from the speech as the certainty regarding the accuracy of the claim was weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A48847-2003Jul12 | work=The Washington Post | title=CIA Got Uranium Reference Cut in Oct | first1=Walter | last1=Pincus | first2=Mike | last2=Allen | date=13 July 2003 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7 October 2002: George W. Bush gives a speech in Cincinnati in which he, for the first time, lays out in detail the case for disarming Iraq. In that speech he asserts, &quot;If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of [[highly enriched uranium]] a little larger than a single softball, it could have a [[nuclear weapon]] in less than a year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html President Bush Outlines Iraqi Threat]&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed (in July 2003) that [[George Tenet]] had intervened to remove language from that speech referencing Iraq's alleged pursuit of Nigerien uranium. More specifically, Deputy National Security Adviser [[Stephen Hadley]] was reported to be a main target of Tenet's entreaties.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost2003&quot;/&gt;
* 9 October 2002: Elisabetta Burba, an Italian journalist for ''[[Panorama (magazine)|Panorama]]'' magazine, part of the media empire of Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], contacts the U.S. Embassy in Rome, requesting authentication of some documents of interest that she has. These documents allegedly represent a contract by Iraq to purchase uranium &quot;[[yellowcake]]&quot; from Niger. The owner, not Elisabetta Burba, reportedly wants 15,000 euros for them. ''Panorama'' refuses to pay that amount unless they are first verified as authentic.&lt;ref name = &quot;csmonitor-yellowcake&quot;&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1115/p01s04a-uspo.htm Yellowcake to 'Plamegate' | csmonitor.com] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 15 October 2002: The embassy in Rome faxes the documents to the State Department's [[Bureau of Nonproliferation]] in Washington, which in turn provided copies to the State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] (INR). The INR's nuclear analyst will later decide they are a hoax in January 2003.
* During an inter-agency meeting the next day, analysts from the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], the [[National Security Agency]], and the CIA all obtain copies of the documents. None of the four CIA analysts in attendance remembers taking a copy, which later would show up in a CIA vault during a postmortem search.&lt;ref name = &quot;csmonitor-yellowcake&quot;/&gt;

===December 2002===
* 19 December 2002: By this date the uranium claim, which George Tenet had removed from Bush's speech in Cincinnati, Ohio, in October 2002, had found its way back into a State Department &quot;fact sheet.&quot; Following that, the Pentagon requests an authoritative judgement from the [[National Intelligence Council]] as to whether or not Iraq had sought uranium from Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/08/AR2006040800916_2.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A 'Concerted Effort' to Discredit Bush Critic | first1=Barton | last1=Gellman | first2=Dafna | last2=Linzer | date=9 April 2006 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===January 2003===
* January 2003: The National Intelligence Council, responding to the Pentagon's request, drafts a memo addressing the Niger uranium story in which they conclude the story is baseless. The memo arrives at the White House prior to the State of the Union address given later that month.&lt;ref name=GellmanLinzer2&gt;[[Barton Gellman]] and Dafna Linzer, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/08/AR2006040800916.html &quot;A 'Concerted Effort' to Discredit Bush Critic: Prosecutor Describes Cheney, Libby as Key Voices Pitching Iraq-Niger Story&quot;], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 9, 2006: A1, accessed January 12, 2008.

* 13 January 2003: The INR's nuclear analyst sends email to colleagues providing rationale on why the Yellowcake document is a hoax. The CIA's nuclear analyst does not have the documents in question and requests a copy.&lt;ref name = &quot;csmonitor-yellowcake&quot;/&gt;
* 16 January 2003: CIA received copies of the original foreign language documents on the Niger-Iraq contract.&lt;ref name = &quot;csmonitor-yellowcake&quot;/&gt;
* 27 January 2003: During a National Security Council meeting at the White House, someone hands George Tenet a hardcopy of President Bush's State of the Union address. Tenet is, he later testifies, too busy to read it and hands it to an aide who passes it to a top official in the CIA intelligence directorate who was also too busy to read it.&lt;ref name = &quot;csmonitor-yellowcake&quot;/&gt;
* 28 January 2003: President [[George W. Bush]] gives his [[State of the Union]] speech. Toward the end Bush states, &quot;The [[United Kingdom|British]] government has learned that [[Saddam Hussein]] recently sought significant quantities of uranium from [[Africa]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/28/sotu.transcript/ | work=CNN | title=Bush's State of the Union speech | date=27 January 2003 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence becomes known as the &quot;[[September Dossier|16 words]].&quot; In his State of the Union speech, Bush also declares, &quot;The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb.&quot;

===February 2003===
* 4 February 2003: The United States provides electronic copy of the Niger documents to Jacques Bute, then head of IAEA's Iraq Nuclear Verification Office, who was in New York, and sends a copy to the IAEA offices in Vienna as well.&lt;ref name = &quot;csmonitor-yellowcake&quot;/&gt;

* Sometime before 8 July 2003 [[Robert Novak]] has a conversation with [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] (Deputy Assistant Secretary of State). In that conversation he is told for the first time that Wilson's wife works for the C.I.A. [Armitage didn't tell Novak her name; subsequently, after his August 2006 public disclosure that he was the &quot;inadvertent&quot; leak, Armitage has asserted that he did not know her name at the time.] Novak uses an edition of Joseph C. Wilson's biography in ''[[Marquis Who's Who|Who's Who]]'' to identify by her maiden name [[Valerie Plame]]. According to the reporters [[Michael Isikoff]] and [[David Corn]], Armitage's leak was &quot;inadvertent, and the [[Intelligence Identities Protection Act|Intelligence Identities Act]] hadn't been violated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/08/plame_and_the_bush_lied_meme.html RealClearPolitics - Articles - Plame and the 'Bush Lied' Meme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Novak is reported to have told Rove the name of the agent as &quot;Valerie Plame&quot; and her role in Wilson's mission to Africa. Rove is reported to have told Novak something to the effect of, &quot;I heard that, too.&quot; or &quot;Oh, so you already know about it.&quot; Rove reportedly told the grand jury that at this time he had already heard about Wilson's wife working for the CIA from another [[journalist]], but is unable to remember who that was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/politics/15rove.html | work=The New York Times | title=Rove Reportedly Held Phone Talk on C.I.A.

According to Libby's later grand jury testimony, he told Miller at this meeting that the Niger uranium claim had been a &quot;key judgement&quot; of the October 2002 NIE (still classified at that time), and that Cheney had instructed him to do so.

* c. 10 July 2003–11 July 2003: Novak called [[Bill Harlow]], then CIA spokesman, to confirm information regarding Plame and Wilson. According to Novak, Harlow denied that Plame &quot;suggested&quot; that Wilson be selected for the trip, and Harlow stated instead that CIA &quot;counter-proliferation officials selected Wilson and asked his wife to contact him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/robertnovak/2003/07/14/160881.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harlow, he &quot;warned Novak in the strongest terms he was permitted to use without revealing classified information&quot;, that Wilson's wife had not authorized the mission and that if Novak did write about it, her name should not be revealed. Harlow said that after Novak's call, he checked Plame's status and confirmed that she was an undercover operative. He said he called Novak back to repeat that the story Novak had related to him was wrong and that Plame's name should not be used. According to Harlow, however, he did not tell Novak directly that Plame was undercover because that information was classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/26/AR2005072602069_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Prosecutor In CIA Leak Case Casting A Wide Net | first1=Walter | last1=Pincus | first2=Jim | last2=VandeHei | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Novak, not only did Harlow not tell Novak that Plame was undercover, he actually told Novak that &quot;she probably never again would be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause 'difficulties.'&quot; Novak states that if he had been told that disclosure of Plame's name would endanger her or anyone else, he would not have disclosed the name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/robertnovak/2005/08/01/155068.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief statement on the President's activities at the hospital, Fleischer answers a question regarding the previous day's statement by [[George Tenet]]. He states that the President is pleased by the report, and expresses the President's confidence in Tenet. The next question is one of accountability, which the press secretary deflects, saying, in part, &quot;The greater truth is that nobody, but nobody, denies that Saddam Hussein was seeking nuclear weapons.&quot; Fleischer cites Wilson's report as being supportive of the yellowcake claim. The conversation with reporters repeated that intelligence supported the notion that Iraq had or was trying to acquire nuclear weapons. Fleischer reiterates the administration's position that the yellowcake claim should not have risen to the level of &quot;presidential speech.&quot; When asked about public perception, Fleischer denies that there's a problem. &quot;Yes, the President has moved on. And I think, frankly, much of the country has moved on, as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/07/20030712-11.html Press Gaggle with Ari Fleischer]&lt;/ref&gt;

:However, Ivan Oelrich, a physicist at the Federation of American Scientists, in response to an A.P. query stated that the issue was whether the uranium's enrichment level was at the 3–5% common in commercial power reactors and if so, then a mere 1.8 tons would be more than sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/11/2/220331.shtml Saddam's 500-ton Uranium Stockpile]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is Ample Evidence On The Public Record To Cast Considerable Doubt That a Crime Has Been Committed. [Supporting facts and rationale are offered in subsequent pages.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He did not, however, go so far as to say that Martino was the forger. News reports have stated that Martino claimed to have gotten the documents from a contact at the Niger embassy in Rome. Pollari is also quoted as telling the committee that no Italian intelligence officers were involved in the forgery or distribution of the document. Pollari also told the committee that Martino claimed he was working for the French intelligence service. A French intelligence spokesman called Martino's claims scandalous without going so far as to explicitly confirm or deny the essence of Martino's claim.

These officials have suggested that she was involved in her husband's being dispatched Niger to investigate reports that Saddam Hussein's government had sought to purchase large quantities of uranium ore, sometimes referred to as yellowcake, which is used to build nuclear devices.&quot; (Two years later, in July 2005, it was revealed that one of the officials who spoke of Plame to ''Time'' was Karl Rove.)

* 3 August 2003: Wilson appears on CNN Late Night with Wolf Blitzer offering his opinion on the existence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs:&lt;blockquote&gt;BLITZER: I think he's being very cautious now, given some of the missteps in the past. But do you have confidence in (weapons inspector) David Kay, that they know what they're doing?
JOSEPH WILSON, FORMER U.S. ACTING AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ: Oh, absolutely, and I've had confidence in — that we would find weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction programs from the very beginning of the run-up to the war in Iraq.
687, the initial U.N. resolution dealing with weapons of mass destruction, demanded compliance, and it had as its objective disarmament. We had not yet achieved disarmament, so it was perfectly appropriate to continue to try and gather together the international consensus to disarm Saddam and his programs.
I think we'll find chemical weapons. I think we'll find biological precursors that may or may not have been weaponized. And I think we will find a continuing interest of — on nuclear weapons. The question really is whether it met the threshold test of imminent threat to our own national security or even the test of grave and gathering danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/000202.html Mark A.

:Wilson's comments are similar to others connected to the intelligence community but who opposed the Iraq war — Iraqi weapons of mass destruction did indeed exist, but did not constitute an imminent threat to the United States itself. The overstated threat assessment of Iraqi WMD capability and stockpiles was the result of poor intelligence shared between the CIA and the international intelligence community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Public statements==

=== Statements by the Bush administration ===
Bush and his White House Press Secretary [[Scott McClellan]] have made several statements about the administration's response if anyone was found to have been involved in the leak:

====September 2003====
* McClellan — September 29, 2003: &quot;The President has set high standards, the highest of standards for people in his administration. He's made it very clear to people in his administration that he expects them to adhere to the highest standards of conduct. If anyone in this administration was involved in it, they would no longer be in this administration.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;WhiteHouse.gov-20030929-7&quot;/&gt;
* Bush — September 30, 2003: &quot;And if there is a leak out of my administration, I want to know who it is. And if the person has violated law, the person will be taken care of. ... I don't know of anybody in my administration who leaked classified information. If somebody did leak classified information, I'd like to know it, and we'll take the appropriate action.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;WhiteHouse.gov-20030930-9&quot;&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030930-9.html President Discusses Job Creation With Business Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;

====October 2003====
* McClellan — October 7, 2003: &quot;Let me answer what the President has said. I speak for the President and I'll talk to you about what he wants.&quot; and &quot;If someone leaked classified information, the President wants to know. If someone in this administration leaked classified information, they will no longer be a part of this administration, because that's not the way this White House operates, that's not the way this President expects people in his administration to conduct their business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/10/20031007-4.html Press Briefing by Scott McClellan]&lt;/ref&gt;

====June 2004====
* Bush — June 10, 2004 (Responding to a media question that asked &quot;do you stand by your pledge to fire anyone found to have ... leaked [Valerie Plame's] name?&quot;): &quot;Yes. And that's up to the U.S. Attorney to find the facts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/rm/33463.htm {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====July 2005====
* Bush — July 18, 2005: &quot;I would like this to end as quickly as possible so we know the facts. And if someone committed a crime, they will no longer work in my administration.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Political-News.org-13435&quot;/&gt;

===Further White House reactions; possible involvement of Bush and Cheney===
In the beginning the White House called the allegation that Rove disclosed classified information &quot;totally ridiculous&quot; and &quot;simply not true&quot;, and stated that &quot;if anyone in this administration was involved in it, they would no longer be in this administration.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;WhiteHouse.gov-20030929-7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://slate.msn.com/id/2088471/ Did Rove blow a spook's cover? - By Timothy Noah - Slate Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A11208-2003Sep27&amp;notFound=true | work=The Washington Post | title=Bush Administration Is Focus of Inquiry | first1=Mike | last1=Allen | first2=Dana | last2=Priest | date=28 September 2003 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030916-6.html#27 Press Briefing by Scott McClellan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The White House continued to publicly assert that no Bush administration officials were involved in the leak until after the Supreme Court decision of 2005, the subsequent release of internal ''[[Time Magazine|TIME magazine]]'' email, and ''TIME'' reporter [[Matt Cooper (American journalist)|Matt Cooper]]'s decision to testify to the grand jury. Once Karl Rove's involvement was disclosed, the White House refused to comment on the ongoing investigation and stated that they would fire anyone ''convicted'' of criminal activity. Critics find an intent to protect Mr. Rove in the new specificity, while supporters say this is indicative of was what was meant all along.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

====September 2003====
On September 29, 2003, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan stated that &quot;[i]f anyone in this administration was involved in it, they would no longer be in this administration&quot;, adding that Karl Rove had specifically assured McClellan that he was not involved, and that &quot;the President expects his administration to adhere to the highest standards of conduct and the highest ethics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030929-7.html#1 Press Briefing by Scott McClellan]&lt;/ref&gt;

White House Press Secretary [[Scott McClellan]] said, regarding any suggested involvement of [[Karl Rove]] with the leak, that &quot;The President knows&quot; that it was not true, adding: &quot;And I said it is simply not true. So, I mean, it's public knowledge. I've said that it's not true. And I have spoken with Karl Rove ... He [President Bush]'s aware of what I've said, that there is simply no truth to that suggestion. And I have spoken with Karl about it.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;WhiteHouse.gov-20030929-7&quot;/&gt;

On September 30, 2003, Mr. Bush said: &quot;And if there is a leak out of my administration, I want to know who it is. And if the person has violated law, the person will be taken care of.&quot; He added: &quot;I don't know of anybody in my administration who leaked classified information. If somebody did leak classified information, I'd like to know it, and we'll take the appropriate action.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;WhiteHouse.gov-20030930-9&quot;/&gt;

President George W. Bush, who has repeatedly denied knowing the identity of the leaker, called the leak a &quot;criminal action&quot; for the first time on 6 October 2003, stating &quot;[i]f anybody has got any information inside our government or outside our government who leaked, you ought to take it to the Justice Department so we can find the leaker.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/10/20031006-3.html President Bush, Kenyan President Kibaki Discuss State Visit]&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to a crowd of journalists the following day, Bush said &quot;I have no idea whether we'll find out who the leaker is — partially because, in all due respect to your profession, you do a very good job of protecting the leakers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/10/20031007-2.html President Meets with Cabinet, Discusses National and Economic Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

====October 2003====
On 8 October 2003, White House spokesman [[Scott McClellan]] said that &quot;no one has more of an interest in getting to the bottom of this than the White House does, than the President does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/10/20031008-3.html Press Briefing by Scott McClellan]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2003, after the Justice Department began its formal investigation into the leak, McClellan specifically said that neither Rove nor two other officials whom he had personally questioned — [[Elliott Abrams]], a national security aide, and [[Lewis Libby]], Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff — were involved and that anyone who was involved in leaking classified information would be fired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/10/20031010-6.html Press Briefing by Scott McClellan]&lt;/ref&gt;

====June 2004====
On 10 June 2004, eight months after the formal outside investigation was begun and five months after the appointment of a Special Counsel, President Bush was asked by a reporter, &quot;Given recent developments in the CIA leak case, particularly Vice President Cheney's discussions with the investigators, do you still stand by what you said several months ago, suggesting that it might be difficult to identify anybody who leaked the agent's name? ... And do you stand by your pledge to fire anyone found to have done so?&quot; The President responded, &quot;Yes. And that's up to the U.S. Attorney to find the facts.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;WhiteHouse.gov-20040610-36&quot;/&gt;

====July 2005====
On 11 July 2005, White House spokesman Scott McClellan, who had since become a grand jury witness himself, refused at a press conference to answer dozens of questions, repeatedly stating that the Bush Administration had made a decision not to comment on an &quot;ongoing criminal investigation&quot; involving White House staff.&lt;ref name = &quot;WhiteHouse.gov-20050711-3&quot;/&gt; McClellan declined to answer whether Rove had committed a crime. McClellan also declined to repeat prior categorical denials of Rove's involvement in the leak,&lt;ref name = &quot;NYTimes-11cndrove&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/11/politics/11cnd-rove.html | work=The New York Times | title=Rove Comes Under New Scrutiny in C.I.A.

Rove was vociferously defended by Republican Party Chairman [[Ken Mehlman]] and by many conservative news outlets and commentators, some of whom followed cues laid out in a &quot;talking points&quot; memo, circulated among Republicans on Capitol Hill, which questioned Joseph Wilson's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Exclusive_GOP_talking_points_on_Rove_seek_to_discre_0712.html The Raw Story | Exclusive: GOP talking points on Rove seek to discredit Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], conservative ''New York Times'' editorialist and [[NPR]] commentator, attacked Wilson on 14 July 2005 by falsely alleging that he had claimed Cheney sent him on the Niger mission, and that in speaking to Cooper and others, Rove was merely correcting a reporter's misconception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/items/200507150004 Media Matters - David Brooks repeated false GOP spin that Wilson claimed Cheney sent him to Niger]&lt;/ref&gt; The Editorial Board of ''The Wall Street Journal'' praised Rove on 13 July 2005 for supposedly leaking Plame's identity, referring to him as a &quot;whistleblower.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110006955 The Wall Street Journal Online - Featured Article]&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News's [[John Gibson (media host)|John Gibson]] said that even if Rove is not being truthful, he deserves a medal for leaking Plame's CIA identity because Joseph Wilson opposed the war and &quot;Valerie Plame should have been outed by somebody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oliverwillis.com/vid/gibson-plame.mov Oliver Willis] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/items/200507130004 Media Matters - Fox's Gibson: Rove deserves &quot;a medal ... Because Valerie Plame should have been outed by somebody&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2005, President Bush stated that &quot;[i]f someone committed a crime, they will no longer work in my administration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/19/politics/19rove.html | work=The New York Times | title=Bush Responds to Questioning Over Leak Case | first1=David E. | last1=Sanger | first2=Richard W. | last2=Stevenson | date=19 July 2005 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-leak18jul18,0,4779848.story?page=2&amp;coll=la-home-headlines | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Top Aides Reportedly Set Sights on Wilson | first1=Tom | last1=Hamburger | first2=Peter | last2=Wallsten | date=18 July 2005}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely interpreted as a retraction of multiple earlier promises to fire anyone involved in the leak itself. Others counter this view by relying on the one previous mention of illegality, the September 30, 2003 remarks, to suggest that criminality was a prerequisite all along.
Many news outlets speculated that Rove's (future) legal defense might be built upon testimony that he was ignorant of Plame's protected status at the time he outed her as a CIA employee; if it could be proven that he had heard of her CIA covert status before speaking to journalists, however, Rove could face far more serious charges. A ''New York Times'' story of 16 July 2005 suggested that the Special Counsel grand jury has questioned whether a particular top secret [[Plame affair#Air Force One memo|State Department report naming Plame]] may have been the source of Rove's information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/politics/16memo.html | work=The New York Times | title=State Dept.

Powell is reported to have testified before the grand jury.

White House Chief of Staff, [[Andrew Card]] was informed by then White House counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] around 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on September 29, 2003, that the Department of Justice was beginning an investigation of the Plame affair, and that the next morning, Gonzalez would order the White House staff to preserve all documents that may be related to the case. Gonzalez has stated that he did not send the order to the staff because of the lateness of the hour, but speculation has suggested that he notified Card in order to give him a twelve hour head start before destruction of any incriminating documents would be prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/face_72405.pdf | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was unusual, according to the ''Washington Post'', since the White House Staff is usually quickly notified of any investigations so as to safeguard the integrity of any documents, emails or memoranda that might be required for the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/24/AR2005072401058.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Bush Aide Learned Early of Leaks Probe | first=Dafna | last=Linzer | date=25 July 2005 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional reactions===

==== July 2005 ====
On July 15, 2005, ninety one Democratic members of Congress sign a petition calling for Karl Rove to explain his role in the Plame affair, or to resign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/judiciary_democrats/letters/presrovesignerslst.pdf]. {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/judiciary_democrats/letters/presroveltr71405.pdf letter] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen Democratic Members of the [[House Judiciary Committee]] call for hearings on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/judiciary_democrats/letters/rovehrgrequestltr71405.pdf U.S. House Judiciary Committee] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Resolution of Inquiry]] has been offered by [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.]] (D-NJ) and [[John Conyers]] (D-MI), requesting that the Bush Administration release all documents concerning the exposure of Ms. Plame.

[[Barney Frank]] (D-MA) and John Conyers (D-MI) have authorized the Library of Congress to research legal precedent for the impeachment of White House staffers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://congressman-john-conyers.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/7/15/161624/901 Daily Kos: 91 Members Tell Karl Rove: Explain Your Role or Resign]&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of nationwide town hall meetings was scheduled for July 23, 2005 to review the [[Downing Street memo]], the Plame affair, and the situation in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/judiciary_democrats/releases/natltownhallpa71505.pdf U.S. House Judiciary Committee] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-six Democratic Senators, including seven members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, have issued a public statement authored by Senator [[John Kerry]], calling for Congressional hearings to investigate the Plame leak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.thedemocraticdaily.com/?p=57 The Democratic Daily » Blog Archive » Kerry, Senators Urge Congressional Investigation Into Leak of CIA Agent Valerie Plame’s Name]&lt;/ref&gt;

====November 2005====
On November 1, 2005, Senator [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV) called for a [[closed session]], for only the 54th time since 1929, to discuss the Plame affair and the Bush Administration's role in pre-Iraq War intelligence.

On November 5, 2005, Senator [[Zell Miller]] (D-GA) wrote a column describing his view of the Plame affair as a &quot;sting operation&quot; by the Wilsons designed to pull down a sitting president. Miller claims that Joseph Wilson played a key role by &quot;misrepresenting&quot; the intelligence he gathered on his trip to Niger, publishing his findings in an op-ed piece.

After an MSNBC report that asserted Plame was working on tracking Iranian nuclear proliferation, U.S. Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-NJ) wrote [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Porter Goss]] requesting a &quot;national security damage assessment briefing to U.S. Senators regarding the public disclosure of Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA officer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=65012 Issue Experts. Unique Connections. Maximum Impact]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions of former CIA officers===

==== July 2005 ====
On 18 July 2005, eleven former CIA officers backed Valerie Plame in a three page statement presented to a Congressional hearing&lt;ref&gt;[http://democrats.senate.gov/dpc/hearings/hearing23/cialetter.pdf Microsoft Word - cialetter.doc] {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized the leak of her identity as damaging &quot;national security and threaten[ing] the ability of U.S. intelligence gathering&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Intelligence officers should not be used as political footballs&quot;, the eleven said. &quot;In the case of Valerie Plame, she still works for the CIA and is not in a position to publicly defend her reputation and honor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://democrats.senate.gov/dpc/hearings/hearing23/cialetter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; as reported by [[Fox News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,163162,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Ex-Intel Officers Back Valerie Plame | date=20 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former CIA officers charge specifically that comments by members of Congress&lt;blockquote&gt;reveal an astonishing ignorance of the intelligence community and the role of cover. The fact is that there are thousands of U.S. intelligence officers who “work at a desk” in the Washington, D.C. area every day who are undercover. Some have official cover, and some have non-official cover. Both classes of cover must and should be protected.&lt;br /&gt;While we are pleased that the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation and that the U.S. Attorney General has recused himself, we believe that the partisan attacks against Valerie Plame are sending a deeply discouraging message to the men and women who have agreed to work undercover for their nation’s security. We are not lawyers and are not qualified to determine whether the leakers technically violated the 1982 Intelligence Identities Protection Act. However, we are confident that Valerie Plame was working in a cover status and that our nation’s leaders, regardless of political party, have a duty to protect all intelligence officers. We believe it is appropriate for the President to move proactively to dismiss from office or administratively punish any official who participated in any way in revealing Valerie Plame's status. Such an act by the President would send an unambiguous message that leaks of this nature will not be tolerated and would be consistent with his duties as the Commander-in-Chief.&lt;br /&gt;We also believe it is important that Congress speak with one non-partisan voice on this issue. Intelligence officers should not be used as political footballs. In the case of Valerie Plame, she still works for the CIA and is not in a position to publicly defend her reputation and honor. We stand in her stead and ask that Republicans and Democrats honor her service to her country and stop the campaign of disparagement and innuendo aimed at discrediting Mrs. Wilson and her husband.&lt;br /&gt;Our friends and colleagues have difficult jobs gathering the intelligence, which helps, for example, to prevent terrorist attacks against Americans at home and abroad. They sometimes face great personal risk and must spend long hours away from family and friends. They serve because they love this country and are committed to protecting it from threats from abroad and to defending the principles of liberty and freedom. They do not expect public acknowledgement for their work, but they do expect and deserve their government’s protection of their covert status.&lt;br /&gt;For the good of our country, we ask you to please stand up for every man and woman who works for the U.S. intelligence community and help protect their ability to live their cover.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Former [[Director of Central Intelligence|DCI]] [[George Tenet]] told a Senator that he was &quot;furious&quot; with the Bush Administration about the leak in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial/20050723/1063162.asp {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larry C. Johnson]], a former CIA colleague of Plame's in the late 1980s, heavily criticized the Bush Administration's handling of the leak: &quot;This is wrong and this is shameful. Instead of a president concerned first and foremost with protecting this country and the intelligence officers who serve it, we are confronted with a president who is willing to sit by while political operatives savage the reputations of good Americans like Valerie and Joe Wilson.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=axg0cWLE3YHs&amp;refer=us Bloomberg.com: U.S]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/51190.html bailey83221: Righting the CIA (About Team B) The Balti]&lt;/ref&gt; and retired Army colonel and DIA officer [[W. Patrick Lang]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkleft.com/lang722.pdf Senate Democratic Policy Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; testified at a Senate Hearing on the consequences of the leak.

Lang emphasized his view that the Bush Administration's action in leaking Plame's identity had threatened vital national security interests over the long term, by sending the message to potential assets around the world that their identity will not be protected if they work with the CIA. &quot;This says to them that if you decide to cooperate, someone will give you up, so you don't do it&quot;, he said. &quot;They are not going to trust you in any way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/22/AR2005072201261.html | work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fred W. Rustmann]], &quot;a covert CIA agent from 1966 to 1990&quot;, was briefly a supervisor of Valerie Plame Wilson during her early career at the CIA, although he left the agency before she went undercover: &quot;'She made no bones about the fact that she was an agency employee and her husband was a diplomat,' he told ''[[The Washington Times]]''. 'Her neighbors knew this, her friends knew this, his friends knew this. A lot of blame could be put on to central cover staff and the agency because they weren't minding the store here...

[[Reuel Marc Gerecht]], a former [[CIA]] case officer and [[Middle East]] specialist who became the director of the [[Project for the New American Century]]'s Middle East Initiative, and a resident fellow at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], dismissed the damage caused by outing Valerie Plame: &quot;The revealing of Valerie Plame's true employer&quot;, he writes, &quot;has in all probability hurt no one overseas. You can rest assured that if her (most recent) outing had actually hurt an agent from her past, we would've heard about it through a CIA leak. Langley's systemic sloppiness — the flimsiness of cover is but the tip of the iceberg of incompetence — has repeatedly destroyed agent networks and provoked 'flaps' with some of our closest allies. A serious CIA would never have allowed Mr. Wilson to go on such an odd, short 'fact finding' mission. It never would have allowed Ms. Plame potentially to expose herself by recommending such an overt mission for her mate, not known for his subtlety and discretion. With a CIA where cover really mattered, Mr. Libby would not now be indicted. But that's not what we have in the real world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110007522 The Wall Street Journal Online - Extra]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Larry C. Johnson]] noted that Plame's outing probably did compromise national security through revealing her cover company: &quot;every time that someone like this is outed, it's not just the person. In this case, it's the front company. It's other NOCs who may have been exposed.... But what I do know for certain is, we're not just talking about Valerie Plame. We're talking about an intelligence resource, a United States national security resource that was destroyed by these White House officials that went out and started talking to the press about this. Reckless. And they have — they have harmed the security of this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juancole.com/2005/10/larry-johnson-on-plame-scandal-i-think.html Informed Comment]&lt;/ref&gt;

====April 2006====
On 6 April 2006, it was widely reported that [[George W. Bush]] authorized Libby to disclose the prior-to-then classified October 2002 NIE on Iraq's weapons program to Judith Miller to rebut charges by Joe Wilson, according to documents filed in federal court detailing Libby's grand jury testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&amp;sid=ayKFRJsxP9Mk&amp;refer=top_world_news%3Cbr/%3E Bloomberg.com: Top Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesmokinggun.com/graphics/pdf/libbyplame.pdf {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; White House Press Secretary [[Scott McClellan]] confirmed that the president authorized the declassification to rebut charges by war critics, but declined to specifically address Libby's testimony.

[[File:Cheneysnotes.jpg|right|thumb|A handwritten note above Joe Wilson's editorial by Vice President Dick Cheney. Cheney wrote: &quot;Have they done this sort of thing before?&quot; &quot;Send an amb(assador) to answer a question?&quot; &quot;Do we ordinarily send people out pro bono to work for us? &quot;Or did his wife send him on a junket?&quot;.]]

In a court filing on May 12, 2006, Fitzgerald included a copy of Wilson's op-ed article in [[The New York Times]] &quot;bearing handwritten notations by the vice president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/cheney15.pdf | work=The New York Times | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See photo.)

Fitzgerald's filing declares that Libby ascertained Plame's name from Cheney through conferences by the vice president's office about &quot;how to respond to a June 2003 inquiry from Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus about Wilson's trip to Niger&quot;. In the filing, Fitzgerald states: &lt;blockquote&gt;It was during a conversation concerning Mr. Pincus’ inquiries that the Vice President advised the defendant that Mr. Wilson’s wife worked at the CIA. (To be clear, the government does not contend that the defendant disclosed the employment of Ms. Plame to Mr. Pincus, and Mr. Pincus’s article contains no reference to her or her employment.) The article by Mr. Pincus thus explains the context in which the defendant discussed Mr. Wilson’s wife’s employment with the Vice President. The article also served to increase media attention concerning the then-unnamed ambassador’s trip and further motivated the defendant to counter Mr. Wilson’s assertions, making it more likely that the defendant’s disclosures to the press concerning Mr. Wilson’s wife were not casual disclosures that he had forgotten by the time he was asked about them by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and before the grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;http://thenexthurrah.typepad.com/the_next_hurrah/files/news_article_response.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====May 2006====
In a May 24, 2006 court filing, Fitzgerald asserted that &quot;To the best of government’s
counsel’s recollection, the government has not commented on whether it intends to call the Vice
President as a witness, and the representations it has made regarding the identity of potential
government witnesses have been limited to responses to the defense assertions in defendant’s
Third Motion to Compel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://talkleft.com/fitzmay24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
