'''Laura Catherine Schlessinger''' (born January 16, 1947) is an American [[talk radio]] host, [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] [[Pundit (expert)|commentator]] and author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/102290|title=Listen Up, Callers: No Whining Allowed|last=King|first=Patricia|coauthors=Kendall Hamilton|date=May 27, 1996|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her radio program consists mainly of her responses to callers' requests for personal advice and has occasionally featured her short monologues on social and political topics. Her website says that her show &quot;preaches, teaches, and nags about morals, values and ethics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drlaura.com/pages/faq|title=The Dr. Laura Program - Top 10 questions|work=Frequently asked questions|publisher=DrLaura.com|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, Schlessinger combined a local radio career with a private practice as a [[Family_therapy#Licensing and degrees|marriage and family counselor]], but after going into national syndication she concentrated her efforts on the daily ''The Dr. Laura Program'', and on authoring [[self-help]] books. The books ''Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives'', and ''The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands'' are among her bestselling works. A short-lived television talk show hosted by Schlessinger was launched in 2000. In August 2010, she announced that she would end her syndicated radio show in December 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post08-17-10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;resigns&quot;/&gt;

Her show moved to [[Sirius XM Radio]]'s [[Sirius XM Stars]] on January 3, 2011. Schlessinger announced a &quot;multi-year&quot; deal to be on satellite radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101126/ap_en_tv/us_tv_dr_laura|title=Laura Schlessinger shifts to satellite radio|last=Bauder|first=David|date=November 26, 2010|publisher=Yahoo!

==Early life and education==
Schlessinger was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], and raised in Brooklyn and on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie, pp. 20, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were Monroe (Monty) Schlessinger, a civil engineer of Jewish heritage, and Yolanda Ceccovini Schlessinger, an Italian-Catholic [[war bride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wnd04-11-06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Diagnosing Dr. Laura|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Conde Nast Publications|issn=0733-8899|date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Her parents had met and married in [[Gorizia]] during the [[World War II]] liberation of Italy, World Net Daily, 4-11-2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Schlessinger has said her father was charming and her mother beautiful as a young woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;wnd04-11-06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times2006&quot;/&gt; She has a sister, Cindy, who is eleven years younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dr. Laura: An Unauthorized Biography|last=Bane|first=Vickie|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks|page=24|isbn=978-0-312-97122-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlessinger has described her childhood environment as unloving and unpleasant, and her family as dysfunctional. She has ascribed some of the difficulty to extended family rejection of her parents' mixed faith Jewish-Catholic marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;wnd04-11-06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://70.85.195.205/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=49682|title=How to redeem a bad childhood|last=Schlessinger|first=Laura|date=April 11, 2006|publisher=World Net Daily&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlessinger said her father was &quot;petty, insensitive, mean, thoughtless, demeaning and downright unloving&quot;. She described her mother as person with &quot;pathological pride&quot;, who &quot;was never grateful&quot;, who &quot;would always find something to criticize,&quot; and who &quot;constantly expressed disdain for men, sex and love&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wnd04-11-06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times2006&quot;/&gt; She credited her father with giving her the drive to succeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;wnd04-11-06&quot;/&gt;

Schlessinger attended [[Westbury High School (Old Westbury, New York)|Westbury High School]] and [[Jericho High School]] where she showed an interest in science.&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie pp. 23, 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt; She received a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Stony Brook University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iconic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/19/dr-lauras-ironic-college-_n_688022.html|title=Dr. Laura's Ironic College Journalism: Young Reporter Covered Obscenity Scandal|date=August 19, 2010|publisher=The Huffington Post|&lt;!--accessdate=August 24, 2010--&gt;|first=Leah|last=Finnegan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to [[Columbia University]] for graduate studies,&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie, pp. 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt; she earned a Master's and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[physiology]] in 1974. Her [[Thesis|doctoral thesis]] was on [[insulin]]'s effects on [[laboratory rat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schelssinger, Laura. &quot;The Effects of Insulin on 3-0-Methyglucose Transport in Isolated Rat Adipocytes&quot;.&quot;DAI, 36, no. 05B, (1974): 2093&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;salon08-23-99&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/people/feature/1999/08/23/drlaura/print.html|last=Milam|first=Lorenzo W|title=Tell Laura I love her|date=August 23, 1999|publisher=Salon|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she began dispensing personal advice on the radio, she obtained training and certification in marriage and family counseling from the [[University of Southern California]], and a therapist's license from the State of California. In addition, she opened up a part-time practice as a marriage and family counselor.&lt;ref name=aboutls&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drlaura.com/about/ About Dr. Laura|title=About Dr. Laura|year=2009|publisher=DrLaura.com|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mfcc&gt;The California Department of Consumer Affairs' Board of Behavioral Science's [http://www.bbs.ca.gov/quick_links/weblookup.shtml Online License / Registration Verification] shows that she holds a Marriage And Family Therapist license, issued January 11, 1980, expiration February 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlessinger's first appearance on radio was in 1975 when she called into a [[KABC (AM)|KABC]] show hosted by [[Bill Ballance]]. Impressed by her quick wit and sense of humor, Ballance began featuring her in a weekly segment.&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Schlessinger's stint on Ballance's show led to her own shows on a series of small radio stations. By 1979 she was on the air Sunday evenings from 9:00 to midnight on [[KWIZ]] in [[Santa Ana, California]]. That year, the ''Los Angeles Times'' described her show as dealing with all types of emotional problems, &quot;though sex therapy is the show's major focus&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes12-04-79&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/648626232.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+4%2C+1979&amp;author=JAMES+BROWIN&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=H1|title=Talk of the Town: Open-mike radio shows that encourage you to talk back|last=Brown|first=James|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=December 4, 1979|page=H9}}(free abstract, article available for a fee)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Schlessinger was filling in for [[Barbara De Angelis]]' noon-time relationship-oriented talk show in [[Los Angeles]] on [[KFI]],&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt; while working weekends at KGIL in [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]]. Her big break came when [[Sally Jessy Raphael]] began working at ABC Radio, and Maurice Tunick, former Vice-President of Talk Programming for the [[Citadel Media#Sale to Citadel|ABC Radio Networks]], needed a regular sub for Raphael's evening personal advice show. Tunick chose Schlessinger to fill in for Raphael.

Ultimately, Schlessinger began broadcasting a daily show on KFI which was nationally [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] in 1994 by Synergy, a company owned by Schlessinger and her husband. In 1997, Synergy sold its rights to the show to [[Jacor]] Communications, Inc., for $71.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt; Later, Jacor  merged with [[Clear Channel Communications]] and a company co-owned by Schlessinger, Take On The Day, LLC, acquired the production rights. The show became a joint effort between Take On The Day, which produced it, [[Talk Radio Network]], which syndicated and marketed it to radio stations, and [[Premiere Radio Networks]], (a subsidiary of Clear Channel), which provided satellite facilities and handled advertising sales. As of September 2009, Schlessinger  broadcast from her home in [[Santa Barbara, California]] with [[KFWB]] as her flagship station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/headline_id=n19579|title=News KFWB-AM/Los Angeles Readies News/Talk Flip|publisher=Radio Online|date=August 10, 2009|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 24, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Podcast]]s and live streams of the show have been available on her website for a monthly fee, and the show was also on [[XM Satellite Radio]].

At its peak, ''The Dr. Laura Program'' was the second-highest-rated radio show after ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', and was heard on more than 450 radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;times2006&quot;/&gt; Writing in 1998, Leslie Bennett described the popularity of the show:
{{quote|In an age of moral relativity, Dr. Laura's certitude compels...Schlessinger's fervor is indisputably evangelical, and her listeners believe her to be a paragon, a beacon of hope and rectitude in a dissolute, degraded world.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt;}}

In May 2002, the show still had an audience of more than 10 million, but had lost several million listeners in the previous two years as it was dropped by [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] and other affiliates, and was moved from day to night in cities such as Seattle and Boston. These losses were attributed in part to Schlessinger's shift from giving relationship advice to lecturing on morality and conservative politics. Pressure from gay rights groups caused dozens of sponsors to drop the radio show as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews05-13-02&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/05/13/2002-05-13_mag__dr__laura_s_star_falling.html|title=Mag: Dr. Laura's Star Falling|last=Hinckley|first=David|publisher=N.Y. Daily News|date=May 13, 2002|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25, 2009 --&gt;|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Schlessinger's show was being aired on approximately 200 stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;times2006&quot;/&gt; As of 2009, it was tied for third place along with ''The [[Glenn Beck Program]]'' and ''[[The Savage Nation]]''.&lt;ref name=talkers2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://talkers.com/online/?p=71|title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences|date=September 2009|publisher=[[Talkers Magazine]]|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 28 2008 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlessinger used &quot;Hot Talkin' Big Shot&quot;, a song by country and blues singer and songwriter [[Nikki Hornsby]], for several years as cue music for her radio program and for a national radio commercial advertising for the show.&lt;ref&gt;http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&amp;friendID=79852674&amp;albumID=803078&amp;imageID=18559692&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2010, during an appearance on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Schlessinger announced the end of her radio show saying that her motivation was to &quot;regain her First Amendment rights&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post08-17-10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/celebritology/2010/08/dr_laura_to_end_her_radio_care.html|title=Dr. Laura to end her radio career|author=Jen Chaney|coauthors=Liz Kelly|date=August 17, 2010|publisher=Washington Post|&lt;!-- accessdate=August 17, 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that she wanted to be able to say what is on her mind without &quot;some special interest group deciding this is a time to silence a voice of dissent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;resigns&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rttnews.com/Content/EntertainmentNews.aspx?Section=2&amp;Id=1397054&amp;SM=1|title=Dr. Laura Resigns After Racist Rant|date=August 18, 2010|author=RTT Staff Writer|publisher=RTT News|&lt;!--accessdate=August 21, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of her affiliates and major sponsors had dropped her show after her on air [[#Use of racial epithet|use of a racial epithet]] on August 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/auto/index.ssf/2010/08/general_motors_ends_sponsorshi.html|title=General Motors ends Dr. Laura sponsorship after N-word flap; host plans to end show this year|publisher=MLive.com|&lt;!--accessdate=2010-08-21--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129268632|title=Dr. Laura Plans To End Radio Show At End Of Year|agency=Associated Press|date=August 18, 2010|publisher=NPR|author=AP staff reporter|&lt;!--accessdate=August 25, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2011, Schlessinger's show moved exclusively to [[Sirius XM Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/26/AR2010112601996.html?nav=rss_artsandliving/entertainmentnews|title=Laura Schlessinger shifts to satellite radio|last=Bauder|first=David|date=November 26, 2010|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television show==
In 2000, Schlessinger signed a deal with [[Paramount Domestic Television]] to produce a syndicated talk show, which would be carried mainly by [[Owned-and-operated television stations in the United States|television stations owned and operated by]] [[CBS]]. The producers hoped to extend the success of Schlessinger's radio show to daytime television, however, the show was controversial before it ever aired, and it proved to be short-lived.

In the months before the premiere of her TV show, Schlessinger called [[homosexuality]] a &quot;biological error&quot;, said that homosexuality was acceptable as long as it was not public, and said that homosexuals should not attempt to [[LGBT adoption|adopt children]]. She regularly compared [[LGBT parenting|gay parenting]] to [[pedophilia]] by reiterating her view that &quot;a huge portion of the male homosexual populace is predatory on young boys.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;words&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopdrlaura.com/laura/index.htm|title=Words of Dr. Laura|year=2000|publisher=StopDrLaura.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlessinger was frequently criticized in [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transsexual]] ([[LGBT]]) media for these views. [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD), an LGBT media watchdog group, began monitoring Schlessinger's on-air comments about LGBT people, posting transcripts of relevant shows on its website.

In March 2000, a group of gay [[activism|activists]] launched [[John Aravosis|StopDrLaura.com]], an online campaign with the purpose of convincing Paramount to cancel the Dr. Laura television show prior to its premiere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopdrlaura.com We Stopped Dr. Laura.] StopDrLaura.com, Retrieved on May 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/030400-02.htm|title=Stop Dr. Laura' Website Receives 1 Million Hits In Just Two Days|last=Herscher|first=Elaine|date=March 4, 2000|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfexamine05-08-00&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/archive/2000/05/08/NEWS15161.dtl|title=Dr. Laura protest at KPIX: Pro-gay activists object to plans to air her program|last=Coile|first=Zachary|date=May 8, 2000|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com)|page=A 7|&lt;!-- accessdate=May 3, 2007 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group protested at Paramount studios, stating her views were offensively [[Bigotry|bigoted]]. StopDrLaura.com eventually organized protests in 34 cities in the U.S. and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~media/pressreleases/05-20-02-GoldenDot.htm|title=Golden Dot Awards For Best Online Issue Advocacy|date=May 20, 2002|publisher=George Washington University Democracy Online Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aravosis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredstrategies.com/tnr_sdl.htm|title=StopDrLaura.com|last=Aravosis|first=John|date=October 23, 2000|work=Wired Strategies Internet consulting|publisher=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and picked up on an advertiser boycott of both the radio and the TV shows started by another grass-roots organization which called itself &quot;Silence Of The Slams&quot; operating its boycott through AOL Hometown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.male-space.org/drlaura/drlaura_intro.html|title=The Silence Of The Slams Historic Perspective|date=March 2000-May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first episode of Schlessinger's television show aired September 11, 2000. Critics and viewers complained that the format had been dumbed down and did not stand out from any other daytime talk show. The biting rhetoric that worked well on radio seemed overly harsh for face-to-face discourse, owing to the normal sympathetic nature of most other daytime hosts; the radical change in Schlessinger's demeanor from her radio persona left viewers cold. Ultimately, the television show failed to generate the energy and interest of Schlessinger's radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A9459-2000Sep14|title=A Case of the Creeps: 'Dr. Laura' on UPN Looks Better on Radio|last=Shales|first=Tom|date=September 15, 2000|publisher=Washington Post|page=C 01|&lt;!-- accessdate=May 3, 2007 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The credibility of Schlessinger's television program also suffered during its first month when the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Schlessinger had used show staff to falsely pose as guests on the show. A September 25, 2000, episode named &quot;Readin', Writin', and Cheatin'&quot; featured a so-called college student who specialized in professional note-taking. On the next day's show, &quot;Getting to the Altar,&quot; the same guest appeared in different hair and makeup and said she was a woman living with her boyfriend. In fact, the woman was San-D Duchas, a researcher for the show whose name appeared in the closing credits of the shows on which she posed as a guest.&lt;ref name=&quot;fake guest&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=114986&amp;page=1|title=Dr. Laura Accused of Using Fake Guest|date=October 3, 2000|publisher=ABC News|author=ABC News Staff|&lt;!--accessdate=August 27, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, Schlessinger was unaware of this incident until it was disclosed by the Post, and immediately put a stop to any further use of this practice.

By November 2000, advertisers that had originally committed to Schlessinger's show left, and the ratings plummeted.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews11-08-04&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2004/11/08/2004-11-08_laura_s_advice_to_self__skip.html|title=Laura's Advice To Self: Skip TV|last=Hinckley|first=David|date=November 8, 2004|publisher=New York Daily News|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS directed its stations to move the show to a late-night slot or replace it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/TV/11/07/dr.laura/|title=CBS shoves Dr. Laura into late night slots, or dumps her|date=November 7, 2000|work=Entertainment TV|publisher=CNN|&lt;!-- accessdate=May 4, 2007 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stations outside of CBS did the same thing, while others moved it to weaker sister stations. The television show was cancelled in March 2001 and last aired in September 2001.

In 2004, Schlessinger said that although there is more money and celebrity in television, it is not as meaningful or intimate as radio, and for her television was a &quot;terrible experience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews11-08-04&quot;/&gt;

==Publications==
===Columns===
For several years, Schlessinger wrote a weekly column syndicated by [[Universal Press Syndicate]] that was carried in many newspapers, as well as ''[[Jewish World Review]]''. She discontinued the column in July 2000, citing lack of time due to her upcoming television show.&lt;ref name=&quot;jwr07-21-00&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/dr/laura.html|title=Starting anew|last=Schlessinger|first=Laura|date=July 21, 2000|publisher=Jewish World Review|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote a monthly column for ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' between 2002 and 2004, with one entry in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;wndarchive&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://70.85.195.205/news/archives.asp?AUTHOR_ID=204&amp;PAGE=1|title=Dr. Laura Schlessinger Do the Right Thing Archive|date=May 6, 2002 - April 11, 2006|work=WorldNetDaily Commentary|publisher=World Net Daily|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Schlessinger joined the ''[[Santa Barbara News-Press]]'', writing bi-weekly columns dealing with Santa Barbara news, as well as general news and cultural issues discussed on her radio show. She suspended the column in mid 2007, resumed writing it later, then discontinued it in December 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo051807&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/23/AR2007052301798.html|title=Dr. Laura Suspends Calif.

===Books===
Schlessinger has written thirteen books for adults and four for children. Several follow the mold of her successful ''Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives'', with similarly named books giving advice for men, couples, and parents, while others are more moral in orientation. 

Her 2004 book, ''The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands'', sold well despite poor reviews by critics. It was a departure from her previous books, which tended to focus on premarital relationships and children. ''Proper Care'' asserts that men need direct communication, respect, appreciation, food, and good loving, rather than tearing down the husband's sense of strength and importance. Schlessinger's thesis is that wives have the power to change their husbands' attitudes by seeing to these needs, and then their husbands will &quot;swim across shark-infested waters to bring you a lemonade.&quot; The book proposes that wives have the power to promote devotion, compassion, and love from their husbands.

===Magazine===
For several years, Schlessinger published a monthly magazine, ''Dr. Laura Perspective''. She was the editor, her husband a contributing photographer, and her son the creative consultant.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes01-18-98&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/25475468.html?dids=25475468:25475468&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+18%2C+1998&amp;author=JANET+WISCOMBE&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=COVER+STORY%3B+I+Don%27t+Do+Therapy%3B+Dr.+Laura+Schlessinger%2C+the+Country%27s+Top+Female+Radio+Personality%2C+Calls+Herself+a+Prophet.+What+She+Frequently+Calls+Others+Is+an+Entirely+Different+Matter.&amp;pqatl=google|title=I Don't Do Therapy; Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the Country's Top Female Radio Personality, Calls Herself a Prophet|last=Wiscombe|first=Janet|date=January 18, 1998|publisher=Los Angeles Times Magazine|work=Cover story}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine has since gone out of publication.

===Website===
Schlessinger has a website which contains hints for stay-at-home parents, her blog, a reading list, and streaming audio of her shows (by subscription only). When it was started, 310,000 people tried to access it simultaneously and it crashed.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt; Certain aspects of [[feminism]] are often discussed on her website; she was a self-proclaimed feminist in the 1970s, but is now opposed to feminism.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drlaurablog.com/2007/01/08/womens-work-saves-womens-lives/#more-30|title=Women's Work Saves Women's Lives Feminism Kills Women|last=Schlessinger|first=Laura|publisher=Dr. Laura's blog|date=January 8, 2007|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 24, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable work==
Schlessinger created the Laura Schlessinger Foundation to help abused and neglected children in 1998. Schlessinger regularly asked her on-air audience to donate items for ''My Stuff'' bags, which go to children in need. All other donations came from other people or groups, usually in the form of donated items for the bags. Per the foundation's reports, money not used for operations was directed toward [[Pro-life movement|pro-life organizations]], such as crisis pregnancy centers. In September 2004, Schlessinger announced that she was closing down the foundation because it had become too difficult and costly for her and her husband to underwrite, and they wished to devote their &quot;energies and resources to other pressing needs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by Dr. Laura Regarding The Dr. Laura Schlessinger Foundation Closing|date=September 2004|publisher=DrLaura.com, reprinted in The Free Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Schlessinger began fundraising for Operation Family Fund, an organization which aids the families of fallen or seriously injured veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2008, she helped raise more than $1 million dollars for the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;talkers11-18-08&quot;/&gt;

==Awards==
Schlessinger has received numerous awards from both media and conservative organizations. She was the first woman to win the [[NAB Marconi Radio Awards|Marconi Award]] for Network/Syndicated Personality of the Year (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=8593|title=1997 Marconi Radio Award Winners|publisher=National Association of Broadcasters|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 24 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 she received the American Women in Radio &amp; Television's Genii Award.

Schlessinger received a National Heritage award from the [[National Council of Young Israel]] in March 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishnews&quot;/&gt; She also received the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] Chairman's Award, and has lectured on the national conservative circuit. She was the commencement speaker at [[Hillsdale College]] in June 2002, and was awarded an honorary degree as a doctor of tradition and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;toledeoblade&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fPkZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-g0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3722,1346246&amp;dq=laura+schlessinger&amp;hl=en|title=Dr. Laura to be Hillsdale speaker|publisher=Toledo Blade|page=E2|date=May 5, 2002|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Schlessinger was given an Exceptional Public Service award by the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense. In 2008, Talkers Magazine presented her with an award for outstanding community service by a radio talk show host.&lt;ref name=&quot;talkers11-18-08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cache.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=-1619357029&amp;page_url=%2f%2fwww.talkers.com%2fmain%2findex.php%3foption%3dcom_content%26task%3dview%26id%3d541%26Itemid%3d142|title=Dr. Laura sets hot pace among talk show hosts|last=Linder|first=Larry|publisher=Talkers Magazine|date=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
Schlessinger was non-religious until she and her son began practicing [[Conservative Judaism]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt; In 1998, Schlessinger, Bishop, and their son converted to [[Orthodox Judaism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishnews&quot;&gt;Although Schlessinger's father was Jewish, her mother was not, thus, she was not a Jew under Jewish law, and conversion was required in order for her to become an Orthodox Jew. {{cite web|url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/010323/laura.shtml|title=Loved and hated, 'Dr. Laura' receives award|last=Wiener|first=Julie|publisher=Jewish News of Greater Phoenix|date=March 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began instruction under [[Reuven Bulka|Rabbi Reuven P. Bulka]] of [[Ottawa, Ontario]].  During this time, Schlessinger sometimes used Jewish law and examples to advise her callers about their moral dilemmas. She occasionally clarified ethical and moral issues with her local Orthodox Rabbi Moshe D. Bryski, before mentioning them on the air. She was embraced by many in the politically conservative segment of Orthodox Judaism for bringing more awareness of Orthodoxy to her radio show. Some of her expressed views were explicitly religious, and are referenced her 1999 book ''The Ten Commandments: The Significance of God's Laws in Everyday Life''. Although her other books have stressed the importance of morality, they are more secular in nature.

In July 2003, Schlessinger announced on her show that she was no longer an Orthodox Jew.&lt;ref name=&quot;forward&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/7887/|title=Dr. Laura Loses Her Religion Radio Host Drops Judaism|last=Keys|first=Lisa|publisher=The Forward|date=August 15, 2003|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25, 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family life==
Schlessinger met and married Michael F. Rudolph, a dentist, in 1972 while she was attending Columbia University. The couple had a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt; Separating from Rudolph, Schlessinger moved to [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino, California]] in 1975 when she obtained a job in the science department at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie pp. 58, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Their divorce was finalized in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie pp. 63, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, while working in the labs at USC, she met Lewis G. Bishop, a professor of [[neurophysiology]] who was married and the father of three children.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop separated from his wife and began living with Schlessinger the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie pp. 84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Schlessinger has vociferously proclaimed her disapproval of unwed couples &quot;shacking up&quot; and having children out of wedlock. But according to personal friend, Shelly Herman, &quot;Laura lived with Lew for about nine years before she was married to him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt; &quot;His divorce was final in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop and Schlessinger married in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/schlessinger.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Herman says that Schlessinger told her she was pregnant at the time, which Herman recalls as &quot; particularly joyful because of the happy news.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt; Schlessinger's only child, a son named Deryk, was born in November 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie pp. 90, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlessinger was estranged from her sister for  years, and many thought she was an only child.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair09-98&quot;/&gt; She had not spoken to her mother for 18&lt;ref&gt;Bane, Vickie p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; to 20 years before her mother's death in 2002 from heart disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;times2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article702249.ece?token=null&amp;print=yes&amp;randnum=1259349686078|title=Just Ditch Those Difficult Parents|last=Ayers|first=Chris|date=April 6, 2006|publisher=The Times|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25 2009 --&gt;|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother's remains were found in her Beverly Hills condo approximately two months after she died,&lt;ref name=&quot;sfchrondec212002&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2002/12/21/MN195481.DTL|title=Dr. Laura's mother found in Beverly Hills condo|last=Leovy|first=Jill|coauthors=Landsberg, Mitchell|date=December 21, 2002|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|&lt;!-- accessdate=24 November 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytapril112003&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/us/national-briefing-west-california-host-s-mother-dead-of-natural-causes.html|title=Host's Mother Dead Of Natural Causes|date=April 11, 2003|publisher=New York Times|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 24 2009 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lay unclaimed for some time in the Los Angeles morgue before Schlessinger had them picked up for burial.&lt;ref name=&quot;philly1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali|first=Fatimah|url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/columnists/fatimah_ali/20100817_Fatimah_Ali__Dr__Laura_Schlessinger___the_n-word.html|title=Fatimah Ali: Dr. Laura Schlessinger &amp; the n-word &amp;#124|publisher=Philadelphia Daily News|date=August 17, 2010|&lt;!--accessdate=2010-08-26--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the day that she heard about her mother’s death, she said: “Apparently she had no friends and none of her neighbors were close, so nobody even noticed! How sad.”&lt;ref name=&quot;times2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;philly1&quot;/&gt; In 2006, Schlessinger wrote that she had been attacked in a &quot;vulgar, inhumane manner by media types&quot; because of the circumstances surrounding her mother's death, and that false allegations had been made that she was unfit to dispense advice based on [[family values]]. She said that she had not mourned the deaths of either of her parents because she had no emotional bond to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;wnd04-11-06&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times2006&quot;/&gt;

==Controversies==
===Libel lawsuit===
In 1998, Schlessinger was in a Costa Mesa surf shop with her son when she began perusing the skateboarding magazine, ''[[Big Brother (magazine)|Big Brother]]''. On her radio program, Schlessinger declared the magazine to be &quot;stealth pornography.&quot; When the owner of the store publicly denied that she found pornography in his store, Schlessinger sued him for lying, claiming that his denial had hurt her reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telemundodallas.com/sh/entertainment/news/articles/natlphae-entnews-990729-102408.html Dr. Laura Goes After Surf Shop For Porn]&lt;/ref&gt; When the case went to court, the judge dismissed her suit, but the shop owner's $4 million defamation [[Counterclaim|countersuit]] lodged for hurting the reputation of his store was allowed to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,616812,00.html|title=Dr. Laura: Surf's Up|date=December 15, 1998|work=News|publisher=People.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1999/12/13/judge-dismisses-dr-laura-schlessinger-suit-against-beach-access-owner/|title=Judge Dismisses Dr. Laura Schlessinger Suit Against Beach Access Owner|date=December 13, 1999|work=Skateboarding News|publisher=Transworld.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit has since been settled, but the terms of the settlement have not been revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;people09-28-98&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,617681,00.html|title=Dr. Laura Makes Nice|last=Slliverman|first=Stephen M.|date=September 28, 1998|publisher=People Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet publication of nude photos===
In 1998, Schlessinger's early radio mentor, [[Bill Ballance]], sold nude photos that he had taken of Schlessinger in the mid-1970s to a company specializing in internet porn. The photos were taken while Schlessinger was involved in a brief affair with then-married Bill Ballance.&lt;ref name=&quot;solove&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Solove, Daniel J.|title=The future of reputation: gossip, rumor, and privacy on the Internet|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn|year=2007|pages=182–4|isbn=0-300-12498-8|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=42nJLWB0ztYC&amp;pg=PA183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nypost12-07-98&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/68460288.html?dids=68460288:68460288&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+07%2C+1998&amp;author=JOHN+MAINELLI&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=WHY+I+PUT+NUDE+PHOTOS+OF+DR.+LAURA+ON+THE+NET|title=Why I Put Nude Photos of Dr. Laura on the Net|last=Mainelli|first=John|date=December 7, 1998|publisher=New York Post|&lt;!-- accessdate=November 25 2009 --&gt;}}&quot;Feisty Bill Ballance says a snub by ex-lover Dr. Laura Schlessinger made him sell nude photos of her.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Schlessinger sued after the photos were posted on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pencilnecks.com/Laura.html|title=Dr.Laura Nude|accessdate=2012 May 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming invasion of privacy and copyright violation.

===Repeated use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;===
On August 10, 2010, Nita Hanson, an [[African-American]] woman married to a white man, called Schlessinger's show to ask for advice on dealing with racial comments made by acquaintances. During the call, Schlessinger used the word &quot;[[nigger]]&quot; eleven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://emptysuit.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/dr-laura-schlesingers-nigger-rant-transcript/|title=Emptysuit Dr. Laura Schlessinger's Nigger Rant Transcript|&lt;!-- accessdate=January 14, 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hanson asked, &quot;Is it ever OK to say that word?,&quot; Schlessinger responded, &quot;It depends how it’s said. Black guys talking to each other seem to think it’s OK.&quot; After the call Schlessinger said, &quot;If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/201008120045|title=FULL AUDIO: Dr Laura Schlessinger's N-Word Rant|last=Holden|first=Jeremy|publisher=Media Matters for America|&lt;!-- accessdate=August 13, 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after that call, she took herself off the air, and early that evening wrote an apology to Los Angeles Radio People online journalist Don Barrett to post on his now-defunct website.

Schlessinger announced she would end her radio show at the end of 2010:{{Quote|I have made the decision not to do radio anymore.

==Fictional portrayals==
In 1999, Schlessinger was parodied as  [[Dr. Nora (Frasier episode)|&quot;Dr. Nora&quot;]] on the sitcom ''[[Frasier]]''. The character was portrayed as having dogmatic and fundamentalist social views that promoted social conservatism. The character was also shown to have a degree that belies her therapeutic advice and was estranged from her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273489,00.html|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|title=Blame Dr. Laura Schlessinger: Thanks to the radio talk show maven's influence, women therapists are appearing all over the small screen|author=Fretts, Bruce|date=May 21, 1999|&lt;!--accessdate=August 25, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/07/entertainment/ca-48098|author=Lowry, Brian|work=Article Collections: Censorship|publisher=Los Angeles Times|title=Syndicated 'Frasier' Episode Spoofing Dr. Laura Is Pulled: Schlessinger didn't ask Paramount to remove 'Dr. Nora' show.|date=November 7, 2000|&lt;!--accessdate=August 25, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, in the episode [[The Midterms]] on ''[[The West Wing]]'', the fictional &quot;Dr. Jenna Jacobs&quot; is scolded by [[Josiah Bartlet|President Bartlet]], who criticizes her views on homosexuality, and points out she is not a doctor in any field related to morality, ethics, or theology. He quotes from the [[Bible]] to point out the inconsistency of condemning certain sins but not others. Show creator [[Aaron Sorkin]] admitted to modeling Bartlet's diatribe on an anonymous &quot;Letter to Dr. Laura,&quot; which was a popular [[viral email]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,85669,00.html|title=Farrah Heir|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 2000|first=Tricia|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Laura-Like Character Mocked|newspaper=Denver Rocky Mountain News|date=December 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlessinger is featured as an antagonist in the animated series ''[[Queer Duck]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.queerduck.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
