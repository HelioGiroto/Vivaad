{{Discrimination sidebar}}
The terms '''Polonophobia''', '''anti-Polonism''', '''antipolonism''' and '''anti-Polish sentiment''' refer to a spectrum of hostile attitudes toward [[Poles|Polish people]] and [[Culture of Poland|culture]]. These terms apply to [[racial prejudice]] against Poles and people of Polish descent, including ethnicity-based [[discrimination]] and state-sponsored mistreatment of Poles and Polish citizens (including Polish Jews).&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor-4465299&quot; /&gt; This prejudice led to mass killings and [[genocide]] during [[World War II]], notably [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|by the German Nazis]], [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia|Ukrainian nationalists]] and [[Katyn Massacre|Soviet forces]].

Anti-Polish sentiment often entails modern-day derogatory [[stereotyping]] and [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emilyk.org/about/inspiration.shtml |title=Emily Krzyzewski Center &amp;#124; About Us &amp;#124; Our Inspiration |publisher=Emilyk.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosmopolitanreview.com/articles/41-reviews/83-a-history-of-polish-americans-revisited |title=A History of Polish Americans ...

==Use of the term in scientific writing==
The term &quot;anti-Polonism&quot; (a [[loanword]] from the {{lang-pl|[[:pl:antypolonizm|antypolonizm]]}}) was coined in [[Poland]] before 1919. It was used by progressive Polish thinkers such as [[Jan Józef Lipski]] during the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] years in connection with allegations of Polish [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;J-L&quot;/&gt; It reappeared in Polish nationalist circles in the 1990s and eventually entered mainstream use, reflected in leading Polish newspapers such as ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;wyborcza&quot;/&gt; In recent years, anti-Polonism, or Polonophobia, has been studied at length in scholarly works by Polish, German, American and Russian researchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolbilov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;archive&quot;/&gt;

==Features==
Forms of hostility toward Poles and Polish culture include:{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--the entire list below seems unreferenced}}--&gt;
* organized persecution of the Poles as a nation or as an ethnic group, often based on the belief that Polish interests are a threat to one's own national aspirations;
* [[racism|racist]] anti-Polonism, a variety of [[xenophobia]];
* cultural anti-Polonism: a prejudice against Poles and Polish-speaking persons—their customs, language and education;
* [[stereotypes]] about Poland and Polish people in the media and popular culture.

A historic example of Polonophobia was ''polakożerstwo'' (in English, &quot;the devouring of Poles&quot;) — a Polish term introduced during the 19th century in relation to the [[Partitions of Poland|annexed areas of Poland]]. It described the forcible suppression of Polish culture, education and religion, and the elimination of Poles from public life and from landed property in east Germany under [[Otto von Bismarck]], especially during the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' and up to the end of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;omp&quot;/&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2012}} Similar policies were implemented, mainly under [[Tsar Nicholas II]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MFJ&quot;/&gt; in the Polish territories that had been annexed by the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatagova&quot;/&gt;

Historic actions inspired by anti-Polonism{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} ranged from felonious acts motivated by hatred, to physical extermination of the Polish nation, the goal of which was to eradicate the Polish state. During World War II, when most of Polish society became the object of [[Nazi]] [[genocide|genocidal]] policies, German anti-Polonism led to a [[World War II crimes in Poland|campaign of mass murder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;neu&quot;/&gt;

At present, among those who often express their hostile attitude towards the Polish people are some [[Russia]]n  politicians and their far-right political parties who search for a new imperial identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazeta&quot;/&gt;

===Polonophobic stereotypes===
In Russian language, the term ''mazurik'' ([[:ru:wikt:мазурик|мазурик]]), a synonym for &quot;pickpocket&quot;, &quot;petty thief&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pSAqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22mazurik%22+thief&amp;dq=%22mazurik%22+thief |title=Russian studies in literature - Google Books |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally means &quot;a person from [[Masuria]], a geographical area in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Dahl]], ''[[Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language]]'', 1880 and later reprints, entry МАЗУРИК&lt;/ref&gt; The word is an example how [[Vladimir Putin]]'s liberal [[Vladimir Putin#Putinisms|use of colloqialisms]] has been catching attention of the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucorg.com/news.php/news/5066 &quot;The Government's Political Technologist, or the Secrets of Inter TV Channel's Information Policy&quot;], ''Ukrayinska Pravda'', Monday, April 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[Polish plumber]]&quot; cliché may symbolize the threat of cheap East European labor to take jobs of West Europeans. On the other hand, others associate it with affordability and dependability of East European migrant workers.&lt;ref name=vq&gt;[http://www.german-times.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1490&amp;Itemid=69 &quot;Beneficial immigration&quot;], by Vanessa Quick, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Persecution of Poles (to 1918)===
Anti-Polish rhetoric combined with the condemnation of Polish culture was most prominent in the 18th century [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] during the [[partitions of Poland]]. For instance, David Blackbourn of Harvard University speaks of scandalized writings of German intelectual [[Georg Forster|Johann Georg Forster]], who was granted a tenure at [[Vilnius University]] by the Polish [[Commission of National Education]] in 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;H-R&quot;/&gt; Forster wrote of Poland's &quot;backwardness&quot; in a similar vein to &quot;ignorance and barbarism&quot; of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;oslo2000&quot; /&gt; Such views were later repeated in the German ideas of [[Lebensraum]] and exploited by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=&quot;S-P&quot;/&gt; German academics in the 18th – 20th century attempted to project, in the difference between Germany and Poland, a &quot;boundary between civilization and barbarism; high German Kultur and ''primitive Slavdom''&quot; (1793 racist diatribe by J.C. Schulz republished by the Nazis in 1941).&lt;ref name=&quot;L-W&quot;/&gt; Prussian officials, eager to secure Polish partition, encouraged the view that the Poles were culturally inferior and in need of Prussian tutelage.&lt;ref name=&quot;oslo2000&quot;/&gt; Such racist texts, originally published from the 18th century on, were republished by the German Reich prior to and after its [[Invasion of Poland]].

[[Frederick the Great]] nourished a particular hatred and contempt for Polish people. Following his conquest of Poland, he compared the Poles to &quot;Iroquois&quot; of Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janowski&quot;/&gt; In his all-encompassing anti-Polish campaign, even the nobility of Polish background living in Prussia were obliged to pay higher taxes than that of German heritage. Polish monasteries were viewed as &quot;lairs of idleness&quot; and their property often seized by Prussian authorities. The prevalent Catholicism among Poles was stigmatized. The Polish language was persecuted on all levels.

When Poland lost the last vestiges of its independence in 1795 and [[partitions of Poland|remained partitioned for 123 years]], ethnic Poles were subjected to discrimination in two areas: the [[Germanization]] under [[Prussia]]n and later German rule, and [[Russification]] in the territories annexed by the [[Imperial Russia]].

Being a Polish person under the Russian occupation was in itself almost culpable – wrote Russian historian [[Liudmila Gatagova]]. – &quot;Practically all of the Russian government, bureaucracy, and society were united in one outburst against the Poles.&quot; – &quot;Rumor mongers informed the population about an order that had supposedly been given to kill [...] and take away their land.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatagova&quot;/&gt; [[Polish culture]] and religion were seen as threats to Russian imperial ambitions. Tsarist [[Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland|Namestniks]] suppressed them on Polish lands by force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolbilov&quot; /&gt; Russian anti-Polish campaign, which included confiscation of Polish nobles' property,&lt;ref name=&quot;RSCI&quot;/&gt; was being waged in the arenas of education, religion as well as language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolbilov&quot; /&gt; Polish schools and universities were being closed in a stepped up campaign of russification. In addition to executions and mass [[Sybirak|deportations of Poles]] to [[Katorga]] camps, [[Tsar Nicholas I]] established an occupation army at Poland's expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFJ&quot;/&gt;

The fact that Poles – unlike the Russians – were overwhelmingly of Catholic faith, gave impetus to their religious persecution. At the same time, with the emergence of [[Panslavism|Panslavist]] ideology, Russian writers accused the Polish nation of betraying their &quot;Slavic family&quot; because of their armed efforts aimed at winning independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLS&quot;/&gt; Hostility toward Poles was present in many of Russia's literary works and media of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;W-S&quot;/&gt; {{quote|&quot;During and after the [[November Uprising|1830-1831 insurrection]] many Russian writers voluntarily participated in anti-Polish propaganda. [[Gogol]] wrote ''Taras Bulba'', an anti-Polish novel of high literary merit, to say nothing about lesser writers.&quot; &lt;small&gt;— Prof. [[Vilho Harle]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harle&quot;/&gt;}}

[[Pushkin]], together with three other poets, published a pamphlet called &quot;On the Taking of Warsaw&quot; to celebrate the crushing of [[November Uprising|the revolt]]. His contribution to the frenzy of anti-Polish writing was composed of poems in which he hailed the capitulation of Warsaw as a new &quot;triumph&quot; of imperial Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shkandrij&quot;/&gt;

In Prussia, and later in Germany, Poles were forbidden to build homes, and their properties were targeted for forced buy-outs financed by the Prussian and German governments. Otto von Bismarck described Poles, as animals (wolves), that &quot;one shoots if one can&quot; and implemented several harsh laws aiming at their expulsion from traditionally Polish lands. The Polish language was banned from public, and ethnically Polish children tortured at schools for speaking Polish.&lt;ref name=&quot;hist&quot;/&gt; Poles were subjected to a wave of forceful evictions (''Rugi Pruskie''). The German government financed and encouraged settlement of ethnic Germans into those areas aiming at their geopolitical Germanisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyklopedia&quot;/&gt; The Prussian Landtag passed laws against Catholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;christopher&quot;/&gt;

Toward the end of [[World War I]] during Poland's fight for independence, [[Imperial Germany]] made further attempts at taking control over the territories of [[Congress Poland]], aiming at a ''population transfer'' of Polish and Jewish people which was meant to be followed by a new wave of settlement by ethnic Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berghahn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt; In August 1914 the German imperial army [[Destruction of Kalisz|destroyed the city of Kalisz]], chasing out tens of thousands of its Polish citizens.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Persecution of Poles (1918–39)===
After Poland regained its independence as [[Second Polish Republic|the Second Republic]] at the end of World War I, the question of new Polish borders could not have been easily settled against the will of her former long-term occupiers. Poles continued to be persecuted in the disputed territories, especially in [[Silesia]]. The German campaign of discrimination contributed to the [[Silesian Uprisings]], where Polish workers were openly threatened with losing their jobs and pensions if they voted for Poland in the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cienciala&quot;/&gt;

In inter-war Germany, anti-Polish feelings ran high.&lt;ref name=&quot;G-W&quot;/&gt; The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] observed that for many Germans in the Weimar Republic, Poland was an abomination, whose people were seen as &quot;an East European species of cockroach&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;G-W&quot; /&gt; Poland was usually described as a ''Saisonstaat'' (a state for a season).{{clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name=&quot;G-W&quot; /&gt; In inter-war Germany, Germans used the phrase &quot;Polish economy&quot; (''polnische Wirtschaft'') to describe any situation that was a hopeless muddle.&lt;ref name=&quot;G-W&quot; /&gt; Weinberg noted that in the 1920s–30s, every leading German politician refused to accept Poland as a legitimate nation, and hoped instead to partition Poland with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;G-W&quot; /&gt;

The British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] wrote in 1945 that National Socialism was inevitable because the Germans wanted &quot;to repudiate the equality with the peoples of (central and) eastern Europe which had then been forced upon them&quot; after 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamilton&quot;/&gt; Taylor wrote that:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;During the preceding eighty years the Germans had sacrificed to the ''Reich'' all their liberties; they demanded as a reward the enslavement of others. No German recognized the Czechs or Poles as equals. Therefore, every German desired the achievement which only total war could give. By no other means could the ''Reich'' be held together. It had been made by conquest and for conquest; if it ever gave up its career of conquest, it would dissolve.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hamilton1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The largest ethnic shooting and deportation action during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bookhaven&quot;/&gt; known as the [[Polish Genocide in the Soviet Union]],&lt;ref name=&quot;naukowa.pl&quot;/&gt; occurred approximately from August 25, 1937 till November 15, 1938. According to archives of the Soviet [[NKVD]], 111,091 Poles, and people accused of ties with Poland, were executed, and 28,744 sentenced to death-ridden [[labor camp]]s; amounting to 139,835 Polish victims in total. This number constitutes 10% of the officially persecuted persons during the entire [[Yezhovshchina]] period, with confirming NKVD documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLoughlin&quot;/&gt; The coordinated actions of the Soviet NKVD and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1937-1938 against [[Poles in the former Soviet Union|Polish minority]] living in the Soviet Union, representing only 0.4 percent of Soviet citizens, amounted to an [[Genocide definitions|ethnic genocide]] as defined by the UN convention, concluded historian [[Michael Ellman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;paulbogdanor&quot;/&gt; His opinion is shared by [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Montefiore&quot;/&gt; Prof. [[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rp.pl&quot;/&gt; and Dr [[Tomasz Sommer]] among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;thepolishreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;se.pl&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historyton.pl&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiara.pl&quot;/&gt; In a typical [[Stalinist]] fashion, the murdered Polish families were accused of &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; activities and state terrorism.&lt;ref name=&quot;global364&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;polishclub.org&quot;/&gt;

===World War II===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Execution of Poles by German Einsatzkomanndo Oktober1939.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Germans execute Poles against a prison wall, [[Leszno]], Poland, October 1939]]
Hostility toward Polish people reached a particular peak during [[World War II]], when Poles became the subject of ethnic cleansing on an unprecedented scale, including: [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Nazi German genocide]] in [[General Government]], [[Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)|Soviet executions and mass deportations]] to [[Siberia]] from [[Kresy]], as well as [[massacres of Poles in Volhynia]], a campaign of ethnic cleansing carried out in today's western Ukraine by Ukrainian nationalists. Millions of citizens of Poland, both ethnic Poles and Jews, died in German [[concentration camp]]s such as [[Auschwitz]]. Unknown numbers perished in Soviet &quot;[[gulag]]s&quot; and political prisons.

Soviet policy following their 1939 [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in World War II was ruthless, and sometimes coordinated with the Nazis (see: [[Gestapo-NKVD Conferences]]). Elements of [[ethnic cleansing]] included Soviet mass executions of Polish [[prisoners of war]] in the [[Katyn Massacre]] and at other sites, and the exile of up to [[Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939-1946)|1.5 million Polish citizens]], including the [[intelligentsia]], academics and priests, to forced-labor camps in [[Siberia]].

In German and Soviet war propaganda, Poles were mocked as inept for their military techniques in fighting the war. Nazi fake newsreels and forged pseudo-documentaries claimed that the [[Polish cavalry]] &quot;bravely but futilely&quot; charged German tanks in 1939, and that the [[Polish Air Force]] was wiped out on the ground on the opening day of the war. Neither tale was true (see: [[Polish September Campaign#Misconceptions|Myths of the Polish September Campaign]]). German propaganda staged a Polish cavalry charge in their 1941 reel called &quot;Geschwader Lützow&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chakoten&quot;/&gt;

Poland's relationship with the USSR during WWII was tricky. The main Western Powers, the US and UK, understood the importance of the USSR in defeating Germany, to the point of allowing Soviet propaganda to vilify their Polish ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies0&quot;/&gt; During World War II, [[E. H. Carr]], the assistant editor of ''[[The Times]]'', was well known for his leaders (editorials) taking the Soviet side in Polish-Soviet disputes. In a leader of February 10, 1945, Carr questioned whether the Polish government in exile even had the right to speak on behalf of Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;integrity110&quot;/&gt; Carr wrote that it was extremely doubtful to him whether the Polish government had “an exclusive title to speak for the people of Poland, and a ''liberum veto'' on any move towards a settlement of Polish affairs” as well as that the “legal credentials of this Government are certainly not beyond challenge if it were relevant to examine them: the obscure and tenuous thread of continuity leads back at best to a constitution deriving from a quasi-Fascist ''coup de Etat''”.&lt;ref name=&quot;integrity110&quot;/&gt; Carr ended his leader with the claim that “What Marshal Stalin desires to see in Warsaw is not a puppet government acting under Russian orders, but a friendly government which fully conscious of the supreme impotence of Russo-Polish concord, will frame its independent policies in that context”.&lt;ref name=&quot;integrity110&quot;/&gt; The western Allies were even willing to help cover up the Soviet massacre at Katyn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stachura0&quot;/&gt; Even today Katyn is not accepted in the West as a war crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies1&quot;/&gt;

===Postwar era===
With the conclusion of the Second World War, Nazi atrocities perforce ended. However, Soviet oppression of the Poles continued. Under [[Joseph Stalin]], thousands of soldiers of Poland's [[Home Army]] (''[[Armia Krajowa]]'') and returning veterans of the Polish Armed Forces that had served with the Western Allies were imprisoned, tortured by [[NKWD]] agents (see: [[Witold Pilecki|W. Pilecki]], [[Łukasz Ciepliński|Ł. Ciepliński]]) and murdered following [[staged trial]]s like the infamous [[Trial of the Sixteen]] in Moscow. A similar fate awaited the [[Cursed soldiers]]. At least 40,000 members of Poland’s Home Army were deported to Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikolajczyk1&quot;/&gt;

In Britain after 1945, the British people initially accepted those Polish servicemen who chose not to return to a Poland ruled by the Communists. The Poles resident in Britain served under British command during the Battle of Britain,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stachure1&quot;/&gt; but as soon as the Soviets began to make gains on the Eastern Front both public opinion and the Government of the UK turned pro-Soviet and against the Poles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stachure1&quot;/&gt; Supporters of the socialists made the Poles out to be &quot;warmongers&quot;, &quot;anti-Semites&quot; and &quot;fascists&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stachure2&quot;/&gt; After the war, the trade unions and Labour party played on the fears of there not being enough jobs, food and housing. There were even anti-Polish rallies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stachure2&quot;/&gt;

In 1961, a book was published in Germany entitled ''Der Erzwungene Krieg'' (The Forced War) by the American historical writer and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[David Hoggan]], which argued that Germany did not commit aggression against Poland in 1939, but was instead the victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy against the ''Reich''.&lt;ref name=&quot;international&quot;/&gt; Reviewers have often noted that Hoggan seems to have an obsessive hostility towards the Poles. His claims included that the Polish government treated Poland's German minority far worse than the German government under Adolf Hitler treated its Jewish minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawidowicz&quot;/&gt; In 1964, much controversy was created when two German right-wing extremist groups awarded Hoggan prizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;/&gt; In the 1980s, the German philosopher and historian [[Ernst Nolte]] claimed that in 1939 Poland was engaged in a campaign of genocide against its ethnic German minority, and has strongly implied that the German invasion in 1939, and all of the subsequent German atrocities in Poland during World War II were in essence justified acts of retaliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pantheon56&quot;/&gt; Critics, such as the British historian [[Richard J. Evans]], have accused Nolte of distorting the facts, and have argued that in no way was Poland committing genocide against its German minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;pantheon56&quot;/&gt;

During the political transformation of the Soviet-controlled Eastern bloc in the 1980s, the traditional German anti-Polish feeling was again openly exploited in the [[East Germany]] against [[Solidarność]]. This tactic had become especially apparent in the &quot;rejuvenation of '[[Polish jokes]],' some of which reminded listeners of the spread of such jokes under the Nazis.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google3&quot;/&gt;

==References to Nazi German death camps in occupied Poland by Western media==
[[File:P Oboz.jpg|thumb|left|200px|German [[concentration camp]] [[badge|patch]] with the letter &quot;P&quot;: required wear for Polish inmates]]
{{main|&quot;Polish death camp&quot; controversy }}
The expressions offensive to Poles are attributed to a number of non-Polish media in relation to {{nowrap|World War II}}. The most prominent is a continued reference by Western news media to &quot;Polish death camps&quot; and &quot;Polish concentration camps&quot;. These phrases refer to the network of [[concentration camp]]s operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland in order to facilitate the &quot;[[Final Solution]]&quot;, but the wording suggests that the Polish people might have been involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;polishembassy.ca&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auschwitz.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dziennik.com&quot;/&gt;

The Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], as well as [[Polish diaspora|Polish organizations]] around the world and all [[Polish government]]s since 1989, condemned the usage of such expressions, arguing that they suggest Polish responsibility for the camps. The [[American Jewish Committee]] stated in its January 30, 2005, press release: &quot;This is not a mere semantic matter. Historical integrity and accuracy hang in the balance.... Any misrepresentation of Poland's role in the Second World War, whether intentional or accidental, would be most regrettable and therefore should not be left unchallenged.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc&quot;/&gt;

On April 30, 2004, a [[CTV television network|CTV News]] report made reference to &quot;the Polish camp in Treblinka&quot;. The Polish embassy in Canada lodged a complaint with CTV. Robert Hurst of CTV, however, argued that the expression, &quot;Polish death camp&quot;, is common usage in news organizations including those in the United States, and declined to issue a correction.&lt;ref name=&quot;auschwitz.org2007&quot;/&gt; The Polish Ambassador to Ottawa then complained to the National Specialty Services Panel of the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. The Council did not accept Hurst's argument and ruled against CTV stating that the word &quot;&quot;Polish&quot;—similarly to such adjectives as &quot;English&quot;, &quot;French&quot; and &quot;German&quot;—had connotations that clearly extended beyond geographic context. Its use with reference to Nazi extermination camps was misleading and improper&quot;. CTV broadcast the decision during prime time.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa-1&quot;/&gt; The Polish Ministry of Foreign affairs has stated. &quot;That example of a successful campaign against the distortion of historic truth by the media – and in defense of the good name of Poland – will hopefully reduce the number of similar incidents in the future.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa-1&quot; /&gt;

Also cited as a similar example of anti-Polish sentiment{{who|date=May 2011}} is the phrase &quot;Polish Nazis&quot; used in relation to non-Polish paramilitary groups operating on Polish soil during World War II,&lt;ref name=&quot;maxveritas&quot;/&gt; disseminated by Norwegian State Broadcasting Corporation, NRK.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRK-1&quot;/&gt; The Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem officially considered this claim by NRK a falsification &quot;offensive to historical truth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;maxveritas&quot; /&gt;

==Hostility today==
===Russia===
In 2005, continued violent crimes against Poles in Moscow prompted the then Polish President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] to call on the Russian government to stop them. &quot;In my capacity as president of the Polish Republic – Kwaśniewski said in an official statement – I address, to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, an appeal calling on the Russian authorities to undertake energetic action to identify and punish the organizers and perpetrators of the assaults.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscow&quot;/&gt; An employee with the Polish embassy in Moscow was hospitalized in serious condition after being beaten in broad daylight near the embassy by unidentified men. Three days later, another Polish diplomat was beaten up near the embassy. The following day the Moscow correspondent for the Polish daily ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' was attacked and beaten by a group of Russians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscow&quot; /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Since [[EU enlargement]] in 2004, the UK has experienced mass immigration from Poland (see [[Poles in the United Kingdom]]). It is estimated that the [[Polish British]] community has doubled in size since 2004. The process has been remarkably friendly and successful. However, there have been some instances of anti-Polish sentiment and hostility towards Polish immigrants. The [[far right]] [[British National Party]] argued for immigration from (Central and) Eastern Europe to be stopped and for Poles to be deported.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail-1&quot;/&gt;

In 2007 Polish people living in London reported 42 ethnically motivated attacks against them, compared with 28 in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orla1&quot;/&gt; The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Daniel Kawczynski]] said that the increase in violence towards Poles is in part &quot;a result of the media coverage by the [[BBC]]&quot; whose reporters &quot;won't dare refer to controversial immigration from other countries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;monster1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newstatesman1&quot;/&gt; Kawczynski voiced his criticism of the BBC in the House of Commons for &quot;using the Polish community as a cat's paw to try to tackle the thorny issue of mass, unchecked immigration&quot; only because against Poles &quot;it's politically correct to do so.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;

In 2009 the [[Federation of Poles in Great Britain]] and the [[Foreign relations of Poland|Polish Embassy]] in London with [[Barbara Tuge-Erecinska]], raised a number of formal complaints – including with the Press Complaints Commission – about news articles that defamed Poles. The PCC arranged a deal between the Federation and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', which ran the articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyMail0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buzzle1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZPWB1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Media1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent2&quot;/&gt; The Embassy also questioned the [[veracity (ethics)|veracity]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' report by Kate Connolly about an alleged &quot;storm of protest in Poland&quot; in response to a film about a Jewish underground resistance movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt; The Polish Embassy stated on March 11, 2009, disproving the claim: &quot;This embassy has been in touch with [the film's] only distributor in Poland, Monolith Plus, and we have been told that this film has not experienced any form of booing, let alone been banned by any cinemas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2&quot;/&gt; ''The Guardian'' was also forced by PCC to publish an admission that another article by [[Simon Jenkins]], from September 1 – which accused Poles of wartime suicide – &quot;repeated [[Polish September Campaign#Nazi propaganda|a myth fostered by Nazi propagandists]], when it said that Polish lancers turned their horses to face Hitler's panzers. There is no evidence that this occurred.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gandul0&quot;/&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' has been noted for a number of other controversies. On October 14, 2009, Nazi-hunter [[Efraim Zuroff]] alleged that: &quot;the second world war narrative [...] has been distorted since independence and the transition to democracy to make it more palatable to their electorate and to minimize the role of local collaborators in Holocaust crimes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E-Z&quot;/&gt; On October 20, 2009, ''The Guardian's'' [[Jonathan Freedland]] said: &quot;We are meant to be friendly towards the newest members of the European Union. But the truth is that several of these &quot;emerging democracies&quot; have reverted to a brand of ultra-nationalistic politics that would repel most voters in western Europe. It exists in Poland&quot;. In response to the above attacks [[Timothy Garton Ash]] wrote in the same paper on 23 December: &quot;In my experience, the automatic equation of Poland with Catholicism, nationalism and antisemitism – and thence a slide to guilt by association with the Holocaust – is still widespread. This collective stereotyping does no justice to the historical record.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;T-G-A&quot;/&gt;

Writing in ''The Guardian'', British [[Foreign Secretary]] [[David Miliband]] described Poland's conservative [[Law and Justice]] party as &quot;[[far right]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;D-M&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2009&quot;/&gt; His language sparked a protest by [[Daniel Hannan]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', who said on October 29, 2009, that the British [[Foreign Secretary]] David Miliband should apologize to the people of Poland. Hannan wrote that Miliband's &quot;increasingly unhinged allegations have been greeted with horror in Poland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph-2&quot;/&gt; However, more diatribes reminiscent of wartime propaganda included also ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'s'' own article by Julian Kossoff who wrote on November 13, 2009, about the alleged &quot;anti-Semitism embedded in Polish history,&quot; an &quot;episode of Polish bloodlust and nightmarish slaughter&quot; and &quot;the unspeakable guilt of the Polish collaborators.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph-3&quot;/&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph's'' [[Gerald Warner]] complained about Kossoff's &quot;insulting attack on Catholics and Poles which grotesquely misrepresents historical fact and which, if leveled at almost any other targets, would probably be characterized as a '[[hate crime]]'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph-1&quot;/&gt; There is, however, over millennium-long record of [[History of Jews in Poland|positive relations]] between Poles and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1450298?seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K2DgBdSCQnsC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Jews+in+Poland+good#v=onepage&amp;q=Jews%20in%20Poland%20good&amp;f=false |title=The Jews of Poland: A Social and Economic History of the Jewish Community in ... - Bernard Dov Weinryb - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the largest contingent of [[Righteous among the Nations]] who saved the Jews during the [[World War II]] is the Polish contingent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/statistics.asp |title=Statistics - The Righteous Among The Nations |publisher=Yad Vashem |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008 the Polish ambassador sent an official protest to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] about ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name=T-C /&gt; On July 26, 2008, columnist [[Giles Coren]] had a comment piece published there with the [[ethnic slur]] '[[Polack]]' used to describe Polish immigrants. He accused Poland of complicity in the six million Jewish deaths of [[The Holocaust]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Two waves of immigration Poles apart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orla2&quot;/&gt;  prompting not only an official letter of complaint to ''The Times'', but also an [[early day motion]] in the [[UK parliament]], followed by an editorial in ''[[The Economist]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;P-UK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakow1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orla3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist-08-14&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coren2008&quot;/&gt; The ambassador, Tuge-Erecinska, explained that the article was &quot;unsupported by any basic historic or geographic knowledge,&quot; and that &quot;the issue of Polish-Jewish relations has been unfairly and deeply falsified&quot; by Coren's &quot;aggressive remarks&quot; and &quot;contempt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;T-C&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T-T&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JC1&quot;/&gt; Coren reacted by telling [[The Jewish Chronicle]]: &quot;''Fuck the Poles''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Coren#assault&gt;[http://thejc.thejc.com/articles/coren-launches-his-own-assault-poland  Coren launches his own assault, available at thejc.thejc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orla4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leeds1&quot;/&gt; The case has been referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orla4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Duke of Cumberland&quot;/&gt; The editor of ''The Jewish Chronicle'', [[Stephen Pollard]], commented on August 6, 2009: &quot;There are few things more despicable than anti-Semitism, but here's one of them: using a false charge of anti-Semitism for political gain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hannan&quot;/&gt;

On October 6, 2009, [[Stephen Fry]] was interviewed by [[Jon Snow]] on ''[[Channel 4 News]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Fry's fears over Tories' anti-gay links&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JC2&quot;/&gt; as a signatory of a letter to British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[David Cameron]] expressing concern about the party's relationship with the right-wing Polish [[Law and Justice]] Party in the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Charter&quot;/&gt; During the interview, Fry stated: &quot;There has been a history, let's face it, in Poland of a right-wing Catholicism which has been deeply disturbing for those of us who know a little history, and remember [[Polish death camp controversy|which side of the border Auschwitz was on]]...&quot; The remark prompted a complaint from the Polish Embassy in London, as well as an editorial in ''[[The Economist]]'' and criticism from British Jewish historian [[David Cesarani]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Europe.view&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Fry's Auschwitz blunder&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew Day 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;channel4&quot;/&gt; Fry has since posted an apology on his personal weblog, in which he stated: &quot;It was a rubbishy, cheap and offensive remark that I have been regretting ever since... I take this opportunity to apologize now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stephenfry1&quot;/&gt; On October 30, 2009, the Chief Rabbi of Poland, [[Michael Schudrich]], complained about this new British political row playing on a &quot;'false and painful stereotype that all Poles are antisemitic', whereas the truth was that the problem was around the same there as elsewhere in Europe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;michael-schudrich&quot;/&gt;

===United States===
[[File:nocowanie.jpg|thumb|Sign in Germany, prohibiting overnight stays in cars in a public parking lot - note that the sign is only in Polish. However, the font differs from that on official signs.]]

On November 14, 2007, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] aired the episode of ''Back to You'', &quot;[[Something's Up There]]&quot;, which contained a controversial [[Poland|Polish]] slur. The slur involved Marsh trying to convince the show's lone Polish-American character, Gary, to go bowling after work by saying: &quot;Come on, it's in your blood, like [[kielbasa]] and collaborating with the [[Nazis]].&quot; Fox later apologized on November 20, 2007. They vowed never to air the line of dialogue again in repeats and/or syndicated broadcasts. Fox stated that, &quot;The line was delivered by a character known for being ignorant, clueless, and for saying outlandish things. Allowing the line to remain in the show, however, demonstrated poor judgment, and we apologize to anyone who was offended.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamed Fox apologizes for Polish slur on 'Back to You'&quot;/&gt;

==&quot;Polish jokes&quot;==
{{main|Polish joke}}
&quot;Polish jokes&quot; belong to a category of conditional jokes, meaning that their understanding requires knowledge of ''what a Polish joke is.'' Conditional jokes depend on the audience's ''affective'' preference—on their likes and dislikes. Though these jokes might be understood by many, their success depends entirely on the negative disposition of the listener.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;/&gt;

Presumably the first Polish jokes by German [[displaced person]]s fleeing war-torn Europe were brought to America in the late 1940s. These jokes were fueled by ethnic slurs disseminated by German [[National Socialist]] propaganda, which attempted to justify the Nazis' murdering of Poles by presenting them as &quot;''dreck''&quot;—dirty, stupid and inferior.&lt;ref name=&quot;bibliografia&quot;/&gt; It is also possible that some early American ''[[Polack]]'' jokes from Germany were originally told before World War II in disputed border regions such as [[Silesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie_Davies&quot;/&gt;

There is debate as to whether the early &quot;Polish jokes&quot; brought to states such as [[Wisconsin]] by German immigrants relate directly to the wave of American jokes of the early 1960s. A &quot;provocative critique of previous scholarship on the subject&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google4&quot;/&gt; has been made by British writer [[Christie Davies]] in ''The Mirth of Nations'', which suggests that &quot;Polish jokes&quot; did not originate in Nazi Germany but much earlier, as an outgrowth of regional jokes rooted in &quot;social class differences reaching back to the nineteenth century.&quot; According to Davies, American versions of Polish jokes are an unrelated &quot;purely American phenomenon&quot; and do not express the &quot;historical Old World hatreds of the Germans for the Poles.  However Hollywood in the 1960s and 1970s imported the subhuman-intelligence jokes about Poles from old Nazi propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie_Davies_2&quot;/&gt;

For decades, Polish Americans have been the subject of derogatory jokes originating in anti-immigrant stereotypes that had developed in the U.S. before the 1920s. During the [[Partitions of Poland]], Polish immigrants came to America in considerable numbers, fleeing mass persecution at home. They were taking the only jobs available to them, usually requiring physical labor. The same ethnic and job-related stereotypes persisted even as Polish Americans joined the middle class in the mid-20th century. &quot;The constant derision, often publicly disseminated through the mass media, caused serious identity crises, feeling of inadequacy, and low self-esteem for many Polish Americans.&quot; In spite of the plight of Polish people under Cold War communism, negative stereotypes about Polish Americans endured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulera&quot;/&gt;

Since the late 1960s, [[Polish American]] organizations have made continuous effort to challenge the negative stereotyping of the Polish people once prevalent in American media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulera&quot; /&gt; The Polish American Guardian Society has argued that NBC-TV used the tremendous power of TV to introduce and push subhuman intelligence jokes about Poles (that were worse than prior simple anti-immigrant jokes) using the repetitive big lie technique to degrade Poles. The play called “Polish Joke” by [[David Ives]] has resulted in a number of complaints by the Polonia in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;polishcultureacpc&quot;/&gt; The &quot;Polish jokes&quot; heard in the 1970s were particularly offensive, so much so that the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs approached the U.S. State Department about that, however unsuccessfully. The syndrome receded only after Cardinal [[Karol Wojtyła]] was elected pope, and Polish jokes became passé.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond&quot;/&gt; Gradually, Americans have developed a more positive image of their Polish neighbors in the following decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pulera&quot; /&gt;

==Use of the term in a modern political context==
The term &quot;anti-Polonism&quot; is said to have been used for campaign purposes by political parties such as the [[League of Polish Families]] ({{lang-pl|Liga Polskich Rodzin}}) or [[Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland]] ({{lang-pl|Samoobrona Rzeczpospolitej Polskiej}})&lt;ref name=&quot;samoobrona&quot;/&gt; as well as by Polish far-right organizations such as Association against Anti-Polonism led by former presidential candidate and leader of extremist [[Polish National Party]] Leszek Bubel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cas&quot;/&gt; Bubel was taken to court by a group of ten well-known Polish intellectuals who filed a lawsuit against him for &quot;violating the public good&quot;. Among the signatories were: former Foreign Minister [[Władysław Bartoszewski]] and filmmaker [[Kazimierz Kutz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;antisemitism&quot;/&gt;

According to writer Joanna Michlic the term is used in Poland also as an argument against the self-critical intellectuals who discuss Polish-Jewish relations, accusing them of &quot;anti-Polish positions and interests.&quot; For example, historian [[Jan T. Gross]] has been accused of being anti-Polish when he wrote about crimes such as the [[Jedwabne pogrom]]. In her view, the charge is &quot;not limited to arguments that can objectively be classified as anti-Polish—such as equating the Poles with the Nazis—but rather applied to any critical inquiry into the collective past. Moreover, anti-Polonism is equated with anti-Semitism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;21michlic&quot;/&gt; Publisher Adam Michnik wrote for the New York Times that &quot;almost all Poles react very sharply when confronted with the charge that Poles get their anti-Semitism 'with their mothers' milk'.&quot; (see: [[Yitzhak Shamir]]'s outburst in an interview with ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', 1989-9-08.) Such verbal attacks – according to Michnik – are interpreted by anti-Semites as &quot;proof of the international anti-Polish Jewish conspiracy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michnik-NYT&quot;/&gt; For the 1994 anniversary of the [[Warsaw Uprising]], a Polish ''Gazeta Wyborcza'' journalist, Michał Cichy, wrote a review of a collection of 1943 memoirs entitled ''Czy ja jestem mordercą?'' (''Am I a murderer?'') by [[Calel Perechodnik]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CP&quot;/&gt; a [[Jewish Ghetto Police|Jewish ghetto policeman]] from Otwock and member of the &quot;[[Chrobry II Battalion]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;RB&quot; /&gt; alleging (as hearsay) that about 40 Jews were killed by a group of Polish insurgents during the 1944 Uprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strzembosz&quot;/&gt;  Unlike the book (later reprinted with factual corrections), the actual review by Cichy elicited a fury of protests,&lt;ref name=&quot;RB&quot;/&gt; while selected fragments of his article were confirmed by three Polish historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neighbors-1&quot;/&gt; Prof. [[Tomasz Strzembosz]] accused Cichy of practicing a 'distinct type of racism,' and charged ''Gazeta Wyborcza'' editor [[Adam Michnik]] with 'cultivating a species of tolerance that is absolutely intolerant of antisemitism yet regards anti-Polonism and [[wiktionary:antigoyism|anti-goyism]] as something altogether natural'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson&quot;/&gt; Michnik responded to the controversy by praising the heroism of the AK, while asking &quot;Is it an attack on Polish people when the past is being explored to seek the truth?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPJS&quot;/&gt; Cichy later apologized for the tone of his article,&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;/&gt; but not for the erroneous facts.&lt;ref name=&quot;RB&quot; /&gt;

The notion of anti-Polonism has been used in some instances as a justification for Polish antisemitism. Cardinal [[Józef Glemp]] in his controversial and widely criticized speech delivered on August 26, 1989 (and retracted in 1991)&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;/&gt; argued that the outbursts of antisemitism are a &quot;legitimate form of national self-defence against Jewish 'Anti-Polonism'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;/&gt; He &quot;asked Jews who 'have great power over the mass media in many countries' to rein in their anti-Polonism because 'if there won't be anti-Polonism, there won't be such antisemitism among us'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google6&quot;/&gt; Similar concerns, but with less display, were echoed in ''Rethinking Poles and Jews'' by Robert Cherry and Annamaria Orla-Bukowska who noted that anti-Polonism and anti-Semitism remain &quot;grotesquely twinned into our own time. We cannot combat the one without combating the other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google7&quot;/&gt; In 2001 PhD Andrzej Leszek Szcześniak published ''Judeopolonia - the Jewish state in Poland'', explaining the origins of pre-war Jewish saying 'our tenements, your streets'. In 2002 Stanisław Wysocki published ''Antypolonizm Żydów polskich'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Antipolishness of the Polish Jews'') naming incidents in Polish-Jewish relations, criticised by Prof Jerzy Tomaszewski as selective, unrepresentative and ignorant.
