[[African-American history]] starts in the 16th century with black Africans forcibly taken to Spanish and English [[Colony|colonies]] in America as [[Slavery|slaves]]. After the United States came into being, [[Slavery in the United States|black people continued to be enslaved]] and [[Racism in the United States|treated as much inferior]]. These circumstances were changed by [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], development of the [[African-American culture|black community]], participation in the great [[Military history of African Americans|military conflicts of the United States]], [[racial segregation]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]] was the first African-American to be elected [[president of the United States]]. The geographical-origin-based [[#Terminology|term &quot;African American&quot;]] is commonly used interchangeably with &quot;black American&quot;, although skin-color-based terms are sometimes considered disparaging.

==History==
{{Main|African-American history}}

===Slavery era===
{{Main|Slavery in the United States|Atlantic slave trade}}
The first African slaves arrived in the present-day United States as part of the [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] colony (most likely located in the [[Winyah Bay]] area of present-day [[South Carolina]]), founded by Spanish explorer [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]] in 1526. The ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local Native Americans. De Ayllón and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned, leaving the escaped slaves behind on North American soil.

In 1565, the colony of [[Saint Augustine, Florida|Saint Augustine]] in Florida, founded by [[Pedro Menendez de Aviles]], became the first permanent European settlement in North America. It included an unknown number of free and enslaved Africans that were part of this colonial expedition.

The first recorded Africans in [[British North America]] (including most of the future United States) were &quot;20 and odd negroes&quot; who came to [[Jamestown, Virginia]] via [[Old Point Comfort|Cape Comfort]] in August 1619 as [[indentured servant]]s. As English settlers died from harsh conditions, more and more Africans were brought to work as laborers. Typically, young men or women would sign a [[Indenture|contract of indenture]] in exchange for transportation to the New World. The landowner received 50 acres of land from the state ([[headright]]s) for each servant purchased (around £6 per person (9 months income) in 17th cen) from a ships captain. An indentured servant (who could be white or black) would work for several years (usually four to seven) without wages. The status of indentured servants in early Virginia and Maryland was similar to slavery. Servants could be bought, sold, or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away. Unlike slaves, they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out, their children did not inherit their status, and on their release from contract they received &quot;a year's provision of corn, double apparel, tools necessary&quot; and a small cash payment called &quot;freedom dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Hashaw |title=The First Black Americans |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |publisher=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=January 21, 2007 |accessdate=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-147667728.html?Q=Jamestown |title=The shaping of Black America: forthcoming 400th celebration |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date=June 26, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They raised families, marrying other Africans and sometimes intermarrying with Native Americans or [[English American|English settlers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |title=The First Black Americans – US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=January 29, 2007 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110202205901/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm| archivedate= 2 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1640s and 1650s, several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own. In 1655, [[John Casor]] became the first individual known to be legally recognized as a slave in what later became the United States, and Anthony Johnson (one of the 20 Africans who arrived in 1619) the first legally recognized slaveholder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweet2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Frank W.

The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century. The [[Dutch West India Company]] introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into [[New Amsterdam]] (present-day New York City). All the colony's slaves, however, were freed upon its surrender to the British.&lt;ref name = &quot;branchandroot&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodges | first = Russel Graham | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Root and Branch: African Americans in New York and East Jersey, 1613–1863 | place = Chapel Hill, North Carolina | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | year = 1999 | edition = | url = | id = | isbn = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] was the first British colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641. In 1662 Virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women (who were of African descent and thus foreigners) took the status of the mother, rather than that of the father, as under English common law. This principle was called ''[[partus sequitur ventrum]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banks&quot;&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, &quot;Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit - Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia&quot;], 41 ''Akron Law Review'' 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed 21 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PBS.

The first black congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]].

Selig, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent African Americans were [[Prince Whipple]] and Oliver Cromwell, who are both depicted in the front of the boat in [[George Washington]]'s famous ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware|1776 Crossing the Delaware]]'' portrait.

By 1860, there were 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the United States due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and another 500,000 African Americans lived free across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm |last=Boddy-Evans |first=Alistair |title=The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade |work=African History |publisher=about.com |accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, during the [[American Civil War]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

===Reconstruction and Jim Crow===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era of the United States|Jim Crow laws}}
[[File:Jesse Owens3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesse Owens]] shook racial stereotypes both with Nazis and
segregationists in the USA at the 1936 Berlin olympics.]]
African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves, as well as schools, community and civic associations, to have space away from white control or oversight. While the post-war reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, in the late 1890s, Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce [[racial segregation]] and [[disfranchisement after the American Civil War|disenfranchisement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creating Jim Crow: In-Depth Essay |last=Davis |first=Ronald L.F., PhD |work=The History of Jim Crow |publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]] |accessdate=June 7, 2007 |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070601223741/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm| archivedate= 1 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most African Americans followed the Jim Crow laws, using a mask of compliance to prevent becoming victims of [[ethnic violence|racially motivated violence]]. To maintain self-esteem and dignity, African Americans such as [[Anthony Overton]] and [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] continued to build their own [[Historically black colleges and universities|schools]], [[Black church|churches]], banks, social clubs, and other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/surviving.htm |title=Surviving Jim Crow |last=Davis |first=Ronald, PhD |work=The History of Jim Crow |publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade of the 19th century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States. These discriminatory acts included [[racial segregation]]—upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] in 1896&lt;ref&gt;''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' {{Ussc|163|537|1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government, voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities.

===Great Migration and Civil Rights Movement===
{{Main|Great Migration (African American)|African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)}}
The desperate conditions of African Americans in the South that sparked the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pbs.org/wnet/aaworld/reference/articles/great_migration.html |title=The Great Migration |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |work=African American World |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |year=2002 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012201420/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/aaworld/reference/articles/great_migration.html |archivedate = October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined with a growing African American community in the Northern United States, led to a movement to fight violence and discrimination against African Americans that, like [[abolitionism]] before it, crossed racial lines. The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] from 1954 to 1968 was directed at abolishing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against African Americans, particularly in the Southern United States. The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

Johnson put his support behind passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and [[Trade union|labor unions]], and the Voting Rights Act (1965), which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections. By 1966, the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] to include economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;abbeville&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp |title=The March On Washington, 1963 |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |publisher=Abbeville Press| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071012121716/http://abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp| archivedate= 12 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically and economically, blacks have made substantial strides during the post-civil rights era. In 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African-American elected governor in U.S. history. There is currently one black governor; governor [[Deval Patrick]] of Massachusetts. [[Clarence Thomas]] became the second African-American Supreme Court Justice. In 1992 [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] of [[Illinois]] became the first black woman elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. There were 8,936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 black mayors.

In 1790, when the first [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the African American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country. The vast majority were slaves, with only 488,000 counted as &quot;[[Freedman|freemen]]&quot;. By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million. In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the South, but large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions, and to escape [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial violence. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million [[black people]] moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, [[New Great Migration|that trend reversed]], with more African Americans moving south to the [[Sun Belt]] than leaving it.

The following table of the African American population in the United States over time shows that the African American population, as a percentage of the total population, declined until 1930 and has been rising since then.

By 1990, the African American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/aap/timelin2.html |title=Time Line of African American History, 1881–1900 |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 38.9 million Americans identified as &quot;Black or African American,&quot; representing 12.6% of the population. Controversy has surrounded the &quot;accurate&quot; population count of African Americans for decades. The NAACP believed it was under counted intentionally to minimize the significance of the black population in order to reduce their political power base{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

At the time of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]], 54.8% of African Americans lived in the [[Southern United States|South]]. In that year, 17.6% of African Americans lived in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and 18.7% in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], while only 8.9% lived in the [[Western United States|western]] states. The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas, however. California, the nation's most populous state, has the fifth largest African American population, only behind New York, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin,&lt;ref name = &quot;tthqvu&quot;/&gt; many of whom may be of [[Afro-Brazilian|Brazilian]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[Dominican American|Dominican]], [[Afro-Cuban|Cuban]], [[Haitian American|Haitian]], or other [[Afro-Latin American|Latin American]] descent. The only self-reported ''ancestral'' groups larger than African Americans are the [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German American|Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf |title=c2kbr01-2.qxd |format=PDF |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110102014403/http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf| archivedate= 2 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many African Americans trace their ancestry to colonial American origins, some simply self-identify as &quot;[[American ethnicity|American]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===U.S. cities===
{{Further|List of U.S. cities with large African American populations|List of U.S. metropolitan areas with large African-American populations}}
Almost 58% of African Americans lived in [[metropolitan area]]s in 2000. With over 2 million black residents, New York City had the largest black urban population in the United States in 2000, overall the city has a 28% black population. Chicago has the second largest black population, with almost 1.6 million African Americans in its metropolitan area, representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population.

Among cities of 100,000 or more, [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2010, with 82%. Other large cities with African American majorities include [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] (60%), [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] (63%) [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] (54%, see [[African Americans in Atlanta]]), [[Memphis, Tennessee]] (61%), and Washington, D.C. (50.7%).

The nation's most affluent county with an African American majority is [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], with a median income of $62,467. Within that county, among the wealthiest communities are [[Glenn Dale, Maryland]] and [[Fort Washington, Maryland]]. Other affluent predominantly African American counties include [[DeKalb County, Georgia|Dekalb County]] in Georgia, and [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]] in Virginia. [[Queens|Queens County, New York]] is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans.&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education outcomes in the United States by race and other classifications}}
[[File:Neil deGrasse Tyson - NAC Nov 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] is an [[astrophysicist]]]]

By 2000, African Americans had advanced greatly. They still lagged overall in education attainment compared to white or Asian Americans, with 14 percent with four year and 5 percent with advanced degrees, though it was higher than for other minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Issued August 2003: Educational Attainment by race and gender: Census 2000 Brief.&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans attend college at about half the rate of whites, but at a greater rate than Americans of Hispanic origin. More African American women attend and complete college than men. [[Black school]]s for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the U.S., and a pattern towards re-segregation is currently occurring{{date missing}} across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kozol, J. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051219/kozol &quot;Overcoming Apartheid&quot;, ''The Nation''. December 19, 2005. p. 26].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historically black colleges and universities]] remain today which were originally set up when segregated colleges did not admit African Americans. As late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. By 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Public Information Office, [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. [http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2000/cb00-151.html High School Completions at All-Time High, Census Bureau Reports]. September 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed high school, less than whites or Asians, but more than Hispanics. On many college entrance, standardized tests and grades, African Americans have historically lagged behind whites, but some studies suggest that the [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap]] has been closing. Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as [[affirmative action]], desegregation, and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closingtheachievementgap.org/cs/ctag/print/htdocs/home.htm |title=California|publisher=Closing the Achievement Gap |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chicago, [[Marva Collins]], an African-American educator, created a low cost private school specifically for the purpose of teaching low-income African American children whom the public school system had labeled as being &quot;[[learning disabled]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvacollins.com/comments.html |title=Marva Collins Seminars, Inc |publisher=Marvacollins.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One article about Marva Collins' school stated,
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Working with students having the worst of backgrounds, those who were working far below grade level, and even those who had been labeled as 'unteachable,' Marva was able to overcome the obstacles. News of third grade students reading at ninth grade level, four-year-olds learning to read in only a few months, outstanding test scores, disappearance of behavioral problems, second-graders studying Shakespeare, and other incredible reports, astounded the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edocere.org/articles/marva_collins.htm |title=Excerpts from Ordinary Children, Extraordinary Teachers and Marva Collins’ Way |publisher=Edocere.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt; During the 2006–2007 school year, Collins' school charged $5,500 for tuition, and parents said that the school did a much better job than the Chicago public school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=6188122&amp;section=news/local |title=Marva Collins School to close |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, during the 2007–2008 year, Chicago public school officials claimed that their budget of $11,300 per student was not enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26515276/ Chicago students skip school in funding protest], Associated Press, September 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic status===
Economically, African Americans have benefited from the advances made during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights era]], particularly among the educated, but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalization when considered as a whole. The racial disparity in poverty rates has narrowed. The black middle class has grown substantially. In 2010, 45% of Africa-Americans owned their homes, compared to 67% of all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0883976.html |title=Homeownership Rates by Race and Ethnicity of Householder — |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poverty rate among African Americans has decreased from 26.5% in 1998 to 24.7% in 2004, compared to 12.7% for all Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeNavas-Walt&quot;/&gt; African Americans have a combined buying power of over $892 billion currently and likely over $1.1 trillion by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizreport.com/2008/02/report_affluent_africanamericans_have_45_of_buying_power.html |title=Report: Affluent African-Americans have 45% of buying power |publisher=Bizreport.com |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS218860+06-Feb-2008+PRN20080206 |title=Buying Power Among African Americans to Reach $1.1 Trillion by 2012 |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, African American-owned businesses accounted for 1.2 million of the US's 23 million businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/6AUOAL4XD  Minority Groups Increasing Business Ownership at Higher Rate than National Average, Census Bureau Reports] U.S. Census Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 African American-owned business account for approximately 2 million [[US businesses]].&lt;ref name=Tozzi&gt;{{cite web|last=Tozzi |first=John |url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2010/sb20100715_469797.htm |title=Minority Businesses Multiply But Still Lag Whites |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black-owned businesses experienced the largest growth in number of businesses among minorities from 2002 to 2011.&lt;ref name=Tozzi/&gt;

African Americans are still underrepresented in government and employment. In 1999, the median income of African American families was $33,255 compared to $53,356 of European Americans. In times of economic hardship for the nation, African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and [[underemployment]], with the black underclass being hardest hit. The phrase &quot;last hired and first fired&quot; is reflected in the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] unemployment figures. Nationwide, the October 2008 unemployment rate for African Americans was 11.1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm |title=BLS.gov |publisher=BLS.gov |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101213004820/http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm| archivedate= 13 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the nationwide rate was 6.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS14000000 |title=BLS.gov |publisher=Data.bls.gov |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110120154929/http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS14000000| archivedate= 20 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary issues==

African Americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African American middle class across the United States. Unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of American government has been gained by African Americans in the post-civil rights era.

Nevertheless, due in part to the legacy of [[slavery]], racism and discrimination, African Americans as a group remain at a pronounced economic, educational and social disadvantage in many areas relative to European Americans. Persistent social, economic and political issues for many African Americans include inadequate health care access and delivery; [[institutional racism]] and discrimination in housing, education, policing, [[criminal justice]] and employment; crime, poverty and [[substance abuse]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

One of the most serious and long standing issues within African American communities is poverty.

Historically, African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves; at the time, the Republicans and Democrats represented the [[sectionalism|sectional]] interests of the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]], respectively, rather than any specific ideology, and both [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]] were represented equally in both parties.

The African American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] program provided economic relief to African Americans; Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies, regardless of region. The African American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s.

After over 50 years, marriage rates for ''all'' Americans began to decline while divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have climbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.hoover.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817998721_95.pdf |title=psi:output_files:HPTHER$$$6.PS |format=PDF |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes have been greatest among African Americans. After more than 70 years of racial parity black marriage rates began to fall behind whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.hoover.org&quot;/&gt; Single-parent households have become common, and according to US census figures released in January 2010, only 38 percent of black children live with both their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/families_households/cb10-08.html |title=Census Bureau Reports Families With Children Increasingly Face Unemployment, US Census Bureau, January 15, 2010 |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Democrats overwhelmingly voted 70% against [[California Proposition 8]], African Americans voted 58% in favor of it while 42% voted against Proposition 8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/issues/egan_sherrill_prop8_1_6_09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2012, Barack Obama, the first African American president, became the first US president to support same sex marriage. After Obama's endorsement there is a rapid growth in support for same sex marriage among African Americans.

===News media and coverage===
[[Image:20061023-1 d-0330-1-545v.jpg|thumb|BET founder [[Robert L. Johnson]] with former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]]]
Some activists and academics contend that news media coverage of African American news concerns or dilemmas is inadequate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackandbrownnews.com |title=BBN |publisher=blackandbrownnews.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4608039 |title=Examining the Future of Black News Media |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4608042 |title=How Will African Americans Get the News? |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or the news media present distorted images of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mikal Muharrar |title=Media Blackface |publisher=FAIR |date=September/ October 1998 |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1431}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this, [[Robert L. Johnson]] founded [[Black Entertainment Television]], a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States. Most programming on the network consists of [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] music videos and urban-oriented movies and series. The channel also shows syndicated television series, original programs, and some public affairs programs. On Sunday mornings, BET broadcasts a lineup of network-produced Christian programming; other, non-affiliated Christian programs are also shown during the early morning hours daily. BET is now a global network that reaches 90 million households in the United States, Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BET Networks|publisher=Viacom|url=http://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/betnetworks/pages/default.aspx|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to BET there is [[Centric]], which is a spin-off cable television channel of BET, created originally as ''BET on Jazz'' to showcase [[jazz]] music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians. Programming has been expanded to include a block of urban programs as well as some R&amp;B, [[neo soul]], and [[alternative hip hop]], with the focus on jazz reduced to low-profile hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18 ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TV One (Radio One)|TV One]] is another African American-oriented network and a direct competitor to BET, targeting African American adults with a broad range of programming. The network airs original lifestyle and entertainment-oriented shows, movies, fashion and music programming, as well as classic series such as [[227 (TV series)|227]], [[Good Times]], [[Martin (TV series)|Martin]], [[Boston Public]] and [[Showtime at the Apollo|It's Showtime at the Apollo]]. The network primarily owned by [[Radio One (company)|Radio One]]. Founded and controlled by [[Cathy Hughes|Catherine Hughes]], it is one of the nation's largest radio broadcasting companies and the largest African American-owned radio broadcasting company in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackamericastudy.com/ |title=BlackAmericaStudy.com |publisher=BlackAmericaStudy.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110207200823/http://blackamericastudy.com/| archivedate= 7 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural influence in the United States===
{{Further|African-American culture}}
[[Image:Jazzing orchestra 1921.png|thumb|The King &amp; Carter [[Jazz]]ing Orchestra photographed in Houston, Texas, January 1921]]
From their earliest presence in North America, African Americans have contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, foods, clothing styles, music, language, social and technological innovation to American culture.
The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the U.S., such as [[Sweet potato|yams]], peanuts, rice, [[okra]], [[sorghum]], [[grits]], [[watermelon]], [[indigo dye]]s, and cotton, can be traced to African and African American influences. Notable examples include [[George Washington Carver]], who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 from pecans; and [[George Crum]], who invented the potato chip in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml |title=African-American Inventors |accessdate=May 30, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070613230925/http://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml| archivedate= 13 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African American music]] is one of the most pervasive African American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[funk]], [[rock and roll]], [[soul music|soul]], [[blues]], and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music, including [[blues]], [[doo-wop]], [[Barbershop music|barbershop]], [[ragtime]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].
[[File:Bbking (300dpi).jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[B.B. King]] is a [[blues]] guitarist and songwriter acclaimed for his expressive singing and guitar playing]]
African American-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other popular musical genre in the world, including [[Country music|country]] and [[techno]]. African American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;stewart&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Earl L. |year=1998 |title=African American Music: An Introduction |isbn=0-02-860294-3 |page=3 |publisher=Schirmer Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans have also had an important role in American dance. [[Bill T. Jones]], a prominent modern choreographer and dancer, has included historical African American themes in his work, particularly in the piece &quot;Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land&quot;. Likewise, [[Alvin Ailey]]'s artistic work, including his &quot;Revelations&quot; based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s, has had a significant influence on modern dance. Another form of dance, [[Stepping (African-American)|Stepping]], is an African American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

African American inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international [[innovation]].

===Political legacy===
[[File:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] remains the most prominent political leader in the American civil rights movement and perhaps the most influential African American political figure in general.]]
African Americans have [[Military history of African Americans|fought]] in every war in the [[Military history of the United States|history of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48936 |title=Defenselink.mil |publisher=Defenselink.mil |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gains made by African Americans in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights]] and Black Power movements not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways. Prior to the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination, or [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]. They would often be the victims of extreme cruelty and violence, sometimes resulting in deaths: by the post WWII era, African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality. In the words of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to &quot;rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm |title=Martin Luther King, Jr |accessdate=May 30, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070613010952/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm| archivedate= 13 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] marked a sea-change in American social, political, economic and civic life. It brought with it [[boycott]]s, [[sit-in]]s, demonstrations, court battles, bombings and other violence; prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate; forged enduring civic, economic and religious alliances; and disrupted and realigned the nation's two major political parties.

Over time, it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another. The movement resulted in the removal of codified, ''de jure'' racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the [[Free Speech Movement]], the disabled, women, Native Americans, and [[migrant workers]].

==Terminology==
===Political overtones===
The term African American carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than ancestry, and were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry; people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law. The terms were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of white supremacy and [[oppression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xoZ0POyF2YkC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=jesse+jackson+african+american+cultural+base |title=''Out of the Mouths of Slaves: African American Language and Educational Malpractice''|accessdate=January 20, 2011|author=Baugh, John|page=86|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-70873-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; There developed among blacks in America a growing desire for a term of self-identification of their own choosing.

[[File:Michelle Obama official portrait crop.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Michelle Robinson Obama|Michelle Obama]] is the [[First Lady]] of the United States; she and her husband, President Barack Obama, are the first African Americans to hold these positions.]]
With the political consciousness that emerged from the political and social ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s, blacks no longer approved of the term Negro. They believed it had suggestions of a moderate, accommodationist, even &quot;[[Uncle Tom]]&quot; connotation. In this period, a growing number of blacks in the United States, particularly African American youth, celebrated their blackness and their historical and cultural ties with the African continent. The Black Power movement defiantly embraced ''Black'' as a group identifier. It was a term social leaders themselves had repudiated only two decades earlier, but they proclaimed, &quot;[[Black is beautiful]]&quot;.

In this same period, a smaller number of people favored ''Afro-American'', a common shortening (as is 'Anglo-American'). However, after the decline in popularity of the 'Afro' hairstyle in the late 1970s, the term fell out of use.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the 1980s the term ''African American'' was advanced on the model of, for example, [[German-American]] or Irish-American to give descendants of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery-era]] a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and a cultural base.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after [[Jesse Jackson]] publicly used the term in front of a national audience. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

Some such as [[Maulana Karenga]] and [[Owen Alik Shahadah]] argue African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates geography and historical origin. Thus linking a people to a continent as opposed to an abstract color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm |title=Language for a New African Reality |publisher=Africanholocaust.net |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;Black,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=September 26, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100906124630/http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/Black-African-American.aspx| archivedate= 6 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have a slight preference for &quot;Black&quot; in personal settings and &quot;African American&quot; in more formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Miller| first1 = Pepper| last2 = Kemp|first2=Herb | title = What's Black About?

Some argued further that, because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the United States under [[Slavery|chattel slavery]], most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.

For many, African American is more than a name expressive of [[culture|cultural]] and historical roots. The term expresses pride in Africa and a sense of kinship and solidarity with others of the [[African diaspora]]—an embrace of pan-Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[George Padmore]].

{{African American topics sidebar}}
Since 1977, in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion, the United States government has officially classified black people (revised to ''black'' or ''African American'' in 1997) as &quot;having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;censusblack&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-5.pdf |first=Jesse |last=McKinnon |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |format=PDF |title=The Black Population: 2000 United States Census Bureau| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071025063946/http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-5.pdf| archivedate= 25 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal offices, such as the [[United States Census]] Bureau, adhere to the OMB standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity |year=1997 |publisher=Office of Management and Budget}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the United States 2010 Census, a marketing and outreach plan, called ''2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan'' (ICC) recognized and defined African Americans as black people born in the United States. From the ICC perspective, African Americans are one of three groups of black people in the United States&lt;ref name = &quot;US2010ICCBlkAud&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= 2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan |url= http://2010.census.gov/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|work= 2010 Census|publisher= U.S. Census Bureau|page= 225|format=PDF |date= August 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012|quote = The Black audience includes all individuals of Black African descent. There are three major groups that represent the Black Audience in the United States. These groups are African Americans (Blacks born in the United States), Black Africans (Black Immigrants from Africa) and Afro-Caribbeans, which includes Haitians.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;US2010ICCBstRch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= 2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan|url=http://2010.census.gov/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|work= 2010 Census|publisher= U.S. Census Bureau|page=230|format=PDF |date= August 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012|quote = Community, both geographic and ethnic, creates a sense of belonging and pride that is unique to the Black audience (African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and Black Africans).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the U.S. as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background. The U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes black or African American people as &quot;A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa&quot; through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook (1978) and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, derived from the 1977 OMB classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBIpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf |title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice.

Historically, &quot;race mixing&quot; between [[Black (people)|black]] and [[White American|white]] people was taboo in the United States. So-called [[anti-miscegenation laws]], barring blacks and whites from marrying or having sex, were established in [[colonial America]] as early as 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In her opinion, President Barack Obama, who is the son of a Kenyan immigrant, although technically African-American, is not black.&lt;ref name=&quot;colorblind-salon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;colbertnation.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/81955/february-08-2007/debra-dickerson?videoId=81955 |title=The Colbert Report |author=Debra Dickerson |date=February 8, 2007 |publisher=colbertnation.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She makes the argument that grouping all people of African descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American community of slave descendents, in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds. &quot;Lumping us all together&quot;, Dickerson wrote, &quot;erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;colorblind-salon&quot;/&gt;

Similar viewpoints have been expressed by [[Stanley Crouch]] in a New York Daily News piece, [[Charles Steele, Jr.]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2008/06/21/sclc_head_michelle_obama_treat.html |title=SCLC head: Michelle Obama treated more roughly than her husband, because of her slave heritage|work=Atlanta Journal Constitution-Ajc.com |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and African-American columnist [[David Ehrenstein]] of the [[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]] who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were &quot;[[Magic Negro]]s&quot;, a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white (as cultural protagonists/drivers) agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama the 'Magic Negro'&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Obama the 'Magic Negro' | date=March 19, 2007 | first=David | last=Ehrenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrenstein went on to say &quot;He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama the 'Magic Negro'&quot;/&gt;

Former Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] (who was famously mistaken for a &quot;recent American immigrant&quot; by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,309218,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Nicolas Sarkozy Mistakes Condoleezza Rice for Recent Immigrant | date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; said &quot;descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start, and I think you continue to see some of the effects of that.&quot; She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African-Americans and instead prefers the term &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; to denote the African and European U.S. founding populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bbaaghs.org/news/?p=10 |title=Book Excerpt: Condoleezza Rice: An American Life |author=Elisabeth Bumiller |date=December 22, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms no longer in common use===
The terms [[mulatto]] and [[colored]] were widely used until the second quarter of the 20th century, when they were considered outmoded and generally gave way to the use of ''negro''. By the 1940s, the term commonly was capitalized, [[Negro]], but by the mid 1960s it was considered disparaging.  By the end of the twentieth century &quot;Negro&quot; had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tottie |first=Gunnel |title=An Introduction to American English |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WWDUtK-f1tQC&amp;pg=PA200 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-19792-3 |page=200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Talmadge |coauthors=James Stewart |title=Introduction to African American Studies |url=http://books.google.com/?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&amp;pg=PA3 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Black Classics Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=1-58073-039-6 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is rarely used by younger black people, but remained in use by many older black Americans who had grown up with the term, particularly in the southern U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/they-put-negro-on-there/38094/ |title=They Put 'Negro' on There? |author=Chris Good |date=March 26, 2010 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''negro'' is the Spanish and Portuguese word for the color ''black''. In regions such as [[Latin America]] where these languages are spoken, ''negro'' (pronounced slightly differently than ''Negro'' in English), is a normal word used without disparaging intent in relation to black people.

There are many other deliberately insulting terms. Many were in common use, but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the twentieth century.
