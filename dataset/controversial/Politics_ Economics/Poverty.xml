'''Poverty'''  is the nonexistence of food, shelter, money and clothing that occurs when people cannot satisfy their basic needs. Poverty can be understood simply as a lack of money, or more broadly in terms of barriers to everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook on Poverty and Inequality|author=Jonathan Haughton and Shahidur Khandker|isbn=978-0-8213-7613-3|url=http://issuu.com/world.bank.publications/docs/9780821376133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Extreme poverty|Absolute poverty]] or '''destitution''' refers to the state of severe deprivation of [[basic needs|basic human needs]], which commonly includes food, [[drinking water|water]], sanitation, clothing, shelter, health care, education and information. Relative poverty is defined contextually as [[economic inequality]] in the location or society in which people live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Inequality|publisher=The World Bank|year=2011|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poverty and its measurement - The presentation of a range of methods to obtain measures of poverty|author=Instituto Nacional de Estadistica|year=2009|page=2-3|url=http://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/sociales/pobreza_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of history poverty had been mostly accepted as inevitable as traditional modes of production were insufficient to give an entire population a comfortable standard of living.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/473136/poverty|title=Poverty (sociology)|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macroeconomics1&quot;&gt;Krugman, Paul, and Robin Wells.

The World Bank estimated 1.29 billion people were living in absolute poverty in 2008. Of these, about 400 million people in absolute poverty lived in India and 173 million people in China. In terms of percentage of regional populations, [[Poverty in Africa|sub-Saharan Africa]] at 47% had the highest incidence rate of absolute poverty in 2008. Between 1990 and 2010, about 663 million people moved above the absolute poverty level. Still, extreme poverty is a global challenge; it is observed in all parts of the world, including the developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Bank Sees Progress Against Extreme Poverty, But Flags Vulnerabilities|publisher=The World bank|date=February 29 2012|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/02/29/world-bank-sees-progress-against-extreme-poverty-but-flags-vulnerabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/IND Poverty and Equity - India, 2010 World Bank Country Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

The supply of basic needs can be restricted by constraints on government services such as corruption, [[Developing countries' debt|debt]] and [[Conditionality|loan conditionalities]] and by the [[brain drain]] of health care and educational professionals. Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedom, and providing financial services. Today, [[poverty#Poverty reduction|poverty reduction]] is a major goal and issue for many international organizations such as the United Nations and the [[World Bank]].

===Definitions===
United Nations: Fundamentally, poverty is a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to food and clothing a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one’s food or a job to earn one’s living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin/documents/ydiDavidGordon_poverty.pdf|title=Indicators of Poverty &amp; Hunger|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World Bank]]: Poverty is pronounced deprivation in well-being, and comprises many dimensions. It includes low incomes and the inability to acquire the basic goods and services necessary for survival with dignity. Poverty also encompasses low levels of health and education, poor access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate physical security, lack of voice, and insufficient capacity and opportunity to better one’s life.

Copenhagen Declaration: ''Absolute poverty'' is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information.  It depends not only on income but also on access to social services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf166/aconf166-9.htm World Summit for Social Development 1995 (see Annex II, Section 19)]&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'absolute poverty' is sometimes synonymously referred to as 'extreme poverty.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPRS1/Resources/Country-Papers-and-JSAs/Mozambique_PRSP.pdf Mozambique: ACTION PLAN FOR THE REDUCTION OF ABSOLUTE POVERTY, 2001-2005, The World Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute poverty===
Poverty is usually measured as either [[absolute poverty|absolute]] or [[relative poverty|relative]] (the latter being actually an index of income inequality). Absolute poverty refers to a set standard which is consistent over time and between countries.

For a few years starting 1990, The World Bank anchored absolute poverty line as $1 per day. This was revised in 1993, and through 2005, absolute poverty was $1.08 a day for all countries on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 U.S. dollar. In 2005, after extensive studies of cost of living across the world, The World Bank raised the measure for global poverty line to reflect the observed higher cost of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dollar a Day Revisited|publisher=The World Bank|year=2008|author=Martin Ravallion, Shaohua Chen and Prem Sangraula|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2008/09/02/000158349_20080902095754/Rendered/PDF/wps4620.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] defines [[extreme poverty]] as living on less than US$1.25 ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) per day, and ''moderate poverty''{{cn|date=August 2012}} as less than $2 or $5 a day (but note that a person or family with access to subsistence resources, e.g. [[subsistence farmers]], may have a low cash income without a correspondingly low standard of living – they are not living &quot;on&quot; their cash income but using it as a top up). It estimates that &quot;in 2001, 1.1 billion people had consumption levels below $1 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank-Poverty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:20153855~menuPK:373757~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:336992,00.html |title=The World Bank, 2007, Understanding Poverty |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''dollar a day'', in nations that do not use the U.S. dollar as currency, does not translate to living a day on the amount of local currency as determined by the [[exchange rate]].&lt;ref name=dollar&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7122356.stm|title=When a dollar a day means 25 cents|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2011-05-28|first=Mukul|last=Devichand|date=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, it is determined by the [[purchasing power parity]], which would look at how much local currency is needed to buy the same things that a dollar could buy in the United States.&lt;ref name=dollar/&gt; Usually, this would translate to less local currency than the exchange rate in poorer countries as the United States is a more expensive country.&lt;ref name=dollar/&gt;

The poverty line threshold of $1.25 per day, as set by The World Bank, is controversial. Each nation has its own threshold for absolute poverty line; in the United States, for example, the absolute poverty line was US$15.15 per day in 2010 (US$22,000 per year for a family of four),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poverty Definitions|publisher=US Census Bureau|year=2011|url=http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/methods/definitions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in India it was US$ 1.0 per day&lt;ref name=wb2010a/&gt; and in China the absolute poverty line was US$ 0.55 per day, each on PPP basis in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Progress in Development-oriented Poverty Reduction Program for Rural China (1,274 yuan per year = US$ 0.55 per day)|publisher=The Government of China|year=2011|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/official/2011-11/16/content_1994729_3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different poverty lines make data comparison between each nation's official reports qualitatively difficult. Some scholars argue that The World Bank method sets the bar too high, others argue it is low. Still others suggest that poverty line misleads as it measures everyone below the poverty line the same, when in reality someone living on $1.2 per day is in a different state of poverty than someone living on $0.2 per day. In other words, the depth and intensity of poverty varies across the world and in any regional populations, and $1.25 per day poverty line and head counts are inadequate measures.&lt;ref name=wb2010a&gt;{{cite web|title=World Bank’s $1.25/day poverty measure- countering the latest criticisms|publisher=The World Bank|year=2010|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:22510787~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poverty Measures|publisher=The World Bank|year=2009|url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/93518/Hung_0603/Hu_0603/Module4MeasuringPovertyMeasures.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Poverty: An Ordinal Approach to Measurement|author=Amartya Sen|journal=Econometrica|volume= 44|number= 2|date= March, 1976|pages= 219-231|jstor=1912718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s some of the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia experienced a sharp drop in income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/0,,contentMDK:20153855~menuPK:373757~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:336992,00.html |title=Worldbank.org reference |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] resulted in large declines in GDP per capita, of about 30 to 35% between 1990 and the trough year of 1998 (when it was at its minimum). As a result poverty rates also increased although in subsequent years as per capita incomes recovered the poverty rate dropped from 31.4% of the population to 19.6%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20398986~menuPK:64133163~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html |title=World Bank, Data and Statistics, WDI, GDF, &amp; ADI Online Databases |publisher=[[World Bank]] |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soviet&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0D8163FF931A25753C1A9669C8B63|title=Study Finds Poverty Deepening in Former Communist Countries|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-05-28|date=2000-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Bank data shows that the percentage of the population living in households with consumption or income per person below the poverty line has decreased in each region of the world since 1990:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp |title=World Bank, 2007, Povcalnet Poverty Data |publisher=[[World Bank]] |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The data can be replicated using World Bank 2007 Human Development Indicator regional tables, and using the default poverty line of $32.74 per month at 1993 PPP.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chen and Ravallion, about 1.76 billion people in developing world lived ''above'' $1.25 per day and 1.9 billion people lived ''below'' $1.25 per day in 1981. The world's population increased over the next 25 years. In 2005, about 4.09 billion people in developing world lived above $1.25 per day and 1.4 billion people lived below $1.25 per day (both 1981 and 2005 data are on inflation adjusted basis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Developing World Is Poorer Than We Thought, But No Less Successful in the Fight against Poverty|author=Shaohua Chen and Martin Ravallioniz|date=August 2008|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2010/01/21/000158349_20100121133109/Rendered/PDF/WPS4703.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting poverty in emerging markets - the gloves go on; Lessons from Brazil, China and India|publisher=The Economist|date=November 26 2009|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14979330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars caution that these trends are subject to various assumptions, and not certain. Additionally, they note that the poverty reduction is not uniform across the world; economically prospering countries such as China, India and Brazil have made more progress in absolute poverty reduction than countries in other regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=HAS WORLD POVERTY REALLY FALLEN?|author=Reddy &amp; Miniou|journal=Review of Income and Wealth|volume= 53|number= 3|date= September 2007|url=http://sanjayreddy.squarespace.com/storage/papers/journal-articles/6WorldPovertyroiw.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absolute poverty measure trends noted above are supported by human development indicators, which have also been improving.

===Relative poverty===
Relative poverty views poverty as socially defined and dependent on [[social context]], hence relative poverty is a measure of income inequality. Usually, relative poverty is measured as the percentage of population with income less than some fixed proportion of median income. There are several other different [[income inequality metrics]], for example the [[Gini coefficient]] or the [[Theil Index]].

Relative poverty measures are used as official poverty rates in several developed countries. As such these poverty statistics measure inequality rather than material deprivation or hardship. The measurements are usually based on a person's yearly income and frequently take no account of total wealth. The main poverty line used in the [[OECD]] and the [[European Union]] is based on &quot;economic distance&quot;, a level of income set at 60% of the median household income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Mobility===
Poverty levels are snapshot picture in time that omits the transitional dynamics between levels. Mobility statistics supply additional information about the fraction who leave the poverty level. For example, one study finds that in a sixteen year period (1975 to 1991 in the U.S.) only 5% of those in the lower fifth of the income level were still in that level while 95% transitioned to a higher income category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/fed/annual/1999/ar95.pdf|page=6|title=By Our Own Bootstraps|author=W. Michael Cox |author2=Richard Alm|year=1995|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty levels can remain the same while those who rise out of poverty are replaced by others. The transient poor and chronic poor differ in each society. In a nine year period ending in 2005 for the U.S., 50% of the poorest quintile transitioned to a higher quintile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/incomemobilitystudy03-08revise.pdf| title=Income Mobility in the U.S. from 1996 to 2005| publisher=Department of the Treasury| date=Nov. 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other aspects===
Economic aspects of poverty focus on material needs, typically including the necessities of daily living, such as food, clothing, shelter, or safe drinking water. Poverty in this sense may be understood as a condition in which a person or community is lacking in the basic needs for a minimum standard of well-being and life, particularly as a result of a persistent lack of income.

Analysis of social aspects of poverty links conditions of scarcity to aspects of the distribution of resources and power in a society and recognizes that poverty may be a function of the diminished &quot;capability&quot; of people to live the kinds of lives they value. The social aspects of poverty may include lack of [[information access|access to information]], education, health care, or political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/english/sha/be_v23n1-glossary.htm |title=A Glossary for Social Epidemiology |publisher=World Health Organization |date=March 2002 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofpoverty.org/JOPPURP/JOPPURP.HTM |title=Journal of Poverty |publisher=Journal of Poverty |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poverty may also be understood as an aspect of unequal [[social status]] and inequitable social relationships, experienced as social exclusion, dependency, and diminished capacity to participate, or to develop meaningful connections with other people in society.&lt;ref&gt;H Silver, 1994, social exclusion and [[Solidarity (sociology)|social solidarity]], in International Labour Review, 133 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Simmel, The poor, Social Problems 1965 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P Townsend, 1979, Poverty in the UK, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; Such social exclusion can be minimized through strengthened connections with the mainstream, such as through the provision of [[relational care]] to those who are experiencing poverty.

The World Bank's &quot;Voices of the Poor,&quot; based on research with over 20,000 poor people in 23 countries, identifies a range of factors which poor people identify as part of poverty. These include:

* Precarious livelihoods
* Excluded locations
* Physical limitations
* Gender relationships
* Problems in social relationships
* Lack of security
* Abuse by those in power
* Dis-empowering institutions
* Limited capabilities
* Weak community organizations

David Moore, in his book ''The World Bank'', argues that some analysis of poverty reflect pejorative, sometimes racial, stereotypes of impoverished people as powerless victims and passive recipients of aid programs.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter on Voices of the Poor in David Moore's edited book The World Bank: Development, Poverty, Hegemony (University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultra-poverty, a term apparently coined by Michael Lipton,&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, Michael (1986), 'Seasonality and ultra-poverty', Sussex, IDS Bulletin 17.3&lt;/ref&gt; connotes being amongst poorest of the poor in low-income countries. Lipton defined ultra-poverty as receiving less than 80 percent of minimum caloric intake whilst spending more than 80% of income on food. Alternatively a 2007 report issued by International Food Policy Research Institute defined ultra-poverty as living on less than 54 cents per day.&lt;ref&gt;International Food Policy Research Institute, [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/worlds-most-deprived The World's Most Deprived. Characteristics and Causes of Extreme Poverty and Hunger], Washington: IFPRI Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The effects of poverty may also be causes, as listed above, thus creating a &quot;poverty cycle&quot; operating across multiple levels, individual, local, national and global.

===Education===
{{See also|Impact of health on intelligence}}
[[File:Afghan girl begging.jpg|thumb|Afghan girl begging in [[Kabul]].]]
Research has found that there is a high risk of educational underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This often is a process that begins in primary school for some less fortunate children. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, these children are at a higher risk than other children for retention in their grade, special placements during the school's hours and even not completing their high school education.&lt;ref name=&quot;SYF&quot;&gt;Huston, A. C. (1991). Children in Poverty: Child Development and Public Policy. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are indeed many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. For children with low resources, the risk factors are similar to others such as [[juvenile delinquency]] rates, higher levels of [[teenage pregnancy]], and the economic dependency upon their low income parent or parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;SYF&quot; /&gt;
Families and society who submit low levels of investment in the education and development of less fortunate children end up with less favorable results for the children who see a life of parental employment reduction and low wages. Higher rates of early [[pregnancy|childbearing]] with all the connected risks to family, health and well-being are majorly important issues to address since education from preschool to high school are both identifiably meaningful in a life.&lt;ref name=&quot;SYF&quot; /&gt;

Poverty often drastically affects children's success in school. A child's &quot;home activities, preferences, mannerisms&quot; must align with the world and in the cases that they do not these students are at a disadvantage in the school and most importantly the classroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANF&quot;&gt;Solley, Bobbie A. (2005). When Poverty's Children Write: Celebrating Strengths, Transforming Lives. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is safe to state that children who live at or below the poverty level will have far less success educationally than children who live above the poverty line. Poor children have a great deal less healthcare and this ultimately results in many absences from the academic year. Additionally, poor children are much more likely to suffer from hunger, fatigue, irritability, headaches, ear infections, flu, and colds.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANF&quot; /&gt; These illnesses could potentially restrict a child or student's focus and concentration.

Most of the children living in institutions around the world have a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty.&lt;ref name=orphanages&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/africa/06orphans.html Aid gives alternatives to African orphanages]&lt;/ref&gt; Experts and child advocates maintain that orphanages are expensive and often harm children's [[child development|development]] by separating them from their families.&lt;ref name=orphanages/&gt; It is speculated that, flush with money, orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died.&lt;ref name=orphanages/&gt;

==Poverty reduction==
{{main|Poverty reduction}}
{{see also|Aid|Development aid}}
Various poverty reduction strategies are broadly categorized here based on whether they make more of the basic human needs available or increase the [[disposable income]] needed to purchase those needs. Some basic needs, such as improving access to education, may also help increase income.

===Increasing the supply of basic needs===
Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], poverty had been mostly accepted as inevitable as economies produced little, making wealth scarce.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; Geoffrey Parker wrote that &quot;In [[Antwerp]] and [[Lyon]], two of the largest cities in [[western Europe]], by 1600 three-quarters of the total population were too poor to pay taxes, and therefore likely to need relief in times of crisis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]] (2001). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=qy8y8rHgucoC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Europe in crisis, 1598–1648]''&quot;. Wiley–Blackwell. p.11. ISBN 0-631-22028-3&lt;/ref&gt; The initial industrial revolution led to high economic growth and eliminated mass absolute poverty in what is now considered the developed world.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

====Food and other goods====
Agricultural technologies such as [[nitrogen fertilizer]]s, pesticides and new irrigation methods have dramatically reduced food shortages in modern times by boosting yields past previous constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |publisher=Theatlantic.com |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Justin Rowlatt |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ethicalman/2009/03/is_the_green_movement_part_of_the_problem.html|title=BBC Ethical Man |publisher=BBC  |date=2009-03-24 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mass production]] of goods in places such as rapidly industrializing China has made what were once considered luxuries, such as vehicles and computers, inexpensive and thus accessible to many who were otherwise too poor to afford them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/world/asia/27laos.html|title=In Laos, Chinese motorcycles change lives|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Thomas|last=Fuller|date=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0625/p12s01-woaf.html?page=2 |title=China boosts African economies, offering a second opportunity |publisher=Csmonitor.com|date=2007-06-25 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; About 60 per cent of illicit capital flight from Africa is from [[transfer mispricing]], where a [[subsidiary]] in a developing nation sells to another subsidiary or [[shell company]] in a [[tax haven]] at an artificially low price in order to pay less tax.&lt;ref name=transparency&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/06/20116188244589715.html|title==‘Transparency’ hides Zambia’s lost billions|work=[[Al-Jazeera]]|date=2011-June-18|accessdate=2011-July-26|first=Khadija|last=Sharife}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[African Union]] reports estimates that about 30% of sub-Saharan Africa's GDP has been moved to [[tax haven]]s.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/jan/21/business.theobserver2|title=Western bankers and lawyers 'rob Africa of $150bn every year'|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=2007-01-21|accessdate=2011-07-05|first=Nick|last=Mathiason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions include corporate “country-by-country reporting” where corporations disclose activities in each country and thereby prohibit the use of tax havens where no effective economic activity occurs.&lt;ref name=transparency/&gt;

''Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, Progress Report.'' Retrieved from [http://worldbank.org Worldbank.org].&lt;/ref&gt; If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for basic services such as health-care and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4081220.stm|title=African debt relief|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Andrew|last=Walker|date=2005-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Zambia]] spent 40% of its total budget to repay foreign debt, and only 7% for basic state services in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcentric.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcentric.org/conscious-living/third-world-debt|title=Third World Debt|publisher=worldcentric.org|accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the proposed ways to help poor countries has been [[debt relief]].

The [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], as primary holders of developing countries' debt, attach [[structural adjustment]] [[Conditionality|conditionalities]] to loans which generally include the elimination of state subsidies and  the privatization of state services.

====Income grants====

{{Main|Guaranteed minimum income|Social security|Welfare}}
A [[guaranteed minimum income]] ensures that every citizen will live be able to purchase a desired level of basic needs. A more specific policy, called a [[basic income]] (or [[negative income tax]]) is a system of [[social security]], that periodically provides each citizen, rich or poor, with a sum of money that is [[sufficient]] to live on. In parts of [[Namibia]], where such a program pays only $13 a month, people were able to pay tuition fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, while child malnutrition rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew by 10%.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,642310,00.html|title=A new approach to aid: How a basic income program saved a Namibian village|work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Namibians line up&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415814.stm|title=Namibians line up for free cash|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=2011-05-28|date=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that a basic income is more economically efficient than a [[minimum wage]] and [[unemployment benefit]]s, as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers, causing [[deadweight loss|losses in efficiency]].

====Financial services====

{{See also|Microcredit}}
Another form of aid is microloans, made famous by the [[Grameen Bank]], where small amounts of money are loaned to farmers or villages, mostly women, who can then obtain physical capital to increase their economic rewards. For example, the [[Thailand|Thai]] government's People's Bank, makes loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. However, microlending has been criticized for making hyperprofits off the poor even from its founder, [[Muhammad Yunus]] and in India which has seen a growing wave of defaults and suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/business/global/06micro.html|title=Microlenders, honored with Nobel, are struggling|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Vikas|last=Bajaj|date=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/world/asia/18micro.html|title=India microcredit faces collapse from defaults|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-05-27|first1=Lydia|last1=Polgreen|first2=Vikas|last2=Bajaj|date=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/opinion/15yunus.html|title=Sacrificing microcredit for megaprofits|work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-05-27|first=Muhammad|last=Yunus|date=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural factors to productivity====
{{see also|Protestant work ethic}}
Cultural factors, such as discrimination of various kinds, can negatively affect productivity such as [[ageism|age discrimination]], [[stereotype|stereotyping]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/cchd/epic/www/causesofpovertya.html |title=Ending Poverty in Community (EPIC) |publisher=Usccb.org |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sexism|gender discrimination]], [[racism|racial discrimination]], and [[caste|caste discrimination]].{{cn|date=August 2012}}

Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott. 1966. ''Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives.'' Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; However, researchers{{Who|date=November 2009}} have gathered evidence that suggest that values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement into and out of poverty, as opposed to shifts in values.&lt;ref name=kerbo2006a&gt;Kerbo, Harold. 2006.

[[Image:Giotto - Legend of St Francis - -05- - Renunciation of Wordly Goods.jpg|thumb|left|150px|St. [[Francis of Assisi]] renounces his worldly goods in a painting attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone]].]]
Among some individuals, poverty is considered a necessary or desirable condition, which must be embraced to reach certain spiritual, moral, or intellectual states. Poverty is often understood to be an essential element of [[nekkhamma|renunciation]] in religions such as [[Buddhism]] (only for monks, not for lay persons) and [[Jainism]], whilst in Roman Catholicism it is one of the [[evangelical counsels]].

[[Benedict XVI]] distinguishes “poverty ''chosen''” (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and “poverty ''to be fought''” (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20090101_world-day-peace_en.html|title=World Peace Day Address 2009|publisher=The Vatican|date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word poverty comes from old French poverté (Modern French: pauvreté), from Latin paupertās, from pauper (poor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language|author=Walter Skeat|year=2005|isbn=978-0486440521|publisher=Dover Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word &quot;poverty&quot; via [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] povert.{{cn|date=August 2012}} There are several definitions of poverty depending on the context of the situation in is placed in and the views of the person giving the definition.

Argues that ideal measures of poverty should: (1) measure comparative historical variation effectively; (2) be relative rather than absolute; (3) conceptualize poverty as social exclusion; (4) assess the impact of taxes, transfers, and state benefits; and (5) integrate the depth of poverty and the inequality among the poor. Next, this article evaluates sociological studies published since 1990 for their consideration of these criteria. This article advocates for three alternative poverty indices: the interval measure, the ordinal measure, and the sum of ordinals measure. Finally, using the [[Luxembourg Income Study]], it examines the empirical patterns with these three measures, across advanced capitalist democracies from 1967 to 1997. Estimates of these poverty indices are made available.&lt;/small&gt;
