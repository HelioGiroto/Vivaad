==Etymology==
The word ''Taliban'' is Pashto, {{lang|ps|طالبان}} ''{{transl|ps|ṭālibān}}'', meaning &quot;students&quot;, the plural of ''ṭālib''. This is a [[loanword]] from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|طالب}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭālib}}'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Arabic Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.ectaco.co.uk/main.jsp?do=e-services-dictionaries-word_translate1&amp;status=translate&amp;lang1=23&amp;lang2=ar&amp;source_id=2248807 |title=English &lt;-&gt; Arabic Online Dictionary |publisher=Online.ectaco.co.uk |date=2006-12-28 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus the [[Persian language|Persian]] plural ending ''-ān'' {{lang|ps|ان}} (the Arabic plural being {{lang|ar|طلاب}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭullāb}}'', whereas {{lang|ar|طالبان}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭālibān}}'' is a dual form with the incongruous meaning, to Arabic speakers, of &quot;two students&quot;). Since becoming a loanword in English, ''Taliban'', besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual. For example, [[John Walker Lindh]] has been referred to as &quot;an American Taliban&quot;, rather than &quot;an American Talib&quot;. In the English language newspapers of Pakistan, the word ''Talibans'' is often used when referring to more than one Taliban. The spelling ''Taliban'' has come to predominate over ''Taleban'' in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Curtis |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/06/from_taleban_to_taliban.html |title=From 'Taleban' to 'Taliban' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Emergence===
{{Main|Taliban's rise to power}}
After the fall of the [[communist]] [[Mohammad Najibullah]]-regime in 1992, several Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the [[Peshawar Accord]]. The Peshawar Accord created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an [[interim government]] for a transitional period. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:

{{quote |The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the [[Soviet]]-backed Najibullah government. ... With the exception of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami]], all of the parties... were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992. ... Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and [[Kabul]] generally. ... Shells and rockets fell everywhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;}}

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan expert [[Amin Saikal]] concludes in ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'':

{{quote|Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in [[Central Asia]]. ... [[Islamabad]] could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders... to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions. ...

Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly-created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Horrific crimes were committed by criminals and individuals inside different factions. Rare ceasefires, usually negotiated by representatives of the Islamic State's newly appointed Defense Minister [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], President [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] and later President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] (the interim government), or officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), commonly collapsed within days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt; The countryside in northern Afghanistan, parts of which was under the control of Defense Minister Massoud remained calm and some reconstruction took place. The city of Herat under the rule of Islamic State ally [[Ismail Khan]] also witnessed relative calm.

[[File:Bird's eye view of Kandahar, 2009-12.jpg|thumb|upright|The Taliban emerged as a military force in the southern Afghan city of [[Kandahar]] in 1994.]]
Meanwhile southern Afghanistan was neither under the control of foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. In 1991, the Taliban (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994–1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp. 25–6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] started his movement with fewer than 50 armed [[madrassah]] students in his hometown of [[Kandahar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;/&gt; The most often-repeated story and the Taliban's own story of how Mullah Omar first mobilized his followers is that in the spring of 1994, neighbors in [[Singesar]] told him that the local governor had abducted two teenage girls, shaved their heads, and taken them to a camp where they were raped. 30 Taliban (with only 16 rifles) freed the girls, and hanged the governor from the barrel of a tank. Later that year, two militia commanders killed civilians while fighting for the right to [[sodomize]] a young boy. The Taliban freed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning the Taliban numbered in the hundreds, were badly equipped and low on munitions. Within months however 15,000 students arrived from the [[madrassas]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Felbab-Brow&gt;{{cite book|last=Felbab-Brow|first=Vanda|title=Shooting up: counterinsurgency and the war on drugs|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8157-0328-0|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban's first major military activity was in 1994, when they marched northward from [[Maywand District|Maiwand]] and captured [[Kandahar|Kandahar City]] and the surrounding provinces, losing only a few dozen men.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rashid 2000 27–29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=27–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When they took control of Kandahar in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashid 2000 27–29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (5)&quot;/&gt; The Taliban also took-over a border crossing at Spin Baldak and an ammunition dump from [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. In the course of 1994, the Taliban took control of 12 of 34 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provinces]] not under central government control. Militias controlling the different areas often surrendered without a fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb |Rashid|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Omar's original commanders were &quot;a mixture of former small-unit military commanders and [[madrassa]] teachers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Goodson|2001 | p = 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time most of the militia factions (Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami, Dostum's Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's [[Defense Minister]] [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]. Bombardment of the capital came to a halt and the Islamic State initiated measures to restore law and order to the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2005|url=http://www.afghanistanjusticeproject.org/warcrimesandcrimesagainsthumanity19782001.pdf |title =Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity: 1978–2001 | publisher = Afghanistan Justice Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;&gt;Amnesty International. &quot;Document - Afghanistan: further information on fear for safety and new concern: deliberate and arbitrary killings: civilians in Kabul.&quot; 16 November 1995 Accessed at [http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA11/015/1995/en/6d874caa-eb2a-11dd-92ac-295bdf97101f/asa110151995en.html Amnesty.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;International Committee of the Red Cross&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1995|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jly2.htm |title =Afghanistan: escalation of indiscriminate shelling in Kabul| publisher =International Committee of the Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud furthermore tried to initiate a nationwide [[political process]] with the goal of national [[Democratic consolidation|consolidation]] and [[democratic]] elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; Ahmad Shah Massoud, known as the &quot;Lion of Panjshir&quot;, had been named &quot;the Afghan who won the Cold War&quot; by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A conversation about recent events in Afghanistan  |url =http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/3199 |date=March 26, 2001|work=[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had defeated the [[Soviet Red Army]] nine times in north-eastern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/27/massoud.afghanistan/ |title = He would have found Bin Laden| publisher = CNN | date=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping for the Taliban to be allies in bringing stability to Afghanistan, Massoud invited the Taliban to join the consolidation process and to contribute to stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; Unarmed, Massoud went to talk to a Taliban leaders in [[Maidan Shar]] to convince them to join the initiated political process, so that democratic elections could be held to decide on a future government for Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; The Taliban declined to join such a political process. When Massoud returned unharmed to Kabul, the Taliban leader who had received him as his guest was killed by other senior Taliban for failing to execute Massoud while the possibility had presented itself.

In a bid to establish their rule over Afghanistan, the Taliban started shelling the capital in early 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;/&gt; [[Amnesty International]], referring to the Taliban offensive, wrote in a 1995 report:
{{quote|This is the first time in several months that Kabul civilians have become the targets of rocket attacks and shelling aimed at residential areas in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;/&gt;}}
The Taliban, however, suffered a devastating defeat against government forces of the Islamic State under the command of Ahmad Shah Massoud. The Taliban's early victories in 1994 were followed by a series of defeats that resulted in heavy losses which led analysts to believe that the Taliban movement as such might have run its course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (5)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-01.htm#P81_13959|title =II.

====Anti-Taliban resistance under Massoud====

[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], former enemies, created the United Front ([[Northern Alliance]]) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. The United Front included beside the dominantly [[Tajik people|Tajik]] forces of Massoud and the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] forces of Dostum, [[Hazara people|Hazara]] troops led by [[Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq]] and [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] forces under the leadership of commanders such as [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] and [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]. Notable politicians and diplomats of the United Front included [[Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai]], [[Abdullah Abdullah]] and [[Masood Khalili]]. From the Taliban conquest of Kabul in September 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[Ghōr Province|Ghōr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]].

After longstanding battles especially for the northern city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Junbish forces were defeated by the Taliban and their allies in 1998. Dostum subsequently went into exile. Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only major anti-Taliban leader inside Afghanistan who was able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Taliban.

In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the [[Women's Rights]] Declaration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite book| last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = Marcela Grad| title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |page=310 | publisher = Webster University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of Massoud, women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa. They were allowed to work and to go to school. In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;
{{quote|It is our conviction and we believe that both men and women are created by the Almighty. Both have equal rights. Women can pursue an education, women can pursue a career, and women can play a role in society – just like men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;|Ahmad Shah Massoud|2001}}
{{quote|Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that 'the cultural environment of the country suffocates women. But the Taliban exacerbate this with oppression.'

Afghan traditions would need a generation or more to overcome and could only be challenged by education, he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; Humayun Tandar, who took part as an Afghan diplomat in the 2001 [[International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn, said that &quot;strictures of language, ethnicity, region were [also] stifling for Massoud. That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-José Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask a Christian friend Jean-José Puig or the Jewish [[Princeton University]] Professor Michael Barry: &quot;Jean-José, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;|National Geographic|Inside the Taliban}}

The Taliban repeatedly offered Massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance. Massoud declined. He explained in one interview:
{{quote|The Taliban say: 'Come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us', and they would keep the highest office in the country, the presidentship. But for what price?!

The United Front in its [http://www.peace-initiatives.com/frame.htm Proposals for Peace] demanded the Taliban to join a political process leading towards nationwide democratic elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt; In early 2001 Massoud employed a new strategy of local military pressure and global political appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Steve Coll| authorlink = Steve Coll| title =Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |edition=February 23, 2004 |page=720| publisher =Penguin Press HC | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resentment was increasingly gathering against Taliban rule from the bottom of Afghan society including the Pashtun areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot; /&gt; Massoud publicized their cause &quot;popular consensus, general elections and democracy&quot; worldwide.

From 1999 onwards a renewed process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. While Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks as well as some Pashtun commanders under his United Front command, the famed Pashtun commander [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] received increasing numbers of defecting Pashtun Taliban as &quot;Taliban popularity trended downward&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tomsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=Wars of Afghanistan|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-763-8|page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king [[Zahir Shah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomsen&quot;/&gt; International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which Pulitzer Prize winner [[Steve Coll]] referred to as the &quot;grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance&quot;, said, &quot;It's crazy that you have this today ...

He brought them all into the northern area where he was.

The assassination of Massoud is believed to have a connection to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on U.S. soil, which killed nearly 3000 people, and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first=Mike|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/11/06/massoud.cable/index.html|title=How much did Afghan leader know?|publisher=CNN.com|date=2003-11-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080820231434/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/11/06/massoud.cable/index.html|archivedate=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John P.

From October to December 2001, the United Front gained control of much of the country and played a crucial role in establishing the post-Taliban interim government under Hamid Karzai.

After the September 11 attacks on the U.S. and the [[PENTTBOM]] investigation, the United States made the following demands of the Taliban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/ |title=Transcript of President Bush's address |publisher=CNN|date= 2001-09-21|accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. petitioned the international community to back a military campaign to overthrow the Taliban. The U.N. issued two resolutions on terrorism after the Sept.11 attacks. The resolutions called on all states to &quot;[increase] cooperation and full implementation of the relevant international conventions relating to terrorism&quot; and specified consensus recommendations for all countries. The Security Council did not authorize military intervention in Afghanistan of any kind, and nowhere in the U.N resolutions did it say military operations in Afghanistan were justified or conformed to international law.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations S.C. Res. 1368, September 12, 2001; S.C. Res. 1373, 2001-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, NATO approved a campaign against Afghanistan as self-defense against armed attack.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by the North Atlantic Council, September 12, 2001, in Press Release 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Salem Zaeef, responded to the ultimatum by demanding &quot;convincing evidence&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Burns, John F. &quot;[http://nytimes.com/2001/09/18/continuous/18CND-PAK.html?pagewanted=all Pakistan Says Taliban Demands Evidence That Bin Laden Is Tied to Attacks].&quot; The New York Times. 2001-09-18&lt;/ref&gt; that Bin Laden was involved in the attacks, stating &quot;our position is that if America has evidence and proof, they should produce it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1556919.stm US resolute on Bin Laden hunt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Jones, Gary and Francis, Wayne. &quot;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WAR+ON+TERROR%3A+MUSLIM+ANGER+-+If+America+wants+war,+it+will+happen....-a078505711 WAR ON TERROR: MUSLIM ANGER].&quot; The Mirror. 2001-09-22&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Taliban insisted that any trial of Bin Laden be held in an Afghan court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban 'will try Bin Laden if US provides evidence'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/05/afghanistan.terrorism|work=The Guardian|date=October 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaeef also claimed that &quot;4,000 Jews working in the Trade Center had prior knowledge of the suicide missions, and 'were absent on that day.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; This response was generally dismissed as a delaying tactic, rather than a sincere attempt to cooperate with the ultimatum.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/01/tl.00.html America Speaks Out: What's the Next Threat?]&quot; ''TalkBack Live''.

On September 22, the [[United Arab Emirates]], and later [[Saudi Arabia]], withdrew recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan's legal government, leaving neighbouring Pakistan as the only remaining country with diplomatic ties. On October 4, the Taliban agreed to turn bin Laden over to Pakistan for trial in an international [[tribunal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.j-n-v.org/AW_briefings/ARROW_briefing005.htm |title=Briefing 05: The Smoking Gun |publisher=J-n-v.org |date=2001-10-08 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; that operated according to Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, but Pakistan blocked the offer as it was not possible to guarantee his safety.&lt;ref&gt;

Also known in print as &quot;Pakistan halts secret plan for bin Laden trial&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan offered to detain bin Laden and try him under Islamic law if the U.S. made a formal request and presented the Taliban with evidence. A Bush administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the Taliban offer, and stated that the U.S. would not negotiate their demands.&lt;ref&gt;

====Coalition attack====

Still on October 7, and less than one month after the Twin Towers fell, the U.S., aided by the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries including several from the NATO alliance, initiated [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|military action]], bombing Taliban and Al-Qaeda-related camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/gen.america.under.attack/ |title=Afghanistan wakes after night of intense bombings.

The CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) units were the first U.S. forces to enter Afghanistan (noting that many different countries intelligence agencies were on the ground or operating within theatre before SAD, and that SAD are not technically military forces, but civilian paramilitaries). They joined with the Afghan United Front ([[Northern Alliance]]) to prepare for the subsequent arrival of U.S. Special Operations forces. The United Front (Northern Alliance) and SAD and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] combined to overthrow the Taliban with minimal coalition casualties, and without the use of international conventional ground forces. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated in an editorial by John Lehman in 2006:

{{quote|What made the Afghan campaign a landmark in the U.S. Military's history is that it was prosecuted by Special Operations forces from all the services, along with [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] tactical power, operations by the Afghan Northern Alliance and the CIA were equally important and fully integrated.

On October 14, the Taliban offered to discuss handing over Osama bin Laden to a neutral country in return for a bombing halt, but only if the Taliban were given evidence of bin Laden's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/waronterror/story/0,1361,573975,00.html |title=Taliban offers to hand bin Laden to a neutral nation for trial |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. rejected this offer, and continued military operations. [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] fell to United Front troops of [[Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor]] and Abdul Rashid Dostum on November 9, triggering a cascade of provinces falling with minimal resistance.

In November 2001, before the [[Siege of Kunduz|capture of Kunduz]] by United Front troops under the command of [[Mohammad Daud Daud]], thousands of top commanders and regular fighters of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agents and military personnel, and other volunteers and sympathizers in the [[Kunduz airlift]], dubbed the [[Airlift of Evil]] by US military forces around Kunduz and subsequently used as a term in media reports, were evacuated and airlifted out of [[Kunduz]] by Pakistan Army cargo aircraft to Pakistan Air Force air bases in [[Chitral]] and [[Gilgit]] in Pakistan's [[Northern Areas]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news |first=Romesh |last=Ratnescar |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/10/timep.afghanistan.year.later.tm/index.html |title=Afghanistan: One year on |date=2002-10-10 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www_newyorker_com10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www_msnbc_com11&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Moran |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3340165 |title=The ‘airlift of evil’ |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |publisher=[[msnbc.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite web |last=[[Press Trust of India]] |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=6813 |title=India protests airlift of Pakistani fighters from Kunduz |date=2002-01-24 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |publisher=''[[The Indian Express]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news_bbc_co_uk12&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=George |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1677157.stm |title=Kunduz celebrates end of siege |date=2001-11-26 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=descent&gt;{{cite book |title=''Descent into Chaos: The United States and the Failure of Nation Building in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia'' |last=Rashid |first=Ahmed |year=2008 |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[United States]] |isbn=978-0-670-01970-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of November 12, the Taliban retreated south from Kabul. On November 15, they released eight Western [[aid worker]]s after [[Attacks on humanitarian workers|three months in captivity]]. By November 13, the Taliban had withdrawn from both Kabul and [[Jalalabad]]. Finally, in early December, the Taliban gave up [[Kandahar]], their last stronghold, dispersing without surrendering.

====Resurgence====
{{Main|Taliban insurgency}}
[[File:Neotaliban insurgency 2002-2006 en.png|thumb|Development of a then small Taliban insurgency up until 2006, the year which saw an escalation in Taliban attacks.]]
Before the summer 2006 offensive began, indications existed that soldiers in Afghanistan had lost influence and power to other groups, including potentially the Taliban. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A notable sign was [[riot]]ing in May after a street accident in the city of Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;

The continued support from tribal and other groups in Pakistan, the drug trade, and the small number of NATO forces, combined with the long history of resistance and isolation, indicated that Taliban forces and leaders were surviving. [[Suicide attack]]s and other terrorist methods not used in 2001 became more common. Observers suggested that [[poppy]] eradication, which destroys the livelihoods of rural Afghans, and civilian deaths caused by airstrikes encouraged the resurgence. These observers maintained that policy should focus on &quot;hearts and minds&quot; and on economic reconstruction, which could profit from switching from interdicting to diverting poppy production—to make medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

In September 2006, Pakistan recognized the [[Islamic Emirate of Waziristan]], an association of [[Waziristan]]i chieftains with close ties to the Taliban, as the de facto security force for Waziristan. This recognition was part of the agreement to end the [[War in North-West Pakistan|Waziristan War]], which had exacted a heavy toll on the [[Pakistan Army]] since early 2004. Some commentators viewed [[Islamabad]]'s shift from war to diplomacy as implicit recognition of the growing power of the resurgent Taliban relative to American influence, with the U.S. distracted by the threat of looming crises in [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Iran]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Other commentators viewed Islamabad's shift from war to diplomacy as an effort to appease growing discontent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaces.brad.ac.uk:8080/display/ssispsru/Home |title=Pakistan Security Research Unit (PSRU) |publisher=Spaces.brad.ac.uk:8080 |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Taliban's leadership structure, Mullah Dadullah's [[targeted killing]] in May 2007 did not have a significant effect, other than to damage incipient relations with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Pashtun [[tribe|tribal group]], with over 40 million members (including Afghans and Pakistanis) had a [[Pashtun people#Pashtuns in the modern era|long history]] of resistance to occupation forces, so the Taliban may have comprised only a part of the insurgency. Most post-invasion Taliban fighters were new recruits, mostly drawn from local madrasas.

In early December, the Taliban offered to give the U.S. &quot;legal guarantees&quot; that it would not allow Afghanistan to be used for attacks on other countries. The U.S. ignored the offer, and continued military action.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;/&gt;

====Targeted killings====
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
The United States has conducted [[targeted killings]] against Taliban leaders, mainly using [[Special Forces]], and sometimes [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s. British forces also used similar tactics, mostly in [[Helmand Province]], Afghanistan. During [[Operation Herrick]], British special forces killed at least fifty high and local Taliban commanders in targeted killings in Helmand Province, which received both positive and negative coverage in the British media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/2848942/SAS-men-and-Navy-SEAL-teams-take-out-top-50-Taliban-leaders.html &quot;SAS assassinate Taliban commanders&quot;], Duncan Larcombe, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', February 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban also use targeted killings. In 2011 alone, they [[assassinated]] notable anti-Taliban leaders such as former Afghan President [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], the police chief in northern Afghanistan and the commander of the elite anti-Taliban 303 Pamir Corps, [[Mohammad Daud Daud]] and the police chief of Kunduz, Abdul Rahman Saidkhaili. All belonged to the Massoud faction of the United Front. According to Guantanamo Bay charge sheets, the [[United States Department of Defense]] believes the Taliban maintains a 40-man undercover unit called &quot;Jihad Kandahar&quot;, which is used for [[undercover operation]]s including assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[[OARDEC]] (2007).

===Massacre campaigns===
[[File:Hazara oldman.jpg|thumb|upright|A Hazara man in Afghanistan. The Sunni Taliban regard the Shia Hazaras as apostates.]]
According to a 55-page report by the [[United Nations]], the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic [[massacre]]s against civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; UN officials stated that there had been &quot;15 massacres&quot; between 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; They also said, that &quot;[t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; &quot;These are the same type of war crimes as were committed in Bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts&quot;, one UN official was quoted as saying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt; The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; Bin Laden's so-called [[055 Brigade]] was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot; /&gt; The report by the [[United Nations]] quotes &quot;eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; The Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the Taliban had been &quot;necessary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saturday, 31 December 2011|url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/purso-pal/4847-cruel-behaviour-was-necessary-during-taliban-rule-zaeef-says |title=Taliban spokesman: Cruel behavior was necessary |publisher=Tolonews.com |date=2011-12-31 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the United Nations accused the Taliban of denying emergency food by the UN's World Food Programme to 160,000 hungry and starving people &quot;for political and military reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F8B4F98500EA0F8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Associated Press: U.N. says Taliban starving hungry people for military agenda |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=1998-01-07 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN said the Taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war.

On August 8, 1998 the Taliban launched an attack on [[Mazar-i Sharif]]. Of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people indiscriminately. At first shooting people in the street, they soon began to target Hazaras. Women were raped, and thousands of people were locked in containers and left to suffocate. This [[ethnic cleansing]] left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 dead.&lt;ref name=Armajani&gt;{{cite book|last=Armajani|first=Jon|title=Modern Islamist Movements: History, Religion, and Politics|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-1742-5|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clements3&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time [[1998 Iranian diplomats assassination in Afghanistan|ten Iranian diplomats]] and a journalist were killed. Iran assumed the Taliban had murdered them, and mobilized its army, deploying men along the border with Afghanistan. By the middle of September there were 250,000 Iranian personal stationed on the border. Pakistan mediated and the bodies were returned to Tehran towards the end of the month.

In a major effort to retake the Shomali plains from the United Front, the Taliban indiscriminately killed civilians, while uprooting and expelling the population. Among others, Kamal Hossein, a special reporter for the [[UN]], reported on these and other [[war crimes]]. The city of [[Istalif]] i. e. was home to more than 45,000 people. In Istalif the Taliban gave 24 hours notice to the population to leave, then completely razed the town leaving the people destitute.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Coburn|first=Noah|title=Bazaar Politics: Power and Pottery in an Afghan Market Town|year=2011|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0804776725|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the town of [[Bamian]] was taken, hundreds of men, women and children were executed.

By 1999, the Taliban had forced hundreds of thousands of people from the Shomali Plains and other regions conducting a policy of scorched earth burning homes, farm land and gardens.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;/&gt;

===Human trafficking===

Several Taliban and Al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking, abducting women and selling them into sex slavery in Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,201892,00.html| work=[[Time Magazine]]|title=Lifting The Veil On Taliban Sex Slavery|date=2002-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Magazine]]'' writes: &quot;The Taliban often argued that the brutal restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex. The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine&quot;/&gt;

The targets for human trafficking were especially women from the Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara and other ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Some women preferred to commit suicide over slavery, killing themselves. During one Taliban and Al-Qaeda offensive in 1999 in the Shomali Plains alone, more than 600 women were kidnapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine&quot;/&gt; Taliban as well as Arab and Pakistani Al-Qaeda militants forced them into trucks and buses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine&quot;/&gt; Time Magazine writes: &quot;The trail of the missing Shomali women leads to Jalalabad, not far from the Pakistan border. There, according to eyewitnesses, the women were penned up inside Sar Shahi camp in the desert. The more desirable among them were selected and taken away. Some were trucked to Peshawar with the apparent complicity of Pakistani border guards. Others were taken to Khost, where bin Laden had several training camps.&quot; Officials from relief agencies say, the trail of many of the vanished women leads to Pakistan where they were sold to brothels or into private households to be kept as slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine&quot;/&gt;

Some local Taliban commanders were opposed to the human trafficking ordered and conducted by their leaders. One Taliban commander, Nuruludah, is quoted as saying that he and his men freed some women which were being abducted by Pakistani members of Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine&quot;/&gt; A few local Taliban in Jalalabad also freed women that were being held by other Taliban and members of Al-Qaeda in a camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine&quot;/&gt;

''Taliban''. Yale Nota Bene Books, 2000, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism against civilians===
According to the [[United Nations]], the Taliban were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009, 75% in 2010 and 80% in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNAMA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kegley&gt;{{cite book|last=Kegley|first=Charles W.|title=World Politics: Trend and Transformation|year=2011|publisher=Cengage|isbn=978-0-495-90655-1|page=230|coauthors=Shannon L Blanton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the Taliban's bombings and other attacks which have led to civilian casualties &quot;sharply escalated in 2006&quot; when &quot;at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at non-combatants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/04/16/afghan15688.htm |title=Human Rights News, Afghanistan: Civilians Bear Cost of Escalating Insurgent Attacks |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/afghanistan0407/ |title=The Consequences of Insurgent Attacks in Afghanistan, April 2007, Volume 19, No. 6(C) |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2007-04-16 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the Taliban had increased its use of suicide bombers and targeted unarmed civilian [[aid worker]]s, such as [[Gayle Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7679212.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; UK charity worker killed in Kabul|publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations reported that the number of civilians killed by both the Taliban and pro-government forces in the war rose nearly 50% between 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnoldy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0731/p06s15-wosc.html |title=In Afghanistan, Taliban kills more civilians than US |date= 2009-07-31 |author=Ben Arnoldy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high number of civilians killed by the Taliban is blamed in part on their increasing use of [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), &quot;for instance, 16 IEDs have been planted in girls' schools&quot; by the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnoldy&quot;/&gt;

In 2009, Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], formerly Commander of British forces in Afghanistan and the intelligence coordinator for the British government, drew parallels between the tactics and strategy of [[Hamas]] in [[Gaza]] to those of the Taliban. Kemp wrote: {{quote|Like Hamas in Gaza, the Taliban in southern Afghanistan are masters at shielding themselves behind the civilian population and then melting in among them for protection. Women and children are trained and equipped to fight, collect intelligence, and ferry arms and ammunition between battles. Female suicide bombers are increasingly common. The use of women to shield gunmen as they engage [[NATO]] forces is now so normal it is deemed barely worthy of comment. Schools and houses are routinely booby-trapped. Snipers shelter in houses deliberately filled with women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defense-update.com/analysis/analysis_280909_goldstone_kemp.html |title=The UN Goldstone Commission: A Lesson in Farcical Hypocrisy, Defense Update.

==Ideology==

===Overview===
{{Islamism sidebar}}
{{Wikiquote|religious police}}
The Taliban initially enjoyed goodwill from Afghans weary of the warlords' corruption, brutality, and incessant fighting.&lt;ref&gt;
Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world / editor in chief, Richard C. Martin, Macmillan Reference USA : Thomson/Gale, c2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, this popularity was not universal, particularly among non-Pashtuns.

The Taliban's extremely strict and [[Development criticism|anti-modern]] ideology has been described as an &quot;innovative form of ''[[sharia]]'' combining Pashtun tribal codes,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Muslim World 2004&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World,'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Pashtunwali]], with radical Deobandi interpretations of Islam favored by JUI and its splinter groups. Also contributing to the mix was the [[jihad]]ism and [[pan-Islamism]] of Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=132, 139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideology was a departure from the [[Islamism]] of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers they replaced who tended to be mystical [[Sufism|Sufis]], traditionalists, or radical Islamicists inspired by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Ikhwan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Taliban regime, [[Sharia law]] was interpreted to forbid a wide variety of previously lawful activities in Afghanistan. One Taliban list of prohibitions included:
pork, pig, pig oil, anything made from human hair, satellite dishes, cinematography, musical equipment, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computers, VCRs, television, anything that propagates sex and is full of music, wine, lobster, nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Waldman | first = Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also got rid of employment, education, sports for all women, dancing, clapping during sports events, kite flying, and characterizations of living things, including drawings, paintings, photographs, stuffed animals, and dolls. Men had to have a fist size beard at the bottom of their chin. Conversely, they had to wear their head hair short. They had to wear a head covering.&lt;ref name=&quot;cr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8222.htm |title=US Country Report on Human Rights Practices – Afghanistan 2001 |publisher=State.gov |date=2002-03-04 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these activities were hitherto lawful in Afghanistan. Critics complained that most Afghans followed a different, less strict, and less intrusive interpretation of Islam. The Taliban did not eschew all traditional popular practices. For example, they did not destroy the graves of Sufi [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] (holy men), and emphasized dreams as a means of revelation.&lt;ref&gt;
Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taliban have been described as both anti-nationalist and Pushtun nationalist. According to journalist [[Ahmed Rashid]], at least in the first years of their rule, they adopted Deobandi and [[Islamist]] anti-nationalist beliefs, and opposed &quot;tribal and feudal structures,&quot; eliminating traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ali A. Jalali and Lester Grau, the Taliban &quot;received extensive support from Pashtuns across the country who thought that the movement might restore their national dominance. Even Pashtun intellectuals in the West, who differed with the Taliban on many issues, expressed support for the movement on purely ethnic grounds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/990306-taliban.htm |title=Foreign Military Studies Office, &quot;Whither the Taliban?&quot; by Mr. Ali A. Jalali and Mr. Lester W. Grau |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ''Wahhabi'' and other Deobandis, the Taliban do not consider [[Shia Islam|Shi{{okina}}i]] to be Muslims. The Shia in Afghanistan consist mostly of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group which totaled almost 10% of Afghanistan's population.&lt;ref name = &quot;hrw.org-Niazi&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364 |title=Human Rights Watch Report, `Afghanistan, the massacre in Mazar-e-Sharif`, November 1998. |chapter=IV. Incitement of violence against Hazaras by governor Niazi |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban were averse to debating doctrine with other Muslims. &quot;The Taliban did not allow even Muslim reporters to question [their] edicts or to discuss interpretations of the [[Qur'an]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 107&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban mainly strictly enforced its ideologies in major cities like [[Herat]], [[Kabul]], and [[Kandahar]]. In rural areas the Taliban had little direct control, and the Taliban had promoted village [[jirgah]]s, so it did not as stringently enforce its ideology in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bamyan Buddhas===
In 1999, Mullah Omar issued a decree protecting the [[Buddhas of Bamyan|Buddha statues at Bamyan]], two 6th century monumental statues of standing [[buddha]]s carved into the side of a cliff in the [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]] valley in the [[Hazarajat]] region of central Afghanistan. He did this because Afghanistan had no [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], so [[idolatry]] would not be a problem. But in March 2001 the statues were destroyed by the Taliban of Mullah Omar following a decree stating: &quot;all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luke Harding |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4145138,00.html |title=How the Buddha got his wounds|date=2001-03-03|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=2010-08-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahya Massoud, brother of the anti-Taliban and resistance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, recalls the following incident after the destruction of the Buddha statues at Bamyan:
{{quote|It was the spring of 2001. I was in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, together with my brother Ahmad Shah Massoud, the leader of the Afghan resistance against the Taliban, and Bismillah Khan, who currently serves as Afghanistan's interior minister. One of our commanders, Commandant Momin, wanted us to see 30 Taliban fighters who had been taken hostage after a gun battle. My brother agreed to meet them.

I remember that his first question concerned the centuries-old Buddha statues that were dynamited by the Taliban in March of that year, shortly before our encounter. Two Taliban combatants from Kandahar confidently responded that worshiping anything outside of Islam was unacceptable and that therefore these statues had to be destroyed. My brother looked at them and said, this time in Pashto, 'There are still many sun- worshippers in this country. Will you also try to get rid of the sun and drop darkness over the Earth?'&quot;''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yahya Massoud|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/30/afghans_can_win_this_war|title=Afghans Can Win This War |date=July 2010|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate= |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Explanation of ideology===
The author Ahmed Rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship of the Soviet invasion and the following period influenced Taliban ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said the Taliban did not include scholars learned in Islamic law and history. The refugee students, brought up in a totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, [[herding]], or [[handicraft]]-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan [[Kinship|lineages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 32&quot;/&gt; In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment. Dominating women simply affirmed manhood. For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but also of political survival. Taliban leaders &quot;repeatedly told&quot; Rashid that &quot;if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school, they would lose the support of their rank and file.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
The Taliban were criticized for their strictness toward those who disobeyed their imposed rules. Many Muslims complained that most Taliban rules had no basis in the [[Qur'an]] or [[sharia]]. [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]]'s title as [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] was criticized on the grounds that he lacked scholarly learning, tribal pedigree, or connections to the [[Prophet Mohammed|Prophet's]] family. Sanction for the title traditionally required the support of all of the country's [[ulema]], whereas only some 1,200 Pashtun Taliban-supporting Mullahs had declared Omar the Amir. &quot;No Afghan had adopted the title since 1834, when King [[Dost Mohammed Khan]] assumed the title before he declared jihad against the [[Sikh]] kingdom in [[Peshawar]]. But Dost Mohammed was fighting foreigners, while Omar had declared jihad against other Afghans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 41-42&quot;/&gt;

Another criticism was that the Taliban called their 20% tax on truckloads of opium &quot;[[zakat]]&quot;, which is traditionally limited to 2.5% of the zakat-payers' disposable income (or wealth).&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 41-42&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=41–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

===Overview===
[[File:Taliban-herat-2001 retouched.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Taliban police patrolling the streets of [[Herat]] in a pickup truck]]
The Taliban, ''[[de jure]]'', controlled 85% of Afghanistan. ''[[De facto]]'' the areas under its direct control were mainly Afghanistan's major cities and highways. Tribal khans and warlords had ''de facto'' direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rashid described the Taliban government as &quot;a secret society run by [[Kandahar]]is ... mysterious, secretive, and dictatorial.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashid 2000 98&quot;/&gt; They did not hold elections, as their spokesman explained:

{{quote|The ''[[Sharia]]'' does not allow politics or political parties. That is why we give no salaries to officials or soldiers, just food, clothes, shoes, and weapons. We want to live a life like the Prophet lived 1400 years ago, and ''[[jihad]]'' is our right. We want to recreate the time of the Prophet, and we are only carrying out what the Afghan people have wanted for the past 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=43}} Interview with Mullah Wakil, March 1996&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They modeled their decision-making process on the Pashtun tribal council (''[[jirga]]''), together with what they believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the &quot;believers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before capturing Kabul, there was talk of stepping aside once a government of &quot;good Muslims&quot; took power, and law and order were restored.

As the Taliban's power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the ''jirga'' and without consulting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power. Instead of an election, their leader's legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance (&quot;[[Bay'ah]]&quot;), in imitation of the Prophet and the first four [[Caliph]]s. On April 4, 1996, Mullah Omar had &quot;the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed&quot; taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years. Wrapping himself in the relic, he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of Kandahar while hundreds of Pashtun [[mullah]]s below shouted &quot;[[Amir al-Mu'minin]]!&quot; (Commander of the Faithful), in a pledge of support. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

{{quote|Decisions are based on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us consultation is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the ''Sharia''. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority, and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with ''Sharia'' and therefore we reject them.&lt;ref&gt;
Interview with Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil in Arabic magazine ''Al-Majallah'', 1996-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Taliban were very reluctant to share power, and since their ranks were overwhelmingly Pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60% of Afghans from other ethnic groups. In local government, such as Kabul city council&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashid 2000 98&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or Herat,&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 39-40&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taliban loyalists, not locals, dominated, even when the [[Pashto language|Pashto]]-speaking Taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke [[Dari]] or other non-Pashtun tongues.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 39-40&quot;/&gt; Critics complained that this &quot;lack of local representation in urban administration made the Taliban appear as an occupying force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 101-102&quot;/&gt;

===Organization===

Consistent with the governance of early Muslims was the absence of state institutions or &quot;a methodology for command and control&quot; that is standard today even among non-Westernized states. The Taliban did not issue press releases, policy statements, or hold regular press conferences. The outside world and most Afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like, since photography was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;regular army&quot; resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal [[militia]] force with only 25,000 men (of whom 11,000 were non-Afghans).

[[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] ministers and deputies were mullahs with a &quot;[[madrasah]] education.&quot; Several of them, such as the Minister of Health and Governor of the State bank, were primarily military commanders who left their administrative posts to fight when needed. Military reverses that trapped them behind lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, &quot;all senior [[Tājik people|Tajik]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]] bureaucrats&quot; were replaced &quot;with Pashtuns, whether qualified or not.&quot; Consequently, the ministries &quot;by and large ceased to function.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 101-102&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=101–102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Finance had neither a budget nor &quot;qualified economist or banker.&quot; Mullah Omar collected and dispersed cash without book-keeping.

===Conscription===
{{Main|Taliban conscription}}
According to the testimony of [[Guantanamo captive]]s before their [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its [[civil service]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Between 1996 and 1999 Mullah Omar reversed his opinions on the drug trade, apparently as it only harmed [[kafirs]]. The Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan's poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chouvy1&quot;/&gt; Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income and their war economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chouvy1&quot;/&gt; According to Rashid, &quot;drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chouvy1&quot;/&gt; In the ''[[New York Times]]'', the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they &quot;appeared to spend US$ 300 million a year, nearly all of it on war.&quot; He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: &quot;poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chouvy1&quot;/&gt;

==International relations==
During its time in power, the Taliban regime, or &quot;Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan&quot;, gained [[diplomatic recognition]] from only three states: the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Saudi Arabia]], all of which provided substantial aid. The other nations including the [[United Nations]] recognized the government of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] (parts of whom were part of the United Front (Northern Alliance) as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Quetta Shura}}
The &quot;vast majority&quot; of the Taliban's rank and file and most of the leadership, though not Mullah Omar, were Koranic students who had studied at madrasas set up for [[Afghan refugees]], usually by JUI. [[Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman]], JUI's leader, was a political ally of [[Benazir Bhutto]]. After Bhutto became prime minister, Rehman &quot;had access to the government, the army and the ISI,&quot; whom he influenced to help the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch writes, &quot;Pakistani aircraft assisted with troop rotations of Taliban forces during combat operations in late 2000 and ... senior members of Pakistan's intelligence agency and army were involved in planning military operations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3bd540b60.html | title=Crisis of Impunity|date = July 2001| work=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan provided military equipment, recruiting assistance, training, and tactical advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frantz|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially Pakistan denied supporting the Taliban militarily.

Author [[Ahmed Rashid]] claims that the Taliban had &quot;unprecedented access&quot; among Pakistan's lobbies and interest groups. He also writes that they at times were able to &quot;play off one lobby against another and extend their influence in Pakistan even further&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=185–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998–99, Taliban-style groups in Pakistan's Pashtun belt, and to an extent in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]], &quot;were banning TV and videos ... and forcing people, particularly women, to adapt to the Taliban dress code and way of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=93, 137}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the U.S. operation in Afghanistan the Afghan Taliban leadership is claimed to have fled to Pakistan where they regrouped and created several shuras to coordinate their insurgency in Afghanistan. On February 8, 2009, U.S. commander of operations in Afghanistan General [[Stanley McChrystal]] and other officials said that the Taliban leadership was in [[Quetta]], Pakistan, though the Pakistani government, an official U.S. ally, denied this.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot;/&gt;

A range of officials inside and outside Pakistan have stepped up suggestions of links between the ISI and terrorist groups in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/pakistan/isi-terrorism-behind-accusations/p11644 |title=The ISI and Terrorism: Behind the Accusations - Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2006, a leaked report by a British Defense Ministry think tank charged, &quot;Indirectly Pakistan (through the ISI) has been supporting terrorism and extremism--whether in London on 7/7 [the July 2005 attacks on London's transit system], or in Afghanistan, or Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; In June 2008, Afghan officials accused Pakistan's intelligence service of plotting a failed assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai; shortly thereafter, they implied the ISI's involvement in a July 2008 Taliban attack on the Indian embassy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; Indian officials also blamed the ISI for the bombing of the Indian embassy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; Numerous U.S. officials have also accused the ISI of supporting terrorist groups including the Afghan Taliban. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said &quot;to a certain extent, they play both sides.&quot; Gates and others suggest the ISI maintains links with groups like the Afghan Taliban as a &quot;strategic hedge&quot; to help Islamabad gain influence in Kabul once U.S. troops exit the region.
&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen in 2011 called the [[Haqqani network]] (the Afghan Taliban's most destructive element) a &quot;veritable arm of Pakistan's ISI&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;longwarjournal1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas |last=Joscelyn |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/09/admiral_mullen_pakis.php |title=Admiral Mullen: Pakistani ISI sponsoring Haqqani attacks |publisher=The Long War Journal |date=2011-09-22 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated, &quot;Extremist organizations serving as proxies of the government of Pakistan are attacking Afghan troops and civilians as well as US soldiers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;longwarjournal1&quot;/&gt;

From 2010, a report by a leading British institution also claimed that Pakistan's intelligence service still today has a strong link with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Published by the [[London School of Economics]], the report said that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) has an &quot;official policy&quot; of support for the Taliban. It said the ISI provides funding and training for the Taliban, and that the agency has representatives on the so-called [[Quetta Shura]], the Taliban's leadership council, which is believed to meet in Pakistan. The report, based on interviews with Taliban commanders in Afghanistan, was written by Matt Waldman, a fellow at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/mritems/Documents/2010/6/13/20106138531279734lse-isi-taliban.pdf |title=Discussion Papers |accessdate=2010-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude,&quot; the report said. The report also linked high-level members of the Pakistani government with the Taliban. It said [[Asif Ali Zardari]], the Pakistani president, met with senior Taliban prisoners in 2010 and promised to release them. Zardari reportedly told the detainees they were only arrested because of American pressure. &quot;The Pakistan government's apparent duplicity – and awareness of it among the American public and political establishment – could have enormous geopolitical implications,&quot; Waldman said. &quot;Without a change in Pakistani behaviour it will be difficult if not impossible for international forces and the Afghan government to make progress against the insurgency.&quot; Afghan officials have long been suspicious of the ISI's role. [[Amrullah Saleh]], the former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, told Reuters that the ISI was &quot;part of a landscape of destruction in this country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6571VE20100608 | title=Afghan ex-intel chief opposed Karzai peace plan | date=2010-06-08 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan on other hand has strongly denied all links with Taliban or any terrorist groups with the argument that Pakistan is the biggest victim of the &quot;War on terror&quot; with a loss of 35,000 lives including policemen, soldiers and mostly civilians.&lt;ref name=Pakdenies&gt;{{cite news|last=Chris Allbritton|title=Pakistan strongly denied Thursday a BBC report that alleged the Pakistani military, along with its intelligence arm, supplied and protected the Afghan Taliban and al Qaeda.|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/27/us-pakistan-taliban-bbc-idUSTRE79Q7V420111027|accessdate=Thu Oct 27, 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's military officials called such allegations highly biased and factually inaccurate.

===Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (Pakistani Taliban)===
{{Main|Islamic Emirate of Waziristan|War in North-West Pakistan|Wana conflict|Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan}}

Before the creation of the Tehrik-i-Taliban(Pakistan), some of their leaders and fighters were part of the 8,000 Pakistani militants fighting in the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996-2001)|War in Afghanistan (1996-2001)]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)]] against the United Islamic Front and [[NATO]] forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot; /&gt; Most of them hail from the Pakistani side of the Af-Pak border regions. After the fall of the Afghan Taliban in late 2001 most Pakistani militants including members of today's TTP fled home to Pakistan.

After the creation of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in 2007, headed by [[Baitullah Mehsud]],&lt;ref name=Tighe-Katz&gt;{{cite news|author=Tighe, Paul and Katz, Ian|title=Pakistan Challenges Taliban to Show Leader Mehsud Still Alive |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=akFq_Knl5Gd0|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-08-10|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; its members have officially defined goals to establish their rule over Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]. They engage the Pakistani army in heavy combat operations. Some intelligence analysts believe that the TTP's attacks on the Pakistani government, police and army strained the TTP's relations with the Afghan Taliban.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=sanctionsunc/&gt;

The Afghan Taliban and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan differ greatly in their history, leadership and goals although they share a common interpretation of Islam and are both predominantly Pashtun.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite news | first = Scott | last = Shane | title = Insurgents Share a Name, but Pursue Different Goals | date = 2009-10-22 | publisher = The New York Times Company | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/world/asia/23taliban.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghan Taliban have no affiliation with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and routinely deny any connection to the TTP.

Afghan Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] asked the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in late 2008 and early 2009 to stop attacks inside Pakistan, to change their focus as an organization and to fight the [[Afghan National Army]] and [[ISAF]] forces in [[Afghanistan]] instead.&lt;ref name=gall2009327/&gt; In late December 2008 and early January 2009 he sent a delegation, led by former [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay detainee]] [[Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul|Mullah Abdullah Zakir]], to persuade leading members of the TTP to put aside differences with Pakistan.&lt;ref name=gall2009327/&gt;

Some regional experts state the common name &quot;Taliban&quot; may be more misleading than illuminating.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;
Gilles Dorronsoro, a scholar of [[South Asia]] currently at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in Washington says:
{{quote|The fact that they have the same name causes all kinds of confusion.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;}}
As the Pakistani Army began offensives against the Pakistani Taliban, many unfamiliar with the region thought incorrectly that the assault was against the Afghan Taliban of Mullah Omar which was not the case.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;

The Pakistani Taliban were put under sanctions by [[United Nations Security Council|U.N.

Although, they have been linked with Waziristan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), however, the connection between these two groups is of symbolic nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url_a&quot; /&gt;

===Al Qaeda===
[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden.jpg|thumb|Pakistani journalist [[Hamid Mir]] interviewing [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan,  1997.]]
In 1996, bin Laden moved to Afghanistan from [[Sudan]]. He came without invitation, and sometimes irritated Mullah Omar with his declaration of war and fatwas against citizens of third-party countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=246–247, 287–288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but relations between the two groups improved over time, to the point that Mullah Omar rebuffed his group's patron Saudi Arabia, insulting Saudi minister [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud|Prince Turki]] while reneging on an earlier promise to turn bin Laden over to the Saudis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=288–289}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden was able to forge an [[Military alliance|alliance]] between the Taliban and [[Al-Qaeda]]. The Al Qaeda-trained [[055 Brigade]] integrated with the Taliban army between 1997 and 2001. Several hundred Arab Afghan fighters sent by bin Laden assisted the Taliban in the [[Mazar-e-Sharif]] slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called Brigade 055 was also responsible for massacres against civilians in other parts of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1340244/Afghanistan-resistance-leader-feared-dead-in-blast.html |title =Afghanistan resistance leader feared dead in blast| publisher = [[Ahmed Rashid in the Telegraph]]|location=London|date=2001-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996 to 2001 the organization of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become a virtual state within the Taliban state.

Taliban-Al-Qaeda connections were also strengthened by the reported marriage of one of bin Laden's sons to Omar's daughter.

===Iran===
Iran has historically been an enemy of the Taliban. In early August 1998, after attacking the city of [[Mazar]], Taliban forces killed several thousand civilians and 10 Iranian diplomats and intelligence officers in the Iranian consulate. Alleged radio intercepts indicate Mullah Omar personally approved the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=74–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following crisis between Iran and the Taliban, the Iranian government amassed up to 200,000 regular troops on the Afghan-Iranian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/1998/09/wwwh8915.html |title=Iranian-Afghan tensions |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=1998-09-15 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; War was eventually averted.

===United States===
The United States supported the Taliban through its allies in [[Pakistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] between 1994 and 1996 because Washington viewed the Taliban as anti-[[Iran–United States relations|Iranian]], anti-[[Shia Islam|Shia]] and pro-Western.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington furthermore hoped that the Taliban would support development planned by the U.S.-based oil company ''[[Unocal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=175–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it made no comment when the Taliban captured Herat in 1995, and expelled thousands of girls from schools;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Taliban began killing unarmed civilians, targeting ethnic groups (primarily Hazaras), and restricting the rights of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muslim World 2004&quot;/&gt; In late 1997, American Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] began to distance the U.S. from the Taliban. The next year, the American-based oil company [[Unocal]] withdrew from negotiations on pipeline construction from Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/west_asia/38115.stm | work=BBC News | title=US pledges support for Afghan oil pipeline if Taliban makes peace | date=1997-12-10 | accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day before the capture of Mazar, bin Laden affiliates [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombed two U.S. embassies]] in Africa, killing 224 and wounding 4,500, mostly Africans. The U.S. responded by launching cruise missiles on suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan, killing over 20 though failing to kill bin Laden or even many Al-Qaeda. Mullah Omar condemned the missile attack and American President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Security Council]] voted unanimously to ban commercial aircraft flights to and from Afghanistan, and freeze its bank accounts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjusting its [[counterinsurgency]] strategy, in October 2009, the U.S announced plans to pay Taliban fighters to switch sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/10/28/afghanistan.taliban.pay/index.html | work=CNN | title=U.S. set to pay Taliban members to switch sides | accessdate=2010-04-09 | date=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--here--&gt;

On November 26, 2009, in an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]], President [[Hamid Karzai]] said there is an &quot;urgent need&quot; for negotiations with the Taliban, and made it clear that the Obama administration had opposed such talks. There was no formal American response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=49701 |title=IPS Inter Press Service |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/06/right-after-interviewing-karzai/ | work=CNN | accessdate=2010-04-09 | title=Right after interviewing&amp;nbsp;Karzai | date=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2009, the Taliban offered to give the U.S. &quot;legal guarantees&quot; that they would not allow Afghanistan to be used for attacks on other countries. There was no formal American response.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KL17Df02.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news, business and economy from India and Pakistan |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, U.S officials indicated that they have not ruled out talks with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Homan |first=Timothy R. |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aUO6eLdxBxqo&amp;pos=9 |title=bloomberg.com |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=2009-12-06 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later it was reported that Gates saw potential for reconciliation with the Taliban, but not with Al-Qaeda. Furthermore, he said that reconciliation would politically end the insurgency and the war. But he said reconciliation must be on the Afghan government's terms, and that the Taliban must be subject to the sovereignty of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/666993 |title=Pentagon sees reconciliation with Taliban |publisher=stuff.co.nz |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, General McChrystal said his troop surge could lead to a negotiated peace with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) – Jan 24, 2010 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iKXQC2HwynedmTU1YcjQQFpyPA_g |title=google.com/hostednews/afp/article |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allegations of connection to CIA'''
There have been many claims that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] directly supported the Taliban or al-Qaeda. In the early 1980s, the CIA and the ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency) provided arms and money, and the ISI helped gather radical Muslims from around the world to fight against the Soviet invaders.&lt;ref name='R000321'&gt;{{cite news | first=Joseph | last=Fitchett | coauthors= | title=What About the Taliban's Stingers? | date=2001-09-26 | publisher= | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/news/26iht-stinger_ed3_.html | work =[[The International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-11-11 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Osama Bin Laden was one of the key players in organizing training camps for the foreign Muslim volunteers. &quot;By 1987, 65,000 tons of U.S.-made weapons and ammunition a year were entering the war.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
After 9/11, the United Kingdom froze the Taliban's assets in the U.K., nearly $200 million by early October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s380395.htm |title=AM Archive – UK freezes $200 million worth of Taliban assets |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.K. also supported the U.S. decision to remove the Taliban, both politically and militarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bv4hzxpo424C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=%22united+kingdom%22+taliban#v=onepage&amp;q=%22united%20kingdom%22%20taliban&amp;f=false |title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-04|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN agreed that NATO would act on its behalf, focusing on counter-terrorist operations in Afghanistan after the Taliban had been &quot;defeated&quot;. The United Kingdom took operational responsibility for [[Helmand Province]], a major poppy-growing province in southern Afghanistan, deploying troops there in the summer of 2006, and encountered resistance by re-formed Taliban forces allegedly entering Afghanistan from Pakistan. The Taliban turned towards the use of [[improvised explosive devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/2171923/General-Sir-Michael-Jackson-We-must-maintain-our-will-in-Afghanistan.html |title=General Sir Michael Jackson: We must maintain our will in Afghanistan |publisher=Telegraph |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2010-11-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the U.K. announced plans to pay Taliban fighters to switch sides or lay down arms;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/2529278/British-cash-to-buy-off-Taliban-goes-to-farmers.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=British cash to buy off Taliban 'goes to farmers' | first=Nick | last=Meo | date=2008-08-09 | accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, in 2009 the United Kingdom government backed talks with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/8628150 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2008-01-23 | accessdate=2010-04-09 | title=UK news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India is one of the Taliban's most outspoken critics. India was concerned about growing Islamic militancy in its neighborhood, and refused to recognize the Taliban regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sOTZqI5zREoC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=india+taliban&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA250,M1 |title='&amp;#39;The idea of Pakistan'&amp;#39;, by Stephen P.

In December 1999, [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] en route from [[Kathmandu]] to [[Delhi]] was hijacked and taken to [[Kandahar]]. The Taliban moved its militias near the hijacked aircraft, supposedly to prevent [[Special Forces of India|Indian special forces]] from storming the aircraft, and stalled the negotiations between India and the hijackers for days. ''[[The New York Times]]'' later reported that there were credible links between the hijackers and the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/07ter.htm |title=Bombay terrorist reveals links with IC 814 hijackers |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the deal to free the plane, India released three militants.

Following the hijacking, India drastically increased its efforts to help Massoud, providing an arms depot in [[Dushanbe]], [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the wake of recent [[Terrorism in India|terrorist attacks in India]], there have been growing concerns about fundamentalist organisations such as the Taliban seeking to expand their activities into India. During the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]] which was co-hosted in India, Pakistani Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] and Interpol chief [[Ronald Noble]] revealed that a terrorist bid to disrupt the tournament had been foiled; following a conference with Noble, Malik said that the Taliban had begun to base their activities in India with reports from neighboring countries exposing their activities in the country and a Sri Lankan terrorist planning to target cricketers was arrested in Colombo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gishkori |first=Zahid |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/137011/terrorism-threat-in-india-during-world-cup-malik |title=Terrorism threat in India during World Cup |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=13081 |title=Taliban trying to enter India: Malik |publisher=The News |date=2011-03-24 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Terrorist-plotting-World-Cup-attack-nabbed-Rehman-Malik/articleshow/7781076.cms |title=Terrorist plotting World Cup attack nabbed: Rehman Malik |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= 2011-03-24|accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kashmir]]-based militant groups thought to have ties with the Taliban have historically been involved in the [[Jammu and Kashmir insurgency]] in Indian-administered Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gall |first=Carlotta |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/world/asia/21quetta.html |title=At Border, Signs of Pakistani Role in Taliban Surge - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the ''[[Times of India]]'' called for India to reassess its Taliban threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-03-31/india/28010241_1_pakistan-army-taliban-threat-quetta-shura |title=India forced to reassess Taliban threat |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations and NGOs===
A major issue during the Taliban's reign was its relations with the [[United Nations]] (UN) and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs). Twenty years of continuous warfare had devastated Afghanistan's [[infrastructure]] and economy. There was no running water, little electricity, few telephones, functioning roads or regular energy supplies. Basic necessities like water, food, housing and others were in desperately short supply. In addition, the [[clan]] and family structure that provided Afghans with a social/economic safety net was also badly damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 107&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan's infant mortality was the highest in the world. A full quarter of all children died before they reached their fifth birthday, a rate several times higher than most other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;
UNCP Country Development Indicators, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

International charitable and/or development organisations ([[NGO]]s) were extremely important to the supply of food, employment, reconstruction, and other services. With one million plus deaths during the years of war, the number of families headed by widows had reached 98,000 by 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00141.x?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=hico |title=Quoting the ICRC |publisher=Blackwell-synergy.com |date=2005-12-21 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Taliban restrictions on women were sometime a matter not only of [[human rights]], but of life and death. In Kabul, where vast portions of the city had been devastated from rocket attacks, more than half of its 1.2 million people benefited in some way from NGO activities, even for water to drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Afghan Civil War|civil war]] and its never-ending refugee stream continued throughout the Taliban's reign. The Mazar, Herat, and Shomali valley offensives displaced more than three-quarters of a million civilians, using &quot;[[scorched earth]]&quot; tactics to prevent them from supplying the enemy with aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=64, 78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the aid, the Taliban's attitude toward the UN and NGOs was often one of suspicion, in place of gratitude or even tolerance. The UN operates on the basis of [[international law]], not [[Sharia]], and the UN did not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Additionally, most foreign donors and aid workers, were non-Muslims. As the Taliban's Attorney General Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada put it:

{{quote|Let us state what sort of education the UN wants. This is a big infidel policy which gives such obscene freedom to women which would lead to [[adultery]] and herald the destruction of Islam. In any Islamic country where adultery becomes common, that country is destroyed and enters the domination of the infidels because their men become like women and women cannot defend themselves. Anyone who talks to us should do so within Islam's framework. The Holy Koran cannot adjust itself to other people's requirements, people should adjust themselves to the requirements of the Holy Koran.&lt;ref&gt;Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada, June 1997 interview with Ahmed Rashid; {{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=111–112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Taliban decision-makers, particularly Mullah Omar, seldom if ever talked directly to non-Muslim foreigners, so aid providers had to deal with intermediaries whose approvals and agreements were often reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 101-102&quot;/&gt; Around September 1997 the heads of three UN agencies in Kandahar were expelled from the country after protesting when a female [[lawyer|attorney]] for the [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] was forced to talk from behind a curtain so her face would not be visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the UN increased the number of Muslim women staff to satisfy Taliban demands, the Taliban then required all female Muslim UN staff traveling to Afghanistan to be chaperoned by a [[mahram]] or a blood relative.&lt;ref name=taliban71&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1998, the Taliban closed &quot;all NGO offices&quot; by force after those organizations refused to move to a bombed-out former [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic]] College as ordered.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7155/369/a Aid agencies pull out of Kabul] The building had neither electricity or running water.&lt;/ref&gt; One month later the UN offices were also shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=71–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As food prices rose and conditions deteriorated, Planning Minister Qari Din Mohammed explained the Taliban's indifference to the loss of humanitarian aid:

{{quote|We Muslims believe God the Almighty will feed everybody one way or another. If the foreign NGOs leave then it is their decision. We have not expelled them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France-Presse]], &quot;Taliban reject warnings of aid pull-out&quot;, 1998-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2009 a top U.N official called for talks with Taliban leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/un-official-calls-for-talks-with-taliban-leaders-news-international-jicuarhgaeb.html |title=UN official calls for talks with taliban leaders |publisher=sify.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the U.N lifted sanctions on the Taliban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7067537/UN-lift-sanctions-on-Taliban-to-build-peace-in-Afghanistan.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=UN: lift sanctions on Taliban to build peace in Afghanistan | first=Ben | last=Farmer | date=2010-01-25 | accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and requested that Taliban leaders and others be removed from terrorism watch lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/01/25/UN-Reduce-Taliban-names-on-terror-list/UPI-69591264400185/ |title=UN Reduce Taliban names on terror list |publisher=upi.com |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the U.S. and Europe announced support for President Karzai's latest attempt to negotiate peace with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/01/2010125185642602982.html |title=Asia News |publisher=english.aljazeera.net |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
