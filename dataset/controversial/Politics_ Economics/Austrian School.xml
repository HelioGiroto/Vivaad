The '''Austrian School of economics''' is a [[Schools of economic thought|school of economic thought]] which bases its study of economic phenomena on the interpretation and analysis of [[methodological individualism|the purposeful actions of individuals]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Menger, Prinicples of Economics, online at http://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib&quot;&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/AustrianSchoolofEconomics.html Austrian School of Economics: The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics | Library of Economics and Liberty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mises_Action&quot;&gt;Ludwig von Mises.  [[Human Action]], p. 11, &quot;r. Purposeful Action and Animal Reaction&quot;. Referenced 2011-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It derives its name from its origin in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the work of [[Carl Menger]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Friedrich von Wieser]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Schumpeter, History of economic analysis, Oxford University Press 1996, ISBN 978-0195105599.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, adherents of the Austrian School can come from any part of the world, but they are often referred to as &quot;Austrian economists&quot; or &quot;Austrians&quot; and their work as &quot;Austrian economics&quot;.

The main tenets of the Austrian School are generally considered to be:
* The theory that economic events are best explained by a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] study of human [[Action (philosophy)|action]].&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lewrockwell&quot;&gt;http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard38.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory that the use of [[economic model]]s and [[econometrics|statistical methods]] to model economic behavior are a flawed, unreliable, and insufficient means of analyzing economic behavior and evaluating economic theories.&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lewrockwell&quot; /&gt;
* The theory that testability in economics and consistently accurate mathematical modeling of an economic market are impossible because mathematical modeling of any real market affects the decision-makers in that market and &quot;testing&quot; relies on real human actors who cannot be placed in a lab setting without altering their would-be actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lewrockwell&quot; /&gt;
* The theory that the way in which [[money]] is produced has real and not only nominal economic effects.&lt;ref name=PatinkinPalgrave&gt;{{Cite document | title = Neutrality of Money | author=Patinkin, Don | year = 1987 | publisher=Palgrave | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory that the cost of any activity should be measured by reference to the next best alternative.&lt;ref name=&quot;investopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=Investopedia |title=Opportunity Cost |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp |accessdate=2010-09-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100914214221/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp| archivedate= 14 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory that, in a [[free market]], [[interest rate]]s and [[Profit (economics)|profits]] are determined by three factors: monetary gains or losses from a change in the consumption of a good or service, additional output that can be produced by additional inputs, and the [[time preference]] of the associated individual agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;BohmBawerkEugen&quot;&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory that [[Market clearing|markets clear]] if prices are allowed to adjust freely.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kates, ''Two Hundred Years of Say's Law''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory that inflation properly defined relates to an increase in the [[Money supply|supply of money]] (including [[credit (finance)|credit]]) which causes prices to rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheTheory&quot;&gt;The Theory of Money and Credit, Mises (1912, [1981], p. 272)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory that [[capital goods]] and [[Labour economics|labor]] are highly heterogeneous (diverse), that money allows different goods to be analyzed in terms of their cost effectively, that economic calculation requires a common basis for comparison for all forms of capital and labor, that this process is the [[Signalling (economics)|signaling]] function of prices, and that it is also a [[rationing]] function which prevents over-use of inherently limited resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mises&quot;&gt;{{cite book

* The theory that the capital structure of economies consists of heterogeneous goods that have multi-specific uses which must be aligned to be effectively allocated, that the economic &quot;[[Boom and bust|boom-bust cycle]]&quot; is caused by an artificial and unsustainable expansion of [[credit (finance)|credit]] by the banks, and that this expansion causes businesses to make bad investment decisions which, in turn, necessarily cause major economic dislocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Mises/msT.html Theory of Money and Credit], Ludwig von Mises, Part III, Part IV&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology===
[[File:Ludwig von Mises.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Ludwig von Mises]]]]
[[File:MurrayBW.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Murray Rothbard]]]]
{{Main|Action axiom|Catallactics|Praxeology}}

The Austrian School differs significantly from many other schools of economic thought in that the Austrian analysis of the observed economy begins from a prior understanding of the motivations and processes of human action.  To understand purposeful economic behavior and its consequences, the Austrian School follows an approach termed [[methodological individualism]], or, as [[Ludwig von Mises]] termed it, &quot;[[praxeology]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludwigvon&quot;&gt;Ludwig von Mises, Nationalökonomie (Geneva: Union, 1940), p. 3; Human Action (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, [1949] 1998), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Mises was the first Austrian economist to present a theory of praxeology as such.  Subsequently, [[Murray Rothbard]] presented a different version of praxeology in his work ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]''

The Austrian praxeological method is based on the heavy use of [[deductive reasoning|deductive arguments]] from undeniable, self-evident [[axioms]] or from irrefutable facts about human existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;HansHermannHoppe&quot;&gt;Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Economic Science and the Austrian Method (Auburn, Ala.: Mises Institute, [1995] 2007), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Austrians, deductive economic [[thought experiment]], if performed correctly, can yield conclusions that follow irrefutably from the underlying assumptions and could not be discovered by empirical observation or statistical inference.  However, economist [[Bryan Caplan]] has stated that the Austrian challenge to the realism of neoclassical assumptions actually helps make those assumptions more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/ausfin2.doc The Austrian Search for Realistic Foundations], Bryan Caplan&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrians believe that their methodology is superior to the methodology of other economists who they believe attempt to mimic the [[hard sciences]] through [[naive empiricism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMb61dyw2Js&amp;feature=player_embedded#! Interview with Austrian economist Pedro Schwartz]&lt;/ref&gt;  Commenting on the attempt to construct &quot;scientific&quot; economic forecasts, economist L. Albert Hahn stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/daily/3582 Keynesians Can't Predict], L. Albert Hahn, ''The Freeman'', October 6, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is seldom realized that belief in the possibility of &quot;scientific&quot; business forecasts, and the forecasting mania of our time, are comparatively new phenomena. Until about 1930 serious economists were not so bold – or so naïve – as to pretend to be able to calculate the coming of booms and depressions in advance. It would not have fitted into their general view on the working of a free economy. They considered the economic future as basically dependent on unpredictable price-cost relationships and on the equally unpredictable psychological reactions of entrepreneurs. Predictions of future business conditions would have seemed to them mere charlatanry, just as predictions, say, regarding the resolutions of Congress two years from now... The basic error of the whole approach lies in the fact that the causative link between objective data and the decision of the members of the community are treated as mechanical. But men are still men and not automatons.}}

Mainstream economists generally argue that conclusions reached by pure logical deduction are limited and weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Samuelson&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Samuelson |first=Paul |title=Economics |publisher=New York: McGraw-Hill |year=1964 |edition=6th |page=736 |isbn=978-0-07-074741-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists Bryan Caplan and [[Paul A. Samuelson]] have argued that this methodology has led to the Austrian School being generally dismissed within mainstream economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;tremble&quot; /&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] argued against use of probabilities in economic models, saying that numerically accurate &quot;probabilities&quot; could never be assigned to singular cases because the unique confluence of events in each moment of time in real markets makes the assignment of &quot;objective&quot; probabilities unrealistic, as these events are intrinsically unique and not capable of numerical probabilistic modeling. Mises argued that the application of probabilistic uncertainty would require the ability to exactly replicate objectively similar events to obtain an accurate understanding of the range of probabilistic outcomes of any event, and this is not possible in real markets, where past market events intimately affect the present and the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mises.org/books/ufofes/ |title=The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science by Ludwig von Mises |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Austrians incorporate models and mathematics into their analysis of the economy.  Austrian economist [[Steven Horwitz]] argues that Austrian methodology is consistent with [[macroeconomics]] and that Austrian macroeconomics can be expressed in terms of [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] foundations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horwitz, Steven 2000&quot;&gt;Horwitz, Steven: Microfoundations and Macroeconomics: An Austrian Perspective (2000)|''Routledge''&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian economist Roger Garrison argues that Austrian macroeconomic theory can be correctly expressed in terms of [[diagram|diagrammatic models]].&lt;ref&gt;http://library.mises.org/books/Roger%20W%20Garrison/Austrian%20Macroeconomics%20A%20Diagrammatical%20Exposition.pdf Garrison, Roger: Austrian Macroeconomics: A Diagrammatical Exposition (1978)|''Institute for Humane Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Austrian economist Oskar Morgenstern presented a rigorous schematization of an ordinal utility function (the [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem]]) in [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, John von and Morgenstern, Oskar Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press. 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opportunity cost===
[[File:1wieser.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Friedrich von Wieser]]]]
{{Main|Opportunity cost}}
The opportunity cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Subjectivism, intelligibility and economic understanding: essays in honor of Ludwig M. Lachmann on his eightieth birthday |last1=Kirzner |first1=Israel M. |last2=Lachman |first2=Ludwig M. |publisher=McMillan |year=1986 |edition=Illustrated |isbn=978-0-333-41788-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opportunity cost is the cost of any activity measured in terms of the value of the next best alternative foregone (that is not chosen). It is the sacrifice related to the second best choice available to someone, or group, who has picked among several [[mutually exclusive]] choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;investopedia&quot; /&gt;  The opportunity cost is also the cost of the foregone products after making a choice. Opportunity cost is a key concept in [[economics]], and has been described as expressing &quot;the basic relationship between [[scarcity]] and [[utility|choice]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=opportunity+cost&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Opportunity cost |encyclopedia=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online |author=James M. Buchanan |authorlink=James M. Buchanan |year=2008 |edition=Second |accessdate=2010-09-18 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/alphabetic.cfm?letter=O#opportunitycost |title=Opportunity Cost |work=Economics A-Z  |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=2010-09-18 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101009122334/http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/alphabetic.cfm?letter=O| archivedate= 9 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real cost]] of [[Production possibilities frontier|output foregone]], lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides [[utility (economics)|utility]] should also be considered opportunity costs.

===Capital and interest===
{{See also|Marginalism|Neutrality of money|Say's law|Time preference}}
[[File:1Bawerk.gif|right|thumb|130px|[[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]]]]
The Austrian theory of capital and interest holds that interest rates and profits are determined solely by the interaction of diminishing gains or losses from a change in the consumption of a good or service with diminishing extra output that can be produced by using one more unit of the input, and the valuation consumers place on consumption nearer in time versus more remote consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;BohmBawerkEugen&quot; /&gt;

The Austrian theory of capital and interest was created by Böhm-Bawerk. He created the theory as a response to Marx's theories on capital. Böhm-Bawerk's theory centered on the untenability of the labor theory of value in the light of the [[transformation problem]]. He also argued that capitalists do not exploit workers; they ''accommodate'' workers by providing them with income well in advance of the revenue from the output they helped to produce. Böhm-Bawerk's theory equates [[capital intensity]] with the degree of [[roundaboutness]] of production processes. Böhm-Bawerk also argued that the law of [[marginal utility]] necessarily implies the classical law of costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;BohmBawerkEugen&quot; /&gt;

Austrians therefore reject the notion that interest rates are determined by [[liquidity preference]]. In his book ''[[America's Great Depression]]'', Rothbard argued that interest rates are instead determined by [[time preference]]. Says Rothbard, &quot;Increased hoarding can either come from funds formerly consumed, from funds formerly invested, or from a mixture of both that leaves the old consumption-investment proportion unchanged. Unless time preferences change, the last alternative will be the one adopted. Thus, the rate of interest depends solely on time preference, and not at all on &quot;liquidity preference.&quot; In fact, if the increased hoards come mainly out of consumption, an increased demand for money will cause interest rates to fall – because time preferences have fallen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mises.org/resources.aspx?Id=3f01a478-6773-41a6-8f32-feab9b46999f |title=Keynesian Criticisms of the Theory - - Mises Institute |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation===
{{See also|Monetary Inflation}}
Mises argues that inflation only results when the supply of money outpaces demand for money:

:In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader sense of the term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader sense of the term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheTheory&quot; /&gt;

Most contemporary economies have a [[central bank]] which supports their banking and monetary systems.  In such economies, the central bank can influence the money supply by, among other measures, the addition or withdrawal of legal [[bank reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/media/4014 The Economics of Legal Tender Laws], Jorg Guido Hulsmann (includes detailed commentary on central banking, inflation and [[fractional reserve banking|FRB]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian School also views the &quot;contemporary&quot; definition of inflation as inherently misleading in that it draws attention only to the ''effect'' of inflation (rising prices) and does not address the &quot;true&quot; phenomenon of inflation, which they believe simply involves an increase in the money supply (or the debasement of the means of exchange).  They argue that this semantic difference is important in defining inflation and finding a cure for inflation.  Austrians maintain the most effective cure is the strict maintenance of a stable money supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mises.org/story/908 |title=Defining Inflation |accessdate=2008-09-20 |last=Shostak, Ph.D |first=Frank |date=2002-03-02 |publisher=Mises Institute | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080930073724/http://mises.org/story/908| archivedate= 30 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mises argues that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inflation, as this term was always used everywhere and especially in this country, means increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check. But people today use the term &quot;inflation&quot; to refer to the phenomenon that is an inevitable consequence of inflation, that is the tendency of all prices and wage rates to rise. The result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages. There is no longer any word available to signify the phenomenon that has been, up to now, called inflation. . . . As you cannot talk about something that has no name, you cannot fight it. Those who pretend to fight inflation are in fact only fighting what is the inevitable consequence of inflation, rising prices. Their ventures are doomed to failure because they do not attack the root of the evil. They try to keep prices low while firmly committed to a policy of increasing the quantity of money that must necessarily make them soar. As long as this terminological confusion is not entirely wiped out, there cannot be any question of stopping inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ludwig |last=von Mises |chapter=Economic Freedom and Interventionism |editor1-first=Bettina B. |editor1-last=Greaves |title=Economics of Mobilization |publisher=The Commercial and Financial Chronicle |location=Sulphur Springs, West Virginia |pages= |year=1980 |isbn= |chapterurl=http://mises.org/efandi/ch20.asp |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following their definition, Austrians measure inflation by calculating the growth of what they call &quot;the true money supply&quot;, i.e. how many new units of money which are available for immediate use in exchange have been created over a specified period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises Institute, &quot;[http://mises.org/content/nofed/chart.aspx?series=TMS True Money Supply]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T.

This interpretation of inflation implies that, within a centralized banking system, inflation is usually the result of action taken by the central government or its central bank,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/daily/1118 Money Multiplier: Myth or Reality?], Frank Shostak&lt;/ref&gt; which permits or allows an increase in the money supply.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises, [http://mises.org/books/Theory_Money_Credit/Contents.aspx The Theory of Money and Credit]&quot;, ISBN 978-0-913966-70-9 See also: Jesus Huerta de Soto, &quot;[http://mises.org/books/desoto.pdf Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles]&quot;, ISBN 978-1-933550-39-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Mises includes bank credit as a significant contributor to inflation, given that the value of bank credit generated by private financial institutions via [[fractional reserve banking]] greatly exceeds the value of physical paper bills and metallic coins issued by the Federal government.  In addition to state-induced monetary expansion via printing of paper money, Austrians also maintain that the effects of increasing the money supply are exacerbated by the credit expansion performed by private financial institutions practising [[fractional-reserve banking]], legally permitted in most economic and financial systems in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, &quot;[http://mises.org/rothbard/rothmoney.pdf What Has Government Done to Our Money?]{{Dead link|date=November 2011}}&quot;, ISBN 978-0-945466-44-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrians hold that states use [[monetary inflation]] as one of the three means by which it can fund its activities, the other two being taxing and borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lew Rockwell]], interview on &quot;[http://mises.org:88/Now NOW with Bill Moyers]{{Dead link|date=November 2011}}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Austrians often seek to identify reasons why the state resorts to allowing the creation new money (whether [[fiat money|fiat paper]] or [[electronic money]]) and what the new money is used for. Various forms of spending are often cited as reasons for resorting to inflation and borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;Lew Rockwell, &quot;[http://mises.org/story/3010 War and Inflation]&quot;, Ludwig von Mises Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, the central bank may try avoid or defer the widespread bankruptcies and insolvencies which cause economic recessions by artificially trying to &quot;stimulate&quot; the economy through money supply growth and further borrowing via artificially low interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Polleit, &quot;[http://mises.org/story/2810 Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster]&quot;, 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, many Austrians support the abolition of the [[central bank]]s and the [[fractional-reserve banking]] system, advocating either a [[gold standard]] or that the market should choose what is used as money.  Austrian economist [[Murray Rothbard]] stated the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;mises_a&quot;&gt;Rothbard, Murray. [http://mises.org/resources/614/Mystery-of-Banking-The ''The Mystery of Banking''], p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Given this dismal monetary and banking situation, given a 39:1 pyramiding of checkable deposits and currency on top of gold, given a Fed unchecked and out of control, given a world of fiat moneys, how can we possibly return to a sound noninflationary market money? The objectives, after the discussion in this work, should be clear: (a) to return to a gold standard, a commodity standard unhampered by government intervention; (b) to abolish the Federal Reserve System and return to a system of free and competitive banking; (c) to separate the government from money; and (d) either to enforce 100 percent reserve banking on the commercial banks, or at least to arrive at a system where any bank, at the slightest hint of nonpayment of its demand liabilities, is forced quickly into bankruptcy and liquidation. While the outlawing of fractional reserve as fraud would be preferable if it could be enforced, the problems of enforcement, especially where banks can continually innovate in forms of credit, make free banking an attractive alternative.}}

Advocates argued that the gold standard would constrain unsustainable and volatile fractional-reserve banking practices, ensuring that money supply growth (&quot;inflation&quot;) would never spiral out of control.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, &quot;[http://mises.org/rothbard/100percent.pdf The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises Institute, &quot;[http://mises.org/story/2870 Money, Banking and the Federal Reserve]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mises argues that civil liberties would be better protected:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights. The demand for constitutional guarantees and for bills of rights was a reaction against arbitrary rule and the nonobservance of old customs by kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Mises |first=Ludwig |authorlink=Ludwig von Mises |coauthors= |title=The Theory of Money and Credit |publisher=Liberty Fund, Inc. |date=1981-07-01 |location= |pages=Chapter 21 |url=http://mises.org/story/2276 |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-913966-71-6 |nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic calculation problem===
{{Main|Economic calculation problem}}

====Background====
[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Friedrich Hayek]]]]
The economic calculation problem is a criticism of [[socialist economics]]. It was first proposed by [[Max Weber]] in 1920. This led to Mises discussing Weber's idea with his student Friedrich Hayek, who expanded upon it to such an extent that it became a key reason cited for the awarding of his Nobel prize.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth |accessdate=2008-09-08 |last=Von Mises |first=Ludwig |authorlink=Ludwig von Mises |year=1990|format=PDF |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |url=http://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf |isbn=0-945466-07-2 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080923191714/http://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf| archivedate= 23 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, (1935), &quot;The Nature and History of the Problem&quot; and &quot;The Present State of the Debate,&quot; om in F. A. Hayek, ed. ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', pp. 1–40, 201–243.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources effectively in an economy.

====On the economic calculation problem====
Austrian theory emphasizes the [[spontaneous order|organizing power]] of the [[price mechanism]]. Mises and Hayek argued that the price mechanism is the only viable solution to the economic calculation problem, as the price mechanism co-ordinates supply and investment decisions most efficiently.  Without the information efficiently and effectively provided by market prices, socialism lacks a method to efficiently allocate resources over an extended period of time in any market where the price mechanism is effective (an example where the price mechanism may not work is in the relatively confined area of [[public goods|public]] and [[common good (economics)|common goods]]). Those who agree with this criticism argue it is a refutation of socialism and that it shows that a socialist [[planned economy]] could never work in the long term for the vast bulk of the economy and has very limited potential application. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by historians of economic thought as ''The Socialist Calculation Debate.''&lt;ref name=&quot;School&quot;&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm The socialist calculation debate]{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mises argued in a 1920 article &quot;[[Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth]]&quot; that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned the [[means of production]], then no prices could be obtained for [[capital goods]] as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a socialist system and not &quot;objects of exchange,&quot; unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient since the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently.&lt;ref name=&quot;School&quot; /&gt;  This led him to declare &quot;…that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mises&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mises.org/humanaction/chap2sec4.asp|author=Ludwig von Mises|title=The Principle of Methodological Individualism|work=Human Action|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|accessdate=2009-04-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090422004804/http://mises.org/humanaction/chap2sec4.asp| archivedate= 22 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mises's declaration has been criticized as overstating the strength of his case, in describing socialism as impossible, rather than having to contend with a source of inefficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_soc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Bryan |title=Is socialism really &quot;impossible&quot;? |journal=Critical Review |volume=16 |pages=33–52 |year=2004 |doi=10.1080/08913810408443598 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business cycles===
{{Main|Austrian business cycle theory}}

====Background====
The Austrian theory of the [[business cycles|business cycle]] (or &quot;ABCT&quot;) focuses on the [[credit cycle]] as the primary cause of most business cycles. The theory was created by Hayek, by integrating Böhm-Bawerk's theory of capital and interest with Mises's arguments concerning how an expansion of the money supply or government manipulation of interest rates contributed to [[malinvestment]] ([[investment]]s of [[business entity|firms]] being badly allocated).

Empirical research by economists regarding the accuracy of the Austrian business cycle theory has generated disparate conclusions, though most research within mainstream economics regarding the theory concludes that the theory is inconsistent with empirical evidence. Economists such as [[Gordon Tullock]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tullock1988&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gordon Tullock |title=Why the Austrians are wrong about depressions |journal=The Review of Austrian Economics |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=73–78 |format=PDF |url=http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE2_1_4.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-24 |doi=10.1007/BF01539299 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Caplan,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/01/whats_wrong_wit_6.html |title=What's Wrong With Austrian Business Cycle Theory |last=Caplan |first=Bryan |date=2008-01-02 |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |accessdate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Friedman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman1969&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The Optimal Quantity of Money and Other Essays |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |pages=261–284 |chapter=The Monetary Studies of the National Bureau, 44th Annual Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman93&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The 'Plucking Model' of Business Fluctuations Revisited |journal=Economic Inquiry |pages=171–177 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Krugman]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/9593 |title=The Hangover Theory |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |date=1998-12-04 |publisher=Slate |accessdate=2008-06-20| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5u40jRL5e | archivedate = 2010-11-07| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; have said that they regard the theory as incorrect. In 1969, Friedman argued that the theory is not consistent with empirical evidence&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Milton. &quot;The Monetary Studies of the National Bureau, 44th Annual Report&quot;. The Optimal Quantity of Money and Other Essays. Chicago: Aldine. pp. 261–284.&lt;/ref&gt; and using newer data in 1993 reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Milton. &quot;The 'Plucking Model' of Business Fluctuations Revisited&quot;. Economic Inquiry: 171–177.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2001, Austrian economist James P. Keeler argued that the theory is consistent with empirical evidence&lt;ref name=&quot;springerlink.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeler | first1 = JP.  | year = 2001 | title = Empirical Evidence on the Austrian Business Cycle Theory | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/pn63r1177r367n43/?p=79dee61d27c14dbeabda7d0226825f09&amp;pi=4 | journal = Review of Austrian Economics | volume = 14 | issue =4 | pages = 331–351|doi=10.1023/A:1011937230775 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 2006, Austrian economist Robert Mulligan also argued that the theory is consistent with empirical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Pu33JCHbURIJ:mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae9_2_4.pdf+austrian+business+cycle+theory+empirical+evidence+mulligan+pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgSseKB9G5WJkN_4Q5ZY3LoTQhJ2hp14Js7bm60sB8sFXV5vjZQJiyhmOxE6soWOw4KlA4e6Ys8RAV18BN9x8Yq7Vlh1gQAOVed3Il7kJHdSoHcFM1J6tklyxusjUgOuCgA6Un1&amp;sig=AHIEtbQpYFTa-TeOlHTrxRn_9DtBg3ASRw An Empirical Examination of Austrian Business Cycle Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Austrian economist Murray Rothbard, the Austrian business cycle theory attempts to answer the following questions about things which Austrians believe appear over the course of a business cycle:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/rothbard/agd/chapter1.asp#boom_and_depression America's Great Depression], Murray Rothbard&lt;/ref&gt;
* Why is there a sudden general cluster of business errors?
* Why do [[capital good]]s industries and asset market prices fluctuate more widely than do the [[consumer good]]s industries and consumer prices?
* Why is there a general increase in the quantity of money in the economy during every boom, and why is there generally, though not universally, a fall in the [[money supply]] during the depression (or a sharp contraction in the growth of [[credit (finance)|credit]] in a recession)?

Rothbard also argues that a feature of the theory is how it integrates &quot;macro&quot; with &quot;mico&quot; economics, being a theory in harmony with general economic theory and other Austrian theories regarding price coordination and capital structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/daily/6197/Why-QE3-Will-Fail Why QE3 Will Fail], Mises.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assertions====
According to the theory, a boom-bust cycle of malinvestment is generated by excessive and unsustainable credit expansion to businesses and individual borrowers by the [[bank]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib.org&quot; /&gt; This [[money creation|credit creation]] makes it appear as if the supply of &quot;saved funds&quot; ready for investment has increased, for the effect is the same: the supply of funds for investment purposes increases, and the [[interest rate]] is lowered.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Mystery of Banking&quot;/&gt; Borrowers, in short, are misled by the bank [[monetary inflation|inflation]] into believing that the supply of saved funds (the pool of &quot;deferred&quot; funds ready to be invested) is greater than it really is.  When the pool of &quot;saved funds&quot; increases, entrepreneurs invest in &quot;longer process of production,&quot; i.e., the capital structure is lengthened, especially in the &quot;higher orders&quot;, most remote from the consumer.  Borrowers take their newly acquired funds and bid up the prices of capital and other producers' goods, which, in the theory, stimulates a shift of investment from consumer goods to capital goods industries. Austrians further contend that such a shift is unsustainable and must reverse itself in due course. They conclude that the longer the unsustainable shift in capital goods industries continues, the more violent and disruptive the necessary re-adjustment process.  While agreeing with economist Tyler Cowen, Bryan Caplan has stated that he also denies &quot;that the artificially stimulated investments have any tendency to become malinvestments.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;caplan_abct&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The preference by entrepreneurs for longer term investments can be shown graphically by using any [[discounted cash flow]] model. Lower interest rates increase the relative value of cash flows that come in the future.  When modeling an investment opportunity, if interest rates are artificially low, entrepreneurs are led to believe the income they will receive in the future is sufficient to cover their near term investment costs. Therefore, investments that would not make sense with a 10% cost of funds become feasible with a prevailing interest rate of 5%.

The proportion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] to saving or investment is determined by people's time preferences, which is the degree to which they prefer present to future satisfactions.  Thus, the pure interest rate is determined by the time preferences of the individuals in society, and the final market rates of interest reflect the pure interest rate plus or minus the entrepreneurial risk and purchasing power components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Mises/msT.html Theory of Money and Credit], Ludwig von Mises, Part II&lt;/ref&gt;

If the pricing signal triggering investment in the economy is artificially &quot;fixed&quot; too low, many entrepreneurs can make the same mistake at the same time (i.e. many believe investment funds are really available for long term projects when in fact the pool of available funds has come from credit creation - not real savings out of the existing money supply) because the debasement of the [[means of exchange]] is universal, . As they are all competing for the same pool of capital and market share, some entrepreneurs begin to borrow simply to avoid being &quot;overrun&quot; by other entrepreneurs who may take advantage of the lower interest rates to invest in more up-to-date capital infrastructure. A tendency towards over-investment and speculative borrowing in this &quot;artificial&quot; low interest rate environment is therefore almost inevitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib.org&quot;/&gt;

This new money then percolates downward from the business borrowers to the factors of production: to the landowners and capital owners who sold assets to the newly indebted [[entrepreneurs]], and then to the other factors of production in wages, rent, and interest. Austrians conclude that, since time preferences have not changed, people will rush to reestablish the old proportions, and demand will shift back from the higher to the lower orders.  In other words, depositors will tend to remove cash from the banking system and spend it (not save it), banks will then ask their borrowers for payment and interest rates and credit conditions will deteriorate.&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib.org&quot;/&gt;

Austrians argue that capital goods industries will find that their investments have been in error; that what they thought profitable really fails for lack of demand by their entrepreneurial customers. Higher orders of production will have turned out to be wasteful, and the malinvestment must be liquidated. In other words, the particular ''types'' of investments made during the monetary boom were inappropriate and &quot;wrong&quot; from the perspective of the long-term financial sustainability of the market because the price signals stimulating the investment were distorted by [[fractional reserve banking]]'s recursive lending &quot;ballooning&quot; the pricing structure in various capital markets. This concept is dependent on notion of the &quot;heterogeneity of capital&quot;, where Austrians emphasize that the mere macroeconomic &quot;total&quot; of investment does not adequately capture whether this investment is genuinely sustainable or productive, due to the inability of the raw numbers to reveal the particular investment activities being undertaken and the inherent inability of the numbers to reveal whether these particular investment activities were appropriate and economically sustainable given people's real preferences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Action&quot;&gt;[http://mises.org/document/3250 Human Action], Ludwig von Mises, p.572&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrians argue that a boom taking place under these circumstances is actually a period of wasteful malinvestment, a &quot;false boom&quot; where the particular kinds of investments undertaken during the period of fiat money expansion are revealed to lead nowhere but to insolvency and unsustainability. It is the time when errors are made, when speculative borrowing has driven up prices for assets and capital to unsustainable levels, due to low interest rates &quot;artificially&quot; increasing the [[money supply]] and triggering an unsustainable injection of [[fiat money]] &quot;funds&quot; available for investment into the system, thereby tampering with the complex pricing mechanism of the [[free market]].  &quot;Real&quot; savings would have required higher [[interest rates]] to encourage depositors to save their money in term deposits to invest in longer term projects under a stable money supply.  According to Mises's work, the artificial stimulus caused by bank-created credit causes a generalized speculative investment bubble, not justified by the long-term structure of the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib.org&quot;/&gt;

Mises further argues that a &quot;[[financial crisis|crisis]]&quot; (or &quot;[[credit crunch]]&quot;) arrives when the consumers come to reestablish their desired allocation of saving and consumption at prevailing interest rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Action&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt; Mises conjectured that the &quot;recession&quot; or &quot;depression&quot; is actually the process by which the economy adjusts to the wastes and errors of the monetary boom, and reestablishes efficient service of sustainable consumer desires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Action&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;

Austrians argue that continually expanding bank credit can keep the borrowers one step ahead of consumer retribution (with the help of successively lower interest rates from the [[central bank]]). In the theory, this postpones the &quot;day of reckoning&quot; and defers the collapse of unsustainably inflated asset prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Action&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;goldensextant.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.goldensextant.com/SavingtheSystem.html Saving the System], Robert K. Landis, 21 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be temporarily put off by [[exogeny|exogenous events]] such as the &quot;cheap&quot; or free acquisition of marketable resources by market participants and the banks funding the borrowing (such as the acquisition of land from local governments, or in extreme cases, the acquisition of foreign land through the waging of war).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/story/3010 War and Inflation], Lew Rockwell&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrians argue that the monetary boom ends when bank credit expansion finally stops - when no further investments can be found which provide adequate returns for speculative borrowers at prevailing interest rates. They further argue that the longer the &quot;false&quot; monetary boom goes on, the bigger and more speculative the borrowing, the more wasteful the errors committed and the longer and more severe will be the necessary bankruptcies, foreclosures, and depression readjustment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Action&quot;/&gt;

Austrian business cycle theory does not argue that fiscal restraint or &quot;austerity&quot; will bring about economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''[[America's Great Depression]]'', [[Murray Rothbard]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, it argues that attempts by central governments to support asset prices, bail out insolvent banks, or &quot;stimulate&quot; the economy with deficit spending will only make the misallocations and malinvestments worse, further confusing pricing information and therefore resource allocation.  Thus, the theory implies that continued mis-pricing by government policy will only prolong the depression and adjustment necessary to return to stable growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Austrians argue the policy error rests in the government's (and central bank's) weakness or negligence in allowing the &quot;false&quot; credit-fueled boom to begin in the first place, not in having it end with financial crisis or fiscal and monetary &quot;austerity&quot;. According to Ludwig von Mises:&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Action&quot;&gt;[http://mises.org/document/3250 Human Action], Ludwig von Mises, Chapter XX, section 8&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion. The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as a result of the voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion, or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The role of central banks====
Austrians generally argue that inherently damaging and ineffective central bank policies, including unsustainable expansion of bank credit through [[fractional reserve banking]], are the predominant cause of most business cycles, as they tend to set artificial interest rates too low for too long, resulting in excessive credit creation, speculative &quot;[[economic bubble|bubbles]]&quot;, and artificially low savings.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsten Polleit, [http://mises.org/story/2810 Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster], 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[fiat money|fiat monetary]] systems, a [[central bank]] creates new money when it lends to member banks, and this money is multiplied many times over through the [[money creation]] process of the private [[bank]]s.  This new bank-created money enters the loan market and provides a lower rate of interest than that which would prevail if the [[money supply]] were stable.&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Mystery of Banking&quot;&gt;[http://www.mises.org/Books/mysteryofbanking.pdf The Mystery of Banking], Murray Rothbard, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray Rothbard paid particular attention to the role of central banks in creating an environment of loose credit prior to the onset of the [[Great Depression]], and the subsequent ineffectiveness of central bank policies, which simply delayed necessary price adjustments and prolonged market dysfunction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Rothbard begins with the premise that in a market with no centralized monetary authority, there would be no simultaneous cluster of malinvestments or entrepreneurial errors, since astute [[entrepreneur]]s would not all make errors at the same time and would quickly take advantage of any temporary, isolated mispricing. In addition, in an [[openness|open]], non-centralized (uninsured) capital market, astute bankers would shy away from speculative lending and uninsured depositors would carefully monitor the balance sheets of risky financial institutions, tempering any speculative excesses that arose sporadically in the finance markets.  In Rothbard's view, the cycle of generalized malinvestment is greatly exacerbated by centralized monetary intervention in the money markets by the [[central bank]]. Such propositions from Rothbard prompted criticism from Bryan Caplan, who questions &quot;Why does Rothbard think businessmen are so incompetent at forecasting government policy? He credits them with entrepreneurial foresight about all market-generated conditions, but curiously finds them unable to forecast government policy, or even to avoid falling prey to simple accounting illusions generated by inflation and deflation... Particularly in interventionist economies, it would seem that natural selection would weed out businesspeople with such a gigantic blind spot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;caplan_abct&quot; /&gt;

Rothbard argues that an over-encouragement to borrow and lend is initiated by the mispricing of credit via the [[central bank]]'s centralized control over interest rates and its need to protect banks from periodic [[bank runs]] (which Austrians believe then causes interest rates to be set too low for too long when compared to the rates that would prevail in a genuine non-[[central bank]] dominated [[free market]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;econlib.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;&gt;[http://mises.org/story/2810 Manipulating the Interest Rate: a Recipe for Disaster], Thorsten Polleit, 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The School owes its name to members of the German [[Historical school of economics]], who argued against the Austrians during the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' (&quot;methodology struggle&quot;), in which the Austrians defended the reliance that classical economists placed upon deductive logic. In 1883, Menger published ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics'', which attacked the methods of the Historical school. [[Gustav von Schmoller]], a leader of the Historical school, responded with an unfavorable review, coining the term &quot;Austrian School&quot; in an attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincial.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Menger’s approach – haughtily dismissed by the leader of the German Historical School, Gustav Schmoller, as merely “Austrian,” the origin of that label – led to a renaissance of theoretical economics in Europe and, later, in the United States.&quot; [[Peter G. Klein]], 2007; in the Foreword to ''Principles of Economics'', Carl Menger; trns. James Dingwall and Bert F. Hoselitz, 1976; Ludwig von Mises Institute, Alabama; 2007; ISBN 978-1-933550-12-1&lt;/ref&gt; The label remained and was adopted by the adherents themselves.

===Precursors===
[[File:Jean-baptiste Say.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Jean-Baptiste Say]]]]

[[Classical economics]] theory is generally considered to be a major precursor to the Austrian School. Classical economists [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]] argued that value is subjective. In the late 19th century, attention then focused on the concepts of [[marginalism|“marginal” cost and value]]. 

Austrian economist [[Murray Rothbard]] has argued that the roots of the Austrian School came from the teachings of the [[School of Salamanca]] in the 15th century and [[Physiocrats]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/etexts/austrian.asp What is Austrian economics?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CarlMenger.png|right|thumb|130px|[[Carl Menger]]]]
The school originated in [[Vienna]], in the [[Austrian Empire]]. Carl Menger's 1871 book, ''[[Principles of Economics]]'', is generally considered the founding of the Austrian School. The book was one of the first modern treatises to advance the theory of [[marginal utility]]. The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the marginalist revolution of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist approach in economics.&lt;ref name=keizer&gt;{{cite book |last=Keizer |first=Willem |title=Austrian Economics in Debate |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-14054-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2011}} While marginalism was generally influential, there was also a more specific school that began to coalesce around Menger's work, which came to be known as the “Psychological School,” “Vienna School,” or “Austrian School.”&lt;ref&gt;Israel M. Kirzner (1987). &quot;Austrian School of Economics,&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 145–151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorstein Veblen]] introduced the term [[neoclassical economics]] in his ''Preconceptions of Economic Science'' (1900) to distinguish marginalists in the objective cost tradition of [[Alfred Marshall]] from those in the subjective valuation tradition of the Austrian School.&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein Bunde; “The Preconceptions of Economic Science” Pt III, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' v14 (1900).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colander&quot; &gt;Colander, David; ''The Death of Neoclassical Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=August 2011}}

[[Carl Menger]] contributions to economic theory were closely followed by that of Böhm-Bawerk and [[Friedrich von Wieser]]. These three economists became what is known as the &quot;first wave&quot; of the Austrian School. Böhm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of [[Karl Marx]] in the 1880s and 1890s, as was part of the Austrians' participation in the late 19th Century ''Methodenstreit'', during which they attacked the [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] doctrines of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Israel Kirzner.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Israel Kirzner]]]]

By the mid-1930s, much of mainstream economics had absorbed what were seen as the important contributions of the Austrians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boettke and Leeson&quot;/&gt; After [[World War II]], Austrian economics was ill-thought of by most economists because it rejected mathematical and statistical methods in the study of economics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/kq577622488v4447/fulltext.pdf Austrian economics and the mainstream: View from the boundary]&quot; by Roger E. Backhouse, $34 to view {{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian economics after 1940 can be divided into two schools of economic thought, and the school &quot;split&quot; to some degree in the late 20th century. One camp of Austrians, exemplified by Mises, regards neoclassical methodology to be irredeemably flawed; the other camp, exemplified by Friedrich Hayek, accepts a large part of neoclassical methodology and is more accepting of government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae7_1_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mises view was carried on by [[Murray Rothbard]] and economists such as [[Jesus Huerta de Soto]].  The other was subsumed within more conventional mainstream free-market thinking and was more conciliatory to government economic policy, fiat money, and central banking.  [[Lawrence White]] and [[George Selgin]] are advocates for this more conciliatory approach.

The reputation of the Austrian School rose in the late-20th century due in part to the work of [[Israel Kirzner]] and [[Ludwig Lachmann]], and renewed interest in the work of Hayek after he won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meijer 1995&quot;/&gt; Hayek's work was influential in the revival of ''laissez-faire'' thought in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=raico&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mises.org/etexts/austrianliberalism.asp |title=Austrian Economics and Classical Liberalism |first=Ralph |last=Raico |work=mises.org |publisher=Mises Institute |year=2011 |quote=despite the particular policy views of its founders ..., Austrianism was perceived as the economics of the free market |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kasper |first=Sherryl Davis |title=The Revival of Laissez-faire in American Macroeconomic Theory |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-84064-606-1 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Hayek, one of Mises's students, [[Murray Rothbard]], became prominent in Austrian theory.  Rothbard opposed [[fractional reserve banking]], viewing it as a [[Misrepresentation|fraudulent contract]] that should be [[criminalize]]d as a sub-category of [[embezzlement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mises_a&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/daily/6206/Krugmans-MMMF-Question Krugman's MMMF Question]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/daily/6056/JPMorgan-Chase-and-Central-Banking JP Morgan Chase and Central Banking], Frank Shostak&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also these Rothbard articles: [http://www.mises.org/money.asp What Has Government Done to Our Money?], [http://www.mises.org/story/1829 The Case for the 100% Gold Dollar]; [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/cartelization.pdf The Fed as Cartel], [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard191.html Private Coinage], [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard190.html Repudiate the National Debt]; [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard181.html Taking Money Back], [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard163.html Anatomy of the Bank Run], [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard128.html Money and the Individual]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century===
Several Austrian economists have made contributions to Austrian economics in the twenty-first century, including noted Spanish economist [[Jesús Huerta de Soto]], Anthony Carilli,&lt;ref name=&quot;Austrian Economics 2008, pages 271-281&quot;&gt;The Review of Austrian Economics, 2008, vol. 21, issue 4, pages 271-281&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Dempster,&lt;ref name=&quot;Austrian Economics 2008, pages 271-281&quot;/&gt; [[Roger Garrison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Auburn User |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/strigl.htm |title=Overconsumption And Forced Saving |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Horwitz]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Horwitz, Steven 2000&quot;/&gt; and [[Robert P.

Carlilli, Dempster, Garrison, de Soto and Murphy have contributed to the Austrian business cycle theory.

==Influence==
Many theories developed by &quot;first wave&quot; Austrian economists have been absorbed by mainstream economics. These include Carl Menger's theories on marginal utility, Friedrich von Wieser's theories on opportunity cost, and Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk's theories on time preference, as well as Menger and Böhm-Bawerk's criticisms of [[Marxian economics]].

The former [[U.S. Federal Reserve]] Chairman, [[Alan Greenspan]], speaking of the originators of the School, said in 2000, &quot;the Austrian School have reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a profound and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan. &quot;Hearings before the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services.&quot; U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services. Washington D.C.. 25 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Laureate [[James M.

Austrian economic ideas are also promoted by bodies such as the [[Mises Institute]] and the [[Foundation for Economic Education]].

==Criticisms==

===General criticisms===
Some economists have argued that Austrians are often averse to the use of mathematics and statistics in economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;white1&quot;/&gt;

Economist Bryan Caplan argues that Austrians have often misunderstood modern economics, causing them to overstate their differences with it. For example, many Austrians object to the use of [[cardinal utility]] in microeconomic theory; however, microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results hold for all strictly [[monotonic]] transformations of utility, and so are true for purely [[ordinal utility|ordinal preferences]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_ord&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/whyaust.htm|title=Why I Am Not an Austrian Economist |last=Caplan |first=Bryan |publisher=[[George Mason University]] |accessdate=2008-07-04 | quote=According to Rothbard, the mainstream approach credulously accepted the use of cardinal utility, when only the use of ordinal utility is defensible. As Rothbard insists, &quot;Value scales of each individual are purely ordinal, and there is no way whatever of measuring the distance between the rankings; indeed, any concept of such distance is a fallacious one.&quot; ...As plausible as Rothbard sounds on this issue, he simply does not understand the position he is attacking. The utility function approach is based as squarely on ordinal utility as Rothbard's is. The modern neoclassical theorists - such as Arrow and Debreau - who developed the utility function approach went out of their way to avoid the use of cardinal utility. ...To sum up, Rothbard falsely accused neoclassical utility theory of assuming cardinality. It does not.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan_journal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bryan |last=Caplan |title=The Austrian Search for Realistic Foundations |publisher=Southern Economic Association |journal=Southern Economic Journal |month=Apr |year=1999 |pages=823–838 |volume=65 |issue=4 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/1061278 |jstor=1061278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that conclusions about utility preferences hold no matter what values are assigned to them. Austrian economist [[:de:Jörg Guido Hülsmann|Jörg Guido Hülsmann]] argues that Caplan's criticism is incorrect because he assumes praxeology is a form of applied psychology instead of a theory of action.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Guido Hülsmann, ''Economic Science and Neoclassicalism'', http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae2_4_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] has stated that because Austrians do not use &quot;explicit models&quot; they are unaware of holes in their own thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman 2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/martin-and-the-austrians |title=The Conscience of a Liberal: Martin And The Austrians |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=4-7-2010 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=9-21-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Benjamin Klein has criticized the economic methodological work of Austrian economist [[Israel M. Kirzner]]. While praising Kirzner for highlighting shortcomings in traditional methodology, Klein argued that Kirzner did not provide a viable alternative for economic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Benjamin. &quot;Book review: ''Competition and Entrepreneurship''&quot; (by [[Israel M. Kirzner]], University of Chicago Press, 1973) ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''.

Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] argues that among developed countries, those with high rates of taxation and high social welfare spending perform better on most measures of economic performance compared to countries with low rates of taxation and low social outlays. He concludes that Friedrich Hayek was wrong to argue that high levels of government spending harms an economy, and &quot;a generous social-welfare state is not a road to serfdom but rather to fairness, economic equality and international competitiveness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Social Welfare State, Beyond Ideology |last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey |date = October 2006|journal=Scientific American |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-social-welfare-state |accessdate=2008-06-20|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian economist [[Sudha Shenoy]] responded by arguing that countries with large public sectors have grown more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Sudha R. Shenoy, ''Are High Taxes the Basis of Freedom and Prosperity?'', http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/are-high-taxes-the-basis-of-freedom-and-prosperity/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology===
Mainstream economists generally argue that Austrian economics lacks scientific rigor and rejects scientific methods and the use of empirical data in modelling economic behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;white1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The research program of Austrian economics |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited |first=Lawrence H. |last=White |journal=Advances in Austrian Economics |year=2008 |page=20 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton1999&quot;&gt;&quot;Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]&quot;, {{harvnb |Newton |1999 |pp=794–6 }}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists describe Austrian methodology as being ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or [[empirical|non-empirical]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tremble&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul A. |last=Samuelson |title=Theory and Realism: A Reply |publisher=[[American Economic Association]] |journal=The [[American Economic Review]] |month=Sep |year=1964 |pages=736–739 |quote=Well, in connection with the exaggerated claims that used to be made in economics for the power of deduction and a priori reasoning ..... – I tremble for the reputation of my subject.

Economist [[Mark Blaug]] has criticized over-reliance on methodological individualism, arguing it would rule out all macroeconomic propositions that cannot be reduced to microeconomic ones, and hence reject almost the whole of received macroeconomics.&lt;ref name=Blaug&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blaug|first=Mark|title=The Methodology of Economics: Or, How Economists Explain|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43678-8|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Mayer]] has stated that Austrians advocate a rejection of the [[Scientific Method]] which involves the development of empirically falsifiable [[Scientific theory#Pedagogical definition|theories]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton1999&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayer1998&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, many supporters of using models of market behavior to analyze and test economic theory argue that economists have developed numerous experiments that elicit useful information about individual preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000391 |title=Models |first=Mary S. |last=Morgan |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics  |year=2008 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000569 |title=Causality in economics and econometrics |first=Kevin D.  |last=Hoover |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics  |year=2008 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital and interest===
Many [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] object to the theory of time preference being applied to an economy as a whole in a capitalist society. They argue that the theory fails to take into account that making profits in a capitalist society is not the provision of future means of consumption, but rather profits for their own sake.&lt;ref&gt;The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective, '' An Anarchist FAQ'' http://infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionC2#secc26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business cycle theory===
According to most mainstream economists, the Austrian business cycle theory is incorrect.

====Theory====
Some mainstream economists argue that the Austrian business cycle theory requires bankers and investors to exhibit a kind of irrationality, because their theory requires investors to be regularly fooled into making unprofitable investments by temporarily low interest rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caplan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tullock1988&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/05/rp_5_4.pdf Problems with Austrian Business Cycle Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; In response, historian [[Thomas Woods]] argues that few investors are familiar enough with the Austrian business cycle theory to consistently make sound investment decisions and bankers are often bailed out in any case, creating [[moral hazard]] in the financial system. Austrian economists Anthony Carilli and Gregory Dempster argue that a banker or firm loses market share if it does not borrow or loan at a magnitude consistent with current interest rates, regardless of whether rates are below their natural levels. Thus businesses are forced to operate as though rates were set appropriately, because the consequence of a single entity deviating would be a loss of business.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austrian Economics 2008, pages 271-281&quot;/&gt; Austrian economist Robert Murphy argues that it is difficult for investors to make sound business choices because they cannot know what the interest rate would be if it were set by the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://mises.org/daily/3466&quot;/&gt; Austrian economist [[Sean Rosenthal (economist)|Sean Rosenthal]] argues that widespread knowledge of the Austrian business cycle theory increases the amount of malinvestment during periods of artificially low interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Sean Rosenthal |url=http://mises.org/daily/6068/When-Anticipation-Makes-Things-Worse |title=When Anticipation Makes Things Worse - Sean Rosenthal - Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Paul Krugman has argued that the theory cannot explain changes in unemployment over the business cycle. Austrian business cycle theory postulates that business cycles are caused by the misallocation of resources from consumption to investment during &quot;booms&quot;, and out of investment during &quot;busts&quot;. Krugman argues that because total spending is equal to total income in an economy, the theory implies that the reallocation of resources during &quot;busts&quot; would increase employment in consumption industries, whereas in reality, spending declines in all sectors of an economy during recessions. He also argues that according to the theory the initial &quot;booms&quot; would also cause resource reallocation, which implies an increase in unemployment during booms as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krugman&quot; /&gt; In response, Austrian economist [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] argues that Krugman's argument is dependent on a misrepresentation of the theory. He furthermore argues that prices on consumption goods may go up as a result of the investment bust, which could mean that the amount spent on consumption could increase even though the quantity of goods consumed has not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/daily/3579 Hangover Theory: How Paul Krugman Has Misconceived Austrian Theory - David Gordon - Mises Daily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Roger Garrison argues that a false boom caused by artificially low interest rates would cause a boom in consumption goods as well as investment goods (with a decrease in &quot;middle goods&quot;), thus explaining the jump in unemployment at the end of a boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Auburn User |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/strigl.htm |title=Overconsumption And Forced Saving |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Austrians also argue that capital allocated to investment goods cannot be quickly augmented to create consumption goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Roger W. Garrison |url=http://mises.org/daily/1215 |title=Hayek on Industrial Fluctuations - Roger W. Garrison - Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Jeffery Hummel is critical of Hayek's explanation of labor asymmetry in booms and busts. He argues that Hayek makes peculiar assumptions about demand curves for labor in his explanation of how a decrease in investment spending creates unemployment. He also argues that the labor asymmetry can be explained in terms of a change in real wages, but this explanation fails to explain the business cycle in terms of resource allocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hummel&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/05/rp_5_4.pdf ''Reason Papers'' |title=Problems with Austrian Business Cycle Theory |last=Hummel |first=Jeffery Rogers|date=Winter 1979|format=PDF |pages=41–53|accessdate=9-17-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Empirical evidence====
Hummel argues that the Austrian explanation of the business cycle fails on empirical grounds. In particular, he notes that investment spending remained positive in all recessions where there are data, except for the [[Great Depression]]. He argues that this casts doubt on the notion that recessions are caused by a reallocation of resources from industrial production to consumption, since he argues that the Austrian business cycle theory implies that net investment should be below zero during recessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hummel&quot;/&gt; In response, Austrian economist [[Walter Block]] argues that the misallocation during booms does not preclude the possibility of demand increasing overall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/30/rp_30_4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have also argued that, as the Austrian business cycle theory points to the actions of fractional-reserve banks and central banks to explain the business cycles, it fails to explain the severity of business cycles before the establishment of the [[Federal Reserve]] in 1913. Supporters of the Austrian business cycle theory respond that the theory applies to the expansion of the money supply, not necessarily an expansion done by a central bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises1&quot;&gt;http://mises.org/books/desoto.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Thomas Woods argues that the crashes were caused by various privately-owned banks with state charters that issued paper money, supposedly convertible to gold, in amounts greatly exceeding their gold reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Thomas E., Jr. (2009). Meltdown: A Free-Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed, the Economy Tanked, and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse (1st ed.). Regnery Publishing, Inc.. pp. 88–94. ISBN 978-1-59698-587-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, economist Milton Friedman, after examining the history of business cycles in the U.S., concluded that &quot;The Hayek-Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence. It is, I believe, false.&quot;&lt;ref name=Friedman1969/&gt; He analyzed the issue using newer data in 1993, and again reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman93&quot;/&gt; Austrian economist [[Jesus Huerta de Soto]] argued that Friedman's conclusions are based on misleading data (such as [[GDP]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;mises1&quot;/&gt; Austrian economist Roger Garrison argued that Friedman misinterpreted economic aggregates and how they related to the [[business cycle]]s he reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Auburn User |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/fm1pluck.htm |title=Plucking Model |publisher=Auburn.edu |date=1982-10-25 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
