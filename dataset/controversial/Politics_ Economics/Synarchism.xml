'''Synarchism''' is a term which generally refers to &quot;joint rule&quot; or &quot;harmonious rule&quot;.

Beyond this general definition, however, both &quot;synarchism&quot; and '''synarchy''' have been used to describe several different [[politics|political]] processes in various contexts.  Increasingly, the terms have been used by [[conspiracy theorists]] to mean rule by a secret [[elite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Parekh 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Parekh, Rupal | title = WPP'S 'Synarchy' Name Choice Sparks Sneers | year = 2008 | url = http://adage.com/agencynews/article?article_id=127164 | accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;synarchy&quot; is attributed to [[Thomas Stackhouse]] (1677–1752), an English clergyman who used the word in his ''New History of the Holy Bible from the Beginning of the World to the Establishment of Christianity'' (published in two folio volumes in 1737). The attribution can be found in the [[Webster's Dictionary]] (the American Dictionary of the English Language, published by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828). Webster's definition for &quot;synarchy&quot; is limited entirely to &quot;joint rule or [[sovereignty]]&quot;.  The word is derived from the Greek stems &quot;syn&quot; meaning with or together and &quot;archy&quot; meaning rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1828-dictionary.com/d/word/synarchy Synarchy entry on ''Noah Webster's 1828 American Dictionary'' web edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most substantial early use of the word &quot;synarchy&quot; comes from the writings of [[Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre]] (1842–1909), who used the term in his book ''La France vraie'' to describe what he believed was the ideal [[form of government]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Yves d'Alveydre, ''La France vraie'' (Paris: Calmann Lévy, 1887).&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to the emergence of [[anarchist]] ideologies and movements, Saint-Yves elaborated a political formula which he believed would lead to a harmonious society. He defended social differentiation and hierarchy with collaboration between social classes, transcending conflict between social and economic groups: synarchy, as opposed to [[anarchy]]. Specifically, Saint-Yves envisioned a [[Federal Europe]] (as well as all the states it has integrated) with a [[corporatism|corporatist]] government composed of three [[Council of State|councils]], one for [[academia]], one for the [[judiciary]], and one for [[chamber of commerce|commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;André Nataf, ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of the Occult'' (Wordsworth Editions Ltd; 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule by a secret elite==
Some [[conspiracy theorists]] use the word &quot;synarchy&quot; to describe a [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]], a form of government where political power effectively rests with a secret [[elite]], in contrast to an &quot;[[oligarchy]]&quot; where the elite is or could be known by the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton &amp; Robin Mackness 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Patton, Guy; Mackness, Robin | title = Web of Gold: The Secret History of Sacred Treasures | publisher = Sidgwick &amp; Jackson | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-283-06344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occultism===

Some authors{{Who|date=March 2012}} have claimed that Saint-Yves was a &quot;[[theocracy|theocratic]] [[occultist]]&quot; who  used &quot;synarchy&quot; to describe a form of government where [[political power]] effectively rests with [[secret societies]] or, more precisely, [[esoteric]] societies, which are composed of [[oracle]]s. Furthermore he is supposed to have associated &quot;synarchy&quot; with the rule of &quot;[[ascended master]]s&quot; who lived in the subterranean caverns of [[Agartha]] and supposedly communicated with him [[telepathy|telepathically]].&lt;ref&gt;Joscelyn Godwyn, ''Arktos: The Polar Myth - in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', p.84 (Adventures Unlimited Press, USA; 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; However, other authors{{Who|date=March 2012}} have described these claims about Saint-Yves as false and originating in occult [[conspiracy theories]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===In Vichy France===

According to former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] officer William Langer (''Our Vichy Gamble'', Alfred A Knopf, New York, 1947), there were French industrial and banking interests who &quot;even before the war, had turned to Nazi Germany and had looked to Hitler as the savior of Europe from Communism. These people were as good fascists as any in Europe. Many of them had extensive and intimate business relations with German interests and were still dreaming of a new system of 'synarchy', which meant government of Europe on fascist principles by an international brotherhood of financiers and industrialists.&quot;

This theory allegedly originated with the discovery of a document called ''Pacte Synarchique'' following the death of Jean Coutrot, former member of [[Groupe X-Crise]], on May 15, 1941.  According to this document, a ''Mouvement Synarchique d'Empire'' had been founded in 1922, with the aim of abolishing [[parliamentarianism]] and replacing it with synarchy. This led to the belief that [[La Cagoule]], a far-right organisation, was the armed branch of French synarchism, and that some important members of the [[Vichy Regime]] were synarchists. An investigation was in fact ordered by the Vichy government, leading to the ''Rapport Chavin''&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chavin, ''Rapport confidentiel sur la société secrète polytechnicienne dite Mouvement synarchique d’Empire (MSE) ou Convention synarchique révolutionnaire'', 1941&lt;/ref&gt; but no evidence for the existence of the ''Mouvement Synarchiste d'Empire'' was found. Most of the presumed synarchists were either associated with the Banque Worms or with Groupe X-Crise and were close to Admiral [[François Darlan]], and this has led to the belief that synarchists had engineered the military defeat of France for the profit of Banque Worms.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Lacroiz-Riz, ''Le choix de la défaite : Les élites françaises dans les années 1930'', [[Armand Colin]], 2006. ISBN 978-2-200-26784-1&lt;/ref&gt;

This belief system has been dismissed as a &quot;work of a paranoid imagination which wove together the histories of three disparate groups of activists, creating a conspiracy among them where none existed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Kuisel, ''The Legend of the Vichy Synarchy'' (French Historical Studies, Vol. 6, No. 3; Spring, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some historians suspect that the ''Pacte Synarchique'' was a [[hoax]] created by some members of La Cagoule to weaken Darlan and his technocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Dard, ''La synarchie, le mythe du complot permanent,'' Paris, Perrin, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propaganda Due ===

The [[Propaganda Due]] lodge (P2) was a &quot;textbook example&quot; of an attempt to establish a synarchy, as it united politicians, the Catholic Church, and the Mafia-controlled tax-free drug economy guaranteed by the historically falsified prohibition of psychotropic substances.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, John Michael. ''The Element Encyclopedia of Secret Societies.'' HarperElement, London, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===LaRouche===

[[Lyndon LaRouche]], leader of a [[LaRouche movement|controversial movement]] on the political fringe,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mintz 1985&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last=Mintz | first=John | title = Ideological Odyssey: From Old Left to Far Right| year = 1985 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/main.htm| accessdate = 2008-04-17 | work=The Washington Post | date=1999-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,16626352-28737,00.html] The Australian {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a wide-ranging historical phenomenon, starting with Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre and the [[Martinist Order]] followed by important individuals, organizations, movements and regimes that are alleged to have been synarchist, including the [[Nazi Germany#Government|government of Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LaRouche 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaRouche | first=Lyndon | title = Reviving the Sense of Mission For American Citizens Today|    year = 2003 |url = http://www.larouchepub.com/lar/2003/3046bsn_event.html| accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that during the [[Great Depression]] an international coalition of financial institutions, raw materials cartels, and [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] operatives, installed [[fascist]] regimes throughout [[Europe]] (and tried to do so in [[Mexico]]) to maintain world order and prevent the repudiation of [[international debt]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|    last=Steinberg | first=Jeffrey |    title = Synarchism: The Fascist Roots Of the Wolfowitz Cabal|    year = 2003 |   url = http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2003/3021synarchism.html| accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche identifies the former U.S. Vice President and former [[PNAC]] member [[Dick Cheney]] as a modern &quot;synarchist&quot;, and claims that &quot;synarchists&quot; have &quot;a scheme for replacing regular military forces of nations, by [[private military company|private armies]] in the footsteps of a privately financed international [[Waffen-SS]]-like scheme, a force deployed by leading financier institutions, such as the multi-billions funding by the U.S. Treasury, of Cheney's [[Halliburton]] gang.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LaRouche, Jr 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|    last=LaRouche, Jr | first=Lyndon H. |  title = The Empire Versus the Nations: Synarchism, Sport &amp; Iran| year = 2008 |url = http://www.larouchepac.com/pages/writings_files/2006/060527_synarchism_sport.htm| accessdate=2008-04-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080324035429/http://www.larouchepac.com/pages/writings_files/2006/060527_synarchism_sport.htm |archivedate = March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of synarchism==
===China===
[[Harvard]] historian and [[sinology|sinologist]] [[John K. Fairbank]] used the word &quot;synarchism&quot; in his 1953 book ''Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast: The Opening of the Treaty Ports, 1842-1854'' and in later writings, to describe the mechanisms of government under the late [[Qing dynasty]] in [[China]]. Fairbank's synarchy is a form of rule by co-opting existing elites and powers, bringing them into the system and legitimising them through a schedule of rituals and tributes that gave them a stake in the Chinese regime and neutralised any risk that they might rebel against the monarchy. He believed that the Qing, who were considered outside rulers because of their [[Manchu]] origins, had developed this strategy out of necessity because they did not have their own political base in China. This conception of Qing rule is not universally accepted among sinologists and historians of China, but is a respected, [[mainstream]] view with significant support in the field.

The term is also used by some political scientists to describe the [[Colonial Hong Kong|British colonial government in Hong Kong]] (1842–1997). [[Ambrose King]], in his controversial 1975 paper ''Administrative Absorption of Politics in Hong Kong'', described colonial Hong Kong's administration as &quot;elite consensual government&quot;.  In it, he claimed, any coalition of elites or forces capable of challenging the legitimacy of Hong Kong's administrative structure would be co-opted by the existing apparatus through the appointment of leading political activists, business figures and other elites to oversight committees, by granting them [[British honours system|British honours]], and by bringing them into elite institutions like Hong Kong's horse racing clubs. He called this &quot;synarchy&quot;, by extension of Fairbank's use of the word.

===Mexican synarchism===
{{main|Mexican synarchism}}
&quot;Synarchy&quot; is also the name of the ideology of a political movement in [[Mexico]] dating from the 1930s. In [[Mexico]] it was historically a movement of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[extreme right]], in some ways akin to [[fascism]], violently opposed to the [[Populism|populist]] and [[secularist]] policies of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|revolutionary]] (PNR, PRM, and PRI) governments that ruled Mexico from 1929 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lucas |first=Jeffrey Kent | title=The Rightward Drift of Mexico’s Former Revolutionaries: The Case of Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama |year=2010 |publisher=Lewiston, NY: [[Edwin Mellen Press]] |isbn=978-0-7734-3665-7 |pages=207–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Synarchist Union]] ''(Unión Nacional Sinarquista,'' UNS) was founded in May 1937 by a group of Catholic political activists led by José Antonio Urquiza, who was murdered in April 1938, and [[Salvador Abascal]]. In 1946 a faction of the movement loyal to deposed leader [[Manuel Torres Bueno]]  regrouped as the [[Popular Force Party]] (Partido Fuerza Popular). Synarchism revived as a political movement in the 1970s through the [[Mexican Democratic Party]] (PDM),&lt;ref&gt;A. Riding, ''Mexico: Inside the Volcano'', Coronet Books, 1989, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; whose candidate, Ignacio González Gollaz, polled 1.8 percent of the vote at the 1982 presidential election. In 1988 [[Gumersindo Magaña]] polled a similar proportion, but the party then suffered a split, and in 1992 lost its registration as a [[political party]]. It was dissolved in 1996.

There are now two organisations, both calling themselves the Unión Nacional Sinarquista, one apparently right-wing orientation, the other apparently left-wing. [[Carlos María Abascal Carranza|Carlos Abascal]], son of [[Salvador Abascal]], was Mexico's Secretary of the Interior during [[Vicente Fox]]'s presidency. Many ''sinarquistas'' are now militant in the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], PAN, the party in power since 2000 first with [[Vicente Fox]] and now with [[Felipe Calderón]] (since 2006) as presidents. ''Sinarquistas'' are influential policy makers in matters like education and health.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
