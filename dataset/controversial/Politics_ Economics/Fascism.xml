'''Fascism''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|f|æ|ʃ|ɪ|z|əm}}) is a [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Nationalism|nationalist]] political [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;authoritarian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;authoritarianism&quot;/&gt; Fascists seek to unify their [[nation]] based on commitment to a nation state where its individuals are united together as one people through their [[national identity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gj120&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; The unity of the nation is to be based upon suprapersonal connections of [[ancestry]] and [[culture]] through a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state that seeks the [[mass mobilization]] of the national community through [[discipline]], [[indoctrination]], [[Physical exercise|physical training]], and [[eugenics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gj120&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Fascism utilizes a [[vanguard party]] to initiate a [[revolution]] to organize the nation upon fascist principles.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatwell&quot;/&gt; The fascist party and state is led by a [[supreme leader]] who exercises a [[dictatorship]] over the party, the government and other state institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;comparative&quot;/&gt; Fascism views [[direct action]] including [[political violence]] and [[war]], as a means to achieve national rejuvenation, spirit and [[Vitalism|vitality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gj120&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley G. Payne 1945. Pp. 106&quot;&gt;Stanley G. Payne. A History of Fascism, 1914–1945. Pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fascism recognizes the existence of [[class conflict]] in societies, and advocates a resolution to end the division of classes and secure national solidarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffin, Roger 1991 pp. 222&quot;/&gt; However fascism publicly favours [[Proletariat|proletarian]] culture, and claims that cultural nationalization of society emancipates the nation's proletariat, and promotes the assimilation of all classes into a [[proletarian nation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffin, Roger 1991 pp. 222&quot;/&gt;

Fascism advocates a state-controlled and regulated [[mixed economy]]; the principal economic goal of fascism is to achieve [[autarky]] to secure national [[self-sufficiency]] and independence, through [[Protectionism|protectionist]] and interventionist economic policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 188-189&quot;/&gt; It promotes regulated [[private enterprise]] and [[private property]] contingent whenever beneficial to the nation and [[state enterprise]] and [[state property]] whenever necessary to protect its interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 188-189&quot;/&gt; It supports [[criminalization]] of [[Strike action|strikes]] by [[employee]]s and [[Lockout (industry)|lockouts]] by [[employer]]s because it deems these acts as prejudicial and detrimental to the national community and therefore to society as an entirety.&lt;ref name=&quot;bolshevism&quot;/&gt; Fascism promotes such economics as a &quot;[[Third Position|third position]]&quot; alternative to [[capitalism]] and [[Marxism]], as fascism declares both as being obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank Joseph 2010. Pp. 50&quot;/&gt;

Fascism was founded during [[World War I]] by Italian [[National syndicalism|national syndicalists]] who combined [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political views.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZeevSternhell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts&quot;/&gt; Fascists have commonly opposed having a firm association with any section of the [[Left–right politics|left-right spectrum]], considering it inadequate to describe their beliefs,&lt;ref name=&quot;university&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aristotle&quot;/&gt; though fascism's goal to promote the rule of people deemed innately superior while seeking to purge society of people deemed innately inferior is identified as a prominent [[Far-right politics|far-right]] theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver H. Woshinsky 2008. Pp. 156&quot;/&gt; Fascism opposes multiple ideologies, such as: [[communism]], [[conservatism]], [[liberalism]], and [[social democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia2&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''fascismo'' is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[fasces]]''. The fasces, which consisted of a bundle of rods that were tied around an axe, was an [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbol of the authority of the civic [[Roman Magistrates|magistrate]]. They were carried by his [[lictor]]s and could be used for [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] and [[capital punishment]] at his command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster's II New College Dictionary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paynee&quot;/&gt; The word ''fascismo'' also relates to political organizations in Italy known as [[fasci]], groups similar to [[guild]]s or [[syndicate]]s.

The symbolism of the fasces suggested ''strength through unity'': a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break.&lt;ref name=&quot;In the Shadow of the Fasces: Political Design in Fascist Italy&quot;/&gt; Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements. For example the [[Falange]] symbol is five arrows joined together by a [[yoke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fashioning the Body Politic: Dress, Gender, Citizenship&quot;/&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Main|Definitions of fascism}}
Historians, political scientists and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;pheonix&quot;/&gt; Each form of fascism is distinct, leaving many definitions too wide or narrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;deff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;intelligentguide&quot;/&gt; Since the 1990s, scholars including [[Stanley Payne]], Roger Eatwell, [[Roger Griffin]] and [[Robert O. Paxton]] have been gathering a rough consensus on the ideology's core tenets.

For Griffin, fascism is &quot;a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism&quot; built on a complex range of theoretical and cultural influences. He distinguishes an inter-war period in which it manifested itself in elite-led but populist &quot;armed party&quot; politics opposing socialism and liberalism and promising radical politics to rescue the nation from decadence.&lt;ref name=&quot;brookes&quot;/&gt; 

Paxton sees fascism as &quot;a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;anatomnyfascismo&quot;/&gt;

One common definition of fascism focuses on three groups of ideas:

* The ''Fascist Negations'' of anti-liberalism, anti-communism and anti-conservatism.
* Nationalist, authoritarian goals for the creation of a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture.
* A political aesthetic using romantic symbolism, mass mobilisation, a positive view of violence, promotion of masculinity and youth and charismatic leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aristotle4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;practice&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Position in the political spectrum===
There is some dispute among scholars about where along the [[Left–right politics|left/right spectrum]] that fascism resides.&lt;ref name=&quot;junginger&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ah.brookes.ac.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sr3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;er71&quot;/&gt; Fascism is commonly described as &quot;[[Far right|extreme right]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; although some writers have found placing fascism on a conventional [[Left–right politics|left-right]] [[political spectrum]] difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;sociology&quot;/&gt; There is a scholarly consensus that fascism was influenced by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and supranational, rational and anti-rational.&lt;ref name=&quot;ah.brookes.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; A number of historians have regarded fascism either as a revolutionary centrist doctrine, as a doctrine which mixes philosophies of the left and the right, or as both of those things.&lt;ref name=sr3/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;er71&quot;/&gt; Fascism was founded during [[World War I]] by Italian [[National syndicalism|national syndicalists]] who combined [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] political views.

Fascism is considered by certain scholars to be right-wing because of its [[social conservatism]] and authoritarian means of opposing [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern Free Society and Its Nemesis: Liberty Versus Conservatism in the New Millennium&quot;/&gt; Roderick Stackleberg places fascism — including Nazism, which he says is &quot;a radical variant of fascism&quot; — on the right, explaining that &quot;the more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;google6&quot;/&gt;

Italian Fascism gravitated to the right in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZeevSternhell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts&quot;/&gt; A major element of fascism that has been deemed as clearly [[Far-right politics|far-right]] is its goal to promote the right of claimed superior people to dominate while purging society of claimed inferior elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver H. Woshinsky 2008. Pp. 156&quot;/&gt;

[[Benito Mussolini]] in 1919 described fascism as a movement that would strike &quot;against the backwardness of the right and the destructiveness of the left&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;varldenshistoria.se&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;littlefield&quot;/&gt; Later the Italian Fascists described fascism  as a right-wing ideology in the political program ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]'', stating: &quot;We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right,' a fascist century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeffrey Thompson Schnapp 2000, p. 57&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benito Mussolini 1935, p. 26&quot;/&gt; However Mussolini clarified that fascism's position on the political spectrum was not a serious issue to fascists and stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center ... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don't give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gentile, Emilio 2005. p. 205&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The accommodation of the political right into the Italian Fascist movement in the early 1920s led to the creation of internal factions. The &quot;Fascist left&quot; included [[Michele Bianchi]], [[Giuseppe Bottai]], [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]], [[Sergio Panunzio]] and [[Edmondo Rossoni]], who were committed to advancing [[national syndicalism]] as a replacement for parliamentary liberalism in order to modernize the economy and advance the interests of workers and the common people.&lt;ref name=&quot;sgp112&quot;/&gt; The &quot;Fascist right&quot; included members of the paramilitary ''Squadristi'' and former members of the [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI).&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt; The ''Squadristi'' wanted to establish Fascism as a complete dictatorship, while the former ANI members, including [[Alfredo Rocco]], sought an authoritarian corporatist state to replace the liberal state in Italy, while retaining the existing elites.&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt; There were also smaller factions within the Italian Fascist movement, such as the [[clerical fascism|clerical Fascists]], who sought to shift Italian Fascism from its anti-Catholic roots to accepting Catholicism. The Italian Fascist movement was initially openly [[Republicanism|republican]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Brien. Mussolini in the First World War: The Journalist, The Soldier, The Fascist. Pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; However upon accommodating the political right, there arose a group of monarchist Fascists who sought to use Fascism to create an [[absolute monarchy]] under King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]].&lt;ref name=sgp112/&gt;

After King Victor Emmanuel III forced Mussolini to resign as head of government and put him under arrest in 1943, Mussolini was rescued by German forces and now dependent on Germany for support, Mussolini and remaining loyal Fascists founded the [[Italian Social Republic]] with Mussolini as head of state. Mussolini sought to re-radicalize Italian Fascism, declaring that the Fascist state had been overthrown because Italian Fascism had been subverted by Italian conservatives and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Ball, Richard Bellamy. The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought. Pp. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the new Fascist government proposed the creation of workers' councils and profit-sharing in industry, however German authorities who effectively controlled northern Italy at this point, ignored these measures and did not seek to enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Ball, Richard Bellamy. The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought. Pp. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of fascist movements described themselves as a &quot;[[third position]]&quot; outside the traditional political spectrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;routeledge&quot;/&gt; Spanish Falangist leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera said: &quot;basically the Right stands for the maintenance of an economic structure, albeit an unjust one, while the Left stands for the attempt to subvert that economic structure, even though the subversion thereof would entail the destruction of much that was worthwhile&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nm54&quot;/&gt;

===''Fascist'' as insult===
{{Main|Fascist (insult)}}
Following the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] in [[World War II]], the term ''fascist'' has been used as a [[pejorative]] word,&lt;ref name=&quot;intellectuals&quot;/&gt; often referring to widely varying movements across the political spectrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;orwell&quot;/&gt; [[George Orwell]] wrote in 1944 that &quot;the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless ... almost any English person would accept 'bully' as a synonym for 'Fascist'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;orwell1944&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Richard Griffiths]] argued in 2005 that &quot;fascism&quot; is the &quot;most misused, and over-used word, of our times&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;intelligentguide&quot;/&gt; &quot;Fascist&quot; is sometimes applied to post-war organisations and ways of thinking that academics more commonly term &quot;[[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism in Europe&quot;/&gt;

Contrary to the common mainstream academic and popular use of the term, Communist states have sometimes been referred to as &quot;fascist&quot;, typically as an insult. Marxist interpretations of the term have, for example, been applied in relation to [[Cuba]] under [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Vietnam]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rg231&quot;/&gt; Herbert Matthews, of the ''[[New York Times]]'' asked &quot;Should we now place Stalinist Russia in the same category as Hitlerite Germany? Should we say that she is Fascist?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;matthews&quot;/&gt; [[J. Edgar Hoover]] wrote extensively of &quot;Red Fascism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestonedocuments&quot;/&gt; Chinese Marxists used the term to denounce the Soviet Union during the [[Sino-Soviet Split]], and likewise, the Soviets used the term to identify Chinese Marxists.&lt;ref name=&quot;quarantotto&quot;/&gt;

{{further2|[[Fascism and ideology]]}}

===''Fin de siècle'' era and the fusion of Maurrasism with Sorelianism (1880—1914)===

The ideological roots of fascism have been traced to the 1880s, and in particular the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' theme of that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;international&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge12&quot;/&gt; The theme was based on revolt against [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[positivism]], bourgeois society and [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170&quot;/&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' generation supported [[emotionalism]], [[irrationalism]], [[subjectivism]] and [[vitalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge13&quot;/&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' mindset saw civilization as being in a crisis that required a massive and total solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170&quot;/&gt; The ''fin-de-siècle'' intellectual school considered the individual as only one part of the larger collectivity, which should not be viewed as an atomized numerical sum of individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170&quot;/&gt; They condemned the rationalistic individualism of liberal society and the dissolution of social links in bourgeois society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternhell, Zeev 1998 p. 170&quot;/&gt;

The ''fin-de-siècle'' outlook was influenced by various intellectual developments, including [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] [[biology]]; [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] [[aesthetics]]; [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s [[Racism|racialism]]; [[Gustave Le Bon]]'s [[psychology]]; and the philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeev 1998 p. 171&quot;/&gt; [[Social Darwinism]], which gained widespread acceptance, made no distinction between physical and social life, and viewed the human condition as being an unceasing struggle to achieve the [[survival of the fittest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeev 1998 p. 171&quot;/&gt; Social Darwinism challenged positivism's claim of deliberate and rational choice as the determining behaviour of humans, with social Darwinism focusing on heredity, race, and environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeev 1998 p. 171&quot;/&gt; Social Darwinism's emphasis on biogroup identity and the role of organic relations within societies fostered legitimacy and appeal for nationalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge14&quot;/&gt; New theories of social and political psychology also rejected the notion of human behaviour being governed by rational choice, and instead claimed that emotion was more influential in political issues than reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeev 1998 p. 171&quot;/&gt; Nietzsche's argument that &quot;God is dead&quot; coincided with his attack on the &quot;herd mentality&quot; of [[Christianity]], democracy and modern collectivism; his concept of the ''[[übermensch]]''; and his advocacy of the [[will to power]] as a primordial instinct, were major influences upon many of the ''fin-de-siècle'' generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge15&quot;/&gt; Bergson's claim of the existence of an &quot;''élan vital''&quot; or vital instinct centred upon free choice and rejected the processes of materialism and determinism, this challenged Marxism.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge16&quot;/&gt;

[[Gaetano Mosca]] in in his work ''[[The Ruling Class (book, Mosca)|The Ruling Class]]'' (1896) developed the theory that claims that in all societies, an &quot;organized minority&quot; will dominate and rule over the &quot;disorganized majority&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;William Outhwaite 2006. Pp. 442&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tracy H. Koon 1943. Pp. 6&quot;/&gt; Mosca claims that there are only two classes in society, &quot;the governing&quot; (the organized minority) and &quot;the governed&quot; (the disorganized majority).&lt;ref name=&quot;Giuseppe Caforio 2006. Pp. 12&quot;/&gt; He claims that the organized nature of the organized minority makes it irresistible to any individual of the disorganized majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giuseppe Caforio 2006. Pp. 12&quot;/&gt;

[[Maurice Barrès]], who greatly influenced the policies of fascism, claimed that true democracy was [[authoritarian democracy]] while rejecting liberal democracy as a fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soucy&quot;/&gt; Barrès claimed that authoritarian democracy involved spiritual connection between a leader of a nation and the nation's people, and that true freedom did not arise from individual rights nor parliamentary restraints, but through &quot;heroic leadership&quot; and &quot;national power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soucy&quot;/&gt; He emphasized the need for [[Cult of personality|hero worship]] and charismatic leadership in national society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley G. Payne 1945. p. 46&quot;/&gt; Barrès mixed anti-Semitic nationalism with socialism and identified as a &quot;national socialist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 418-419&quot;/&gt;

The rise of support for [[anarchism]] in this period of time was important in influencing the politics of fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart Joseph Woolf 1970. Pp. 282&quot;/&gt; The anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s concept of [[propaganda of the deed]] that stressed the importance of [[direct action]] as the primary means of politics - including revolutionary violence, became popular amongst fascists who admired the concept and adopted it as a part of fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stuart Joseph Woolf 1970. Pp. 282&quot;/&gt;

The [[German National Association of Commercial Employees]] (DHV) was a nationalist and anti-Semitic [[labour union]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew Lange 2006. Pp. 224&quot;/&gt; It was [[Anti-democratic thought|anti-democratic]] and anti-liberal and supported the concept of a [[conservative revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;conservatism&quot;/&gt; It also espoused an anti-Semitic [[anti-capitalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew Lange 2006. Pp. 224&quot;/&gt; It is considered a [[Proto-fascism|proto-fascist]] or pre-fascist movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge17&quot;/&gt; It existed between 1893 to 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew Lange 2006. Pp. 224&quot;/&gt; By 1914 it had 160,000 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;connecticut&quot;/&gt;

{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=left|image2=Georges Sorel.jpg|image1=Maurras.png|width=150|caption2=Georges Sorel|caption1=Charles Maurras.}}

[[French nationalism|French nationalist]] and reactionary monarchist [[Charles Maurras]] influenced fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism18&quot;/&gt; Maurras promoted what he called [[integral nationalism]], that called for organic unity of a nation, Maurras insisted that a powerful monarch was an ideal leader of a nation. Maurras distrusted what he considered the democratic mystification of the popular will that created an impersonal collective subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism18&quot;/&gt; He claimed that a powerful monarch was a personified sovereign who could exercise authority to unite a nation's people.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism18&quot;/&gt; Maurras' integral nationalism was idealized by fascists, but modified into a modernized revolutionary form that was devoid of Maurras' monarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism18&quot;/&gt;

One of the key persons who greatly influenced fascism, the French revolutionary syndicalist [[Georges Sorel]] was greatly influenced by anarchism and contributed to the fusion of anarchism and syndicalism together into [[anarcho syndicalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mobilization&quot;/&gt; Sorel promoted the legitimacy of [[political violence]] in his work ''[[Reflections on Violence]]'' (1908) and other works in which he advocated radical syndicalist action to achieve a revolution to overthrow capitalism and the bourgeoisie through a [[general strike]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mobilization21&quot;/&gt; In ''Reflections on Violence'', Sorel emphasized need for a revolutionary [[political religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mobilization22&quot;/&gt; Also, in his work The Illusions of Progress, Sorel denounced democracy as reactionary, saying &quot;nothing is more aristocratic than democracy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobilization23&quot;/&gt; By 1909 after the failure of a syndicalist general strike in France, Sorel and his supporters left the radical left and went to the radical right, where they sought to merge militant Catholicism and French patriotism with their views - advocating anti-republican Christian French patriots as ideal revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobilization24&quot;/&gt; Initially Sorel had officially been a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] of Marxism, but by 1910 announced his abandonment of socialist literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of [[Benedetto Croce]] that &quot;socialism is dead&quot; because of the &quot;decomposition of Marxism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 78&quot;/&gt; Sorel became a supporter of reactionary Maurrassian nationalism beginning in 1909 that influenced his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternhell, Zeev 1994 p. 78&quot;/&gt; Maurras held interest in merging his nationalist ideals with [[Sorelianism|Sorelian]] [[syndicalism]] as a means to confront [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;revolution1994&quot;/&gt; Maurras famously stated &quot;a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiculturalism&quot;/&gt;

The fusion of Maurassian nationalism and Sorelian syndicalism influenced radical Italian nationalist [[Enrico Corradini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zs163&quot;/&gt; Corradini spoke of the need for a [[National syndicalism|nationalist-syndicalist]] movement, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action and a willingness to fight.&lt;ref name=zs163/&gt; Corradini spoke of Italy as being a &quot;proletarian nation&quot; that needed to pursue [[imperialism]] in order to challenge the &quot;[[Plutocracy|plutocratic]]&quot; French and British.&lt;ref name=&quot;mb9&quot;/&gt; Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI), which claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by corruption in its political class, [[liberalism]], and division caused by &quot;ignoble socialism&quot;.&lt;ref name=mb9/&gt; The ANI held ties and influence among [[Conservatism|conservatives]], Catholics, and the business community.&lt;ref name=mb9/&gt; Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of [[bourgeois]] values, [[democracy]], liberalism, [[Marxism]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], and [[pacifism]], and the promotion of [[heroism]], [[vitalism]], and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;revolution&quot;/&gt;  The ANI claimed that liberal democracy was no longer compatible with the modern world, and advocated a strong state and [[imperialism]], claiming that humans are naturally predatory and that nations were in a constant struggle, in which only the strongest could survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism25&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Manifesto of Futurism.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], Italian modernist author of the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' (1908) and later the co-author of the ''[[Fascist Manifesto]]'' (1919).]]
Futurism that was both an artistic-cultural movement and initially a political movement in Italy led by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] who founded the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'' (1908), that championed the causes of modernism, action, and political violence as necessary elements of politics while denouncing liberalism and parliamentary politics. Marinetti rejected conventional democracy for based on majority rule and egalitarianism while promoting a new form of democracy, that he described in his work &quot;The Futurist Conception of Democracy&quot; as the following: &quot;We are therefore able to give the directions to create and to dismantle to ''numbers'', ''to quantity'', ''to the mass'', for with us ''number'', ''quantity and mass'' will never be—as they are in Germany and Russia—the number, quantity and mass of mediocre men, incapable and indecisive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aesthetics&quot;/&gt;

Futurism influenced fascism in its emphasis on recognizing the virile nature of violent action and war as being necessities of modern civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gigliola Gori 2004.

===World War I and aftermath (1914—1929)===
[[File:Benito Mussolini 1917.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] in 1917, as a soldier in [[World War I]]. In 1914, Mussolini founded the ''[[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria]]'' that he led. Mussolini promoted the Italian intervention in the war as a revolutionary nationalist action to liberate Italian-claimed lands from Austria-Hungary.]]
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Italian political left became severely split over its position on the war. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) opposed the war on the grounds of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], but a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported intervention against Germany and Austria-Hungary on the grounds that their [[reactionary]] regimes needed to be defeated to ensure the success of socialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;zs175&quot;/&gt; Corradini presented the same need for Italy as a &quot;proletarian nation&quot; to defeat a reactionary Germany from a nationalist perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;revolution26&quot;/&gt; The origins of Italian Fascism resulted from this split, first with [[Angelo Oliviero Olivetti]] forming an pro-interventionist [[fasci]] called the [[Fasci d'Azione Internazionalista|Fasci of International Action]] in October 1914.&lt;ref name=zs175/&gt; Benito Mussolini upon being expelled from his position as chief editor of the PSI's newspaper Avanti! for his pro-Entente stance, joined the interventionist cause in a separate fasci.&lt;ref name=&quot;revolution27&quot;/&gt; The term &quot;Fascism&quot; was first used in 1915 by members of Mussolini's movement, the [[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria|Fasci of Revolutionary Action]].&lt;ref name=&quot;journalist&quot;/&gt;

Mussolini accused conventional socialists for being [[Dogmatism|dogmatic]] and in December 1914 criticized the PSI for their association with Marxism that Mussolini declared had become obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul O Pp. 44&quot;&gt;Paul O'Brien. Mussolini in the First World War: The Journalist, The Soldier, The Fascist. Pp. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini made a list of socialist figures ranging from the top of admirable socialist figures at the top like Mazzini, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], Mikhail Bakunin, [[Charles Fourier]], and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]]; while placing unadmirable socialists at the bottom, including [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul O Pp. 44&quot;/&gt; The first meeting of the Fasci of Revolutionary Action was held on 24 January 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul O Pp. 41&quot;&gt;Paul O'Brien. Mussolini in the First World War: The Journalist, The Soldier, The Fascist. Pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting Mussolini declared that it was necessary for Europe to resolve its national problems - including national borders - of Italy and elsewhere &quot;for the ideals of justice and liberty for which oppressed peoples must acquire the right to belong to those national communities from which they descended&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul O Pp. 41&quot;/&gt; Amidst discussion on the question of [[irredentism]], Mussolini noted from the proceedings of the members that &quot;the difficult question of irredentism was posed and resolved in the ambit of ideals of socialism and liberty which do not however exclude the safeguarding of a positive national interest&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul O Pp. 41&quot;/&gt; Its attempts to hold mass meetings were ineffective and it was regularly harassed by government authorities and socialists.&lt;ref name=&quot;intellectual&quot;/&gt; Antagonism between interventionists, including Fascists, and anti-interventionist socialists resulted in violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajg196&quot;/&gt;

Similar political ideas arose in Germany after the outbreak of the war. German sociologist [[Johann Plenge]] spoke of the rise of a &quot;National Socialism&quot; in Germany within what he termed the &quot;ideas of 1914&quot; that were a declaration of war against the &quot;ideas of 1789&quot; (the [[French Revolution]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205&quot;/&gt; According to Plenge, the &quot;ideas of 1789&quot; that included rights of man, democracy, individualism and liberalism were being rejected in favour of &quot;the ideas of 1914&quot; that included &quot;German values&quot; of duty, discipline, law, and order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205&quot;/&gt; Plenge believed that ethnic solidarity (''[[volksgemeinschaft]]'') would replace class division and that &quot;racial comrades&quot; would unite to create a socialist society in the struggle of &quot;proletarian&quot; Germany against &quot;capitalist&quot; Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205&quot;/&gt; He believed that the &quot;[[Spirit of 1914]]&quot; manifested itself in the concept of the &quot;People's League of National Socialism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92&quot;/&gt; This National Socialism was a form of state socialism that rejected the &quot;idea of boundless freedom&quot; and promoted an economy that would serve the whole of Germany under the leadership of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92&quot;/&gt; This National Socialism was opposed to capitalism because of the components that were against &quot;the national interest&quot; of Germany, but insisted that National Socialism would strive for greater efficiency in the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92&quot;/&gt; Plenge advocated an authoritarian rational ruling elite to develop National Socialism through a hierarchical [[Technocracy|technocratic]] state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Rohkrämer 2007. p. 130&quot;/&gt;

The ''Arditi'' were founded in 1917 as groups of soldiers trained for: dangerous missions, refusal to surrender, and to be willing to fight to the death. The ''Arditi'''s black uniform and use of the fez, were adopted by the Italian Fascist movement in homage to the ''Arditi''.]]
A major event that greatly influenced the development of fascism was the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 in which [[Bolshevik]] communists led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] seized power in Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96&quot;/&gt; In 1917, Mussolini as leader of the [[Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria|Fasci of Revolutionary Action]] praised the [[October Revolution]], however Mussolini later became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him as merely a new version of Tsar Nicholas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Neville 2004. Pp. 36&quot;/&gt; After World War I fascists have commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96&quot;/&gt; However both Bolshevism and fascism hold ideological similarities: both advocate a revolutionary ideology, both believe in the necessity of a vanguard elite, both have disdain for bourgeois values, and both had totalitarian ambitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96&quot;/&gt; In practice, fascism and Bolshevism have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, single-party states, and party-armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 95-96&quot;/&gt;

With the antagonism between anti-interventionist Marxists and pro-interventionist Fascists complete by the end of the war, the two sides became irreconcilable. The Fascists presented themselves as [[Anti-communism|anti-Marxists]] and as opposed to the Marxists.&lt;ref name=&quot;revolution28&quot;/&gt; Benito Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement in 1919 with the founding of the ''[[Fasci italiani di combattimento]]'', whose opposition to socialism he declared:

{{quote|We declare war against socialism, not because it is socialism, but because it has opposed nationalism. Although we can discuss the question of what socialism is, what is its program, and what are its tactics, one thing is obvious: the official Italian Socialist Party has been reactionary and absolutely conservative. If its views had prevailed, our survival in the world of today would be impossible.&lt;ref name=&quot;littlefield29&quot;/&gt;}}

In 1919, [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] created ''[[Fascist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Italian Fasci of Combat]]'' (a.k.a. the ''Fascist Manifesto'').&lt;ref name=&quot;connecticut30&quot;/&gt; The Manifesto was presented on June 6, 1919 in the Fascist newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia''. The Manifesto supported the creation of [[universal suffrage]] for both men [[women's suffrage|and women]] (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded&lt;ref name=&quot;passmore&quot;/&gt;); [[proportional representation]] on a regional basis; government representation through a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] system of &quot;National Councils&quot; of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, communications, etc.; and the abolition of the [[Italian Senate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts31&quot;/&gt; The Manifesto supported the creation of an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for all workers, a [[minimum wage]], worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong [[progressive tax]] on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of their{{Who|date=January 2011}} profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts32&quot;/&gt; It also called for the creation of a short-service national militia to serve defensive duties, [[nationalization]] of the armaments industry, and a foreign policy designed to be peaceful but also competitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts33&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb||300px|left|Residents of [[Rijeka|Fiume]] cheer the arrival of [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and his blackshirt-wearing nationalist raiders. D'Annunzio and Fascist [[Alceste De Ambris]] developed the quasi-fascist [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]], a city-state in Fiume, from 1919 to 1920. D'Annunzio's actions in Fiume inspired the Italian Fascist movement.]]
The next events that influenced the Fascists in Italy was the raid of [[Fiume (city)|Fiume]] by Italian nationalist [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and the founding of the [[Charter of Carnaro]] in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;revolution34&quot;/&gt; D'Annunzio and De Ambris designed the Charter, which advocated national-syndicalist [[Corporatism|corporatist]] [[productionism]] alongside D'Annunzio's political views.&lt;ref name=&quot;revolution35&quot;/&gt; Many Fascists saw the Charter of Carnaro as an ideal constitution for a Fascist Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;zs189&quot;/&gt; This behaviour of aggression towards Yugoslavia and [[South Slavs]] was pursued by Italian Fascists with their persecution of South Slavs - especially Slovenes and Croats.

With the  1920, militant strike activity by industrial workers reached its peak in Italy, where 1919 and 1920 were known as the &quot;Red Years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts36&quot;/&gt; Mussolini and the Fascists took advantage of the situation by allying with industrial businesses and attacking workers and peasants in the name of preserving order and internal peace in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts37&quot;/&gt;

Fascists identified their primary opponents as the majority of socialists on the left who had opposed intervention in World War I.&lt;ref name=zs189/&gt; The Fascists and the Italian political right held common ground: both held Marxism in contempt, discounted class consciousness and believed in the rule of elites.&lt;ref name=&quot;zs193&quot;/&gt; The Fascists assisted the anti-socialist campaign by allying with the other parties and the conservative right in a mutual effort to destroy the Italian Socialist Party and labour organizations committed to class identity above national identity.&lt;ref name=zs193/&gt;

Fascism sought to accommodate Italian [[Conservatism|conservatives]] by making major alterations to its political agenda;– abandoning its previous [[populism]], [[republicanism]], and [[anticlericalism]], adopting policies in support of [[free enterprise]], and accepting the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the monarchy as institutions in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ga145&quot;/&gt; To appeal to Italian conservatives, Fascism adopted policies such as promoting family values, including promotion policies designed to reduce the number of women in the workforce limiting the woman's role to that of a mother. The fascists banned literature on birth control and increased penalties for abortion in 1926, declaring both crimes against the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservatives&quot;/&gt; Though Fascism adopted a number of positions designed to appeal to [[Reactionary|reactionaries]], the Fascists sought to maintain Fascism's revolutionary character, with Angelo Oliviero Olivetti saying &quot;Fascism would like to be conservative, but it will [be] by being revolutionary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revolution38&quot;/&gt; The Fascists supported revolutionary action and committed to secure law and order to appeal to both conservatives and syndicalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservatives39&quot;/&gt;

Prior to Fascism's accommodation of the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members.&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts40&quot;/&gt; After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;massachusetts41&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and homes of socialist leadership figures to one of violent occupation of cities. The Fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;rop87&quot;/&gt; The Fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; After seizing these cities, the Fascists made plans to take [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt;

[[File:March on Rome.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Benito Mussolini]] (centre in suit with arms akimbo) along with other Fascist leader figures and [[Blackshirts]] during the March on Rome.]]
On 24 October 1922, the Fascist party held its annual congress in [[Naples]], where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt; The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances.&lt;ref name=&quot;rop88&quot;/&gt; King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high.&lt;ref name=&quot;rop90&quot;/&gt; Victor Emmanuel III decided to appoint Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of Italy]], and Mussolini arrived in Rome on 30 October to accept the appointment.&lt;ref name=rop90/&gt; Fascist propaganda aggrandized this event, known as &quot;[[March on Rome]]&quot;, as a &quot;seizure&quot; of power because of Fascists' heroic exploits.&lt;ref name=rop87/&gt;

Upon being appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form a coalition government, because the Fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;sgp110&quot;/&gt; Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] policies under the direction of liberal finance minister [[Alberto De Stefani]], including balancing the budget through deep cuts to the civil service.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt; Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited.&lt;ref name=sgp110/&gt;

The Fascists began their attempt to entrench Fascism in Italy with the [[Acerbo Law]], which guaranteed a plurality of the seats in parliament to any party or coalition list in an election that received 25% or more of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;sgp113&quot;/&gt; Through considerable Fascist violence and intimidation, the list won a majority of the vote, allowing many seats to go to the Fascists.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; In the aftermath of the election, a crisis and political scandal erupted after Socialist Party deputy [[Giacomo Matteoti]] was kidnapped and murdered by a Fascist.&lt;ref name=sgp113/&gt; The liberals and the leftist minority in parliament walked out in protest in what became known as the [[Aventine Secession (20th century)|Aventine Secession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sgp114&quot;/&gt; On 3 January 1925, Mussolini addressed the Fascist-dominated Italian parliament and declared that he was personally responsible for what happened, but he insisted that he had done nothing wrong. He proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament.&lt;ref name=sgp114/&gt; From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced, and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge42&quot;/&gt;

In 1929, the Fascist regime gained the political support and blessing of the Roman Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the [[Lateran Treaty]], which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge43&quot;/&gt;

The Fascist regime created a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economic system in 1925 with creation of the [[Palazzo Vidioni Pact]], in which the Italian employers' association [[Confindustria]] and Fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-Fascist trade unions.&lt;ref name=&quot;cb150&quot;/&gt; The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs, and in 1927 created the [[Labour Charter of 1927|Charter of Labour]], which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes.&lt;ref name=cb150/&gt; In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime, and employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves but instead by appointed Fascist party members.&lt;ref name=cb150/&gt;

In the 1920s, Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive foreign policy that included an attack on the Greek island of [[Corfu]], aims to expand Italian territory in the [[Balkans]], plans to wage war against [[Turkey]] and [[Yugoslavia]], attempts to bring Yugoslavia into civil war by supporting Croat and Macedonian separatists to legitimize Italian intervention, and making [[Albania]] a ''[[de facto]]'' [[protectorate]] of Italy, which was achieved through diplomatic means by 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;expansionism&quot;/&gt; In response to revolt in the Italian colony of [[Libya]], Fascist Italy abandoned previous liberal-era colonial policy of cooperation with local leaders. Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the &quot;inferior&quot; Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa134&quot;/&gt; This resulted in an aggressive military campaign against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of [[concentration camp]]s, and the forced starvation of thousands of people.&lt;ref name=aaa134/&gt; Italian authorities committed [[ethnic cleansing]] by forcibly expelling 100,000 [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mussolini&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;university44&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, München, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Nazis in [[Munich]] during the Beer Hall Putsch.]]
The March on Rome brought Fascism international attention. One early admirer of the Italian Fascists was [[Adolf Hitler]], who, less than a month after the March, had begun to model himself and the [[Nazi Party]] upon Mussolini and the Fascists.&lt;ref name=&quot;kershaw&quot;/&gt; The Nazis, led by Hitler and the German war hero [[Erich Ludendorff]], attempted a &quot;March on Berlin&quot; modeled upon the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]] in November 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;dissolution&quot;/&gt;

===International surge of fascism and World War II (1929—1945)===
[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|right|Benito Mussolini (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] (right).]]

The events of the [[Great Depression]] resulted in an international surge of fascism and the creation of several fascist regimes and regimes that adopted fascist policies.  The most important new fascist regime was [[Nazi Germany]], under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, [[liberal democracy]] was dissolved in Germany, and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised, and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups. 

Fascist movements grew in strength elsewhere in Europe. Hungarian fascist [[Gyula Gömbös]] rose to power as Prime Minister of Hungary in 1932 and attempted to entrench his [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] throughout the country; created an eight-hour work day, a forty-eight hour work week in industry, and sought to entrench a corporatist economy; and pursued irredentist claims on Hungary's neighbors.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge45&quot;/&gt; The fascist [[Iron Guard]] movement in [[Romania]] soared in political support after 1933, gaining representation in the Romanian government, and an Iron Guard member assassinated Romanian prime minister [[Ion Duca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge46&quot;/&gt; During the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], [[France]] faced the greatest domestic political turmoil since the [[Dreyfus Affair]] when the fascist [[Mouvement Franciste|Francist Movement]] and multiple far right movements rioted ''[[en masse]]'' in Paris against the French government resulting in major political violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;fascism&quot;/&gt; A variety of para-fascist governments that borrowed elements from fascism were formed during the Great Depression, including those of [[Greece]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], and [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge47&quot;/&gt;

In the Americas, the [[Brazilian Integralism|Brazilian Integralists]] led by [[Plínio Salgado]], claimed as many as 200,000 members although following coup attempts it faced a crackdown from the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] of [[Getúlio Vargas]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;griffin&quot;/&gt; In the 1930s, the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] gained seats in Chile's parliament and attempted a coup d'état that resulted in the [[Seguro Obrero massacre]] of 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge48&quot;/&gt;

During the Great Depression, Mussolini promoted active state intervention in the economy. He denounced the contemporary &quot;[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]&quot; that he claimed began in 1914 as a failure because of its alleged [[decadence]], support for unlimited [[consumerism]] and intention to create the &quot;standardization of humankind&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gb2000&quot;/&gt; Fascist Italy created the [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|Institute for Industrial Reconstruction]] (IRI), a giant state-owned firm and holding company that provided state funding to failing private enterprises.&lt;ref name=&quot;cb189&quot;/&gt; The IRI was made a permanent institution in Fascist Italy in 1937, pursued Fascist policies to create national [[autarky]], and had the power to take over private firms to maximize war production.&lt;ref name=cb189/&gt; In the late 1930s, Italy enacted manufacturing cartels, tariff barriers, currency restrictions, and massive regulation of the economy to attempt to balance payments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 72&quot;/&gt; However, Italy's policy of autarky failed to achieve effective economic autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyprian Blamires 2006. p. 72&quot;/&gt; Nazi Germany similarly pursued an economic agenda with the aims of autarky and rearmament and imposed [[Protectionism|protectionist]] policies, including forcing the German steel industry to use lower-quality German iron ore rather than superior-quality imported iron.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia49&quot;/&gt; 

In Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany both pursued territorial expansionist and interventionist foreign policy agendas from the 1930s through the 1940s culminating in [[World War II]]. Mussolini called for irredentist Italian claims to be reclaimed, establishing Italian domination of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and securing Italian access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and the creation of Italian ''spazio vitale'' (&quot;vital space&quot;) in the Mediterranean and [[Red Sea]] regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;expansionism50&quot;/&gt; Hitler called for irredentist German claims to be reclaimed along with the creation of German ''[[lebensraum]]'' (&quot;living space&quot;) in Eastern Europe, including territories held by the [[Soviet Union]], that would be colonized by Germans.&lt;ref name=&quot;expansionism51&quot;/&gt;

From 1935 to 1939 Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy invaded [[Ethiopia]] in 1935 resulting in condemnation by the League of Nations and widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936 Germany [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the industrial Rhineland]]; the region had been ordered demilitarized by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1938 Germany annexed Austria and Italy assisted in Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on Czecholslovakia by arranging the [[Munich Agreement]] that gave Germany the Sudetenland and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war, these hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;university52&quot;/&gt; In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eugene Davidson Pp. 371-372&quot;/&gt; The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eugene Davidson Pp. 371-372&quot;/&gt;

The invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of [[World War II]]. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into [[World War II]] on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with [[France]] or the [[United Kingdom]] and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940, on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;university53&quot;/&gt; Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in Egypt where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;university54&quot;/&gt; Plans by Germany to invade the UK in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the [[Battle of Britain]]. The war became prolonged contrary to Mussolini's plans resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. In 1941 the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe.

During World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe, led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]]. In Asia, Japan committed large massacres of Chinese civilians.

After 1942, Axis forces began to falter. By 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, and Allied invasion of Italy, and corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested by the order of King Victor Emmanuel III who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945. 

On 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was dismantled and key Nazi members arrested to stand trial for [[crimes against humanity]] involving the Holocaust.

[[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Greece]] and [[Ethiopia]] requested [[extradition]] of 1,200 Italian war criminals who however never saw anything like Nuremberg trial, because the British government with the beginning of [[cold war]] saw in [[Pietro Badoglio]] a guarantee of an [[anti-communist]] post-war [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pedaliu&quot;/&gt; The repression of memory led to historical revisionism&lt;ref name=&quot;revisionism&quot;/&gt; in Italy and in 2003 the Italian media published [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s statement that the [[Benito Mussolini]] only &quot;used to send people on vacation&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IHT&quot;/&gt; denying the existence of [[Italian concentration camps]],&lt;ref name=&quot;webcitation&quot;/&gt; such as [[Rab concentration camp]].

===Post-World-War II (1945—present)===
[[File:Franco0001.PNG|thumb|left|175px|[[Francisco Franco]], the quasi-fascist ''[[Caudillo]]'' of [[Spain]] from 1939 to 1975.]]
[[Image:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Juan Perón]], [[President of Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974. Perón admired Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on those pursued by Fascist Italy.]] 

In the aftermath of [[World War II]], the victory of the Allies over the Axis powers led to the collapse of multiple fascist regimes in Europe. The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted multiple Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust.

However there remained multiple ideologies and governments that were ideologically related to fascism. 

[[Francisco Franco]]'s quasi-fascist [[Falangism|Falangist]] single-party state in Spain was officially neutral in World War II and survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the Spanish Civil War, and had sent volunteers to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with Western powers in the [[Cold War]], until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.
 
[[Peronism]] associated with the regime of [[Juan Peron]] in [[Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was strongly influenced by fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512&quot;/&gt; Prior to rising to power, from 1939 to 1941, Peron had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist economic policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 512&quot;/&gt;

Both of Ba'athism's key ideologists Aflaq and [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]] were directly inspired by fascism and Nazism.]]

Another ideology strongly influenced by fascism is [[Ba'athism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84&quot;/&gt; Ba'athism is a revolutionary [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] ideology that seeks the unification of all claimed Arab lands into a single Arab state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84&quot;/&gt; [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], one of the principal founders of Ba'athism was strongly influenced by and supportive of fascism and Nazism.&lt;ref name=&quot;transaction&quot;/&gt; Several close associates of Ba'athism's key ideologist [[Michel Aflaq]] have admitted that Aflaq had been directly inspired by certain fascist and Nazi theorists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84&quot;/&gt; Ba'athist regimes in power in Iraq and Syria have held strong similarities to fascism, they are radical authoritarian nationalist single-party states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84&quot;/&gt; Because of Ba'athism's anti-Western stances it preferred the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]] and admired and adopted certain Soviet organizational structures for their governments, however the Iraqi Ba'athist regimes persecuted communists while the Syrian Ba'athist regime collaborated with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84&quot;/&gt; Like fascist regimes, Ba'athism became heavily militarized in power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84&quot;/&gt; Ba'athist movements governed Iraq in 1963 and again from 1968 to 2003 and in Syria from 1963 to present. Ba'athist heads of state such as [[President of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Hafez al-Assad]] and [[President of Iraq|Iraqi President]] [[Saddam Hussein]] created [[personality cult]]s around themselves portraying themselves as the nationalist saviours of the Arab world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blamires, Cyprian 2006 p. 82-84&quot;/&gt; 

[[Ba'athist Iraq]] under Saddam Hussein pursued [[ethnic cleansing]] or liquidation of minorities, pursued expansionist wars against Iran and Kuwait, and gradually replaced pan-Arabism with an [[Iraqi nationalism]] that emphasized Iraq's connection to the glories of ancient Mesopotamian empires, including [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 517&quot;/&gt; Historian of fascism [[Stanley Payne]] has said about Saddam Hussein's regime: &quot;There will probably never again be a reproduction of the Third Reich, but Saddam Hussein has come closer than any other dictator since 1945&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 517&quot;/&gt;

==Tenets==

===Nationalism===
Nationalism is the main foundation of fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyprian Blamires 2006. Pp. 451-453&quot;&gt;Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. Pp. 451-453.&lt;/ref&gt; The fascist view of a nation is of a single organic entity which binds people together by their ancestry and is a natural unifying force of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism56&quot;/&gt; Fascism seeks to solve economic, political, and social problems by achieving a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] national rebirth, exalting the [[nation]] or [[race (biology)|race]] above all else, and promoting cults of unity, strength and purity.&lt;ref name=&quot;anatomnyfascismo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Passmore&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;natureoffascismo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;walterlaq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannicafasc&quot;/&gt; European fascist movements all typically espouse a [[racism|racist]] conception of non-Europeans being inferior to Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 11&quot;&gt;Stanley G. Payne. ''A history of fascism, 1914-1945''. Digital printing edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1995, 2005. Pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However beyond this, fascists in Europe have not held a unified set of racial views.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 11&quot;/&gt; 

Historically most fascists promoted [[imperialism]], however there were several fascist movements that were disinterested in the pursuit of new imperial ambitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley G. Payne 1995, Pp. 11&quot;/&gt;

===Totalitarianism===
Fascism promotes the establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin. ''Fascism, Totalitarianism, and Political Religion''. Routledge. Pp. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' states, &quot;The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;institutions&quot;/&gt; Some have argued that, in spite of Italian Fascism's attempt at totalitarianism, it became an authoritarian cult of personality around Mussolini.&lt;ref name=&quot;google63&quot;/&gt; In ''The Legal Basis of the Total State'', Nazi political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]] described the Nazi intention to form a &quot;strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity&quot; in order to avoid a &quot;disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmitt&quot;/&gt;

Fascist states pursued policies of social [[indoctrination]] through [[propaganda]] in education and the media and regulation of the production of educational and media materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;totalitarianism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google68&quot;/&gt; Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauley&quot;/&gt;

===Third Position===
Fascism promotes such economics as a &quot;[[Third Position|third position]]&quot; alternative to [[capitalism]] and [[Marxism]], as fascism declares both as being obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank Joseph 2010. Pp. 50&quot;/&gt; Such an economic system, is variously termed by fascists as &quot;national corporatism&quot;, &quot;national socialism&quot; or &quot;national syndicalism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;deff&quot;/&gt;

Benito Mussolini spoke of this as a &quot;Third Alternative&quot; in 1940 upon Italy's entry into World War II, saying:

{{quote|''This conflict must not be allowed to cancel out all our achievements of the past eighteen years, nor, more importantly, extinguish the hope of a Third Alternative held out by Fascism to mankind fettered between the pillar of capitalist slavery and the post of Marxist chaos.''|Benito Mussolini, 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank Joseph 2010. Pp. 50&quot;/&gt;}}  

Fascism officially advocates resolution to domestic [[class conflict]] within a nation to secure national solidarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffin, Roger 1991 pp. 222&quot;/&gt; However fascism publicly favours [[Proletariat|proletarian]] culture due to its association with [[Production (economics)|economic production]] and claims that proletarians as producers must have a dominant role in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Corner. The Fascist Party and Popular Opinion in Mussolini's Italy. Oxford, England, UK: Oxford University Press, 2012. Pp. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; It deplores [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] culture for having an [[Fitness (biology)|unfit]] [[sedentary lifestyle]] and for its [[individualism]] that fascism views as inconsistent with virile nationhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert O. Paxton 2005. Pp. 10&quot;&gt;Robert O. Paxton. ''The Anatomy of Fascism''. Vintage Books edition. Vintage Books, 2005. Pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Sternhell. ''Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France''. Princeton University Press edition. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 1996. Pp. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism claims that cultural nationalization of society emancipates the nation's proletariat, and promotes the assimilation of all classes into proletarian national culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffin, Roger 1991 pp. 222&quot;/&gt; While fascism opposes domestic class conflict, fascism believes that bourgeois-proletarian conflict primarily exists in national conflict between [[proletarian nation]]s versus [[bourgeois nation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;minneapolis&quot;/&gt; 

Fascism denounces capitalism not because of its competitive nature nor its support of private property that fascism supports; but due to its [[materialism]], individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence, and alleged indifference to the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert O. Paxton 2005. Pp. 10&quot;/&gt; Fascism denounces Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity that fascism regards as an attack upon the emotional and spiritual bonds of nationality and thwarting the achievement of genuine national solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;John Breuilly. Nationalism and the State. University of Chicago Press edition. University of Chicago, 1994. Pp. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benito Mussolini promised a &quot;social revolution&quot; that would &quot;remake&quot; the [[Italian people]]. According to Patricia Knight, this was only achieved in part.&lt;ref name=&quot;kp72&quot;/&gt; The people who primarily benefited from Italian fascist social policies were members of the [[middle class|middle]] and [[lower-middle class]]es, who filled jobs in the vastly expanded government workforce, which grew from about 500,000 to 1,000,000 jobs in 1930 alone.&lt;ref name=kp72/&gt; Health and welfare spending grew dramatically under Italian fascism, with welfare rising from 7% of the budget in 1930 to 20% in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;experience&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro]]'' (OND) or &quot;National After-work Program&quot; was one major social welfare initiative in Fascist Italy. Created in 1925, it was the state's largest recreational organisation for adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauley3&quot;/&gt; The ''Dopolavoro'' was responsible for establishing and maintaining 11,000 sports grounds, over 6,400 libraries, 800 movie houses, 1,200 theatres, and over 2,000 orchestras.&lt;ref name=pauley3/&gt; Membership of the ''Dopolavoro'' was voluntary, but it had high participation because of its nonpolitical nature.&lt;ref name=pauley3/&gt; It is estimated that, by 1936, the OND had organised 80% of salaried workers&lt;ref name=&quot;organizations&quot;/&gt; and, by 1939, 40% of the industrial workforce. The sports activities proved popular with large numbers of workers. The OND had the largest membership of any of the mass Fascist organisations in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;aristotle99&quot;/&gt;

The enormous success of the ''Dopolavoro'' in Fascist Italy was the key factor in Nazi Germany's creation of its own version of the ''Dopolavoro'', the ''[[Kraft durch Freude]]'' (KdF) or &quot;Strength through Joy&quot; program of the Nazi government's [[German Labour Front]], which became even more successful than the ''Dopolavoro''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauley100&quot;/&gt; KdF provided government-subsidized holidays for German workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;community&quot;/&gt; KdF was also responsible for the creation of the original [[Volkswagen]] (&quot;People's Car&quot;), a state-manufactured automobile that was meant to be cheap enough to allow all German citizens to be able to own one.

While fascists promoted social welfare to ameliorate economic conditions affecting their nation or race as whole, they did not support social welfare for [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] reasons. Fascists criticised egalitarianism as preserving the weak. They instead promoted [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] views.&lt;ref name=&quot;egalitarianism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;university101&quot;/&gt;
Adolf Hitler was opposed to egalitarian and universal social welfare because, in his view, it encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and feeble.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitler&quot;/&gt; While in power, the Nazis created social welfare programs to deal with the large numbers of unemployed. However, those programs were neither egalitarian nor universal, excluding many minority groups and other people whom they felt posed a threat to the future health of the German people.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans102&quot;/&gt;

===Action===
Fascism emphasizes [[direct action]], including supporting the legitimacy of [[political violence]], as a core part of its politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley G. Payne 1945. Pp. 106&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Breuilly. Nationalism and the State. Pp. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism views violent action as a necessity in politics that fascism identifies as being an &quot;endless struggle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Political Theory 2010. Pp. 106&quot;&gt;Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology. Routledge. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2010. Pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of fascism's support of violent action in politics is connected to [[social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Political Theory 2010. Pp. 106&quot;/&gt; Fascist movements have commonly held [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] views of nations, races, and societies.&lt;ref name=psg485/&gt; They argue that nations and races must purge themselves of socially and biologically weak or [[Degeneration|degenerate]] people, while simultaneously promoting the creation of strong people, in order to survive in a world defined by perpetual national and racial conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;university64&quot;/&gt;

===Youth and natality===
Fascism emphasizes [[youth]] both in a physical sense of age and in a spiritual sense as related to virility and commitment to action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Antliff 2007. Pp. 171&quot;&gt;Mark Antliff. ''Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909–1939''. Duke University Press, 2007. Pp. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called ''[[Giovenezza]]'' (&quot;The Youth&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Antliff 2007. Pp. 171&quot;/&gt; Fascism identifies the physical age period of youth as a critical time for the moral development of people that will affect society.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. Pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Italian Fascism pursued what it called &quot;moral hygiene&quot; of youth, particularly regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47&quot;&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. Pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy promoted what it considered normal sexual behaviour in youth while denouncing what it considered deviant sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47&quot;/&gt; It condemned [[pornography]], most forms of [[birth control]] and contraceptive devices (with the exception of the [[condom]]), [[homosexuality]], and [[prostitution]] as deviant sexual behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995. Pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy regarded the promotion of male sexual excitation before [[puberty]] as the cause of criminality amongst male youth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47&quot;/&gt; Fascist Italy declared homosexuality to be a social disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47&quot;/&gt; Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive campaign to reduce prostitution of young women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47&quot;/&gt;

Mussolini perceived women's primary role to be childbearers, while men were warriors, once saying, &quot;war is to man what maternity is to the woman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychoanalysis&quot;/&gt; In an effort to increase birthrates, the Italian Fascist government gave financial incentives to women who raised large families, and initiated policies designed to reduce the number of women employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;mussolini73&quot;/&gt; Italian Fascism called for women to be honoured as &quot;reproducers of the nation&quot;, and the Italian Fascist government held ritual ceremonies to honour women's role within the Italian nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;university74&quot;/&gt; In 1934, Mussolini declared that employment of women was a &quot;major aspect of the thorny problem of unemployment&quot; and that for women, working was &quot;incompatible with childbearing&quot;. Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the &quot;exodus of women from the work force&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge75&quot;/&gt;

The German Nazi government strongly encouraged women to stay at home to bear children and keep house.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans76&quot;/&gt; This policy was reinforced by bestowing the Cross of Honor of the German Mother on women bearing four or more babies. The unemployment rate was cut substantially, mostly through arms production and sending women home so that men could take their jobs. Nazi propaganda sometimes promoted premarital and extramarital sexual relations, unwed motherhood and divorce, but at other times the Nazis opposed such behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;msu&quot;/&gt; The growth of Nazi power, however, was accompanied by a breakdown of traditional sexual morals with regard to extramarital sex and licentiousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;university77&quot;/&gt;

The Nazis decriminalized abortion in cases where fetuses had hereditary defects or were of a race the government disapproved of, while the abortion of healthy &quot;pure&quot; German, &quot;[[Aryan race|Aryan]]&quot; fetuses remained strictly forbidden.&lt;ref name=&quot;friedlander&quot;/&gt; For non-Aryans, abortion was often compulsory. Their [[eugenics]] program also stemmed from the &quot;progressive biomedical model&quot; of [[Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;publishing&quot;/&gt; In 1935 Nazi Germany expanded the legality of [[history of abortion|abortion]] by amending [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring|its eugenics law]], to promote abortion for women with hereditary disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;The origins of Nazi genocide: from euthanasia to the final solution&quot;/&gt; The law allowed abortion if a woman gave her permission and the fetus was not yet viable,&lt;ref name=&quot;Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gender and Crime in Modern Europe&quot;/&gt; and for purposes of so-called [[racial hygiene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis71&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Women's studies encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

The Nazis argued that homosexuality was degenerate, effeminate, perverted, and undermined masculinity because it did not produce children.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans78&quot;/&gt; They considered homosexuality curable through therapy, citing modern [[scientism]] and the study of [[sexology]], which said that homosexuality could be felt by &quot;normal&quot; people and not just an abnormal minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;fascism79&quot;/&gt; Open homosexuals were among those interned in Nazi concentration camps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich&quot;/&gt;

===Palingenesis and modernism===
Fascism emphasizes both [[palingenesis]] and [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2006 Pp. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fascism's nationalism has been identified as having a palingenetic character.&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1''.

{{Further|Economics of fascism}}

According to Bruce Pauley, Fascist governments exercised control over private property but did not nationalize it.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauley83&quot;/&gt; However, according to Patricia Knight, they did, with the Italian Fascist government coming to own the highest percentage of industries outside the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;mussolini84&quot;/&gt; The Nazis also nationalized some business.&lt;ref name=&quot;guillebaud&quot;/&gt; In fact, the &quot;Twenty-Five Point Programme&quot; of the Nazi party, adopted in 1920, demanded &quot;the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;heinemann&quot;/&gt; Other scholars noted that big business developed an increasingly close partnership with the Nazi and Fascist governments as it became increasingly organized. Business leaders supported the government's political and military goals, and in exchange, the government pursued economic policies that maximized the profits of its business allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloomington&quot;/&gt; Nazi Germany transferred public ownership and public services into the private sector, while other Western capitalist countries strove for increased state ownership of industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;www&quot;/&gt; In his book, ''Big Business in the Third Reich'', Arthur Schweitzer notes that, &quot;Monopolistic price fixing became the rule in most industries, and cartels were no longer confined to the heavy or large-scale industries. [...] Cartels and quasi-cartels (whether of big business or small) set prices, engaged in limiting production, and agreed to divide markets and classify consumers in order to realize a monopoly profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloomington85&quot;/&gt; 

Fascists pursued economic policies to strengthen state power and spread ideology, such as consolidating trade unions to be state- or party-controlled.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauley86&quot;/&gt; Attempts were made by both Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany to establish &quot;[[autarky]]&quot; (self-sufficiency) through significant economic planning, but neither achieved economic self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;pauley87&quot;/&gt;

====National corporatism, statism and national syndicalism====

Italian Fascism's economy was based on [[corporatism]], and a number of other fascist movements similarly promoted corporatism. [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[British Union of Fascists]], describing fascist corporatism, said that &quot;it means a nation organized as the human body, with each organ performing its individual function but working in harmony with the whole&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;re208&quot;/&gt; Fascists were not hostile to the ''[[petit-bourgeoisie]]'' or to small businesses, and they promised these groups, alongside the proletariat, protection from the upper-class bourgeoisie, big business, and Marxism. The promotion of these groups is the source of the term &quot;extremism of the centre&quot; to describe fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;gr101&quot;/&gt;

Fascism blamed capitalist [[liberal democracies]] for creating class conflict and communists for exploiting it.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; In Italy, the Fascist period presided over the creation of the largest number of state-owned enterprises in [[Western Europe]], such as the nationalisation of [[petroleum]] companies into a single state enterprise called the Italian General Agency for Petroleum (''Azienda Generale Italiani Petroli'', AGIP).&lt;ref name=&quot;publishing88&quot;/&gt; Fascists made populist appeals to the [[middle class]], especially the lower middle class, by promising to protect small businesses and property owners from communism, and by promising an economy based on competition and profit while pledging to oppose big business.&lt;ref name=gr101/&gt;

In 1933, Benito Mussolini declared Italian Fascism's opposition to the &quot;decadent capitalism&quot; that he claimed prevailed in the world at the time, but he did not denounce capitalism entirely. Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or [[Heroic capitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|heroic capitalism]] (1830–1870), followed by static capitalism (1870–1914), and reaching its final form of decadent capitalism or &quot;[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]&quot; beginning in 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;fz136&quot;/&gt; Mussolini argued that Italian Fascism acknowledged the positive achievements of dynamic and heroic capitalism for its contribution to [[industrialism]] and its technical developments, but that it did not favour supercapitalism, which he claimed was incompatible with Italy's agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=fz136/&gt;

Thus Mussolini claimed that Italy under Fascist rule was not capitalist in the contemporary use of the term, which referred to supercapitalism.&lt;ref name=fz136/&gt; Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the &quot;standardization of humankind&quot; and for causing excessive consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;aesthetics89&quot;/&gt; Mussolini claimed that at the stage of supercapitalism, &quot;a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;establishing&quot;/&gt; He saw Fascism as the next logical step to solve the problems of supercapitalism and claimed that &quot;our path would lead inexorably into [[state capitalism]], which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mb158-159&quot;/&gt; Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the [[bourgeoisie]] could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism if the concept of economic [[individualism]] were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;salvemini&quot;/&gt; [[Private enterprise]] would control production but it would be supervised by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salvemini. Pp. 134&quot;/&gt; By the late 1930s and the 1940s, Italian Fascism completely denounced capitalism as an obsolete and oppressive system, Mussolini in 1940 at the entry of Italy into World War II, said: 
{{quote|''This conflict must not be allowed to cancel out all our achievements of the past eighteen years, nor, more importantly, extinguish the hope of a Third Alternative held out by Fascism to mankind fettered between the pillar of capitalist slavery and the post of Marxist chaos. The proponents of these obsolete doctrines must understand that the Fascist sword has been unsheathed twice before, in Ethiopia and in Spain, with known results.''|Benito Mussolini, 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediterranean&quot;/&gt;}}  

Italian Fascism presented the economic system of [[corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salvemini. Pp. 134&quot;/&gt;

Other fascist regimes were indifferent or hostile to [[corporatism]]. The Nazis initially attempted to form a corporatist economic system like that of Fascist Italy, creating the National Socialist Institute for Corporatism in May 1933, which included many major economists who argued that corporatism was consistent with National Socialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;minneapolis90&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge91&quot;/&gt; In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler spoke enthusiastically about the &quot;National Socialist corporative idea&quot; as one which would eventually &quot;take the place of ruinous class warfare&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aristotle92&quot;/&gt; However, the Nazis later came to view corporatism as detrimental to Germany and institutionalizing and legitimizing social differences within the German nation. Instead, the Nazis began to promote economic organisation that emphasized the biological unity of the German national community.&lt;ref name=&quot;minneapolis93&quot;/&gt;

Hitler continued to refer to corporatism in propaganda, but it was not put into place, even though a number of Nazi officials such as [[Walther Darré]], [[Gottfried Feder]], [[Alfred Rosenburg]], and [[Gregor Strasser]] were in favour of a [[Neo-medievalism|neo-medievalist]] form of corporatism, since corporations had been influential in German history in the [[medieval]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;ideologies&quot;/&gt;

Spanish Falangist leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera did not believe that corporatism was effective and denounced it as a propaganda ploy, saying &quot;this stuff about the corporative state is another piece of windbaggery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ideologies94&quot;/&gt;

====Economic planning====
Fascists opposed the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies that were dominant in the era prior to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;political&quot;/&gt; After the Great Depression began, many people from across the [[political spectrum]] blamed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, and fascists promoted their ideology as a &quot;[[Third Position|third way]]&quot; between capitalism and [[communism]].&lt;ref name=pm168/&gt;

Fascists declared their opposition to [[finance capitalism]], [[interest]] charging, and profiteering.&lt;ref name=&quot;university95&quot;/&gt; [[Nazism|Nazis]] and other anti-Semitic fascists considered finance capitalism a &quot;[[Parasitism|parasitic]]&quot; &quot;[[anti-Semitism|Jewish conspiracy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialism&quot;/&gt; Fascist governments introduced [[Incomes policy|price controls]], wage controls and other types of [[Economic interventionism|economic interventionist]] measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andreski-p64&quot;/&gt;

Fascists thought that private property should be regulated to ensure that &quot;benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reconciling&quot;/&gt; Private [[property]] rights were supported but were contingent upon service to the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;neofascism&quot;/&gt; For example, &quot;an owner of agricultural land may be compelled to raise wheat instead of sheep and employ more labour than he would find profitable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;comparative96&quot;/&gt; However, they promoted the interests of successful small businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;fascist&quot;/&gt; Mussolini wrote approvingly of the notion that profits should not be taken away from those who produced them by their own labour, saying &quot;I do not respect&amp;nbsp;— I even hate&amp;nbsp;— those men that leech a tenth of the riches produced by others&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mussolini97&quot;/&gt;

According to historian Tibor Ivan Berend, ''[[dirigisme]]'' was an inherent aspect of fascist economies.&lt;ref name=&quot;university98&quot;/&gt; The [[Labour Charter of 1927]], promulgated by the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], stated in article 7: &quot;The corporative State considers private initiative, in the field of production, as the most efficient and useful instrument of the Nation&quot;, then continued in article 9: &quot;State intervention in economic production may take place only where private initiative is lacking or is insufficient, or when are at stakes the political interest of the State. This intervention may take the form of control, encouragement or direct management.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;corporativo&quot;/&gt;  --&gt;

==Criticism of fascism==
Fascism has been widely criticized and condemned in popular culture since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II.

===Fascism as a form of tyranny===
One of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism, is that it is a [[tyranny]] in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Boesche. Theories of Tyranny, from Plato to Arendt. Pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fascism is commonly regarded as deliberately and entirely non-democratic and anti-democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barry Clarke, Joe Foweraker. ''Encyclopedia of Democratic Thought''. Routledge, 2001. Pp. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Pollard. The Fascist Experience in Italy. Routledge, 1998. Pp. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin. ''The Nature of Fascism''. New York, New York, USA: St. Martin's Press, 1991. Pp. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar on democracy, Anthony Arblaster has recorded fascists' policy claim about the ideology supporting a form of democracy, but Arblaster regards the claim as a deliberate lie and empty rhetoric, claiming that fascism never intended to put such claims of democracy into practice, and thus he categorizes fascism as non-democratic and anti-democratic in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arblaster&quot;&gt;Anthony Arblaster. &quot;Democracy&quot;, ''Concepts in social thought''.Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA: University of Minnesota Press, 1994. Pp. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However there have been scholars who have rebuked this common critical view. Scholar on fascism [[Walter Laqueur]] says that fascists &quot;''would not necessarily accept the label of 'anti-democratic'. In fact many of them argued that they were fighting for a purer and more genuine democracy in which the participation of the individual in politics would not be mediated by professional politicians, clerical influences, the availability of the mass media, but through personal, almost full time involvement in a political movement and through identification with the leader who would represent the feelings and sentiments of the whole people.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Laqueur (ed.). ''Fascism, a Reader's Guide: Analyses, Interpretations, Bibliography''. First paperback edition. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 1978. Pp. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scholar on fascism, Dylan J. Riley has investigated the possibility of fascism being an [[authoritarian democracy]], a term used by Italian Fascist theorist and policymaker Giovanni Gentile to describe fascism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dylan J. Riley 1945. Pp. 4-5&quot;&gt;Dylan J. Riley. The civic foundations of fascism in Europe: Italy, Spain, and Romania, 1870-1945. Pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Gentile explicitly rejected the conventional form of democracy, [[parliamentary democracy]] for being based on [[majority rule]] and thus an inherent assumption of the equality of citizens, while fascism rejects the concept of universal egalitarianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arblaster&quot;/&gt; But Gentile claimed that fascism supported what he called [[authoritarian democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arblaster&quot;/&gt; Riley in analysis accepts that fascism can be identified as an authoritarian democracy, and claims that fascist regimes replaced multi-party based democracy with [[Corporatism|corporatist]] representation of state-sanctioned [[corporate group]]s that would unite people into interest groups to address the state that would act in the interest of the [[general will]] of the nation and thus exercise an orderly form of popular rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dylan J. Riley 1945. Pp. 4-5&quot;/&gt; Riley notes that fascists argued that this authoritarian democracy is capable of representing the different interests of society that advise the state and the state acts in the interest of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riley&quot;&gt;Dylan J. Riley. The civic foundations of fascism in Europe: Italy, Spain, and Romania, 1870-1945. Pp. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Riley also notes that in contrast, fascists denounced liberal democracy for not being a true democracy but in fact being un-democratic because from the fascist perspective, elections and parliaments are unable to represent the interests of the nation because it lumps together individuals who have little in common into geographical districts to vote for an array of parties to represent them that results in little unanimity in terms of interests, projects, or intentions, and that liberal democracy's multi-party elections merely serve as a means to legitimize elite rule without addressing the interests of the general will of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riley&quot;/&gt;

===Unprincipled opportunism===
A common criticism of the original version of fascism, Italian Fascism, has been the accusation that much of the ideology was merely a by-product of unprincipled [[opportunism]] by Mussolini, whom they claimed changed his political stances merely to bolster his personal ambitions while he disguised them as being purposeful to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard Schreiber 1995. Pp. 111&quot;&gt;Gerhard Schreiber, Bernd Stegemann, Detlef Vogel. ''Germany and the Second World War: Volume III: The Mediterranean, South-East Europe, and North Africa 1939-1941 (From Italy's Declaration of Non-Belligerence to the Entry of the United States into the War)''. Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The American ambassador to Italy [[Richard Washburn Child]] who became a personal friend and admirer of Mussolini and worked with Mussolini to translate and write an English language autobiography; directly addressed the issue of opportunism in Mussolini's behaviour in the preface of the English language autobiography of Mussolini.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benito Mussolini 1998&quot;&gt;Benito Mussolini. ''My Rise And Fall, Volumes 1-2''. Da Capo Press edition. Da Capo Press, 1998. Pp. ix. (Note: Mussolini wrote the second volume about his fall from power as head of government of the Kingdom of Italy in 1943, though he was restored to power in northern Italy by the German military.)&lt;/ref&gt; Child said &quot;''Opportunist is a term of reproach used to brand men who fit themselves to conditions for the reasons of self-interest. Mussolini, as I have learned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes.''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benito Mussolini 1998&quot;/&gt; Child quoted Mussolini as saying, &quot;''The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine first of all must run!''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benito Mussolini 1998&quot;/&gt;

Mussolini's actions at the time of the outbreak of World War I were then, and have since, been commonly criticized for being completely opportunist for allegedly suddenly abandoning Marxist egalitarian internationalism he had formerly held in favour of non-egalitarian nationalism. Furthermore such criticisms have noted that upon Mussolini endorsing Italy's intervention in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, that he and the new Fascist movement received financial support from foreign sources. Such as receiving funds from [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Mack Smith. 1997. ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini was supported by the British Security Service [[MI5]], and was being paid a £100 weekly wage from MI5; this help was authorised by [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2009-10-13&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/13/benito-mussolini-recruited-mi5-italy |work=Guardian |location=UK |title=Recruited by MI5: the name's Mussolini. Benito Mussolini&amp;nbsp;– Documents reveal Italian dictator got start in politics in 1917 with help of £100 weekly wage from MI5 |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2009 |first=Tom |last=Kington}}&lt;/ref&gt; However such criticism has been challenged even by Mussolini's socialist critics at the time who noted that regardless of the financial support he accepted for his pro-interventionist stance, that Mussolini was free to write whatever he wished in his newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'', without prior sanctioning by his financial backers.&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Brien. Mussolini in the First World War: The Journalist, The Soldier, The Fascist. Pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the major source that Mussolini and the Fascist movement received in World War I was not from capitalists who sought to use Mussolini's new movement, but rather it came from France and is widely believed to have come from French socialists who supported the French government's war against Germany and were sending support to Italian socialists who wanted Italian intervention on France's side. {{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=200}}

Furthermore Mussolini's transformation away from Marxism into eventually what became fascism, began prior to World War I, as Mussolini had grown increasingly pessimistic of Marxism and egalitarianism while at the same time he had become increasingly supportive of figures who opposed [[egalitarianism]], such as Nietzsche.{{sfn|Golomb|2002|p=249}} By 1902 Mussolini was studying Sorel, Nietzsche, and the [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Vilfredo Pareto]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mediterranean Fascism by Charles F. Delzel page 96&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel's emphasis on the need for overthrowing decadent [[liberal democracy]] and [[capitalism]] by the use of violence, [[direct action]], the [[general strike]], and the use of [[Machiavellianism|neo-Machiavellian]] appeals to emotion, impressed Mussolini deeply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mediterranean3&quot;&gt;Mediterranean Fascism 1919–1945 Edited by Charles F. Delzel, Harper Rowe 1970, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; His use of Nietzsche made him a highly unorthodox socialist, due to Nietzsche's promotion of elitism and anti-egalitarian views.{{sfn|Golomb|2002|p=249}} Prior to World War I, Mussolini's writings over time indicated that he had abandoned Marxism and egalitarianism that he had previously supported, in favour of Nietzsche's ''übermensch'' concept and anti-egalitarianism.{{sfn|Golomb|2002|p=249}} In 1908, Mussolini wrote a short essay called &quot;Philosophy of Strength&quot; based on his Nietzschean influence, in which Mussolini openly spoke fondly of the ramifications of an impending war in Europe, saying:
{{quote|''a new kind of free spirit will come, strengthened by the war, ... a spirit equipped with a kind of sublime perversity, ... a new free spirit will triumph over God and over Nothing.''|Benito Mussolini, &quot;Philosophy of Strength&quot;, 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gigliola Gori 2004. Pp. 14&quot;/&gt;}}

Claims of Mussolini's unprincipled opportunism have pointed to the changes in Fascist Italy's foreign policy in the 1930s that changed from promoting a French-Italian alliance against Germany to promoting a German-Italian alliance against France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard Schreiber 1995. Pp. 111&quot;/&gt; However this view on Fascist Italy's foreign policy has been challenged by historians who have noted that Italian Fascist foreign policy was based upon a principle of &quot;decisive weight&quot; as designed by Italian Fascist official [[Dino Grandi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard Schreiber 1995. Pp. 111&quot;/&gt; Grandi's principle of decisive weight stressed that although Italy at the time was not a great power in that it was weaker for the time being in comparison with other European states, that Italy's power was still significant enough to &quot;weigh the balance&quot; in European affairs; and that Italy would not rule out neither antagonism nor alliance with either France or Germany, because Italy refused to become &quot;a slave of the rule of three&quot;, meaning that Italian Fascists did not intend for Italy to obediently serve as a junior partner to either France against Germany or Germany against France, and that Italy would only put its weight into an alliance that best upheld Italy's interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerhard Schreiber 1995. Pp. 111&quot;/&gt;

===Ideological dishonesty===
Fascism has been criticized for being ideologically dishonest. 

Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian Fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 17&quot;&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;John Pollard 1998. Pp. 129&quot;&gt;John Pollard. The Fascist Experience in Italy. Routledge, 1998. Pp. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological [[hyperbole]] to justify its actions, although during Dino Grandi's tenure as Italy's foreign minister, the country engaged in ''[[realpolitik]]'' free of such fascist hyperbole.&lt;ref&gt;H. James Burgwyn. ''Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918-1940''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. Pp. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934 involving praising Hitler's rise to power and meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's ally leader in Austria, [[Engelbert Dolfuss]] by Nazis in Austria; and again back to support after 1936 when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia.

Upon antagonism exploding between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dolfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian Fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism's racial theories, particularly by denouncing its [[Nordic race|Nordicism]], while promoting [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneanism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;John Pollard 1998. Pp. 129&quot;/&gt;  Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists' claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy, by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the Lombards took control of Italy after the fall of ancient Rome, that they arrived in small numbers of about 8,000 and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the Latin language within fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism was influenced by the tradition of Italian nationalists scornfully looking down upon Nordicists' claims, and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of ancient Roman civilization as well as the classical revival in the [[Renaissance]], to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as &quot;newcomers&quot; to civilization in comparison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 17&quot;/&gt; At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian Fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that Nazi theory on German superiority was based on the theory of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman [[Arthur de Gobineau]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; However after German-Italian relations reduced in tension in the late 1930s, Italian Fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Pollard 1998. Pp. 129&quot;/&gt; 

Mussolini declared in 1938 that Italian Fascism had always been anti-Semitic, upon Italy adopting anti-Semitic laws in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Pollard 1998. Pp. 129&quot;/&gt; When in fact Italian Fascism did not endorse anti-Semitism until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating anti-Semitic Nazi Germany whose power and influence was growing in Europe, prior to then there had been major Jewish Italians who had been major Italian Fascist officials prior to this, including [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who had also been Mussolini's mistress.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Pollard 1998. Pp. 129&quot;/&gt; Also, contrary to Mussolini's claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian Fascists were staunchly anti-Semitic such as [[Roberto Farinacci]] and [[Giuseppe Preziosi]] while other members, such as [[Italo Balbo]] who came from [[Ferrara]] that had one of Italy's largest Jewish communities, were disgusted with the anti-Semitic laws and opposed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Pollard 1998. Pp. 129&quot;/&gt; However fascism scholar [[Mark Neocleous]] notes that while Italian Fascism did not have a clear commitment to anti-Semitism, that there were occasional anti-Semitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian Bolsheviks, and claimed that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous. ''Fascism''. Open University Press, 1997. Pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;
