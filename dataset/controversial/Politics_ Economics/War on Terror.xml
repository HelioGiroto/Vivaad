The '''War on Terror''' (also known as the '''Global War on Terror''' and '''War on Terrorism''') is a term commonly applied to an international military campaign begun in 2001 by the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], with support from other countries. The campaign's initial purpose was to eliminate [[al-Qaeda]] and other militant organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;WH 10-07-01&quot;&gt;[[ETA]]
{{cite press release

(Clockwise, starting at top left:Burning ruins of the [[World Trade Center]], US soldiers board a Chinook helicopter during [[Operation Anaconda]], an Afghan and US soldier stand by to engage an enemy, a car bomb detonates in Baghdad, Iraq

The phrase 'War on Terror' was first used by [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George W. Bush]] on 20 September 2001. The Bush administration and the Western media have since used the term to denote a global military, political, legal and ideological struggle—targeting both organizations designated as terrorist and regimes accused of supporting them. It was typically used with a particular focus on [[Islamic terrorism|militant Islamists]] and al-Qaeda.

Although the term is not officially used by the administration of US President [[Barack Obama]] (which instead uses the term '''Overseas Contingency Operation'''), it is still commonly used by politicians, in the media and officially by some aspects of government, such as the [[United States Armed Forces|United States']] [[Global War on Terrorism Service Medal]]

==Terminology==
The phrase &quot;War on Terror&quot; has been used to specifically refer to the ongoing military campaign led by the US, UK and their allies against organizations and regimes identified by them as terrorist, and excludes other independent [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist operations and campaigns]] such as those by [[Russia]] and [[India]]. The conflict has also been referred to by names other than the War on Terror.  It has also been known as:

In 1984 the [[Reagan Administration]] used the term &quot;war against terrorism&quot; as part of an effort to pass legislation that was designed to freeze assets of terrorist groups and marshal the forces of government against them. Author Shane Harris asserts this was a reaction to the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1973131,00.html |title=How America Became a Surveillance State |work=Time Magazine |date=18 March 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of America at war with terrorism may have begun on September 11, 2001 when [[Tom Brokaw]], having just witnessed the collapse of one the towers of the [[World Trade Center]], declared &quot;Terrorists have declared war on [America].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=1419 |title=Breaking News on September 11th |author=[[Matt Lauer]] |author2=[[Katie Couric]] |author3=Tom Brokaw |date=11 September 2001 |work=NBC Learn K-12 |publisher=NBCUniversal Media |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 16 September 2001, at [[Camp David]], President George W. Bush used the phrase ''war on terrorism'' in an unscripted and controversial comment when he said, &quot;This crusade – this war on terrorism – is going to take a while, ... &quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/09/17/2001-09-17_a_fight_vs__evil__bush_and_c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100505200651/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/09/17/2001-09-17_a_fight_vs__evil__bush_and_c.html|archivedate=5 May 2010 |title=Kenneth R. Bazinet, &quot;A Fight Vs. Evil, Bush And Cabinet Tell U.S.&quot; |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=17 September 2001 |accessdate=26 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bush later apologized for this remark due to the negative connotations the term ''crusade'' has to people of Muslim faith.  The word ''crusade'' was not used again.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lyons, &quot;Bush enters Mideast's rhetorical minefield&quot; (Reuters: 21 September 2001). [http://hv.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=006SM3 Greenspun.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of congress, Bush stated that, &quot;(o)ur 'war on terror' begins with al-Qaeda, but it does not end there.  It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.&quot;&lt;ref name=cnntranscript&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcript of President Bush's address |publisher=CNN |date= 20 September 2001 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bush did not say when he expected this would be achieved.

US President Barack Obama has rarely used the term, but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009, he stated &quot;Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Inauguration/story?id=6689022&amp;page=1 |title=FULL TRANSCRIPT: President Barack Obama's Inaugural Address|publisher=ABC News |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from &quot;Global War on Terror&quot; to &quot;Overseas Contingency Operation&quot; (OCO).&lt;ref name=oco-wapost&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/24/AR2009032402818.html 'Global War On Terror' Is Given New Name], Scott Wilson and Al Kamen, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 25 March 2009; Page A04&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] requested that [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] staff members avoid use of the term, instead using &quot;Overseas Contingency Operation&quot;.&lt;ref name=oco-wapost/&gt;

In April 2007 the British government announced publicly that it was abandoning the use of the phrase &quot;War on Terror&quot; as they found it to be less than helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Reynolds|first=Paul |date=17 April 2007 |title=Declining use of 'war on terror' |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6562709.stm}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was explained more recently by Lady [[Eliza Manningham-Buller]]. In her 2011 [[Reith lecture]], the former head of [[MI5]] said that the 9/11 attacks were &quot;a crime, not an act of war.&quot;, &quot;So I never felt it helpful to refer to a war on terror&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011 |title=MI5 former chief decries 'war on terror' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/02/mi5-war-on-terror-criticism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the term and the policies it denotes have been a source of ongoing controversy, as critics argue it has been used to justify unilateral [[preventive war]], human rights abuses and other violations of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Borhan Uddin Khan and Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman, “Combating Terrorism under Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Regime”, Mediterranean Journal of Human Rights, Vol. 12 (Double Issue), 2008, pp.379–397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The origins of al-Qaeda as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] (December 1979 – February 1989). The United States supported the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[mujahadeen]] [[guerilla warfare|guerillas]] against the military forces of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cooley|first=John K.|authorlink=John K.

===Operation Active Endeavour===

Operation Active Endeavour is a [[Navy|naval operation]] of NATO started in October 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks. It operates in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and is designed to prevent the movement of militants or [[weapons of mass destruction]] and to enhance the security of shipping in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_7932.htm |title=Operation Active Endeavour |publisher=[[NATO]] |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation has also assisted [[Greece]] with its prevention of [[illegal immigration]].

===Operation Enduring Freedom===

[[File:Streamer gwotE.PNG|thumb|Campaign streamer awarded to units who have participated in [[Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal|Operation Enduring Freedom]].]]
Operation Enduring Freedom is the official name used by the Bush administration for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], together with three smaller military actions, under the umbrella of the Global War on Terror. These global operations are intended to seek out and destroy any al-Qaeda fighters or affiliates.

On 20 September 2001, in the wake of the [[11 September attacks]], George W. Bush delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban government of Afghanistan to turn over Osama bin Laden and [[al-Qaeda]] leaders operating in the country or face attack.&lt;ref name=cnntranscript/&gt; The Taliban demanded evidence of bin Laden's link to the 11 September attacks and, if such evidence warranted a trial, they offered to handle such a trial in an Islamic Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban rejects president Bush's demands |publisher=PBS |date= 21 September 2001 |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US refused to provide any evidence.

Subsequently, in October 2001, US forces (with UK and coalition allies) invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime. On 7 October 2001, the official invasion began with British and US forces conducting [[airstrike]] campaigns over enemy targets. Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, [[Fall of Kabul|fell by mid-November]]. The remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, mainly Tora Bora. In December, Coalition forces (the US and its allies) [[Battle of Tora Bora|fought within that region]]. It is believed that Osama bin Laden escaped into [[Pakistan]] during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/world/asia/29torabora.html?_r=1 |title=Senate Report Explores 2001 Escape by bin Laden From Afghan Mountains |work=The New York Times |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Scott |last=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/29/osama-bin-laden-senate-report |title=Rumsfeld let Bin Laden escape in 2001, says Senate report |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |work=The Guardian  |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, the US and other [[NATO]] and non-NATO forces launched [[Operation Anaconda]] with the goal of destroying any remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the [[Shah-i-Kot Valley]] and [[Arma Mountains]] of Afghanistan. The Taliban suffered heavy casualties and evacuated the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/DC12Ag01.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=12 March 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Syed Saleem |last=Shahzad |title=Taliban find unlikely allies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban regrouped in western Pakistan and began to unleash an insurgent-style offensive against Coalition forces in late 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |date=26 March 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-03-26/us/ret.war.facts_1_taliban-fighters-al-qaeda-afghanistan?_s=PM:US |title=Al Qaeda, Taliban may be regrouping}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout southern and eastern Afghanistan, firefights broke out between the surging Taliban and Coalition forces. Coalition forces responded with a series of military offensives and an increase in the amount of troops in Afghanistan. In February 2010, Coalition forces launched [[Operation Moshtarak]] in southern Afghanistan along with other military offensives in the hopes that they would destroy the Taliban insurgency once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2010/02/201021343536129252.html |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=13 February 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |title=Operation Moshtarak: At a glance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace talks are also underway between Taliban affiliated fighters and Coalition forces.

This extension of Operation Enduring Freedom was titled OEF-HOA. Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF-HOA does not have a specific organization as a target. OEF-HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect militant activities in the region and to work with willing governments to prevent the reemergence of militant cells and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCE–HORN OF AFRICA |publisher=United States Africa Command |url=http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090426223216/http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archivedate=26 April 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, the [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) was established in [[Djibouti]] at [[Camp Lemonnier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10504.pdf |title=DOD Needs to Determine the Future of Its Horn of Africa Task Force |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |date = April 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains approximately 2,000 personnel including US military and special operations forces (SOF) and coalition force members, [[Combined Task Force 150]] (CTF-150).

Task Force 150 consists of ships from a shifting group of nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, [[Italy]], Netherlands, Pakistan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region and affecting the US' [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

Included in the operation is the training of selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] in counter-terrorism and [[counter-insurgency]] tactics. Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include rebuilding of schools and medical clinics and providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained.

The program expands as part of the [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative]] as CJTF personnel also assist in training the armed forces of [[Chad]], Niger, [[Mauritania]] and [[Mali]]. However, the War on Terror does not include Sudan, where over 400,000 have died in an ongoing civil war.

On 1 July 2006, a Web-posted message purportedly written by Osama bin Laden urged [[Somalis]] to build an [[Islamic state]] in the country and warned western governments that the al-Qaeda network would fight against them if they intervened there.&lt;ref name=BIN-LADEN-MESSAGE-IRAQ-SOMALIA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-01-bin-laden-plans-message_x.htm |title=Bin Laden releases Web message on Iraq, Somalia |work=USA Today |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalia has been considered a &quot;[[failed state]]&quot; because its official central government was weak, dominated by warlords and unable to exert effective control over the country. Beginning in mid-2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist faction campaigning on a restoration of &quot;law and order&quot; through [[Sharia]] law, had rapidly taken control of much of southern Somalia.

On 14 December 2006, the US Assistant Secretary of State [[Jendayi Frazer]] claimed al-Qaeda cell operatives were controlling the Islamic Courts Union, a claim denied by the ICU.&lt;ref name=US-SAYS-AL-QAEDA-BEHIND-SOMALI-ISLAMISTS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080204082431/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm |title=US says al Qaeda behind Somali Islamists |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2006, the UN-backed [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) of Somalia had seen its power effectively limited to [[Baidoa]], while the Islamic Courts Union controlled the majority of southern Somalia, including the capital of [[Mogadishu]]. On 20 December 2006, the Islamic Courts Union launched an [[Battle of Baidoa|offensive]] on the government stronghold of Baidoa, and saw early gains before Ethiopia intervened in favor of the government.

By 26 December, the Islamic Courts Union retreated towards Mogadishu, before again retreating as TFG/Ethiopian troops neared, leaving them to take Mogadishu with [[Fall of Mogadishu|no resistance]]. The ICU then fled to [[Kismayo]], where they fought Ethiopian/TFG forces in the [[Battle of Jilib]].

The Prime Minister of Somalia claimed that three &quot;terror suspects&quot; from the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] are being sheltered in Kismayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jun/13/usa.terrorism |work=The Guardian  |location=London  | title=Secret world of US jails | first=Jason | last=Burke | date=13 June 2004 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2006, al-Qaeda deputy leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] called upon Muslims worldwide to fight against Ethiopia and the TFG in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/cfr/world/slot2_20090227.html?_r=1|title= Backgrounder: Al-Shabaab |work=The New York Times|author=Stephanie Hanson|date=2 March 2009|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2007, the US launched the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]] by bombing [[Ras Kamboni]] using [[AC-130]] gunships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,242460,00.html |title=U.S. Launches Attack on Suspected Al Qaeda Members in Somalia |publisher=Fox News |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2009, [[US Special Forces]] killed two men and wounded and captured two others near the Somali village of [[Baraawe raid|Baarawe]].  Witnesses claim that helicopters used for the operation launched from French-flagged warships, but that could not be confirmed.

{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara}}
Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara (OEF-TS) is the name of the military operation conducted by the US and partner nations in the Sahara/Sahel region of Africa, consisting of counter-terrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa.

[[Iraq]] had been listed as a [[State sponsor of terrorism]] by the US since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq accuses US, Turkey of 'illegally' meeting with Kurds |publisher=CNN |date=9 March 2000 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Saddam Hussein]] [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded Kuwait]].  Iraq was also on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the US could provide material support to Iraq in its [[Iran-Iraq war|war with Iran]].  Hussein's regime proved a continuing problem for the UN and Iraq’s neighbors due to its use of [[chemical weapons]] against [[Iranian people|Iranians]] and [[Kurds]].

====Iraqi no-fly zones====
After the [[Gulf War]], the US, French and British militaries instituted and began patrolling [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], to protect Iraq's Kurdish minority and [[Shi'a]] [[Arab]] population—both of which suffered attacks from the Hussein regime before and after the Gulf War—in Iraq's northern and southern regions, respectively. US forces continued in combat zone deployments through November 1995 and launched [[Operation Desert Fox]] against Iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet US demands of &quot;unconditional cooperation&quot; in weapons inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton: Iraq has abused its final chance |publisher=CNN |date=16 December 1998 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/16/clinton/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Operation Desert Fox, US president Bill Clinton predicted &quot;And mark my words, he will develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and he will use them.&quot; Clinton also declared a desire to remove Hussein from power and in the same speech said, &quot;The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power, he threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of his region, the security of the world.&quot; In the aftermath of Operation Desert Fox, during December 1998, Iraq announced that it would no longer respect the no-fly zones and resumed its attempts to shoot down US aircraft.

Air strikes by the British and US against Iraqi anti-aircraft and military targets continued over the next few years. Also in 1998, Clinton signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]], which called for regime change in Iraq on the basis of its alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, oppression of Iraqi citizens, and attacks on other Middle Eastern countries.

The George W. Bush administration called for the [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) to again send weapons inspectors to Iraq to find and destroy the alleged weapons of mass destruction and called for a UNSC resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush's remarks after UN passes Iraq resolution |publisher=CNN |date=8 November 2002 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/11/08/bush.transcript/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|UNSC Resolution 1441]] was passed unanimously, which offered Iraq &quot;a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations&quot; or face &quot;serious consequences.&quot;

Resolution 1441 did not authorize the use of force by member states. The Iraqi government subsequently allowed UN inspectors some access to Iraqi sites, while the US government continued to assert that Iraq was being obstructionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/resolution2_2-24-03.html |title=The Second UN Resolution|date=24 February 2003|work=pbs.org|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, a large bipartisan majority in the [[United States Congress]] authorized the president to use force if necessary to disarm Iraq in order to &quot;prosecute the war on terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of US Armed Forces Against Iraq |date=2 October 2002 |publisher=[[White House]] |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/print/20021002-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to overcome opposition from France, Russia, and China against a UNSC resolution that would sanction the use of force against Iraq, and before the UN weapons inspectors had completed their inspections (which were claimed to be fruitless by the US because of Iraq's alleged deception), the US assembled a &quot;[[Coalition of the Willing]]&quot; composed of nations who pledged support for its policy of regime change in Iraq.

The Iraq War began in March 2003 with an air campaign, which was immediately followed by a [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led ground invasion]]. The Bush administration stated the invasion was the &quot;serious consequences&quot; spoken of in the UNSC Resolution 1441. The Bush administration also [[Iraq War and U.S. Global War on Terror|stated the Iraq war]] was part of the War on Terror, something later [[Criticism of the War on Terror|questioned or contested]].

[[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Baghdad, Iraq’s capital city, fell]] in April 2003 and Saddam Hussein’s government quickly dissolved. On 1 May 2003, [[2003 Mission Accomplished speech|Bush announced]] that major combat operations in Iraq had ended.&lt;ref&gt;

The insurgency, which included [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq|al-Qaeda affiliated groups]], led to far more coalition casualties [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|than the invasion]]. Other elements of the insurgency were led by fugitive members of President Hussein's [[Ba'ath]] regime, which included Iraqi nationalists and [[pan-Arabist]]s.

In 2004, the insurgent forces grew stronger. The US conducted attacks on insurgent strongholds in cities like [[Battle of Najaf (2004)|Najaf]] and [[Second Battle of Fallujah|Fallujah]].

In January 2007, President Bush presented a new strategy for Operation Iraqi Freedom based upon [[counter-insurgency]] theories and tactics developed by General [[David Petraeus]]. The [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] was part of this &quot;new way forward&quot; and, along with US backing of [[Sunni]] groups it had previously sought to defeat, has been credited with a widely recognized dramatic decrease in violence by up to 80%.

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, former President of Pakistan [[Pervez Musharraf]] sided with the US against the Taliban government in Afghanistan after an ultimatum by former US President George W. Bush.  Musharraf agreed to give the US the use of three airbases for Operation Enduring Freedom. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] and other US administration officials met with Musharraf. On 19 September 2001, Musharraf addressed the people of Pakistan and stated that, while he opposed military tactics against the Taliban, Pakistan risked being endangered by an alliance of India and the US if it did not cooperate. In 2006, Musharraf testified that this stance was pressured by threats from the US, and revealed in his memoirs that he had &quot;war-gamed&quot; the United States as an adversary and decided that it would end in a loss for Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-09-25-pakistan-memoir_x.htm  Musharraf's book says Pakistan faced US 'onslaught' if it didn't back terror war] 26 September 2006 USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2002, Musharraf gave a speech against Islamic extremism. He unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan itself. He stated that his government was committed to rooting out extremism and made it clear that the banned militant organizations would not be allowed to resurface under any new name. He said, &quot;the recent decision to ban extremist groups promoting militancy was taken in the national interest after thorough  consultations. It was not taken under any foreign influence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |title=Musharraf vows to root out extremism: Banned outfits won’t be allowed to resurface|publisher=Dawn.Com |date=5 December 2003|first=Rafaqat|last= Ali |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Musharraf-led government took a firm stand against the jihadi organizations and groups promoting extremism, and  arrested [[Maulana Masood Azhar]], head of the [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]], and [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]], chief of the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], and took dozens of activists into custody. An official ban was imposed on the groups on 12 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH20Df07.html |title=Musharraf braced for jihadi backlash |publisher=Atimes.com |date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] born [[Abu Zubaydah|Zayn al-Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah]] was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint US-Pakistan raids. Zubaydah is said to have been a high-ranking al-Qaeda official with the title of operations chief and in charge of running al-Qaeda training camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/04/01/pakistan.alqaeda/ | work=CNN | title=Officials: Captured man says he's al Qaeda brass | date=1 April 2002 | accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent al-Qaeda members were arrested in the following two years, namely [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], who is known to have been a financial backer of al-Qaeda operations, and [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], who at the time of his capture was the third highest-ranking official in al-Qaeda and had been directly in charge of the planning for the 11 September attacks.

In 2004, the [[Pakistan Army]] launched a campaign in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan's [[Waziristan]] region, sending in 80,000 troops. The goal of the conflict was to remove the al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the region.

After the fall of the Taliban regime many members of the Taliban resistance fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, wanted for his involvement in the USS Cole bombing, the [[Bojinka plot]], and the killing of ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter [[Daniel Pearl]].

The United States has carried out a campaign of [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Drone attacks]] on targets all over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. However, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistani Taliban]] still operates there. To this day it’s estimated that 15 US soldiers were killed while fighting al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants in Pakistan since the War on Terror began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icasualties.org/oef/ |title=Operation Enduring Freedom &amp;#124; Afghanistan |publisher=iCasualties |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kashmir region 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Political Map:''' the Kashmir region districts]]
In a 'Letter to American People' written by [[Osama bin Laden]] in 2002, he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting America is because of its support of India on the Kashmir issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/report/2002/021120-ubl.htm Osama bin Laden &quot;letter to the American people&quot;], [[GlobalSecurity.org]], 20 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; While on a trip to Delhi in 2002, U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] suggested that [[Al-Qaeda]] was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2043800.stm Analysis: Is al-Qaeda in Kashmir?], [[BBC]], 13 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/06/13/1023864326179.html Rumsfeld offers US technology to guard Kashmir border], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 14 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]] with tacit approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence agency [[Inter-Services Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0702/p01s02-wosc.html Al Qaeda thriving in Pakistani Kashmir], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 2 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A team of [[Special Air Service]] and [[Delta Force]] was sent into [[Indian-administered Kashmir]] in 2002 to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group [[Harkat-ul-Mujahideen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/1385795/SAS-joins-Kashmir-hunt-for-bin-Laden.html SAS joins Kashmir hunt for bin Laden], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 23 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.

[[Image:BritishPatrolHelmand01.jpg|thumb|right|The United Kingdom is the second largest contributor of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].]]
The invasion of Afghanistan is seen to have been the first action of this war, and initially involved forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]]. Since the initial invasion period, these forces were augmented by troops and aircraft from Australia, Canada, [[Denmark]], France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand and [[Norway]] amongst others. In 2006, there were about 33,000 troops in Afghanistan.

On 12 September 2001, less than 24 hours after the 11 September attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., NATO invoked Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] and declared the attacks to be an attack against all 19 NATO member countries. Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] also declared that Australia would invoke the [[ANZUS]] Treaty along similar lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 September 2001 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s367069.htm |title=PM speaks on Ansett collapse, Anzus treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following months, NATO took a wide range of measures to respond to the threat of terrorism. On 22 November 2002, the member states of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC) decided on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism which explicitly states that &quot;EAPC States are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, as well as the rule of law, in combating terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism |url=http://pfpdev.ethz.ch/SCORMcontent/72234/scos/93/documents/0.pdf |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |publisher=[[NATO]]}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO started naval operations in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general called Operation Active Endeavour.

Support for the US cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002. Even so, many of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; countries that unconditionally supported the US-led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan, particular neighboring Pakistan, which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict. Pakistan was also engaged in the [[War in North-West Pakistan]] (Waziristan War). Supported by US intelligence, Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New frontline in the war on terror.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{Main|International Security Assistance Force}}

December 2001 saw the creation of the NATO-led [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) to assist the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] and the first post-Taliban elected government. With a renewed Taliban insurgency, it was announced in 2006 that ISAF would replace the US troops in the province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

The British [[16th Air Assault Brigade]] (later reinforced by [[Royal Marines]]) formed the core of the force in southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British, 2,000 Canadian, 1,400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia, along with special forces from Denmark and [[Estonia]] and small contingents from other nations. The monthly supply of cargo containers through Pakistani route to ISAF in Afghanistan is over 4,000 costing around 12 billion in Pakistani Rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2011/01/29/war-on-terror-cost-of-us-taxpayers-patience/#.TtjwPLLNllk |title=Afghan war cost rise tests US taxpayers’ patience |publisher=Thenewstribe.com |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK troops take over Afghan duties|date=1 June 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4961368.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada set for longer Afghan stay |date=16 June 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4984880.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia outlines Afghan force|date=8 May 2006|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4983540.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |date=3 February 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Military aid to other countries==

;Pakistan
In the three years before the attacks of 11 September, Pakistan received approximately US$9 million in American military aid. In the three years after, the number increased to US$4.2 billion, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11.

Such a huge inflow of funds has raised concerns in the Indian press that these funds were given without any accountability, as the end uses not being documented, and that large portions were used to suppress civilians' human rights and to purchase weapons to contain domestic problems like the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] unrest. Pakistan has stated that India has been supporting terror groups within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan with the aim of creating unrest within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[India Today]] |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/24792/Cover+Story/Tackling+Pakistan.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091124135535/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/24792/COVER%20STORY/Tackling+Pakistan.html |archivedate=24 November 2009 |title=Tackling Pakistan |date= 9 January 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Lebanon

On 20 May 2007, a conflict began in north [[Lebanon]] after fighting broke out between [[Fatah al-Islam]], an [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[List of designated terrorist organizations|militant organization]], and the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] in [[Nahr al-Bared]], a [[Palestinian refugee|Palestinian]] [[List of Palestinian refugee camps|refugee camp]] near [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. The conflict evolved mostly around the Siege of Nahr el-Bared, but minor clashes also occurred in the [[Ain al-Hilweh]] refugee camp in southern Lebanon and several bombings took place in and around Lebanon's capital, [[Beirut]].

Fatah-al-Islam has been described as a militant [[mujahid]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Figaro_20070416&quot;&gt;Le Figaro (16 April 2007). [http://www.lefigaro.fr/english/20070416.WWW000000477_fatah_al_islam_the_new_terrorist_threat_hanging_over_lebanon.html &quot;Fatah Al-Islam: the new terrorist threat hanging over Lebanon&quot;].

On 7 September 2007, Lebanese government forces captured the camp and declared victory.

{{further2|[[Detentions following the September 11 attacks]] and [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks]]}}

In addition to military efforts abroad, in the aftermath of 9/11 the Bush Administration increased domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. Various government bureaucracies which handled security and military functions were reorganized. A new cabinet level agency called the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was created in November 2002 to lead and coordinate the largest reorganization of the US federal government since the consolidation of the armed forces into the Department of Defense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Justice Department launched the [[National Security Entry-Exit Registration System]] for certain male non-citizens in the US, requiring them to register in person at offices of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].

The USA PATRIOT Act of October 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies' ability to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States; expands the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]’s authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts. The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]] monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by [[The New York Times]] newspaper). Telecommunication usage by known and suspected terrorists was studied through the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]]. The Patriot Act is still in effect.

Political interest groups have stated that these laws remove important restrictions on governmental authority, and are a dangerous encroachment on civil liberties, possible [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] violations of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. On 30 July 2003, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed the first legal challenge against Section 215 of the Patriot Act, claiming that it allows the [[FBI]] to violate a citizen's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, Fourth Amendment rights, and right to [[due process]], by granting the government the right to search a person's business, bookstore, and library records in a terrorist investigation, without disclosing to the individual that records were being searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |title=American Libraries – First Patriot Act Challenge Filed by ACLU |publisher=ALA |date=4 August 2003 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, governing bodies in a number of communities have passed symbolic resolutions against the act.

In a speech on 9 June 2005, Bush said that the USA PATRIOT Act had been used to bring charges against more than 400 suspects, more than half of whom had been convicted. Meanwhile the ACLU quoted Justice Department figures showing that 7,000 people have complained of abuse of the Act.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) began an initiative in early 2002 with the creation of the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, designed to promote information technologies that could be used in counter-terrorism. This program, facing criticism, has since been defunded by Congress.

By 2003, 12 major conventions and protocols were designed to combat terrorism. These were adopted and ratified by a number of states. These conventions require states to co-operate on principal issues regarding unlawful seizure of aircraft, the physical protection of nuclear materials, and the freezing of assets of militant networks.&lt;ref&gt;Cindy C Combs (2003), Terrorism in the Twenty First Century, (3rd Edition, New Jersey: Pearsons Educ. Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624|Resolution 1624]] concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international human rights laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both resolutions require mandatory annual reports on counter-terrorism activities by adopting nations, the United States and Israel have both declined to submit reports. In the same year, the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a planning document, by the name &quot;National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism&quot;  which stated that it constituted the &quot;comprehensive military plan to prosecute the Global War on Terror for the [[Military of the United States|Armed Forces of the United States]]...including the findings and recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]] and a rigorous examination with the Department of Defense&quot;.

On 9 January 2007, the House of Representatives passed a bill, by a vote of 299–128,  enacting many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission The bill passed in the US Senate,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073 US Senate: Legislation &amp; Records&lt;!-- Bot generated  title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; by a vote of 60–38, on 13 March 2007 and it was signed into law on 3 August 2007 by President Bush. It became Public Law 110-53. In July 2012, US Senate passed a resolution urging that the [[Haqqani Network]] be designated a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist organisation]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/us-cong-votes-for-designating-haqqani-network-as-terror-group/980665/|Title= US Cong votes for designating Haqqani network as terror group| date= 28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Office of Strategic Influence]] was secretly created after 9/11 for the purpose of coordinating propaganda efforts, but was closed soon after being discovered. The Bush administration implemented the [[Continuity of Operations Plan]] (or Continuity of Government) to ensure that US government would be able to continue in catastrophic circumstances.

Since 9/11, extremists made various attempts to attack the US homeland, with varying levels of organization and skill. For example, vigilant passengers aboard a transatlantic flight prevented [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]], in 2001, and [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], in 2009, from detonating an explosive device.

Other terrorist plots have been stopped by federal agencies using new legal powers and investigative tools, sometimes in cooperation with foreign governments.

Such thwarted attacks include:
*The [[2001 shoe bomb plot]]
*A plan to crash airplanes into the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|US Bank Tower]] (aka Library Tower) in Los Angeles
*The 2003 plot by [[Iyman Faris]] to blow up the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in New York City
*The [[2004 Financial buildings plot]] which targeted the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] buildings in Washington, DC, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and other financial institutions
*The 2004 [[Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot]]
*The [[2006 Sears Tower plot]]
*The [[2007 Fort Dix attack plot]]
*The [[2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot]]
*The [[Najibullah Zazi|New York Subway Bombing Plot]] and [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]]

The Obama administration has promised the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], increased the number of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]], and promised the withdrawal of its troops from [[War in Iraq|Iraq]].

==Casualties==

The Global War of Terror has seen fewer war deaths than any other decade in the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S. [http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/15/think_again_war &quot;Think Again: War.&quot;] ''Foreign Policy Magazine'', 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no widely agreed on figure for the number of people that have been killed so far in the War on Terror as it has been defined by the Bush Administration to include the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and operations elsewhere. Some estimates include the following:

* Iraq: 62,570 to 1,124,000
{{Main|Casualties of the Iraq War}}
:*[[ORB survey of Iraq War casualties|Opinion Research Business (ORB) poll]] conducted 12–19 August 2007 estimated 1,033,000 violent deaths due to the Iraq War. The range given was 946,000 to 1,120,000 deaths. A nationally representative sample of approximately 2,000 Iraqi adults answered whether any members of their household (living under their roof) were killed due to the Iraq War. 22% of the respondents had lost one or more household members. ORB reported that &quot;48% died from a gunshot wound, 20% from the impact of a car bomb, 9% from aerial bombardment, 6% as a result of an accident and 6% from another blast/ordnance.&quot;&lt;ref name=ORB&gt;[http://www.opinion.co.uk/Newsroom_details.aspx?NewsId=78 &quot;More than 1,000,000 Iraqis murdered&quot;].

:*According to Marc W. Herold's extensive database,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold/dossier |title=Dossier on Civilian Victims of United States' Aerial Bombing |publisher=Pubpages.unh.edu |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 3,100 and 3,600 civilians were directly killed by US [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] bombing and Special Forces attacks between 7 October 2001 and 3 June 2003. This estimate counts only &quot;impact deaths&quot;—deaths that occurred in the immediate aftermath of an explosion or shooting—and does not count deaths that occurred later as a result of injuries sustained, or deaths that occurred as an indirect consequence of the US airstrikes and invasion.

:*In an opinion article published in August 2002 in the magazine [[The Weekly Standard]], [[Joshua Muravchik]] of the [[American Enterprise Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2006/10/10/the_fp_memo_operation_comeback |title=The FP Memo: Operation Comeback – By Joshua Muravchik |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=10 October 2006 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioned Professor Herold's study entirely on the basis of one single incident that involved 25–93 deaths. He did not provide any estimate his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/565otmps.asp?pg=1 |title=The Prof Who Can't Count Straight |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=26 August 2002 |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*In a pair of January 2002 studies, Carl Conetta of the Project on Defense Alternatives estimates that &quot;at least&quot; 4,200–4,500 civilians were killed by mid-January 2002 as a result of the US war and airstrikes, both directly as casualties of the aerial bombing campaign, and indirectly in the resulting humanitarian crisis.

:*His first study, &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties?&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html |title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties? |publisher=Comw.org |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; released 18 January 2002, estimates that, at the low end, &quot;at least&quot; 1,000–1,300 civilians were directly killed in the aerial bombing campaign in just the 3 months between 7 October 2001 to 1 January 2002. The author found it impossible to provide an upper-end estimate to direct civilian casualties from the [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] bombing campaign that he noted as having an increased use of [[cluster bombs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html#1 |title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties – Bombers and cluster bombs |publisher=Comw.org |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this lower-end estimate, only Western press sources were used for hard numbers, while heavy &quot;reduction factors&quot; were applied to Afghan government reports so that their estimates were reduced by as much as 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201oef.html#appendix1 |title=Operation Enduring Freedom: Why a Higher Rate of Civilian Bombing Casualties – Appendix 1.

:*In his companion study, &quot;Strange Victory: A critical appraisal of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Afghanistan war&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201strangevic.html |title=Strange Victory: A critical appraisal of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Afghanistan war |publisher=Comw.org |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; released 30 January 2002, Conetta estimates that &quot;at least&quot; 3,200 more Afghans died by mid-January 2002, of &quot;starvation, exposure, associated illnesses, or injury sustained while in flight from war zones&quot;, as a result of the US war and airstrikes.

:*In similar numbers, a [[Los Angeles Times]] review of US, British, and Pakistani newspapers and international wire services found that between 1,067 and 1,201 direct civilian deaths were reported by those news organizations during the five months from 7 October 2001 to 28 February 2002. This review excluded all civilian deaths in Afghanistan that did not get reported by US, British, or Pakistani news, excluded 497 deaths that did get reported in US, British, and Pakistani news but that were not specifically identified as civilian or military, and excluded 754 civilian deaths that were reported by the Taliban but not independently confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/templates/misc/printstory.jsp?slug=la-060202bombs |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020604082553/http://www.latimes.com/templates/misc/printstory.jsp?slug=la-060202bombs |archivedate=4 June 2002 |title='The Americans . . .

Criticism of the War on Terror addresses the issues, morals, ethics, efficiency, economics, and other questions surrounding the War on Terror and made against the phrase itself, calling it a [[misnomer]]. The notion of a &quot;war&quot; against &quot;terrorism&quot; has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy / military objectives,&lt;ref name=&quot;Monbiot2003&quot;&gt;[[George Monbiot]], [http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2003/03/11/a-wilful-blindness &quot;A Wilful Blindness&quot;] (&quot;Those who support the coming war with Iraq refuse to see that it has anything to do with US global domination&quot;), ''monbiot.com'' (author's website archives), reposted from ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 March 2003. Retrieved 28 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; reduce [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired-FBI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/03/fbi-tried-to-co/|title=FBI Tried to Cover Patriot Act Abuses With Flawed, Retroactive Subpoenas, Audit Finds|last=Singel|first=Ryan|date=13 March 2008|work=Wired |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and infringe upon human rights. It is argued that the term war is not appropriate in this context (as in [[War on Drugs]]), since there is no identifiable enemy, and that it is unlikely international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richissin&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html|title=&quot;War on terror&quot; difficult to define|last=Richissin|first=Todd|date=2 September 2004|work=The Balitmore Sun|accessdate=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], note that &quot;[[Definition of terrorism|terrorism]]&quot; is not an enemy, but a tactic; calling it a &quot;war on terror&quot;, obscures differences between conflicts such as anti-occupation [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s and international [[mujahideen]]. With a military presence in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and its associated collateral damage [[Shirley Williams]] maintains this increases resentment and terrorist threats against the West.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Shirley. &quot;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1072390,00.html The seeds of Iraq's future terror]&lt;/cite&gt;&quot;.
