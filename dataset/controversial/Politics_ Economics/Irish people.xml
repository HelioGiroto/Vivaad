One reason, an improved image of what it means to be Irish according to the census experts, making Australians more proud to state their Irish ancestry.

The '''Irish people''' ({{lang-ga|Muintir na hÉireann}} or ''na hÉireannaigh''; [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]]: ''Airisch'' or ''Airish fowk'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/saintpatrick/sco/html/legacy/monasteries.shtml Saint Patrick's Journey – Monasteries] [[BBC]]. Retrieved 27 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismireland.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=68a26ff4-3226-4943-84f6-f3d45117ce5e Tourism Airlan – Corporate Plen 2008–2010] [[Tourism Ireland]]. Retrieved 27 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; are an [[ethnic group]] who originate in [[Ireland]], an island in northwestern Europe. Ireland has been populated for around 9,000 years (according to archaeological studies, see [[Prehistoric Ireland]]). The Irish people's earliest ancestors are recorded in legends &amp;ndash; they are claimed to be descended from groups such as the [[Nemedians]], [[Fomorians]], [[Fir Bolg]], [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|pages=xvi|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill and MacMillan|isbn= 0-7171-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]], a book of Irish mythology tells that [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]s were [[Scythian]] descendants.&lt;ref&gt;M. Virpiranta, Struggles of Sun against Thunder: Development of Druidism and Christianity. Perfect Paperback, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main groups that interacted with the Irish in the Middle Ages include the [[Picts]], [[Scottish People|Scots]], and the [[Vikings]]. Due to this contact, [[Icelanders]] are noted for having some Irish descent. The [[Anglo-Norman]] invasion of the High Middle Ages, the English plantations and the subsequent English rule of the country introduced the [[Normans]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] into Ireland. [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Picts]], [[Breton people|Bretons]], and small parties of [[Gauls]] and even [[Anglo-Saxons]] are known in Ireland from much earlier times.

There have been many notable Irish people throughout history. The 6th century Irish monk and missionary [[Columbanus]] is regarded as one of the &quot;fathers of Europe&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ColumbanusZenit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-22867|title=Pope Calls Irish Monk a Father of Europe|accessdate=2007-07-15|date=2007-07-11|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency|Zenit]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Saint Kilian|Kilian of Würzburg]] and [[Vergilius of Salzburg]]. The scientist [[Robert Boyle]] is considered the &quot;father of [[chemistry]]&quot;. Famous Irish explorers include [[Brendan the Navigator]], [[Robert McClure]], [[Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]]. By some accounts, the first European child born in North America had Irish descent on both sides;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smiley630&quot;&gt;Smiley, p 630&lt;/ref&gt; and an Irishman was the first European to set foot on American soil in [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbus' expedition]] of 1492.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus343&quot;&gt;MacManus, p 343-344&lt;/ref&gt;

Large populations of people of Irish ethnicity live in many western countries, particularly in English-speaking countries. Historically, emigration has been caused by politics, famine and economic issues. An estimated 50 to 80 million people make up the [[Irish diaspora]] today, which includes Great Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Argentina, [[Chile]], Jamaica, [[Trinidad]], South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, France, Germany and [[Brazil]]. The largest number of people of Irish descent live in the United States &amp;ndash; about ten times more than in Ireland itself.

===Prehistoric and legendary ancestors===
{{Main|Prehistoric Ireland|Early history of Ireland|}}
[[Image:Carrowmore tomb, Ireland.jpg|thumb|[[Carrowmore]] tomb, 6000 BC]]
During the past 8,000 years of inhabitation, Ireland has witnessed many different peoples arrive on its shores. The ancient peoples of Ireland — such as the creators of the [[Céide Fields]] and [[Newgrange]]—are almost unknown. Neither their languages nor terms they used to describe themselves have survived. As late as the middle centuries of the [[1st millennium]] the inhabitants of Ireland did not appear to have a collective name for themselves. 

Ireland itself was known by a number of different names, including [[Banba]], [[Fódla]], [[Ériu]] by the islanders, ''Iouerne'' and ''Hiverne'' to the [[Greeks]], and [[Hibernia]] to the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].

[[Scotland]] takes its name from Scoti/Scotti (singular Scotus/Scottus), which is the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name for Celtic inhabitants of Caledonia (Scotland) and Hibernia (Ireland). Other [[Latin]] names for people from Ireland in Classic and Mediaeval sources include [[Attacotti]] and [[Gael]]. This last word, derived from the [[Old Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwyddel'' &quot;raiders&quot;, was eventually adopted by the Irish for themselves. However, as a term it is on a par with [[Viking]], as it describes an activity (raiding, piracy) and its proponents, not their actual ethnic affiliations.

{{Irish people}}
The terms ''Irish'' and ''Ireland'' are derived{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} from the goddess [[Ériu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Erin {{failed verification|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of historical ethnic groups have inhabited the island, including the [[Airgialla]], [[Fir Ol nEchmacht]], [[Delbhna]], [[Fir Bolg]], [[Érainn]], [[Eóganachta]], [[Mairtine]], [[Conmaicne]], [[Soghain]], and [[Ulaid]]. In the cases of the Conmaicne, Delbhna, and perhaps Érainn, it can be demonstrated that the tribe took their name from their chief deity, or in the case of the Ciannachta, Eóganachta, and possibly the Soghain, a deified ancestor. This practise is paralleled by the [[Anglo-Saxon]] dynasties claims of descent from [[Woden]], via his sons [[Wecta]], Baeldaeg, [[Casere]] and [[Wihtlaeg]].

The [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mythographer]] [[Euhemerus]] originated the concept of [[Euhemerism]], which treats mythological accounts as a reflection of actual historical events shaped by retelling and traditional mores. In the 12th century, [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] [[bard]] and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] proposed that the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods were originally historical war leaders and kings, who later became cult figures, eventually set into society as gods. This view is in agreement with Irish historians such [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] and [[Francis John Byrne]]; the early chapters of their respective books, ''Early Irish history and mythology'' (reprinted 2004) and ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'' (3rd revised edition, 2001), deal in depth with the origins and status of many Irish ancestral deities.

One legend states that the Irish were descended from one [[Míl Espáine]], whose sons supposedly conquered Ireland around 1000 BC or later.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Manus, p 1 &amp; 7&lt;/ref&gt; The character is almost certainly a mere personification of a supposed migration by a group or groups from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] to Ireland. It is from this that the Irish were, as late as the 1800s, popularly known as &quot;[[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Irish historians, over the course of several centuries, created the [[genealogical]] [[dogma]] that all Irish were descendants of Míl, ignoring the fact that their own works demonstrated inhabitants in Ireland prior to his supposed arrival.

This [[doctrine]] was adapted between the 10th and 12th centuries, as demonstrated in the works of [[Eochaidh Ua Floinn]] (936–1004); [[Flann Mainistrech]] (died 25 November 1056); Tanaide (died c. 1075) and [[Gilla Cómáin mac Gilla Samthainde]] (fl. 1072). Many of their compositions were incorporated into the compendium [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]].

This tradition was enhanced and embedded in the tradition by successive historians such as [[Dubsúilech Ó Maolconaire]] (died 1270); [[Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin]] (d.1372); [[Giolla Íosa Mór Mac Fir Bhisigh]] (fl. 1390–1418); [[Pilip Ballach Ó Duibhgeannáin]] (fl. 1579–1590) and Flann Mac Aodhagáin (alive 1640). The first Irish historian who questioned the reliability of such accounts was [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] (murdered 1671).

===Genetics===
{{See also|Genetic history of Europe|Y-DNA haplogroups in European populations|Genetic history of the British Isles}}
The frequency of Y-DNA [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|haplogroup R1b]] (the most common haplogroup in Europe) is highest in the populations of [[Atlantic Europe]] and, due to European emigration, in North America, South America, and Australia. In Ireland and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] its frequency exceeds 90% and approaches 100% in [[Western Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roperld.com/YBiallelicHaplogroups.htm |title=Y-Chromosome Biallelic Haplogroups |publisher=Roperld.com |accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incidence of R1b is 70% or more in Celtic regions - [[Cumbria]] and [[Cornwall]] in England, northern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] (Celtic - [[Galicia (Spain)]] and [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] ), western France (Celtic - [[Brittany]]), and Celtic Countries - [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] in Britain. R1b's incidence declines gradually with distance from these areas but it is still common across the central areas of Europe. R1b is the most frequent haplogroup in Germany, and is common in southern [[Scandinavia]] and in [[Italy]]. This led to writers, such as [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] and [[Bryan Sykes]], to conclude that the majority of Irish people (and indeed all natives of the [[British Isles]]) primarily descend from an &quot;Iberian refugium&quot; [[population bottleneck]] dating back to the last [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Oppenheimer]], ''The Origins of the British – A Genetic Detective Story'', 2006, Constable and Robinson, ISBN 1-84529-158-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Bryan Sykes|first=Bryan|last=Sykes|title=Blood of the Isles: Exploring the Genetic Roots of Our Tribal History|year=2006|publisher=Bantam|isbn=0-593-05652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this haplogroup is now believed by some to have originated over 12,000 years more recently than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isogg.org/tree/ISOGG_HapgrpR09.html |title=ISOGG 2009 |publisher=Isogg.org |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus follows that Irish and many other R1b [[subclade]]s will be considerably younger than the maximum age of 18,000 years. The previous estimates, based on inaccurate dating methods (30,000+ years BP), made R1b and its subclades seem to be more useful indicators of the paleolithic era populations of western Europe than they actually are. According to recent 2009 studies by Bramanti et al. and Malmström et al. on [[mtDNA]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencemag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1176869 |title=Bramanti et al 2009 |doi=10.1126/science.1176869 |publisher=Sciencemag.org |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901694-7 |title=Malmström et al 2009 |publisher=Cell.com |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; related western European populations appear to be largely from the [[neolithic]] and not [[paleolithic]] era, as previously thought. There was discontinuity between [[mesolithic]] central Europe and modern European populations mainly due to an extremely high frequency of haplogroup U (particularly U5) types in mesolithic central European sites.

That there exists an especially strong genetic association between the Irish and the Basques, one even closer than the relationship between other west Europeans, was first challenged in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201482 | last1 = Alonso | author-separator =, | last2 = Flores | author-name-separator=  | first2 = C| year = 2005 | last3 = Cabrera | first3 = V | last4 = Alonso | first4 = A | last5 = Martín | first5 = P | last6 = Albarrán | first6 = C | last7 = Izagirre | first7 = N | last8 = De La Rúa | first8 = C | last9 = García | first9 = O | title = The Place of the Basques in the European Y-chromosome Diversity Landscape | url = http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v13/n12/full/5201482a.html | journal=European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 12| pages = 1293–1302 | pmid = 16094307 | display-authors = 1 | first1 = Santos }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 scientists began looking at the possibility of a more recent Mesolithic- or even Neolithic-era entrance of R1b into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=B. Arredi, E. S. Poloni and C. Tyler-Smith |chapter=The peopling of Europe |editor=Crawford, Michael H. |title=Anthropological genetics: theory, methods and applications |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2007 |page=394 |isbn=0-521-54697-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new study published in 2010 by Balaresque et al. implies either a Mesolithic- or Neolithic- (not Paleolithic) era entrance of R1b into Europe.&lt;ref name=Balaresque2010&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Balaresque|year=2010|title=A Predominantly Neolithic Origin for European Paternal Lineages|journal=PLoS.

Although the Welsh have a greater presumed [[Neolithic]] input than both the Irish and the Basques.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencemag&quot;/&gt; Genetic marker R1b averages from 83-89% amongst the [[Welsh people|Welsh]].

==History==

===Early expansion and the coming of Christianity===
{{See also|Early history of Ireland}}
[[Image:Clonard RC Church St Finian 07 Detail 2007 08 26.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Finnian of Clonard]] imparting his blessing to the &quot;[[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]&quot;]]

One Roman historian records that the Irish people were divided into &quot;sixteen different nations&quot; or tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus86&quot;&gt;MacManus, p 86&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional histories assert that the Romans never attempted to conquer Ireland, although it may have been considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus86&quot;/&gt; The Irish were not, however, cut off from Europe; they frequently raided the Roman territories,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus86&quot;/&gt; and also maintained trade links.&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most famous people of ancient Irish history are the [[High Kings of Ireland]], such as [[Cormac mac Airt]] and [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]], and the semi-legendary [[Fianna]]. The 20th century writer [[Seumas MacManus]] wrote that even if the Fianna and the [[Fenian Cycle]] were purely fictional, it would still be representative of the character of the Irish people:

The introduction of Christianity to the Irish people during the 5th century brought a radical change to the Irish people's foreign relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus89&quot;&gt;MacManus, p 89&lt;/ref&gt; The only military raid abroad recorded after that century is a presumed invasion of [[Wales]], which according to a Welsh manuscript may have taken place around the 7th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus89&quot;/&gt; In the words of Seumas MacManus:

{{imagequote|225|If we compare the history of Ireland in the 6th century, after Christianity was received, with that of the 4th century, before the coming of Christianity, the wonderful change and contrast is probably more striking than any other such change in any other nation known to history.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus89&quot;/&gt;}}
Following the conversion of the Irish to Christianity, Irish secular laws and social institutions remained in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Dalriada.png|thumb||The approximate area of the [[Dál Riata]] (shaded)]]
Around the 5th century, Gaelic language and culture spread from Ireland to what is now the west of Scotland via the [[Dál Riata]].  These Gaels soon spread out to most of the rest of the country.  &quot;[[Scoti]]&quot; is the name given by the Romans earlier in the millennium who encountered the inhabitants of Ireland. The Gaelic cultural and linguistic dominance of northern [[Great Britain|Britain]] is the origin of the name &quot;Scotland&quot;.  The territories of the Gaels and the Picts merged to form the [[Kingdom of Alba]]. The modern [[Scottish people]] have therefore been influenced historically by both the Irish people and the [[English people]] to the south. The [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Manx people]] also came under massive Gaelic influence in their history.

Irish missionaries such as [[Columba|Saint Columba]] brought [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Christianity to Pictish Scotland]]. The Irishmen of this time were also &quot;aware of the cultural unity of Europe&quot;, and it was the 6th century Irish monk [[Columbanus]] who is regarded as &quot;one of the fathers of Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColumbanusZenit&quot;/&gt; Another Irish saint, [[Aidan of Lindisfarne]], has been proposed as a possible [[patron saint]] of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Home-grown holy man: Cry God for Harry, Britain and... St Aidan |work=The Independent |location=London |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2008-07-21 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/homegrown-holy-man-cry-god-for-harry-britain-and-st-aidan-814057.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Saint Kilian|Saints Kilian]] and [[Vergilius of Salzburg|Vergilius]] became the patron saints of [[Würzburg]] in Germany and [[Salzburg]] in Austria, respectively.
Irish missionaries founded monasteries outside Ireland, such as [[Iona Abbey]], the [[Abbey of St Gall]] in Switzerland, and [[Bobbio Abbey]] in Italy.

Common to both the monastic and the secular bardic schools were Irish and [[Latin]]. With Latin, the early Irish scholars &quot;show almost a like familiarity that they do with their own Gaelic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 221&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence also that [[Hebrew]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] were studied, the latter probably being taught at Iona.&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 221-222&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|&quot;The knowledge of Greek&quot;, says Professor Sandys in his History of Classical Scholarship, &quot;which had almost vanished in the west was so widely dispersed in the schools of Ireland that if anyone knew Greek it was assumed he must have come from that country.&quot;'&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 215&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the time of [[Charlemagne]], Irish scholars had a considerable presence in the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish court]], where they were renowned for their learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;StanfordEriugena&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=John Scottus Eriugena |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2004-10-17 |accessdate=2008-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period was the 9th century [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality.&lt;ref name=&quot;StanfordEriugena&quot;/&gt; He was the earliest of the founders of [[scholasticism]], the dominant school of [[medieval philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gothic&quot;&gt;Toman, p 10: &quot;[[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] himself was... together with John Scotus Erigena (9th century), and [[Lanfranc]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (both 11th century), one of the founders of scholasticism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Greek theological tradition]], previously almost unknown in the Latin West.&lt;ref name=&quot;StanfordEriugena&quot;/&gt;

The influx of [[Viking]] raiders and traders in the 9th and 10th centuries resulted in the founding of many of Ireland's most important towns, including [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Dublin, [[Limerick]], and [[Waterford]] (earlier Gaelic settlements on these sites did not approach the urban nature of the subsequent Norse trading ports). The Vikings left little impact on Ireland other than towns and certain words added to the Irish language, but many Irish taken as slaves inter-married with the Scandinavians, hence forming a close link with the [[Icelandic people]]. In the Icelandic ''[[Laxdœla saga]]'', for example, &quot;even slaves are highborn, descended from the kings of Ireland.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, p 274&lt;/ref&gt; The first name of [[Njáll Þorgeirsson]], the chief protagonist of ''[[Njáls saga]]'', is a variation of the Irish name [[Neil]]. According to ''[[Eirik the Red's Saga]]'', the first European couple to have a child born in North America was descended from the Viking [[Kings of Dublin|Queen of Dublin]], [[Aud the Deep-minded]], and a Gaelic slave brought to Iceland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smiley630&quot; /&gt;

The arrival of the [[Anglo-Normans]] brought also the [[Wales|Welsh]], [[Flanders|Flemish]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Bretons]]. Most of these were [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]]d into [[Irish culture]] and polity by the 15th century, with the exception of some of the walled towns and [[the Pale]] areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; The [[Late Middle Ages]] also saw the settlement of Scottish [[gallowglass]] families of mixed [[Gaelic-Norse]] [[Picts|-Pict]] descent, mainly in the north; due to similarities of language and culture they too were assimilated.

===Surnames===
{{Main|Irish name}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
The Irish were among the first people in Europe to use surnames as we know them today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woulfe|first=Patrick|title=Sloinnte Gaedheal is Gall: Irish names and surnames |publisher=M. H. Gill &amp; son|year=1923|pages=xx|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nWFmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ireland+was+the+first+country+after+the+fall%22&amp;dq=%22ireland+was+the+first+country+after+the+fall%22&amp;cd=5|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very common for people of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin to have the English versions of their surnames beginning with &quot;O'&quot; or &quot;[[Family name#Scotland and Ireland|Mc]]&quot; (less frequently &quot;Mac&quot; and occasionally shortened to just &quot;Ma&quot; at the beginning of the name).

&quot;O'&quot;  comes from the Gaelic Ó which in turn came from Ua, which means &quot;[[grandson (son of a child)|grandson]]&quot;, or &quot;[[Kinship|descendant]]&quot; of a named person. Names that begin with &quot;O'&quot; include Ó Briain ([[O'Brien]]), Ó Cheallaigh ([[Kelly (name)|O'Kelly]]), Ó Conchobhair (O'Connor), Ó Domhnaill ([[O'Donnell]]), Ó Cuilinn ([[Cullen (surname)|Cullen]]), Ó Máille ([[O'Malley (surname)|O'Malley]]), Ó Néill ([[O'Neill (surname)|O'Neill]]), Ó Sé (O'Shea), Ó Súilleabháin ([[O'Sullivan]]), and Ó Tuathail ([[O'Toole (family)|O'Toole]]).

&quot;Mac&quot; or &quot;Mc&quot; means &quot;son&quot;. Names that begin with Mac or Mc include Mac Diarmada (MacDermott), Mac Cárthaigh ([[McCarthy (surname)|MacCarthy]]), Mac Domhnaill (MacDonnell), and Mac Mathghamhna (MacMahon, MacMahony, etc.). Mac is commonly anglicised Mc. However, &quot;Mac&quot; and &quot;Mc&quot; are not mutually exclusive, so, for example, both &quot;MacCarthy&quot; and &quot;McCarthy&quot; are used. While both &quot;Mac&quot; and &quot;O'&quot; prefixes are Gaelic in origin, &quot;Mac&quot; is more common in Scotland and in [[Ulster]] than in the rest of Ireland; furthermore, &quot;Ó&quot; is far less common in Scotland than it is in Ireland. The proper surname for a woman in Irish uses the feminine prefix nic (meaning daughter) in place of mac. Thus a boy may be called Mac Domhnaill whereas his sister would be called Nic Dhomhnaill or Ní Dhomhnaill - the insertion of 'h' follows the female prefix in the case of most consonants (bar H, L, N, R, &amp; T).

A son has the same surname as his father. A female's surname replaces Ó with Ní (reduced from Iníon Uí - &quot;daughter of the grandson of&quot;) and Mac with Nic (reduced from Iníon Mhic - &quot;daughter of the son of&quot;); in both cases the following name undergoes lenition. However, if the second part of the surname begins with the letter C or G, it is not lenited after Nic.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Thus the daughter of a man named Ó Maolagáin has the surname ''Ní Mhaolagáin'' and the daughter of a man named Mac Gearailt has the surname ''Nic Gearailt''. When anglicised, the name can remain O' or Mac, regardless of gender.

There are a number of Irish surnames derived from Norse personal names, including [[Clan Sweeney|Mac Suibhne]] (Sweeney) from Swein and McAuliffe from &quot;Olaf&quot;.  The name [[Cotter family|Cotter]], local to [[County Cork]], derives from the Norse personal name Ottir. The name [[Reynolds (surname)|Reynolds]] is an Anglicization of the Gaelic Mac Raghnaill, itself originating from the Norse names Randal or Reginald. Though these names were of Viking derivation some of the families who bear them appear to have had Gaelic origins.

&quot;Fitz&quot; is an old Norman French variant of the Old French word ''fils'' (variant spellings filz, fiuz, fiz, etc.), used by the Normans, meaning ''son''. The [[Normans]] themselves were descendants of [[Vikings]], who had settled in [[Normandy]] and thoroughly adopted the French language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Normans |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/NORMANS.HTM |author=Richard Hooker |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the Gaelic-Irish [[Fitzpatrick (name)|Fitzpatrick]] (Mac Giolla Phádraig) surname, all names that begin with Fitz – including [[FitzGerald]] (Mac Gearailt), [[Fitzsimons]] (Mac Síomóin/Mac an Ridire) and FitzHenry (Mac Anraí) – are descended from the initial Norman settlers. A small number of Irish families of [[Goidelic|Gaelic]] origin came to use a Norman form of their original  surname—so that Mac Giolla Phádraig became Fitzpatrick – while some assimilated so well that the Gaelic name was dropped in favor of a new, Hiberno-Norman form. Another common Irish surname of [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman Irish]] origin is the 'de' habitational prefix, meaning 'of' and originally signifying prestige and land ownership. Examples include de Búrca (Burke), de Brún, de Barra (Barry), de Stac (Stack), de Tiúit, de Faoite (White), de Londras (Landers), de Paor (Power). The Irish surname &quot;Walsh&quot; (in Gaelic ''Breathnach'') was routinely given to settlers of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] origin, who had come during and after the Norman invasion. The Joyce and Griffin/Griffith (Gruffydd) families are also of Welsh origin.

The Mac Lochlainn, Ó Maol Seachlainn, Ó Maol Seachnaill, Ó Conchobhair Mac Loughlin and Mac Diarmada Mac Loughlin families, all distinct, are now all subsumed together as MacLoughlin. The full surname usually indicated which family was in question, something that has being diminished with the loss of prefixes such as Ó and Mac. Different branches of a family with the same surname sometimes used distinguishing epithets, which sometimes became surnames in their own right. Hence the chief of the clan Ó Cearnaigh (Kearney) was referred to as An Sionnach (Fox), which his descendants use to this day. Similar surnames are often found in Scotland for many reasons, such as the use of a common language and mass Irish migration to Scotland in the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries.

===Late Medieval and Tudor Ireland===

[[Image:Gallowglass - Dürer.png|thumb||Gaelic Irish soldiers in the [[Low Countries]], from a drawing of 1521 by [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
The Irish people of the Late Middle Ages were active as traders on the European continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus343&quot;&gt;MacManus, p 343&lt;/ref&gt; They were distinguished from the English (who only used their own language or French) in that they only used [[Latin]] abroad—a language &quot;spoken by all educated people throughout Gaeldom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 340&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writer [[Seumas MacManus]], the explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] visited Ireland to gather information about the lands to the west,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus343&quot;/&gt; a number of Irish names are recorded on Columbus' crew roster preserved in the archives of [[Madrid]] and it was an Irishman named Patrick Maguire who was the first to set foot in the [[Americas]] in 1492;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacManus343&quot; /&gt; however, according to [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Morison]] and Miss Gould, who made a detailed study of the crew list of 1492, no Irish or English sailors were involved in the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Paolo Emilio Taviani|first=Paolo Emilio|last=Taviani|title=Christopher Columbus|page=376|isbn=0-85613-922-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An English report of 1515 states that the Irish people were divided into over sixty Gaelic lordships and thirty Anglo-Irish lordships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;&gt;Nicholls &lt;!--page number needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The English term for these lordships was &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; The Irish term &quot;''oireacht''&quot; referred to both the territory and the people ruled by the lord.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; Literally, it meant an &quot;assembly&quot;, where the [[Brehon]]s would hold their courts upon hills to arbitrate the matters of the lordship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; Indeed, the Tudor lawyer [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]] described the Irish people with respect to their laws:

{{blockquote|There is no people under the sun that doth love equal and indifferent (impartial) justice better than the Irish, or will rest better satisfied with the execution thereof, although it be against themselves, as they may have the protection and benefit of the law upon which just cause they do desire it.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;/&gt;}}
[[Image:Gaelic Poet.jpg|thumb|The Gaelic scribes and poets reflected the broad education of the Irish learned classes]]
Another English commentator records that the assemblies were attended by &quot;all the scum of the country&quot;—the labouring population as well as the landowners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; While the distinction between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;unfree&quot; elements of the Irish people was unreal in legal terms, it was a social and economic reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; Social mobility was usually downwards, due to social and economic pressures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; The ruling clan's &quot;expansion from the top downwards&quot; was constantly displacing commoners and forcing them into the margins of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt;

As a clan-based society, [[genealogy]] was all important.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; Ireland 'was justly styled a &quot;Nation of Annalists&quot;'.&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 352&lt;/ref&gt; The various branches of Irish learning—including law, poetry, history and genealogy, and medicine—were associated with hereditary learned families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jefferies&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Culture__Religion_in_Tudor_Ireland_1494-1558 |title=Culture and Religion in Tudor Ireland, 1494–1558 |last=Jefferies |first=Dr. Henry A |publisher=[[University College Cork]] |accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poetic families included the [[Ó Dálaigh|Uí Dhálaigh]] (Daly) and the [[MacGrath (disambiguation)|MacGrath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholls&quot;/&gt; Irish physicians, such as the O'Briens in [[Munster]] or the MacCailim Mor in the [[Western Isles]], were renowned in the courts of England, Spain, Portugal and the Low Countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref1&quot;&gt;MacManus, p 348&lt;/ref&gt; Learning was not exclusive to the hereditary learned families, however; one such example is [[Cathal Óg Mac Maghnusa|Cathal Mac Manus]], the 15th century diocesan priest who wrote the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jefferies&quot;/&gt; Other learned families included the [[Mac Aodhagáin|Mic Aodhagáin]] and [[Clan MacFhirbhisigh|Clann Fhir Bhisigh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jefferies&quot;/&gt; It was this latter family which produced [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]], the 17th century genealogist and compiler of the ''[[Leabhar na nGenealach]]''. (see also [[Irish medical families]]).

===Plantations===

{{See also|Plantations of Ireland|Ulster-Scots}}
After Ireland was subdued by England, the English—under [[James I of England]] (reigned 1603–1625), the [[Lord Protector]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653–1658), [[William III of England]] (reigned 1689–1702) and their successors—began the settling of Protestant Scottish and English [[colonist]]s into Ireland, where they settled most heavily in the northern [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]]. The [[Plantations of Ireland]], and in particular the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in the 17th century, introduced great numbers of Scottish, English as well as French [[Huguenot]]s as colonists.

Many Gaelic Irish were displaced during the 17th century plantations. Only in the major part of Ulster did the plantations of mostly Scottish prove long-lived; the other three provinces ([[Connacht]], [[Leinster]], and [[Munster]]) remained heavily [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Irish. Eventually, the [[Anglo-Irish]] and Protestant populations of those three provinces decreased drastically as a result of the political developments in the early 20th century in Ireland, as well as the Catholic Church's [[Ne Temere]] decree for mixed marriages, which obliged the non-Catholic partner to have the children raised as Catholics{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

===Enlightenment Ireland===

{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- The 1798 Uprising, at least, needs to be discussed --&gt;

There have been notable Irish scientists. The Anglo-Irish scientist [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) is considered the [[fathers of scientific fields|father]] of [[chemistry]] for his book ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'', written in 1661.&lt;ref&gt;''Boyle on Atheism'' by J.J. MacIntosh (University of Toronto Press ISBN 978-0-8020-9018-8), page 6&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle was an [[atomist]], and is best known for [[Boyle's Law]]. The [[hydrographer]] [[Rear Admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] [[Francis Beaufort]] (1774–1857), an Irish naval officer of Huguenot descent, was the creator of the [[Beaufort scale]] for indicating wind force. [[George Boole]] (1815–1864), the mathematician who invented [[Boolean algebra (disambiguation)|Boolean algebra]], spent the latter part of his life in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. The 19th century physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney|George Stoney]] introduced the idea and the name of the [[electron]]. He was the uncle of another notable physicist, [[George FitzGerald]].

[[Image:Jonathan swift.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jonathan Swift, one of the foremost prose satirists in the English language]]
The Irish bardic system, along with the [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]] and learned classes, were upset by the plantations, and went into decline. Among the last of the true bardic poets were [[Brian Mac Giolla Phádraig]] (c. 1580–1652) and [[Dáibhí Ó Bruadair]] (1625–1698). The Irish poets of the late 17th and 18th centuries moved toward more modern dialects. Among the most prominent of this period were [[Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta]], [[Peadar Ó Doirnín]], [[Art Mac Cumhaigh]], [[Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna]], and [[Seán Clárach Mac Domhnaill]]. Irish Catholics continued to receive an education in secret &quot;hedgeschools&quot;, in spite of the [[Penal laws]].&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 461&lt;/ref&gt; A knowledge of [[Latin]] was common among the poor Irish mountaineers in the 17th century, who spoke it on special occasions, while cattle were bought and sold in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] in the mountain market-places of [[County Kerry|Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, p 461-462&lt;/ref&gt;

For a comparatively small population of about 6 million people, Ireland made an enormous contribution to literature during the enlightenment. [[Irish literature]] encompasses the Irish and English languages. Notable [[Irish fiction|Irish writers]] include [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667–1745), [[Laurence Sterne]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], and [[Bram Stoker]].

It is predominately religion, historical, and political differences that divide the two communities of ([[Irish nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionism]]). Four polls taken between 1989 and 1994 revealed that when asked to state their national identity, over 79% of Northern Irish Protestants replied &quot;British&quot; or &quot;Ulster&quot; with 3% or less replying &quot;Irish&quot;, while over 60% of Northern Irish Catholics  replied &quot;Irish&quot; with 13% or less replying &quot;British&quot; or &quot;Ulster&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/research/nisas/rep5c2.htm |title=in, Social Attitudes in Northern Ireland: The Fifth Report |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in 1999 showed that 72% of Northern Irish Protestants considered themselves &quot;British&quot; and 2% &quot;Irish&quot;, with 68% of Northern Irish Catholics considering themselves &quot;Irish&quot; and 9% &quot;British&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/NINATID.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also revealed that 78% of Protestants and 48% of all respondents felt &quot;Strongly British&quot;, while 77% of Catholics and 35% of all respondents felt &quot;Strongly Irish&quot;.  51% of Protestants and 33% of all respondents felt &quot;Not at all Irish&quot;, while 62% of Catholics and 28% of all respondents felt &quot;Not at all British&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/BRITISH.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=2003-05-12 |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/IRISH.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames in the nine-county Province of [[Ulster]] tend to differ based on which community families originate from. Ulster Protestants tend to have either English or [[Scotland|Scottish]] surnames while Catholics tend to have Irish surnames, although this is not always the case.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} There are many Catholics in nine-county Ulster with surnames such as Adams, Emerson, Whitson, Livingstone, Hardy, Tennyson, Galbraith, McCausland, MacDonald (this surname is also common with Highland Roman Catholics in Scotland), Dunbar, Groves, Legge, Scott, Gray, Page, Stewart, Roberts, Rowntree, Henderson, et al., due to intermarriage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Religions===
In the Republic of Ireland, as of 2006, 3,681,446 people or about 86.83% of the population claim to be Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=19670 Population classified by religion for relevant censuses from 1881 to 2006 Summary], [[Central Statistics Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northern Ireland]] about 53.1% of the population are Protestant (21.1% Presbyterian, 15.5% Church of Ireland, 3.6% Methodist, 6.1% Other Christian) whilst a large minority are Catholic at approximately 43.8%, as of 2001.
&lt;!--Conversely, some Irish people would have at least some degree of English or Scottish ancestry. Irish of partial English background are most common in the [[Dublin]] area, descended from settlers in the [[English Pale]], along with a large but undetermined number of English Catholic [[recusant]]s who moved there to escape compulsory attendance at the [[Church of England]]. Scottish origin is especially common among Irish Catholics in [[Ulster]], and are mainly of [[gallowglass]] [[Scottish Highlander]] origin. The Irish surname &quot;Walsh&quot; was routinely given to settlers of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] origin.--&gt;

The 31st [[International Eucharistic Congress]] was held in [[Dublin]] in 1932, that year being the supposed 1,500th anniversary of Saint Patrick's arrival.

Lewis]], an Ulster Protestant, who is walking towards it, even though he never ultimately crosses the threshold?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Pearce |title=Editorial: The Celtic Enigma |journal=[[St. Austin Review]] |volume=7 |month=March/April |year=2007 |issue=2 |article=The Celtic Enigma |page=1 |publisher=Sapientia Press |location=Ave Maria University, Naples, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This has been a matter of concern over the last century for followers of nationalist ideologists such as [[DP Moran]].

===Irish Identity===
The question of Irish identity, and what defines Irishness, was elucidated by the prominent Irish nationalist [[Thomas Davis (Young Irelander)|Thomas Davis]]: 

{{Blockquote| It is not blood that makes you Irish but a willingness to be part of the Irish Nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://dublinstreets.osx128.com/dublin-statues-monuments/thomas-davis/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question of 'Irishness' is also examined in the Irish language film [[Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom]] in which a Chinese man learns [[Gaeilge|the Irish language]] before visiting Ireland, only to find no one understands him upon his arrival in Dublin. This would also be a classic case of being [[More Irish than the Irish themselves]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Europe===
Ireland joined the [[European Community]] in 1973, and Irish citizens became additionally [[Citizenship of the European Union|Citizens of the European Union]] with the [[Maastricht Treaty]] signed in 1992. This brought a further question for the future of Irish identity; whether Ireland was &quot;closer to Boston than to Berlin:&quot;

{{blockquote|History and geography have placed Ireland in a very special location between America and Europe... As Irish people our relationships with the United States and the [[European Union]] are complex. Geographically we are closer to Berlin than Boston. Spiritually we are probably a lot closer to Boston than Berlin. – [[Mary Harney]], [[Tánaiste]], 2000&lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p 185&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Celebrities===
{{main|List of Irish people}}

Ireland is well known for producing a wealth of famous figures in the arts and media. A number of important figures in science and technology and business have also come from Ireland. &lt;!-- If someone is to be included here please make certain that secondary sources are given showing they are notable in their field and for having come from Ireland rather than just that they are Irish playwrights etc. --&gt;

==Irish diaspora==

The Irish diaspora consists of Irish [[emigration|emigrants]] and their descendants in [[country|countries]] such as the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and nations of the [[Caribbean]] such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Barbados]]. These countries, known sometimes as the [[Anglosphere]], all have large minorities of Irish descent, who in addition form the core of the Catholic Church in those countries. People of Irish descent also feature strongly in Latin America, especially in [[Argentina]] and important minorities in [[Brazil]], Chile, and [[Mexico]]. In 1995, President [[Mary Robinson]] reached out to the &quot;70&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide who can claim Irish descent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irelandroots.com/roots4.htm |title=Ireland's Diaspora |publisher=Irelandroots.com |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the [[diaspora]] is believed to contain an estimated 80 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diaspora&quot;/&gt;

There are also large Irish communities in some mainland European countries, notably in Spain, France and Germany. Between 1585 and 1818, over half a million Irish departed Ireland to serve in the wars on the continent, in a constant emigration romantically styled the &quot;''[[Flight of the Wild Geese]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WildGeese&quot;&gt;[http://www.ospreypublishing.com/text_search.aspx?TextSearch=Wild%20Geese&amp;Group=1 The Wild Geese], Men-at-Arms 102, [[Osprey Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early years of the [[English Civil War]], a French traveller remarked that the Irish &quot;are better soldiers abroad than at home&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, p4&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Irish brigades in France and Spain fought in the [[War of Spanish Succession|Wars of the Spanish]] and [[War of Austrian Succession|Austrian Succession]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WildGeese&quot;/&gt; In the words of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], the Irish-born [[Duke of Wellington|&quot;Iron Duke&quot; of Wellington]], a notable representative of the [[Irish military diaspora]], &quot;Ireland was an inexhaustible nursery for the finest soldiers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p 832&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous cause of emigration was the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] of the late 1840s. A million are thought to have emigrated to [[Liverpool]] as a result of the famine.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross, ''Ireland: History of a Nation'', New Lanark: Geddes &amp; Grosset, 2002, p. 226. ISBN 1-84205-164-4&lt;/ref&gt; For both the Irish in Ireland and those in the resulting [[Irish diaspora|diaspora]], the famine entered [[folk memory]]&lt;ref&gt;The Famine that affected Ireland from 1845 to 1852 has become an integral part of folk legend. Kenealy, ''This Great Calamity'', p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a rallying point for various [[Irish nationalism|nationalist movements]].

People of Irish descent are the second largest self-reported ethnic group in the United States, after [[German American]]s. Nine of the signatories of the [[American Declaration of Independence]] were of Irish origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;irishpresidents&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://irishamericanheritage.com/ProcWebPages/1995.htm | title = Irish-American History Month, 1995 | publisher=irishamericanheritage.com | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was the sole Catholic signatory, [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], whose family were the descendants of [[Ely O'Carroll]], an Irish prince who had suffered under Cromwell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitmaryland.org/PressRoom/Pages/MarylandTracesitsIrishRootsar.aspx Maryland Traces Its Irish Roots], Maryland Office of Tourism&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, large numbers of Irish immigrants were conscripted into [[Irish regiments]] of the [[United States Army]] at the time of the [[Mexican-American War]]. The vast majority of the 4,811 Irish-born soldiers served in the U.S. Army, but some defected to the [[Mexican Army]], primarily to escape mistreatment by Anglo-Protestant officers and the strong anti-Catholic discrimination in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connaughton&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Beneath an Emerald Green Flag, The Story of Irish Soldiers in Mexico |url=http://www.irlandeses.org/sanpatriciosB.htm |author=Michael G. Connaughton |publisher=The Society for Irish Latin American Studies |month=September | year=2005 |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the ''San Patricios'', or [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]]—a group of Irish led by [[Galway]]-born [[John O'Riley]], with some [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|German]], [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Scottish]] and [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|American Catholics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Connaughton&quot;/&gt; They fought until their surrender at the decisive [[Battle of Churubusco]], and were executed outside [[Mexico City]] by the American government on 13 September 1847.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connaughton&quot;/&gt; The battalion is commemorated in Mexico each year on 12 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The San Patricios: Mexico's Fighting Irish |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/mexico/img/more_san_ps.html |author=Mark R. Day |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th and 19th centuries, 300,000 free emigrants and 45,000 convicts left Ireland to settle in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indigo.ie/~wildgees/australia/index.htm|title= Botany Bay  1791–1867|last= Ryan |first=Sean|year=2006 |publisher=Wild Geese Heritage Museum and Library Portumna, Co. Galway|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Australians of Irish descent are one of the largest self-reported ethnic groups in Australia, after English and Australian. In the 2006 [[Australian Census|Census]], 1,803,741 residents identified themselves as having Irish ancestry either alone or in combination with another ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2006 AUS | id = 0 | name = Australia | quick = on | accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However this figure does not include Australians with an Irish background who chose to nominate themselves as 'Australian' or other ancestries.  The Australian embassy in Dublin states that up to 30 percent of the population claim some degree of Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ireland.embassy.gov.au/dubl/relations.html |title=Australia- Ireland relationship – Australian Embassy |publisher=Ireland.embassy.gov.au |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that as many as 30,000 Irish people emigrated to Argentina between the 1830s and the 1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argentina&quot;/&gt; Today Irish-Argentines number over 1,000,000—about 1.25% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argentina&quot;/&gt; Some famous Argentines of Irish descent include [[Che Guevara]], former president [[Edelmiro Julián Farrell]], and admiral [[William Brown (admiral)|William Brown]]. There are people of Irish descent all over South America, such as the Chilean liberator [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and the Peruvian photographer [[Mario Testino]]. Although some Irish retained their surnames intact, others were assimilated into the Spanish vernacular. The last name ''O'Brien'', for example, became ''Obregón''.

People of Irish descent are also one of the largest self-reported ethnic groups in Canada, after [[English Canadian|English]], [[French Canadian|French]] and [[Scottish Canadian]]s. As of 2006, [[Irish Canadian]]s number around 4,354,155.&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadaCensus&quot;/&gt;
