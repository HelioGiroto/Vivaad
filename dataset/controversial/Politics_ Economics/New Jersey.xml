'''New Jersey''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-New Jersey.ogg|n|uː|_|ˈ|dʒ|ɜr|z|i}}) is a state in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Mid-Atlantic States|Middle Atlantic]] regions of the United States.  It is bordered on the north and east by the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]], on the southeast and south by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], on the west by [[Pennsylvania]], and on the southwest by [[Delaware]].  New Jersey is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|4th least extensive]], but the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|11th most populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|most densely populated]] of the [[50 United States]].  New Jersey lies mostly within the sprawling [[metropolitan area]]s of [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]].  It is also the third wealthiest U.S. state by 2011 [[median household income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/acsbr11-02.pdf|title=Median Household Income and Gini Index in the Past 12 Months by State and Puerto Rico: 2010 and 2011 - Page 5|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South Mountain View.jpg|thumb|[[South Mountain Reservation]] in [[Millburn, New Jersey|Millburn]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]].]]

The area was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 2,800 years, with historical tribes such as the [[Lenape]] along the coast. In the early 17th century, the Dutch and the [[Sweden|Swedes]] made the first European settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/state/NJ-History.htm |title=NJ History Outline |publisher=Usgennet.org |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] later seized control of the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/us/A0859954.html|title=Encyclopedia – New Jersey History|publisher= 2000–2011 Pearson Education, publishing as Infoplease|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; naming it the [[Province of New Jersey]]. It was granted as a colony to [[Sir George Carteret]] and [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]]. At this time, it was named after the largest of the British [[Channel Islands]], [[Jersey]], Carteret's birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwsuNvS8 |title=MSN Encarta |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

In the 19th century, factories in cities such as [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] helped to drive the [[Industrial Revolution]]. New Jersey's position at the center of the [[Northeast megalopolis]], between [[Boston]] and New York City to the northeast, and Philadelphia, [[Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] to the southwest, fueled its rapid growth through the process of [[suburbanization]] in the 1950s and beyond.

{{Main|Geography of New Jersey}}
{{See also|List of counties in New Jersey}}

New Jersey is bordered on the north and northeast by New York (parts of which are across the [[Hudson River]], [[Upper New York Bay]], the [[Kill Van Kull]], [[Newark Bay]], and the [[Arthur Kill]]); on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; on the southwest by [[Delaware]] across [[Delaware Bay]]; and on the west by [[Pennsylvania]] across the [[Delaware River]].

New Jersey can be thought of as five regions, based on natural geography and population. Northeastern New Jersey, the [[Gateway Region]], lies within the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]], and some residents commute into the city to work.  Northwestern New Jersey, or the &quot;[[Skylands Region|Skylands]]&quot;, is, compared to the northeast, more wooded, rural, and mountainous. The &quot;[[Jersey shore|Shore]]&quot;, along the Atlantic Coast in the central-east and southeast, has its own natural, residential, and lifestyle characteristics owing to its location by the ocean. The [[Delaware Valley]] includes the southwestern counties of the state, which reside within the [[Philadelphia Metropolitan Area]]. The fifth region is the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]] in the interior of the southern part. Covered rather extensively by mixed pine and oak forest, it has a much lower population density than much of the rest of the state.

New Jersey also can be broadly divided into three geographic regions: [[North Jersey]], [[Central Jersey]], and [[South Jersey]]. Some New Jersey residents do not consider Central Jersey a region in its own right, but others believe it is a separate geographic and cultural area from the North and South.

The federal [[Office of Management and Budget]] divides New Jersey's counties into seven [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s, including sixteen counties in the New York City or Philadelphia metro areas. Four counties have independent metro areas, and Warren County is part of the Pennsylvania-based [[Lehigh Valley]] metro area. (See [[Metropolitan Statistical Areas of New Jersey]] for details.)

It is also at the center of the [[Northeast megalopolis]].

Additionally, the New Jersey Commerce, Economic Growth, &amp; Tourism Commission divides the state into six distinct regions to facilitate the state's tourism industry. The regions are:
*[[Gateway Region]], encompassing [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], and [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]].
*[[Skylands Region]], encompassing [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]], and [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]].
*[[Shore Region]], encompassing [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]] and [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]].
*[[Delaware River Region]], encompassing [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]], [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]], [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]], [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester County]], and [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]].
*[[Greater Atlantic City Region]], encompassing [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]].
*[[Southern Shore Region]], encompassing [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]] and [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]].

[[High Point (New Jersey)|High Point]], in [[Montague Township, New Jersey|Montague Township]], [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], is the highest elevation, at {{convert|1803|ft|m}}. The [[New Jersey Palisades|Palisades]] are a line of steep cliffs on the lower west side of the [[Hudson River]].

Major [[List of New Jersey rivers|rivers]] include the [[Hudson River|Hudson]], [[Delaware River|Delaware]], [[Raritan River|Raritan]], [[Passaic River|Passaic]], [[Hackensack River|Hackensack]], [[Rahway River|Rahway]], [[Musconetcong River|Musconetcong]], [[Mullica River|Mullica]], [[Rancocas River|Rancocas]], [[Manasquan River|Manasquan]], [[Maurice River|Maurice]], and [[Toms River|Toms]] rivers.

[[Sandy Hook (New Jersey)|Sandy Hook]], along the eastern coast, is a popular recreational beach. It is a barrier [[spit (landform)|spit]] and an extension of the [[Barnegat Peninsula]] along the state's Atlantic Ocean coast.

[[Long Beach Island]] (&quot;LBI&quot;), a [[barrier island]] along the eastern coast, has popular recreational beaches. The primary access point to the island is by a single bridge connection to the mainland. [[Barnegat Lighthouse]] is on the northern tip.

Areas managed by the [[National Park Service]] include:
*[[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]]
*[[Delaware National Scenic River]]
*[[Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area]]
*[[Ellis Island National Monument]]
*[[Gateway National Recreation Area]] in Monmouth County
*[[Great Egg Harbor River]]
*[[Morristown National Historical Park]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]]
*[[New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route]]
*[[New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve]]
*[[Thomas Edison National Historical Park]] in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]]

Prominent geographic features include:
* [[Delaware Water Gap]]
* [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge]]
* [[New York - New Jersey Highlands|The Highlands]]
* [[New Jersey Meadowlands]]
* [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]]
* [[South Mountain Reservation|South Mountain]]

===Climate===
As with many other geographic features, New Jersey's climate divides into regions. The south, central, and northeast parts of the state have a humid [[mesothermal]] climate, while the northwest has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[microthermal]]), with slightly cooler temperatures due to higher elevation. New Jersey receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm|title=united states annual sunshine map|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summers are typically hot and humid, with statewide average high temperatures of {{convert|82|-|88|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|60|-|70|F|C}}; however, temperatures exceed {{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=on}} on average 25 days each summer, though rarely exceed {{convert|100|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Winters are usually cold, with average high temperatures of {{convert|38|-|46|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|26|-|32|F|C}} for most of the state, but temperatures could, for brief interludes, be as low as {{convert|10|-|20|F|C}} and sometimes rise to {{convert|50|-|60|F|C}}. Northwestern parts of the state have slightly colder winters with average temperatures just below freezing. Spring and autumn may feature wide temperature variations, with lower humidity than summer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Weather.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Average annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|43|to|51|in|mm}}, uniformly spread through the year. Average snowfall per winter season ranges from {{convert|10|-|15|in|cm}} in the south and near the seacoast, {{convert|15|-|30|in|cm}} in the northeast and central part of the state, to about {{convert|40|-|50|in|m}} in the northwestern highlands, but this varies from year to year. Precipitation falls on an average of 120 days a year, with 25 to 30 thunderstorms, most of which occur during the summer.

During winter and early spring, New Jersey can experience &quot;[[nor'easter]]s&quot;, which are capable of causing [[blizzards]] or flooding throughout the northeastern United States. [[Hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s (such as Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/mhx/Floyd/Impacts.php|title=Hurricane Floyd Impacts|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[tornado]]es, and earthquakes are rare.

==History==
{{Main|History of New Jersey}}

Around 180 million years ago, during the [[Jurassic Period]], New Jersey bordered North Africa. The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Around 18,000 years ago, the [[Ice Age]] resulted in [[glacier]]s that reached New Jersey. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind [[Glacial Lake Passaic|Lake Passaic]], as well as many rivers, swamps, and gorges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatswamp.org/GSW/Geology.htm Geological History] by Great Swamp Watershed Association. Retrieved December 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey was originally settled by Native Americans, with the [[Lenape|Lenni-Lenape]] being dominant at the time Europeans arrived. The Lenape were loosely organized groups that practiced small-scale agriculture (mainly based on [[maize|corn]]) in order to increase their largely mobile hunter-gatherer society in the region surrounding the [[Delaware River]], the lower [[Hudson River]], and western [[Long Island Sound]]. The Lenape society was divided into [[matrilinear]] clans that were based upon common female ancestors. These clans were organized into three distinct [[phratry|phratries]] identified by their animal sign: Turtle, [[Turkey (bird)|Turkey]], and [[Wolf]].  They first encountered the Dutch in the early 17th century, and their primary relationship with the Europeans was through [[fur trade]].

===Colonial era===
{{Main|Colonial history of New Jersey}}

The Dutch became the first Europeans to lay claim to lands in New Jersey.  The Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] consisted of parts of modern [[Middle Atlantic]] states.  Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the [[Lenape]], [[Dutch West India Company]] policy required their colonists to purchase land which they settled. The first to do so was [[Michael Reyniersz Pauw|Michiel Pauw]] who established a patronship named [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]] along the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] which eventually became the [[Bergen, New Netherland|Bergen]]. [[Peter Minuit]]'s purchase of lands along the [[Delaware River]] establish the colony of [[New Sweden]]. The entire region became a territory of [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1664, when an English fleet under the command of Colonel [[Richard Nicolls]] sailed into what is today [[New York Harbor]] and took control of [[Fort Amsterdam]], annexing the entire province.

During the [[English Civil War]] the [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] of [[Jersey]] remained loyal to the Crown and gave sanctuary to the King. It was from the Royal Square in St. Helier that [[Charles II of England]] was first proclaimed King in 1649, following the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. The North American lands were divided by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who gave his brother, the Duke of York (later [[James II of England|King James II]]), the region between [[New England]] and [[Maryland]] as a [[proprietary colony]] (as opposed to a [[royal colony]]). James then granted the land between the [[Hudson River]] and the [[Delaware River]] (the land that would become New Jersey) to two friends who had remained loyal through the [[English Civil War]]: [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]] and [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton|Lord Berkeley of Stratton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrnussbaum.com/readingcomp/njcolony.htm|title=New Jersey Colony Reading Comprehension|publisher=MrNussbaum.com|accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was named the [[Province of New Jersey]].

Since the state's inception, New Jersey has been characterized by [[multiculturalism|ethnic and religious diversity]]. New England [[Congregationalists]] settled alongside Scots [[Presbyterians]] and [[Dutch Reformed]] migrants.  While the majority of residents lived in towns with individual landholdings of {{convert|100|acre|ha|0}}, a few rich proprietors owned vast estates.  English [[Quakers]] and [[Anglicans]] owned large landholdings. Unlike [[Plymouth Colony]], [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and other colonies, New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from Europe. New Jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era, and commercial farming only developed sporadically.  Some townships, such as [[Burlington, New Jersey|Burlington]] on the Delaware River and [[Perth Amboy]], emerged as important [[port]]s for shipping to New York City and Philadelphia. The colony's fertile lands and tolerant religious policy drew more settlers, and New Jersey boasted a population of 120,000 by 1775.

Settlement for the first 10 years of English rule took place along [[Hackensack River]]  and [[Arthur Kill]] - settlers came primarily from New England. Unlike other colonies that were settled by immigrants from Europe, New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of settlement from communities already established on the North American continent. March 18, 1673, Berkeley sold his half of the colony to [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in England, who settled the Delaware Valley region as a Quaker colony. ([[William Penn]] acted as trustee for the lands for a time.)  New Jersey was governed very briefly as two distinct provinces, [[East Jersey|East]] and [[West Jersey]], for 28 years between 1674 and 1702, at times part of the [[Province of New York]] or [[Dominion of New England]].

In 1702, the two provinces were reunited under a royal, rather than a proprietary, governor. [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], Lord Cornbury, became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. Lord Cornbury was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land, so in 1708 he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused those governors of favoritism to New York. [[Lewis Morris (1671-1746)|Judge Lewis Morris]] led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth pg 30–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary War era===
{{Main|New Jersey during the American Revolution}}

New Jersey was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]]. The [[wikisource:New Jersey Constitution of 1776|New Jersey Constitution of 1776]] was passed July 2, 1776, just two days before the [[Second Continental Congress]] declared American Independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. It was an act of the Provincial Congress, which made itself into the state Legislature. To reassure neutrals, it provided that it would become void if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain.
[[Image:Princetonwashington.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]] rallying his troops at the [[Battle of Princeton]]]]
New Jersey representatives [[Richard Stockton (1730–1781)|Richard Stockton]], [[John Witherspoon]], [[Francis Hopkinson]], [[John Hart (New Jersey politician)|John Hart]], and [[Abraham Clark]] were among those who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], British and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times, and several pivotal battles took place in the state.  Because of this, New Jersey today is often referred to as &quot;The Crossroads of the Revolution.&quot;  The winter quarters of the revolutionary army were established there twice by General [[George Washington]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], which was called the military capital of the revolution.

On December 25, 1776, the [[Continental Army]] under [[George Washington]] crossed the [[Delaware River]].  After the crossing, he surprised and defeated the unprepared [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian troops]] in the [[Battle of Trenton]]. Slightly more than a week after victory at [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], on January 3, 1777, American forces gained an important victory by stopping [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis's]] charges at the [[Second Battle of Trenton]].  By evading Cornwallis's army, Washington made a surprise attack on [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and successfully defeated the British forces there.  [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s painting of ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' became an icon of the Revolution.

American forces under Washington met the forces under General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] at the [[Battle of Monmouth]] in an indecisive engagement in June 1778. Washington attempted to take the British column by surprise; when the British army attempted to flank the Americans, the Americans retreated in disorder. The ranks were later reorganized and withstood the British charges.

In the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in [[Nassau Hall]] at [[Princeton University]], making [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] the nation's capital for four months. It was there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the war.

On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], which was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey, as it prevented New York and Pennsylvania from charging and keeping tariffs on goods imported from Europe. On November 20, 1789, the state became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

The 1776 [[New Jersey State Constitution]] gave the vote to &quot;all inhabitants&quot; who had a certain level of wealth. This included women and blacks, but not married women, because they could not own property separately from their husbands. Both sides, in several elections, claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of &quot;petticoat electors&quot; (entitled to vote or not); on the other hand, both parties passed Voting Rights Acts. In 1807, the legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal ''white male'' suffrage, excluding paupers. (This was less revolutionary than it sounds: the &quot;constitution&quot; was itself only an act of the legislature.)&lt;ref&gt;Klinghoffer and Elkis (&quot;The Petticoat Electors: Women’s Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776–1807&quot;, ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 12, no. 2 (1992): 159–193.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
{{Main|New Jersey in the 19th century}}
On February 15, 1804, New Jersey became the last northern state to abolish new [[slavery]] and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery. This led to a gradual scale-down of the slave population.  By the close of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed [[freedmen]].  New Jersey voters initially refused to ratify the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the United States' black population.

In 1844, the second [[New Jersey State Constitution|state constitution]] was ratified and brought into effect. Counties thereby became districts for the State Senate, and some realignment of boundaries (including the creation of [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]]) immediately followed. This provision was retained in the 1947 Constitution, but was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1962 by the decision [[Baker v. Carr]]. While the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution, the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him, or to the people, and it gave him a three-year term, but he could not succeed himself.

Unlike the Revolutionary War, no Civil War battles took place within the state. However, throughout the course of the Civil War, over 80,000 from New Jersey enlisted in the Northern army to defeat the Southern [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].
[[File:Edison in his NJ laboratory 1901.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Edison]] in his laboratory, West Orange, New Jersey, 1901]]
New Jersey was one of the few Northern states (the others being [[Delaware]] and [[Kentucky]]) to select a candidate other than [[Abraham Lincoln]] twice in national elections, and sided with [[Stephen Douglas]] (1860) and [[George B. McClellan]] (1864) during their campaigns. McClellan later became governor (1878–81). During the Civil War, the state was led first by Republican Governor [[Charles Smith Olden]], then by Democrat [[Joel Parker]].

In the [[Industrial Revolution]], cities like [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] grew and prospered. Previously, the economy had been largely agrarian, which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil. This caused a shift to a more industrialized economy, one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk. [[List of inventors|Inventor]] [[Thomas Edison]] also became an important figure of the Industrial Revolution, having been [[List of Edison patents|granted 1,093 patents]], many of which for inventions he developed while working in New Jersey. Edison's facilities, first at [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]] and then in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]], are considered perhaps the first [[research center]]s in the U.S. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare in the world to have electric lighting. Transportation was greatly improved as [[locomotive|locomotion]] and [[steamboat]]s were introduced to New Jersey.

[[Iron ore|Iron]] mining was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century. [[Bog iron]] pits in the Southern New Jersey Pinelands were among the first sources of iron for the new nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/nj/county/atlantic/Pinelands/BogIron.htm |title=Usgennet.org |publisher=Usgennet.org |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mining|Mines]] such as Mt. Hope, Mine Hill and the [[Rockaway Valley]] Mines created a thriving industry.  Mining generated the impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need for the [[Morris Canal]]. [[Zinc]] mines were also a major industry, especially the [[Sterling Hill Mine]].

===20th century===
{{Main|New Jersey in the 20th century}}
[[Image:0328Jersey City Statue of Liberty.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Jersey City]]]]
Through both World Wars, New Jersey was a center for war production, especially in naval construction. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers were all made in this state. In addition, [[Fort Dix, New Jersey|Fort Dix]] (1917) (originally called &quot;Camp Dix&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dix.army.mil/history/history.htm |title=Our History |publisher=Dix.army.mil |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}{{fact|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camp Merritt (New Jersey)|Camp Merritt]] (1917)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.com/~cacunithistories/camp_merritt.htm |title=Camp Merritt |publisher=Freepages.military.rootsweb.com |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Camp Kilmer]] (1941)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/camp-kilmer.htm |title=Camp Kilmer |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were all constructed to house and train American soldiers through both World Wars. New Jersey also became a principal location for defense in the [[Cold War]]. Fourteen [[Project Nike|Nike Missile]] stations were constructed, especially for the defense of New York City and [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]'', a motor torpedo boat commanded by Lt. (j.g.) [[John F. Kennedy]] in World War II, was built at the Elco Boatworks in Bayonne. The aircraft carrier [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)]] was briefly docked at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne in the 1950s before she was sent to Kearney to be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cv6.org/1946/scrap/default.htm |title=CV6.org |publisher=CV6.org |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the world's first nuclear-powered cargo ship, the [[NS Savannah]], was launched at Camden.

New Jersey prospered through the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The first [[Miss America]] Pageant was held in 1921 in Atlantic City, the first drive-in movie was shown in 1933 in Camden, and the [[Holland Tunnel]] opened in 1927. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the state offered begging licenses to unemployed residents,&lt;ref&gt;Gerdes, Louise I. The 1930s, Greenhaven Press, Inc., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; the zeppelin airship [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] crashed in flames over [[Lakehurst, New Jersey|Lakehurst]], and the [[SS Morro Castle]] beached itself near Asbury Park after going up in flames while at sea.

In 1951, the New Jersey Turnpike opened, permitting fast travel by car and truck between North Jersey (and metropolitan New York) and South Jersey (and metropolitan Philadelphia).

In the 1960s, [[race riot]]s erupted in many of the industrial cities of North Jersey. The first race riots in New Jersey occurred in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] on August 2, 1964. Several others ensued in 1967, in [[1967 Newark riots|Newark]] and [[1967 Plainfield riots|Plainfield]]. Other riots followed the assassination of [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in April 1968, just as in the rest of the country. A riot occurred in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] in 1971.

As a result of an order from the New Jersey Supreme Court to fund schools equitably, the New Jersey legislature reluctantly passed an income tax bill in 1976. Prior to this bill, the state had no income tax.&lt;ref name=tws29decf3354&gt;{{cite news

==Economy==
[[Image:1999 NJ Proof.png|thumb|right|The New Jersey State Quarter, released in 1999, with a depiction of [[Washington Crossing the Delaware]].]]
The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] estimates that New Jersey's gross state product in 2010 was $487 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrelarchive/2005/gsp1005.pdf Bureau of Economic Analysis]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GDP by State|url=http://greyhill.com/gdp-by-state|publisher=Greyhill Advisors|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012|01}}, the state's unemployment rate is 9%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Area Unemployment Statistics|url=http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstch.htm|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=N.J. unemployment rate dips to 9 percent, lowest in nearly 3 years|accessdate=March 30, 2012|newspaper=NJ.com|date=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affluence===
Its [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|per capita gross state product]] in 2008 was $54,699, 2nd in the U.S. and above the national per capita gross domestic product of $46,588.&lt;ref name = BEAState&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2009/11%20November/D-Pages/1109dpg_k.pdf|title=Selected Regional Estimates|date=January 11, 2009|publisher=BEA.gov|accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its per-capita income was the third highest in the nation with $51,358.&lt;ref name = BEAState/&gt;  The state also has the highest percentage of millionaire households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/01/nj_has_most_millionaires_in_co.html |title=&quot;New Jersey has most millionaires in country,&quot; Associated Press, January 10, 2008 |publisher=Nj.com |date=January 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ranked 2nd in the nation by the number of places with per capita incomes above national average with 76.4%. Nine of New Jersey's counties are in the wealthiest 100 of the country.

===Fiscal policy===
New Jersey has seven tax brackets for determining [[income tax]] rates. The rates range from 1.4 to 8.97%. The standard [[sales tax]] rate is 7%, applicable to all retail sales unless specifically exempt by law. Exemptions include most food items for at-home preparation, medicines, clothing (except fur items), footwear, and disposable paper products for use in the home. Approximately 30 New Jersey municipalities are designated as [[Urban Enterprise Zone]]s and shoppers are charged a 3½% tax rate, half of the rate charged outside the UEZs. Sections of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] are examples of communities that are subject to the lower sales tax rate.
New Jersey has the highest tax rate of all 50 states with residents paying a total of $68 billion in state and local taxes annually with a per capita burden of $7,816 at a rate of 12.9% of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://247wallst.com/2011/07/21/108558/3/ |title=States Where People Pay The Most (And Least) In Taxes – 24/7 Wall St |publisher=24/7 Wall St. |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All [[real property]] located in the state is subject to [[property tax]] unless specifically exempted by statute. New Jersey does not assess an intangible personal property tax, but it does impose an [[inheritance tax]].

===Federal taxation disparity===
New Jersey has the highest disparity of any state in the United States between what it gives to the federal government and what it receives. In fiscal year 2005, New Jersey taxpayers gave the federal government $77 billion, while only receiving $55 billion. This difference is higher than any other state and means that for every $1 New Jersey taxpayers send to Washington, the state only receives $0.61 in return. This calculation is applied correctly after making the federal government deficit neutral, as sometimes the federal government spends more than it receives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/347.html link Chart of State to Federal government spend/receive ratios], [[Tax Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2005}}, New Jersey has never been above 48th in rank for per capita federal spending (with a rank of 50th for the majority of that time) since 1982, while being second or third in per capita federal taxes paid to Washington.

New Jersey runs into deficits frequently and has one of the highest tax burdens in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/44.html |title=link Tax Burdens in New Jersey |publisher=Taxfoundation.org |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors for this include the large federal tax liability which is not adjusted for New Jersey's higher cost of living and Medicaid funding formulas. As shown by the study, incomes tend to be higher in New Jersey, which puts those in higher tax brackets especially vulnerable to the [[alternative minimum tax]].

===Industries===
[[Image:Cranberrys beim Ernten.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Cranberry]] harvest.]]

New Jersey's economy is centered on the pharmaceutical industry, the financial industry, chemical development, telecommunications, food processing, electric equipment, printing and publishing, and tourism. New Jersey's agricultural outputs are nursery stock, horses, vegetables, fruits and nuts, seafood, and dairy products. New Jersey ranks second among states in [[blueberry]] production, third in [[cranberry|cranberries]] and [[spinach]], and fourth in [[bell peppers]], [[peach]]es, and [[lettuce|head lettuce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Judith H.

Although New Jersey is home to many energy-intensive industries, its energy consumption is only 2.7% of the U.S. total, and its carbon dioxide emissions are only 0.8% of the U.S. total. Its comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to nuclear power. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], nuclear power dominates New Jersey’s electricity market, typically supplying more than one-half of State generation. New Jersey has three nuclear power plants, including the [[Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station]], which came online in 1969 and is the oldest operating nuclear plant in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=NJ |title= EIA State Energy Profiles: New Jersey |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey has a strong scientific economy. New Jersey is home to major pharmaceutical firms such as [[Johnson and Johnson]], [[Sanofi-Aventis]], [[Novartis]], [[Pfizer]], [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], [[Hoffman-LaRoche]], and [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]. New Jersey is home to major telecommunications firms such as [[Verizon Wireless]], [[Avaya]], [[Alcatel-Lucent]], and [[AT&amp;T Communications]]. Furthermore, New Jersey draws upon its large and well-educated labor pool which also supports the myriad of industries that exist today.

New Jersey is the ultimate [[bedroom community]] since the state is right next to New York City and Philadelphia. Thus, there is a strong service economy in New Jersey serving residents who work in New York City or Philadelphia. Some of these industries include retail sales, education and real estate. 

Shipping is a strong industry in New Jersey because of the state's strategic location, the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] the busiest on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. The [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]] was the world's first [[container port]] and is one of the world's largest container ports. New Jersey also has a strong presence in chemical development, refining, and food processing operations.

New Jersey hosts several business headquarters, including twenty-four [[Fortune 500]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2007/states/NJ.html |title=Fortune 500 2007 – States: New Jersey |date=March 30, 2007 |accessdate=May 30, 2007 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]] is noted for having one of the highest retail sales per person ratios in the nation. Several New Jersey counties such as [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset]] (7), [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]] (10), [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon]] (13), [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] (21), [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth]] (42) counties are ranked among the [[highest-income counties in the United States]]. Four others are also in the top 100.

===Natural resources===
New Jersey's greatest natural resource is its location, which has made the state a crossroads of commerce. Other commercial advantages include its extensive transportation system, which puts one quarter of all United States consumers within overnight delivery range. Lake and seaside resorts such as Atlantic City have contributed to New Jersey's rank of fifth among the states in revenues from tourism.

Almost half of New Jersey is wooded. The chief tree of the northern forests is the oak. A large part of the southern section is in pine. Jersey oak has been used extensively in shipbuilding.

The mineral resources in New Jersey are small. The state, however, does rank high in smelting and refining minerals from other states. Some mining activity does still take place in the area in and around the [[Franklin Furnace]], which was long a center of [[zinc]] production (see [[New Jersey Zinc Company]]).

New Jersey is second in the nation in [[Solar power in New Jersey|solar power]] installations, enabled by one of the country's most favorable [[net metering]] policies, and the renewable energy certificates program. The state has more than 10,000 solar installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtechling.com/2011/08/solar-shore-jersey-hits-10000-installations/ Solar Shore: Jersey Hits 10,000 Installations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary of Education Rick Rosenberg, appointed by Governor [[Jon Corzine]], created the Education Advancement Initiative (EAI) to increase College admission rates by 10% for New Jersey's high school students, decrease dropout rates by 15%, and increase the amount of money devoted to schools by 10%. Rosenberg retracted this plan when criticized for taking the money out of healthcare to fund this initiative.

In 2010 the state government paid all of the teachers' premiums for health insurance.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp100422&quot;/&gt;

Census data reveal that New Jersey spent more per each public school student than any other state except New York in 2009, amounting to $16,271 spent per pupil, with 41% of the revenue derived from state sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://247wallst.com/2011/05/31/the-states-that-spend-the-most-and-least-on-each-student/3/|title=The States That Spend The Most And Least On Each Student|publisher=2011 24/7 Wall St|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[toll road]] carries interstate traffic between [[Delaware]] and New York, and the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in general. Commonly referred to as simply &quot;the Turnpike,&quot; it is known for its numerous rest-areas named after prominent New Jerseyans as diverse as inventor [[Thomas Edison]]; United States Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]]; [[Presidents of the United States|United States Presidents]] [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]; writers [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[Joyce Kilmer]], and [[Walt Whitman]]; patriot [[Molly Pitcher]]; Red Cross advocate [[Clara Barton]]; and football coach [[Vince Lombardi]].

The [[Garden State Parkway]], or simply &quot;the Parkway,&quot; carries more in-state traffic and runs from the town of [[Montvale, New Jersey|Montvale]] along New Jersey's northern border to its southernmost tip at [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]] for {{convert|172.4|mi|km}}. It is the trunk that connects the New York metropolitan area to Atlantic City and is consistently one of the safest roads in the nation.  With a total of 15 travel lanes and 6 shoulder lanes, the [[Driscoll Bridge]] on the Parkway, spanning the [[Raritan River]] in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], is the widest motor vehicle bridge in the world by number of lanes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/1492|title=Garden State Parkway opens world's widest bridge – 15 lanes|publisher=TOLLROADSnews, Peter Samuel|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of the busiest.

New Jersey is connected to New York City via various bridges and tunnels. The [[George Washington Bridge]] at 300,000 vehicles per day carries the heaviest load of motor vehicle traffic of any bridge in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;panynj.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=bridge&gt;[http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061024/BIZ/610240312/-1/NEWS03 George Washington Bridge turns 75 years old: Huge flag, cake part of celebration], ''[[Times Herald-Record]]'', October 24, 2006. &quot;The party, however, will be small in comparison to the one that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey organized for 5,000 people to open the bridge to traffic in 1931. And it won't even be on what is now the world's busiest bridge for fear of snarling traffic.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] in [[Bergen County]] to the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood in [[Upper Manhattan]] in New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway carrying I-95, US 1, and US 9. The [[Lincoln Tunnel]] connects to [[Midtown Manhattan]] carrying New Jersey State Route 495 and the [[Holland Tunnel]] connects to [[Lower Manhattan]] carrying I-78. These are the three major Hudson River crossings that see heavy vehicular traffic. New Jersey is also connected to [[Staten Island]] by three bridges. From the southernmost to northernmost; the [[Outerbridge Crossing]], [[Goethals Bridge]], and [[Bayonne Bridge]].

Other expressways in New Jersey include the [[Atlantic City Expressway]], the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]], [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]], [[Interstate 78 in New Jersey|Interstate 78]], [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]], [[Interstate 95 (New Jersey)|Interstate 95]], [[Interstate 195 (New Jersey)|Interstate 195]], [[Interstate 278]], [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|Interstate 280]], [[Interstate 287]], [[Interstate 295 (Delaware-New Jersey-Pennsylvania)|Interstate 295]], and [[Interstate 676]]. Other major roadways include [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|U.S. 1]], [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. 9]], [[New Jersey Route 17]], [[New Jersey Route 4]], and [[U.S. Route 46]].

New Jersey has [[interstate compact]]s with all three neighboring states. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], the [[Delaware River Port Authority]] (with Pennsylvania), and the [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]] (with Delaware) operate most of the major transportation routes into and out of New Jersey. Bridge tolls are collected in one direction only – it is free to cross into New Jersey, but motorists must pay when exiting the state. Exceptions to this are the [[Dingman's Ferry Bridge]] and the [[Delaware River – Turnpike Toll Bridge]] where tolls are charged both ways. The Washington Crossing and [[Scudders Falls Bridge|Scudders Falls (on I-95)]] bridges near Trenton, as well as Trenton's [[Calhoun Street Bridge|Calhoun Street]] and [[Lower Trenton Bridge|Bridge Street (&quot;Trenton Makes&quot;)]] bridges, are toll-free. In addition, * [[Riverton-Belvidere Bridge]], [[Northampton Street Bridge]], [[Riegelsville Bridge]], and [[Upper Black Eddy-Milford Bridge]] are free Delaware River bridges into and out of NJ.
* [[Uhlerstown-Frenchtown Bridge]] – ([[Route 12 (New Jersey)|NJ 12]])
* [[Lumberville-Raven Rock Bridge]] – (pedestrian)
* [[Centre Bridge-Stockton Bridge]] – ([[Pennsylvania State Route 263|PA 263]] / [[County Route 523 (New Jersey)|CR 523]])

New Jersey is one of only two states (along with [[Oregon]]) where all fuel dispensing stations are required to sell gasoline full-service to customers. It is unlawful for a customer to serve him/herself.

New Jersey's Highway Maintenance Program was rated &quot;Extremely Poor&quot; by [[Reason Foundation]]'s  &quot;17th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems.&quot;

===Airports===

[[Image:NewarkIntAirport.jpg|right|thumb|New York City skyline from Continental (now United) Terminal C in [[Newark Liberty Airport]].]]
[[Newark Liberty International Airport]] is one of the busiest airports in the United States. Operated by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], which runs the other two major airports in the [[New York metropolitan area]] ([[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and [[LaGuardia Airport]]), it is one of the main airports serving the New York City area. [[United Airlines]] is the facility's largest tenant, operating an entire terminal at Newark, which it uses as one of its primary [[Airline hub|hubs]]. [[FedEx Express]] operates a large cargo hub. The adjacent [[Newark Liberty International Airport (NJT station)|Newark Airport railroad station]] provides access to the trains of [[Amtrak]] and [[New Jersey Transit]] along the [[Northeast Corridor Line]].

Two smaller commercial airports, [[Atlantic City International Airport]] and [[Trenton-Mercer Airport]], also operate in other parts of New Jersey. [[Teterboro Airport]], in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], is a [[general aviation]] airport popular with private and corporate aircraft, due to its proximity to New York City. [[Millville Municipal Airport]], in [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]], is a [[general aviation]] airport popular with private and corporate aircraft, due to its proximity to the shore.

===Rail and bus===

[[Image:Hudson bergen exchange place.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] trains in [[Jersey City]], New Jersey.]]

The [[New Jersey Transit]] Corporation (NJ Transit) operates extensive rail and bus service throughout the state. NJ Transit is a state-run corporation that began with the consolidation of several private bus companies in North Jersey. In the early 1980s, it acquired the commuter train operations of [[Conrail]] that connect towns in northern and central New Jersey to New York City. NJ Transit has eleven lines that run throughout different parts of the state. Most of the trains start at various points in the state and most end at either [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]], in New York City, or [[Hoboken Terminal]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]. NJ Transit began service between Atlantic City and [[Lindenwold, New Jersey|Lindenwold]] in 1989 and extended it to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, in the 1990s.

NJ Transit also operates three light rail systems in the state. The [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] connects [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] to [[North Bergen, New Jersey|North Bergen]], with planned expansion into [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] communities. The [[Newark Light Rail]] is the only [[Rapid transit|subway]] system entirely in the state, but it is only partially underground. Its Main Line connects [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station]] in [[Downtown Newark]] with outer parts of the city, ending at Grove Street station in [[Bloomfield, New Jersey|Bloomfield]]. The Broad Street Line of the subway, the first component of the [[Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link]], connects [[Newark Broad Street Station]] to [[Newark Penn Station]]. The last of the three light rail lines is the [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] which connects [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]].

The [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] is a subway and above-ground railway which links [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]] and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] with New York City. The PATH operates four lines that connect various points in North Jersey and New York. The lines all terminate in [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] or [[Manhattan]] in New York City.

The [[Port Authority Transit Corporation|PATCO]] High Speedline links [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]] and [[Philadelphia]]. PATCO operates a single elevated and subway line that runs from [[Lindenwold, New Jersey|Lindenwold]] to Center City Philadelphia. PATCO operates stations in Lindenwold, [[Voorhees, New Jersey|Voorhees]], [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]], [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]], [[Haddon Township, New Jersey|Haddon Township]], [[Collingswood, New Jersey|Collingswood]], and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], along with four stations in Philadelphia.

[[Amtrak]] also operates numerous long-distance passenger trains in New Jersey to and from neighboring states and around the country. In addition to the Newark Airport connection, other major Amtrak railway stations include [[Trenton (Amtrak station)|Trenton Rail Station]], [[Metropark (NJT station)|Metropark]], and the grand historic [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark Penn Station]].

[[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] also has two lines that operate into New Jersey. The [[Trenton Line (SEPTA)|Trenton Line]] terminates at the [[Trenton Transit Center]], and the [[West Trenton Line (SEPTA)|West Trenton Line]] terminates at the [[West Trenton Rail Station]] in [[Ewing, New Jersey|Ewing]].

[[AirTrain Newark]] is a monorail connecting the Amtrak/NJ Transit station on the [[Northeast Corridor]] to the airport's terminals and parking lots.

Some private bus carriers still remain in New Jersey. Most of these carriers operate with state funding to offset losses and state owned buses are provided to these carriers of which [[Coach USA]] companies make up the bulk. Other carriers include private charter and tour bus operators that take gamblers from other parts of New Jersey, New York City, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Delaware]] to the casino resorts of Atlantic City.

===Ferries===

On the [[Delaware Bay]], the [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]] operates the [[Cape May-Lewes Ferry]]. The agency also operates ferries between [[Fort Mott (New Jersey)]] and [[Fort Delaware]] and Fort DuPont in [[Delaware]]. The [[Delaware River Port Authority]] operates the [[RiverLink Ferry]] between the [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] waterfront and [[Penn's Landing]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania.

In the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], [[NY Waterway|New York Waterway]] has ferry terminals at [[Belford, New Jersey|Belford Harbor]], [[Jersey City]], [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] and [[Weehawken]], and [[Edgewater Landing]]. There are [[Ferry slip|slips]] are at [[Port Liberte]], Liberty Harbor, [[Exchange Place (Jersey City)|Exchange Place]] in Jersey City, [[Weehawken Port Imperial|Port Imperial]] and [[Lincoln Harbor]] in Weehawken, [[Hoboken Terminal]] and [[14th Street (Hoboken)|14th Street]] in Hoboken. [[Manhattan]] terminals are located at [[Wall Street]]/Pier 11, [[Battery Park City Ferry Terminal|Battery Park City (BPC)]] or [[West Midtown Ferry Terminal]]. [[Liberty Water Taxi]] in [[Jersey City]] has ferries from [[Paulus Hook]] and [[Liberty State Park]] to (BPC). [[Statue Cruises]] has service from Liberty State Park and [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], including [[Ellis Island]]. (Although there is a bridge from Ellis Island to the park built for renovations on the island it is not open for public use.) [[SeaStreak]] offers services from the [[Raritan Bayshore]] to Manhattan and during [[New York Mets|the Met's]] season to [[Shea Stadium]]. The ferries on leave from [[Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey|Atlantic Highlands]] and two terminals in [[Highlands, New Jersey|Highlands]]. Ferry service from [[Keyport, New Jersey|Keyport]] and [[Perth Amboy]] have been also been proposed. Service from [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] at [[Newark Bay]] is proposed in conjunction with re-development  plans on the shore near [[Jersey Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison |first=Brianne |url=http://www.globest.com/news/1091_1091/newjersey/168147-1.html |title=$2B MXD Planned for Elizabeth Waterfront |publisher=Globest.com |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
{{main|Government of New Jersey}}
{{Further|Governor of New Jersey|Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey|New Jersey Legislature|2006 New Jersey State Government Shutdown}}

===Executive===
&lt;!--spills over into History too much IMO. This should be about modern day structure---&gt;
The position of Governor of New Jersey has been considered one of the most powerful in the nation. Until 2010 the governor was the only statewide elected office in the state appointed numerous government officials. Formerly, an Acting Governor was even more powerful as he simultaneously served as President of the [[New Jersey State Senate]], thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process. In 2002 and 2007, President of the State Senate [[Richard Codey]] held the position of Acting Governor for a short time, and from 2004 to 2006 Codey became a long-term Acting Governor due to [[Jim McGreevey]]'s resignation. A 2005 amendment to the state Constitution prevents the Senate President from becoming Acting Governor in the event of a permanent gubernatorial vacancy without giving up her or his seat in the state Senate. [[Chris Christie]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) is the [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]].

The governor's mansion is [[Drumthwacket]], located in [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]].

Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kim Guadagno]] was elected the first [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey]] and took office on January 19, 2010.  She was elected on the Republican ticket with Governor-Elect [[Chris Christie]] in the November 2009 NJ gubernatorial election. The position was created as the result of a [[Constitutional amendment]] to the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] passed by the voters on November 8, 2005 and effective as of January 17, 2006.

===Legislative===
[[Image:New Jersey State House.jpg|thumb|The [[New Jersey State House]] is topped by its golden dome in [[Trenton, NJ|Trenton]].]]
The current version of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] was adopted in 1947. It provides for a [[bicameral]] [[New Jersey Legislature]], consisting of an [[upper house]] [[New Jersey Senate|Senate]] of 40 members and a [[lower house]] [[New Jersey General Assembly|General Assembly]] of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one State Senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; State Senators are elected in the years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms.

New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years. (The others are [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Virginia]].) New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year following each federal Presidential election year. Thus, the last year when New Jersey elected a Governor was 2009; the next gubernatorial election will occur in 2013, with future gubernatorial elections to take place in 2017, 2021, 2025, etc.

===Judicial===
The [[New Jersey Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm |title=Supreme Court of New Jersey |publisher=Judiciary.state.nj.us |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a Chief Justice and six Associate Justices. All are appointed by the Governor with the [[advice and consent]] of a majority of the membership of the State Senate. Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70.

Most of the day-to-day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the '''Municipal Courts''', where simple traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard.

More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the '''[[New Jersey Superior Court|Superior Court]]''' for each county. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the Governor with the [[advice and consent]] of a majority of the membership of the State Senate. Each judge serves an initial seven-year term, after which he or she can be reappointed to serve until age 70.

New Jersey's judiciary is unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and [[equity (law)|equity]], like its neighbor [[Delaware]] but unlike most other U.S. states. The [[New Jersey Superior Court]] is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level.

The Superior Court also has an '''[[New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division|Appellate Division]]''', which functions as the state's intermediate [[appellate court]]. Superior Court judges are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice.

There is also a '''Tax Court''', which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Tax Court judges hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation. They also hear appeals on decisions made by the Director of the Division of Taxation on such matters as state income, sales and business taxes, and homestead rebates. Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Tax Court judges are appointed by the Governor for initial terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. There are 12 Tax Court judgeships.

===Counties===
{{Further|List of New Jersey counties}}
New Jersey is divided into 21 counties; 13 date from the colonial era. New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692; the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones; most recently [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] in 1857. New Jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county officials are called &quot;Freeholders,&quot; governing each county as part of its own [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]]. The number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum, and must consist of three, five, seven or nine members.

Depending on the county, the executive and [[legislative]] functions may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate branches of government. In 16 counties, members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis, with each Freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments. In the other 5 counties ([[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]] and [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer]]), there is a directly elected [[County Executive]] who performs the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains a legislative and oversight role. In counties without an Executive, a County Administrator (or County Manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration of county functions.

===Municipalities===
New Jersey has 566 municipalities; the number was 567 before [[Pahaquarry Township, New Jersey|Pahaquarry Township]] was absorbed by [[Hardwick Township, New Jersey|Hardwick Township]] in 1997. Unlike states in the west and south, all New Jersey land is part of a municipality. In 2008, Governor [[Jon Corzine]] proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10,000 people, to encourage mergers to reduce administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90090911 |title=Small Towns in N.J. Told to Merge or Face Cuts |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, the Local Unit Alignment Reorganization and Consolidation Commission (LUARC) began a study of about 40 small communities in South Jersey to decide which ones might be good candidates for consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20090529_N_J__town_mergers_could_start_in_18_months.html &quot;N.J. town mergers could start in 18 months&quot;]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} by Jan Hefler, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', May 29, 2009. Retrieved on May 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of government====
When the types of government were devised in the 19th century, the intention was that [[city (New Jersey)|cities]] would be large built-up areas, with progressively smaller [[Borough (New Jersey)|boroughs]], [[Town (New Jersey)|towns]], and [[Village (New Jersey)|villages]]; the rural areas in between would be relatively large [[township (New Jersey)|townships]]. This is still often true, although [[Shrewsbury Township, New Jersey|Shrewsbury Township]] has been divided over the years; today it is less than a square mile, consisting only of a single housing development. Some townships – notably [[Brick Township, New Jersey|Brick]], [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton]], [[Middletown Township, New Jersey|Middletown]], and [[Toms River, New Jersey|Toms River]] – have, without changing their boundaries, become large stretches of [[suburbia]], as populous as cities, often focused around shopping centers and highways rather than traditional downtowns and main streets.

Short Hills, Murray Hill, and many other locations in New Jersey are not municipalities but rather neighborhoods, with no exact boundaries. Often the cluster of houses, the traditional neighborhood, the postal district, and the [[Census designated place]] will differ.

====Forms of government====
{{NJmunigov}}
The five types of municipality differ mostly in name. Originally, each type had its own form of government but more modern forms are available to any municipality, even though the original type is retained in its formal name. Only boroughs can (but are not required to) have the &quot;borough form&quot; of government.

Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented. This began with the [[Walsh Act (New Jersey)|Walsh Act]], enacted in 1911 by the [[New Jersey Legislature]], which provided for a 3- or 5-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis. This was followed by the [[1923 Municipal Manager Law]], which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced [[Council-Manager government]] with an (ideally apolitical) appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs.

The [[Faulkner Act (New Jersey)|Faulkner Act]], originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: [[Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council)|Mayor-Council]], [[Faulkner Act (Council-Manager)|Council-Manager]], [[Faulkner Act (Small Municipality)|Small Municipality]], and [[Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council-Administrator)|Mayor-Council-Administrator]]. The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the Council; seats selected at-large, by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the Council or elected directly by voters. Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey's residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters. Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a [[Special Charter (New Jersey)|Special Charter]] with the approval of the [[New Jersey Legislature]].

While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government, they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government, or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public. For example, though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type, [[Loch Arbour, New Jersey|Loch Arbour]] is the only one remaining with the village form of government. The other three villages – [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey|Ridgefield Park]] (now with a Walsh Act form), [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]] (now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter) and [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]] (now operates under a [[Special Charter (New Jersey)|Special Charter]]) – have all migrated to other non-village forms.

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of New Jersey}}

====Social attitudes and issues====
Socially, New Jersey is considered one of the more liberal states in the nation. Polls indicate that 60% of the population are self-described as [[pro-choice]], although a majority are opposed to late trimester and [[Partial Birth Abortion]] and public funding of Abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=17086 |title=Poll says majority of Americans opposed to abortion funding in health care bill :: Catholic News Agency (CNA) |publisher=Catholic News Agency |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/50State2005/50StateAbortion0805SortedbyState.htm |title=SurveyUSA Pro-Life vs. Pro Choice Sorted by State |publisher=Surveyusa.com |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll, a plurality supported [[same-sex marriage]] 49% to 43% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6776022&amp;rss=rss-wpvi-article-6776022 |title=Poll: NJ voters support gay marriage |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, New Jersey enacted a [[Domestic partnerships in New Jersey|domestic partnership law]], which is available to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples aged 62 and over. During 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court voted 4 to 3 that state lawmakers must provide the rights and benefits of marriage to gay and lesbian couples. Moreover, effective February 19, 2007, New Jersey became the third state in the U.S. (the other two being [[Civil unions in Connecticut|Connecticut]] and [[Civil unions in Vermont|Vermont]]) to offer [[civil union]]s to same-sex couples, conferring over 850 rights, privileges and responsibilities of marriage; legislators declined, however, to use the term &quot;marriage&quot; for same-sex unions. Thus, three separate government-recognized relationships are now in effect in the Garden State: domestic partnerships, civil unions, and marriage. {{See also|LGBT rights in New Jersey}}

New Jersey also has some of the most stringent gun-control laws in the U.S. These include bans on assault firearms, hollow-nose bullets and even slingshots. No gun offense in New Jersey is graded less than a felony. [[BB guns]] and black powder guns are all treated as modern firearms. New Jersey does not recognize out-of-state gun licenses and aggressively enforces its own gun laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nraila.org/statelawpdfs/NJSL.pdf NRAILA.org]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In past federal elections, New Jersey was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] bastion, but recently has become a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold.  Currently, [[New Jersey Democratic State Committee|New Jersey Democrats]] have majority control of both houses of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] (Senate, 22–18, and Assembly, 48–32), both [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats, and 8 out of the state's 13 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. The state had a Republican governor from 1994 to 2002, as [[Christie Todd Whitman]] won twice with vote percentages of 47 and 49 percent.

In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Republican [[Chris Christie]] defeated incumbent Democrat [[Jon Corzine]]. Because each candidate for lieutenant governor runs on the same ticket as the party's candidate for governor, the current Governor and Lieutenant Governor are members of the Republican Party. The governor's appointments to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party. (The 2009 Attorney General appointee is a Democrat.)

In federal elections, the state leans heavily towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. For many years in the past, however, it was a Republican stronghold, having given comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the close elections of [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]], [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], and [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]]. New Jersey was a crucial [[swing state]] in the elections of [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], and [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]. The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was [[Clifford P. Case]] in 1979. ([[Nicholas F. Brady]] was appointed a U.S. Senator by Governor [[Thomas Kean]] in 1982 and served for eight months, after [[Harrison A. Williams]] resigned the Senate seat following the [[Abscam]] investigations.)

The state's Democratic strongholds include [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]], [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] (including [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], the state's largest city), [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] (including [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], the state's second-largest city); [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]] (especially around [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]), [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], and [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] (including [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], the state's fourth-largest city).

The suburban northwestern and southeastern counties of the state are reliably Republican: Republicans have support along the coast in [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]] and in the mountainous northwestern part of the state, especially [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]]. Other suburban counties, especially [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] and [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]] had the majority of votes go to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In the 2008 election, President [[Barack Obama]] won New Jersey with approximately fifty-seven percent of the vote, compared to [[John McCain|McCain's]] forty-one percent. Independent candidate [[Ralph Nader]] garnered less than one percent of the vote.

About one-third of the state's counties are considered &quot;swing&quot; counties, but some go more one way than others. For example, [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]], the same is true with [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]], with a highly populated Hispanic Democratic south (including [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], the state's third-largest city) and a rural, Republican north. Other &quot;swing&quot; counties like [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]], and [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]] tend to go Republican, as they also have population in conservative areas.

To be eligible to vote in a U.S. election, all New Jerseyans are required to start their residency in the state 30 days prior to an election and register 29 days prior.

====Capital punishment====
{{Main|Capital punishment in New Jersey}}
On December 17, 2007, Governor Jon Corzine signed into law a bill that would eliminate the death penalty in New Jersey. New Jersey is the first state to pass such legislation since [[Iowa]] and [[West Virginia]] eliminated executions in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gYppYSKRwPNEaUjbxFuUGpS_iouQD8TJ9TBO1 Google.com]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} Hester Jr., Tom (2007) ''N.J.

===Collegiate sports teams===
{{See also|List of college athletic programs in New Jersey, USA}}
New Jerseyans' collegiate allegiances are predominately split among the three major [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] programs in the state – the [[Rutgers University#Athletics|Rutgers University]] (New Jersey's largest state university) [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Scarlet Knights]], the [[Seton Hall Pirates|Seton Hall University]] (which is the state's largest [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman]] Catholic university) [[Seton Hall Pirates|Pirates]], and the [[Princeton University#Athletics|Princeton University]] (the state's [[Ivy League]] university) [[Princeton Tigers|Tigers]]. Both Rutgers and Seton Hall compete in the [[Big East Conference]], and the rivalry between the two teams has always been an intense one. Rutgers and Princeton likewise have an intense rivalry – stemming from the [[1869 college football season|first intercollegiate football game]] in 1869 – though the two schools have not met on the football field since 1980. They continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.

Rutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its excellent football and women's basketball programs. The university is planning a large expansion to the on-campus [[Rutgers Stadium]] – to accommodate the rising number of fans – and the teams play in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway]], which is adjacent to the New Brunswick campus. The university also fields rising basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers' fan base is mostly derived from the western parts of the state and [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]], not to mention its alumni base, which is the largest in the state.

Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, also has campuses in Camden and Newark (in addition to its main campus in New Brunswick). The [[Rutgers-Camden]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers-Camden#Athletics|Scarlet Raptors]]. The [[Rutgers-Newark]] athletic teams are called the [[Rutgers-Newark#Athletics|Scarlet Raiders]]. The Scarlet Raiders and the Scarlet Raptors both compete within NCAA [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]].

Seton Hall, unlike Rutgers, does not field a football team. Its basketball team, however, has been one of the most storied programs in the Big East, and it plays its home games at the state-of-the-art [[Prudential Center]], located in downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. The Pirates, while lacking as large an alumni base as the state university, have a large well of support in the predominately Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the [[Jersey Shore]].

The state's other Division I schools include the [[Monmouth Hawks|Monmouth University Hawks]] (West Long Branch), the [[NJIT Mens Soccer|New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders]] (Newark), the [[Rider University#Athletics|Rider University Broncs]] (Lawrenceville), and the [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey#Athletics|Saint Peter's College Peacocks and Peahens]] (Jersey City).

[[Fairleigh Dickinson Knights|Fairleigh Dickinson University]] competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the [[Northeast Conference]] and NCAA Division I. The College at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the [[Middle Atlantic Conferences#Freedom Conference|Middle Atlantic Conferences' Freedom Conference]] and NCAA Division III.

Among the various Division III schools in the state, the [[Stevens Tech Ducks football|Stevens Institute of Technology]] Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men's lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.

===Television and film===
{{Main|Television and film of New Jersey}}

Motion picture technology was developed by [[Thomas Edison]], with much of his early work done at his [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]] laboratory. [[Edison's Black Maria]] was the first motion picture studio. [[America's first motion picture industry]] started in 1907 in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]] and the first studio was constructed there in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortleefilm.org/ |title=Fort Lee Film Commission &amp;#124; Fort Lee, NJ |publisher=Fortleefilm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DuMont Laboratories]] in [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], developed early sets and made the first broadcast to the private home.

A number of television shows and films have been filmed in New Jersey. Since 1978, the state has maintained a Motion Picture and Television Commission to encourage filming in-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njfilm.org/ |title=NJ Motion Picture &amp; Television Commission |publisher=Njfilm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey has long offered tax credits to television producers. Governor Christopher Christie suspended the credits in 2010, but the [[New Jersey State Legislature]] in 2011 approved the restoration and expansion of the tax credit program. Under bills passed by both the state Senate and Assembly, the program offers 20 percent tax credits (22% in [[urban enterprise zone]]s) to television and film productions that shoot in the state and meet set standards for hiring and local spending.&lt;ref name = crewsback&gt;{{Cite news    | last = Wright   | first = E.

==Culture==
===General===
Like every state, New Jersey has its own [[Cuisine of New Jersey|cuisine]], [[Religion in New Jersey|religious communities]], [[List of museums in New Jersey|museums]], and [[:Category:Halls of Fame in New Jersey|halls of fame]].

New Jersey is the birthplace of modern inventions such as: [[FM radio]], the motion picture camera, the [[lithium battery]], the [[light bulb]], [[transistor]]s, and the electric train. Other New Jersey creations include: the drive-in movie, the cultivated [[blueberry]], [[cranberry sauce]], the postcard, the [[boardwalk]], the [[zipper]], the [[phonograph]], [[saltwater taffy]], the dirigible, the [[watermelon|seedless watermelon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njinvent.njit.edu/1992/pioneer_inductees_1992/andrews.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423223438/http://www.njinvent.njit.edu/1992/pioneer_inductees_1992/andrews.html|archivedate=April 23, 2008 |title=New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame |publisher=Njinvent.njit.edu |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[David Bushnell|first use]] of a [[submarine]] in warfare, and the ice cream cone.
[[Image:Dinner Freehold NJ.jpg|thumb|A diner in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]]]]

There are mineral museums in Franklin and Ogdensburg.

[[Diner]]s are common in New Jersey. The state is home to many diner manufacturers and has more diners than any other state: over 600. There are more diners in the state of New Jersey than any other place in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.50states.com/facts/newjerse.htm |title=New Jersey Facts and Trivia |publisher=50states.com |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey is the only state without a state song. &quot;I'm From New Jersey&quot; is incorrectly listed on many websites as being the New Jersey State Song, but wasn't even a contender when in 1996 the [[New Jersey Arts Council]] submitted their suggestions to the [[New Jersey Legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutnewjersey.com/editorials/stateSong_3_15_04.php |title=The History of the New Jersey State Song? |publisher=Aboutnewjersey.com |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends and ghosts===
A long-circulated legend says a creature, the [[Jersey Devil]] or the Leeds Devil, terrorizes the population of the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]]. The [[New Jersey Devils]] are named for this mythical creature. New Jersey is also home to several other legends, such as the ghost of [[Annie's Road]] – a section of Riverview Drive between Totowa Road and Union Boulevard in [[Totowa, New Jersey|Totowa]], which is said to be haunted by a &quot;Lady in White&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Weird N.J.: Your Travel Guide to New Jersey's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets| last=Moran | first=Mark | last2=Sceurman | first2=Mark | year=2009 | publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. | pages=216–217 | isbn=978-1-4027-6685-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the haunted and demon-possessed [[Clinton Road]] in [[West Milford, New Jersey|West Milford]]. Cooper Road in [[Middletown, New Jersey|Middletown]] is said to be haunted by strange, ghostly people who jump out from behind trees at cars traveling down the unpaved portion of the road. The unpaved section has no street lights and thus is very dangerous as it has sharp turns where the ghostly people are said to jump in front of the cars from behind trees, causing them to crash. There is also the [[Atco Ghost]] – the ghost of a little boy who runs across the street late at night in [[Atco, New Jersey|Atco]]. It is also rumored that [[Jimmy Hoffa]], the late leader of the [[Teamsters]] Union, is buried beneath [[Giants Stadium]] or the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. However, on the popular television show ''[[MythBusters]]'', the myth of Jimmy Hoffa being buried under Giants Stadium was debunked using [[ground penetrating radar]].

The magazine ''[[Weird NJ]]'' (the creators of which later started ''[[Weird U.S.]]'') was started to catalog and explore the ghosts, legends, and prevalence of otherwise &quot;weird&quot; things in the state.
