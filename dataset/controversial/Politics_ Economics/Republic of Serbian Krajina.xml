The '''Republic of Serbian Krajina''' ('''RSK''') ({{lang-sr|''Republika Srpska Krajina'', RSK; Република Српска Крајина, РСК}}, {{IPA-sh|rɛpǔblika sr̩̂pskaː krâjina|sr}}; sometimes translated as ''Republic of Serb Krajina'') was a self-proclaimed [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb]] entity within [[Croatia]]. Established in 1991, it was not recognized internationally. It formally existed from 1991 to 1995, having been initiated a year earlier via smaller separatist regions. The name ''[[Krajina]]'' means &quot;frontier&quot;. Its [[Separatism|separatist]] government engaged in a war for ethnic Serb independence from the [[Republic of Croatia]], within and out of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], once Croatian borders had been recognized by foreign states in August 1991 and February 1992. 

[[Milan Babić]], former President of Serbian Krajina, testified to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) that Krajina was provided weapons by [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s government in [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]], and that Krajina was economically and financially dependent upon Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Armatta. Twilight of Impunity: The War Crimes Trial of Slobodan Milosevic. Duke University Press, 2010. Pp. 160-163.&lt;/ref&gt;  Babic testified that Milošević held ''[[de facto]]'' control over both the [[Military of Serbian Krajina|Army of Serbian Krajina]] and the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] during its actions in Krajina via an alternate chain of command through the Serbian police.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Armatta. Twilight of Impunity: The War Crimes Trial of Slobodan Milosevic. Duke University Press, 2010. Pp. 160-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Krajina had [[de facto]] control over central parts of the territory while control of the outskirts changed with success and failures of the military activities. In 1992, the Serb Krajina government signed a demilitarisation agreement and removed all of the heavy artillery that were brought in by [[Yugoslav People's Army]] at the start of the conflict, in exchange the area became a United Nations Protected [[demilitarised zone]]. The territory was legally protected by the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) and the Army of Serbian Krajina that frequently attacked neighbouring [[Bihać]] enclave (then in the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) with heavy artillery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RWFGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KOkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6084,4117396&amp;dq=bihac+bosnia&amp;hl=en The Daily Gazette, 17 June 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main portion was overrun by Croatian forces in 1995; a [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia|rump remained in eastern Slavonia]] under [[United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium|UNTAES]] administration until its peaceful reintegration into Croatia in 1998.

==Etymology==
The name [[Krajina]] was adopted from the [[Military Frontier]] that was carved out of parts of the [[crown land]]s of [[Croatia in the Habsburg Empire|Croatia]] and [[Banovina of Slavonia|Slavonia]] by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] between 1553&amp;ndash;1578 as a means of defending against the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Many Croats, Serbs and [[Vlach]]s immigrated from nearby parts of Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Bosnia and Serbia) into the region and helped bolster and replenish the numbers of [[Croats]] as well as the garrisoned German troops in the fight against the Ottomans. The Austrians controlled the Frontier from military headquarters in Vienna and did not make it a [[crown land]], though it had some special rights in order to encourage settlement in an otherwise deserted, war-ravaged territory. The abolition of the military rule took place between 1869 and 1871. In order to attract Serbs to be part of Croatia, on 11 May 1867, the Sabor solemnly declared that &quot;the Triune Kingdom recognizes the Serbian/Vlach people living in it as a nation identical and equal with the Croatian nation.&quot; After that, the Military Frontier was reincorporated in [[Croatia in the Habsburg Empire|Croatia]] in 1881.

[[File:Militargrenze, Wojwodowena und Banat.jpg|left|thumb|Map of the original Krajina, the [[Military Frontier]]]]

Following [[World War I]], the regions formerly part of the Military Frontier became part of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] where it was in the [[Sava Banovina]] with most of old Croatia-Slavonia. Between the two world wars the Serbs of the Croatian and Slavonian Krajinas, as well as the [[Bosnian Krajina]] and other regions west of [[Serbia]], organized a notable political party, the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]] under [[Svetozar Pribićević]]. In the new state there existed much tension between the Croats and Serbs over differing political visions, with the campaign for Croatian autonomy culminating in the assassination of their leader [[Stjepan Radić]] in the parliament and repression by the Serb dominated security structures.

Between 1939–1941, in an attempt to resolve the Croat-Serb political and social antagonism in the [[first Yugoslavia]], an autonomous [[Banovina of Croatia]] was created incorporating (amongst other territories) much of the former [[Military Frontier]] as well as parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In 1941, the [[axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia and in the aftermath the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (which included whole of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Serbia (Eastern Syrmia) as well) was declared. The [[Ustaše]] (who were allegedly behind the assassination of the Serbian king of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) were installed by the Germans as rulers of the new country and promptly pursued a genocidal policy of persecution of Serbs, Jews and Croats (from opposition groups) leading to hundreds of thousands being killed. During this period, Croats coalesced around the ruling authorities or the communist anti-fascist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. Serbs from around the [[Knin]] area tended to join the [[chetnik]]s, whilst Serbs from the [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] and [[Slavonia]] regions tended to join the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].

At the end of the war, the communist dominated [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] prevailed and the region was part of the [[People's Republic of Croatia]] until 7 April 1963, when the federal republic changed its name to the  [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]]. The autonomous political organisations of the region were also suppressed by Tito (along with others such as the [[Croatian Spring]]); however, the Yugoslav constitutions of 1965 and 1974 did give substantial rights to national minorities including the Serbs in SR Croatia.

The Serbian &quot;Krajina&quot; entity to emerge upon Croatia's declaration of independence in 1991 would include three kinds of territories:
* a large section of the historical Military Frontier, in areas with a majority of Serbian population;
* areas such as parts of northern Dalmatia, that were never part of the Frontier but had a majority or a plurality of Serbian population, including the self-proclaimed entity's capital, [[Knin]];
* areas that bordered with Serbia and where Serbs are significant minority ([[Baranja region|Baranja]], [[Vukovar]]).

Large sections of the historical Military Frontier were outside of the Republic of Serb Krajina and contained a largely Croat population including much of [[Lika]], the area centred around the city of [[Bjelovar]], central and south-eastern [[Slavonia]].

==Creation==
[[File:CroatianSerbs.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Serb-populated areas in Croatia (according to the 1981 census)]]

The Serb-populated regions in Croatia were of central concern to the Serbian nationalist movement of the late 1980s, led by [[Slobodan Milošević]]. The incidents started in 1988 and turned into full-scale Serbian political rallies in 1989. The Croatian pro-independence victory in 1990 made matters more tense, especially since the country's Serbian minority was supported both politically and militarily by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], especially Serbian President Milošević. At the time, Serbs comprised about 12.2% of Croatia's population: 581,663 people declared themselves Serbs in the census of 1991.

Serbs became increasingly opposed to the policies of Franjo Tuđman, elected president of Croatia in April 1990, due to his overt desire for the creation of an independent Croatia.  On 30 May 1990, the [[Serb Democratic Party (Croatia)|Serb Democratic Party]] of Jovan Rašković broke all ties to the Croatian parliament. The following June in Knin, the Serbs—led by the [[Serb Democratic Party (Croatia)|Serb Democratic Party]]—proclaimed the creation of the Association of Municipalities of Northern Dalmatia and Lika.  In August 1990, the Serbs began what became known as the [[Log Revolution]], where barricades of logs were placed across roads throughout the South as an expression of their secession from Croatia.  This effectively cut Croatia in two, separating the coastal region of [[Dalmatia]] from the rest of the country. The [[Constitution of Croatia|Croatian constitution]] was passed in December 1990 putting Serbs in a minority category along with other ethnic groups such as Italians, Hungarians, and others. Some would later justify their claim to an independent Serb state by arguing that the new constitution contradicted the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]], because in their view, Croatia was still legally governed by the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. This was contradicted by the increased signs of fragmentation within the Yugoslav republics.  Croatian leaders officially insisted on the goal of an independent Croatia as a member of Yugoslav confederation of independent states.

Serbs in Croatia had established a Serbian National Council in July 1990 to coordinate opposition to Croatian independence.  Their position was that if Croatia could secede from Yugoslavia, then the Serbs could secede from Croatia.  [[Milan Babić]], a dentist from the southern town of [[Knin]], was elected president. At his [[ICTY]] trial in 2004, he claimed that &quot;during the events [of 1990-1992], and in particular at the beginning of his political career, he was strongly influenced and misled by Serbian propaganda, which repeatedly referred to the imminent threat of a Croatian genocide perpetrated on the Serbs in Croatia, thus creating an atmosphere of hatred and fear of Croats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/icty/babic/trialc/judgement/index.htm Milan Babic - Sentencing Judgement]. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Retrieved 8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebel Croatian Serbs established a number of [[paramilitary]] militias under the leadership of [[Milan Martić]], the police chief in Knin.

In August 1990, a referendum was held in the Krajina on the question of Serb &quot;sovereignty and autonomy&quot; in Croatia. The resolution was confined exclusively to Serbs so it passed by a majority of 99.7%. As expected, it was declared illegal and invalid by the Croatian government, who stated that Serbs had no constitutional right to break away from Croatian legal territory.

Babić's administration announced the creation of a [[SAO Krajina|Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina]] (or ''SAO Krajina'') on 21 December 1990. On 16 March 1991 another referendum was held which asked &quot;Are you in favour of the SAO Krajina joining the Republic of Serbia and staying in Yugoslavia with Serbia, Montenegro and others who wish to preserve Yugoslavia?&quot;. With 99.8% voting in favour, the referendum was approved and the Krajina assembly declared that &quot;the territory of the SAO Krajina is a constitutive part of the unified state territory of the Republic of Serbia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612.pdf Prosecutor v. Milan Martić Judgement]. p. 46. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Retrieved 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1991, it declared that it would secede from Croatia.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-Separation-1Apr1991&quot;&gt;{{cite news | publisher = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/world/rebel-serbs-complicate-rift-on-yugoslav-unity.html?ref=croatia | title = Rebel Serbs Complicate Rift on Yugoslav Unity | author= Chuck Sudetic | date = 2 April 1991 | accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Serb-dominated communities in eastern Croatia announced that they would also join SAO Krajina and ceased paying taxes to the [[Zagreb]] government, and began implementing its own currency system, army regiments, and postal service.

Croatia held a [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|referendum on independence on 19 May 1991]], in which the electorate&amp;mdash;minus many Serbs, who chose to boycott it&amp;mdash;voted overwhelmingly for independence with the option of confederate union with other Yugoslav states. On 25 June 1991, Croatia and Slovenia both declared their independence from Yugoslavia. As the JNA attempted unsuccessfully to suppress Slovenia's independence in the short [[Slovenian War]], clashes between rebelled Croatian Serbs and Croatian security forces broke out almost immediately, leaving dozens dead on both sides. Serbs calling themselves [[Chetniks]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Seselj article&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2317765.stm Profile: Vojislav Seselj]. BBC (7 November 2007). Retrieved 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; were supported by the remnants of the JNA (whose members were now only from Serbia and Montenegro), which provided them military arms. Many Croatians fled their homes in fear, or were forced out by the rebel Serbs. The [[European Union]] and [[United Nations]] attempted to broker ceasefires and peace settlements, but all to no avail.
[[File:Demographics of RSK.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Change in the ethnic composition of Krajina from April 1991 to July 1992. Serbs increased from 52,3 % to 88 % of the total population]]
Around August 1991, the leadership of the Serbian Krajina, and that of Serbia, allegedly agreed to embark on a campaign which the ICTY prosecutors described as a &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot; whose purpose &quot;was the forcible removal of the majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from approximately one-third of the territory of the Republic of Croatia, an area he planned to become part of a new Serb-dominated state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icty.org/sid/7946 Judge Rodrigues confirms Indictment charging Slobodan Milosevic with Crimes committed in Croatia]. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Retrieved 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders are documented to have included Milan Babić, and other rebelled Croatian Serbs' figures such as Milan Martić, the Serbian militia leader [[Vojislav Šešelj]] and Yugoslav Army commanders including General [[Ratko Mladić]], who was at the time the commander of JNA forces in Croatia.

According to testimony given by Babić in his subsequent war crimes trial, during the summer of 1991 the Serbian secret police&amp;mdash;under Milošević's command&amp;mdash;set up &quot;a parallel structure of state security and the police of Krajina and units commanded by the state security of Serbia&quot;. Shadowy groups of paramilitaries with names such as the &quot;Vukovi sa Vucjaka&quot; (&quot;Wolves from Vucjak&quot;) and the &quot;Beli Orlovi&quot; (&quot;White Eagles&quot;), funded by the Serbian [[secret police]], were also a key component of this structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seselj indictment&quot;&gt;[http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ses-ii030115e.htm Seselj indictment]&lt;/ref&gt;

A wider-scale war was launched in August 1991. Over the following months, a large area of territory, amounting to a third of Croatia, was controlled by the rebel Serbs. The Croatian population suffered heavily, fleeing or evicted with numerous killings, leading to [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY evidence&quot;&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/dhr/Archive/2004/Jan/29-319268.html ICTY evidence; Babic pleads guilty to crimes]&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the fighting occurred between August and December 1991 when approximately 80,000 Croats were expelled (and some were killed).&lt;ref name=&quot;Croatian refugees&quot;&gt;[http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=822 Croatian refugees]&lt;/ref&gt; Many more died and or were displaced in fighting in eastern [[Slavonia]] (this territory along the Croatian/Serbian border was not part of the Krajina, and it was the JNA that was the principal actor in that part of the conflict). The total number of exiled Croats and other non-Serbs range from 170,000 ([[ICTY]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the latter half of 1991, Croatia was beginning to form an army and their main defenders, the local police, were overpowered by the JNA military who supported rebelled Croatian Serbs. The RSK was located entirely inland, but they soon started advancing deeper into Croatian territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY evidence&quot; /&gt; Among other places, they shelled the Croatian coastal town of [[Zadar]] killing over 80 people in nearby areas and damaging the [[Maslenica Bridge (D8)|Maslenica Bridge]] that connected northern and southern Croatia, in the [[Operation Coast-91]]. They also tried to overtake [[Šibenik]], but the defenders successfully repelled the attack by JNA, in the [[Battle of Šibenik (1991)|Battle of Šibenik]].

On 19 December 1991, the SAO Krajina proclaimed itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina. On 26 February 1992, the SAO Western Slavonia and SAO Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srem were added to the RSK, which initially had only encompassed the territories within the SAO Krajina. The Serb Army of Krajina (''Српска Војска Крајине'' / ''Srpska Vojska Krajine'' ; abbreviated  ''СВК'' / ''SVK'') (or the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina Army]]) was officially formed on 19 March 1992. The RSK occupied an area of some 17,028&amp;nbsp;km² at its greatest extent.

A ceasefire agreement was signed by Presidents Tuđman and Milošević in January 1992, paving the way for the implementation of a United Nations peace plan put forward by [[Cyrus Vance]]. Under the [[Peace plans offered before and during the Bosnian War|Vance Plan]], four United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) were established in Croatian territory which was claimed by RSK. The Vance Plan called for the withdrawal of the JNA from Croatia and for the return of refugees to their homes in the UNPAs. The JNA officially withdrew from Croatia in May 1992 but much of its weaponry and many of its personnel remained in the Serb-held areas and were turned over to the RSK's security forces. Refugees were not allowed to return to their homes and many of the remaining Croats and other nationalities left in the RSK were expelled or killed in the following months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner: Croatia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Babic Guilty&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3433721.stm | work=BBC News | title=Babic admits persecuting Croats | date=27 January 2004 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 1992, the creation of the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) was authorised by the [[UN Security Council]] for an initial period of a year, to provide security to the UNPAs.

The agreement effectively froze the front lines for the next three years. Croatia and the RSK had effectively fought each other to a standstill. The Republic of Serbian Krajina was not recognised [[de jure]] by any other country or international organisation. Nevertheless it gained support from Serbia's allies, [[Greece]], [[Russia]], and [[Romania]].

UNPROFOR was deployed throughout the region to maintain the ceasefire, although in practice its light armament and restricted rules of engagement meant that it was little more than an observer force. It proved wholly unable to ensure that refugees returned to the RSK. Indeed, the rebel Croatian Serb authorities continued to make efforts to ensure that they could ''never'' return, destroying villages and cultural and religious monuments to erase the previous existence of the Croatian inhabitants of the Krajina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner: Croatia&quot; /&gt;  Milan Babić later testified that this policy was driven from Belgrade through the Serbian secret police&amp;mdash;and ultimately Milošević&amp;mdash;who he claimed were in control of all the administrative institutions and armed forces in the Krajina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babic testification&quot;&gt;[http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;s=f&amp;o=164710&amp;apc_state=henitri200407 Babic testifies against Milosevic]&lt;/ref&gt; This would certainly explain why the Yugoslav National Army took the side of the rebelled Croatian Serbs in spite of its claims to be acting as a &quot;peacekeeping&quot; force. Milošević denied this, claiming that Babić had made it up &quot;out of fear&quot;.

==After the ceasefire==
[[File:Kotar Glina i Knin.jpg|right|thumb|Autonomous District of Glina is shown in dark green; the district of Knin is shown in light green]]

With the creation of new [[Counties of Croatia|Croatian counties]] on 30 December 1992, the Croatian government also set aside two autonomous regions (''kotar'') for ethnic Serbs in the areas of Krajina:
* [[Autonomous District of Glina]], {{lang|hr|Autonomni kotar Glina}}, {{lang|sr-Cyrl|Аутономни котар Глина}}
* [[Autonomous District of Knin]], {{lang|hr|Autonomni kotar Knin}}, {{lang|sr-Cyrl|Аутономни котар Книн}}

Municipalities [[de jure]] within the Autonomous District of Glina were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_06_34_896.html | language = Croatian | title = Ustavni zakon o ljudskim pravima i slobodama i pravima etničkih i nacionalnih zajednica ili manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj | author = [[Croatian Parliament]] | journal = [[Narodne novine]] | issue = 34/92 | location = Zagreb | date = 3 June 1992 | accessdate =7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Glina, Croatia|Glina]]
*[[Vrginmost]]
*[[Hrvatska Kostajnica]]
*[[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]]
*[[Vojnić]]

However, Serbs considered this too late, as it was not the amount of autonomy they wanted, and by now they had declared [[de facto]] independence.

The districts never actually functioned since they were located within the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. Existence of the Autonomous District of Glina was also provided in the draft of the [[Z-4 plan]], that was rejected.
After [[Operation Storm]], the application of the law which allowed autonomy would be temporarily suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1995_09_68_1192.html | language = Croatian | title = Ustavni zakon o privremenom neprimjenjivanju pojedinih odredbi Ustavnog zakona o ljudskim pravima i slobodama i o pravima etničkih i nacionalnih zajednica ili manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj | author = [[Croatian Parliament]] | journal = [[Narodne novine]] | issue = 68/95 | date = 21 September 1995 | accessdate =7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 this part of the law was formally repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2000_05_51_1127.html | language = Croatian | title = Ustavni zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Ustavnog zakona o ljudskim pravima i slobodama i o pravima etničkih i nacionalnih zajednica ili manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj | author = [[Croatian Parliament]] | journal = [[Narodne novine]] | issue = 51/2000 | date = 19 May 2000 | accessdate =7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
[[File:Goran Hadzic 1992 2.jpg|right|150px|thumb|1992: RSK president [[Goran Hadžić]].]]
The partial implementation of the Vance Plan drove a wedge between the governments of the RSK and Serbia, the RSK's principal backer and supplier of fuel, arms and money. Milan Babić strongly opposed the Vance Plan but was overruled by the RSK's assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner: Croatia&quot; /&gt;

On 26 February 1992, Babić was deposed and replaced as President of the RSK by [[Goran Hadžić]], a Milošević loyalist. Babić remained involved in RSK politics but as a considerably weaker figure.

The position of the RSK eroded steadily over the following three years. On the surface, the RSK had all the trappings of a state: army, parliament, president, government and ministries, currency and stamps. However its economy was wholly dependent on support from the rump Yugoslavia, which had the effect of importing that country's [[hyperinflation]].

The economic situation soon became disastrous. By 1994, only 36,000 of the RSK's 430,000 citizens were employed. The war had severed the RSK's trade links with the rest of Croatia, leaving its few industries idle. With few natural resources of its own it had to import most of the goods and fuel it required. Agriculture was devastated, and operated at little more than a subsistence level.&lt;ref name=&quot;svarm&quot; /&gt; Professionals went to Serbia or elsewhere to escape the republic's economic hardships. To make matters worse, the RSK's government was grossly corrupt and the region became a haven for black marketeering and other criminal activity. It was clear by the mid-1990s that without a peace deal or support from Yugoslavia the RSK was not economically viable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evidence&quot;&gt;Milosevic and the JNA http://hrw.org/reports/2006/milosevic1206/4.htm#&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially evident in Belgrade, where the RSK had become an unwanted economic and political burden for Milošević. Much to his frustration, the rebel Croatian Serbs rebuffed his government's demands to settle the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner: Croatia&quot; /&gt; 
In July 1992 the RSK issued its own currency, the [[Krajina dinar]] (HRKR), in parallel with the [[Yugoslav dinar]]. This was followed by the &quot;October dinar&quot; (HRKO), first issued on 1 October 1993 and equal to 1,000,000 Reformed Dinar, and the &quot;1994 dinar&quot;, first issued on 1 January 1994, and equal to 1,000,000,000 October dinar.
The RSK's weakness also adversely affected its armed forces, the [[Vojska Srpske Krajine]] (VSK). Since the 1992 ceasefire agreement, Croatia had spent heavily on importing weapons and training its armed forces with assistance from American contractors. In contrast, the VSK had grown steadily weaker, with its soldiers poorly motivated, trained and equipped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner: Croatia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Security&quot;&gt;Testimony from RSK generals http://www.nsf-journal.hr/issues/v3_n3-4/11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There were only about 55,000 of them to cover a front of some 600&amp;nbsp;km in Croatia plus 100&amp;nbsp;km along the border with the [[Bihać]] pocket in Bosnia. With 16,000 stationed in eastern Slavonia, only about 39,000 were left to defend the main part of the RSK. Overall, only 30,000 were capable of full mobilization, yet they faced a far stronger Croatian army. Also, political divisions between Hadžić and Babić occasionally led to physical and sometimes even armed confrontations between their supporters; Babić himself was assaulted and beaten in an incident in [[Benkovac]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dokumenti&quot;&gt;[http://www.profil.hr/index.php?cmd=show_proizvod&amp;proizvod_id=30205 Republika Hrvatska i Domovinski rat 1990. - 1995. dokumenti] {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Pdf/2005%5C10%5C22%5C30A30.PDF | title=U ljeto '91. pripremana i pobuna u Gorskom kotaru | work=[[Vjesnik]] | date=22 October 2005 | first=Željko | last=Krušelj | language=Croatian | format=PDF | accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1993 the revitalized Croatian army attacked the Serbian positions around [[Maslenica]] in southern Croatia which curtailed their access to the sea via [[Novigrad, Zadar County|Novigrad]]. In a second offensive in September 1993 the Croatian army overran the [[Medak pocket]] in the southern Krajina in a push to regain Serb-held Croatian territory. This action was halted by international diplomacy but although the rebel Croatian Serbs brought reinforcements forward fairly quickly, the strength of the Croatian forces proved superior. Hadžić sent an urgent request to Belgrade for reinforcements, arms and equipment. In response, around 4,000 paramilitaries under the command of [[Vojislav Šešelj]] (the [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]]) and &quot;[[Arkan]]&quot; (the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]]) arrived to bolster the VSK. They found the RSK government and military in a chaotic state.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

== Operation Storm ==

[[File:Martic-order1995.jpg|thumb|The order to evacuate ethnic Serbians from [[Republik Serbische Krajina|RSK]] territory, issued by the Serbian Ministry of Defence and signed by [[Milan Martić]]; 4 August 1995]]

Following the rejection by both sides of the [[Z-4 plan]] for reintegration, the RSK's end came in 1995, when Croatian forces gained control of [[SAO Western Slavonia]] in [[Operation Flash]] (May) followed by the biggest part of occupied Croatia in [[Operation Storm]] (August). The Krajina Serb Supreme Defence Council met under president [[Milan Martić]] to discuss the situation. A decision was reached at 16:45 to &quot;start evacuating the population unfit for military service from  the municipalities of [[Knin]], [[Benkovac]], [[Obrovac, Croatia|Obrovac]], [[Drniš]] and [[Gračac]].&quot; The RSK was disbanded and most of the Serb population fled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner: Croatia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;[[Amnesty International]], [http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/002/2005/en/46184632-d4c3-11dd-8a23-d58a49c0d652/eur640022005en.html Croatia: Operation &quot;Storm&quot; - still no justice ten years on], 04.08.2005&lt;/ref&gt; Only 5,000 to 6,000 people remained, mostly the elderly.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldstein&quot;&gt;Goldstein, Ivo (1999). ''Croatia: A History''. p. 253–254. C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers. ISBN 1-85065-525-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian historian [[Ivo Goldstein]] wrote, &quot;''The reasons for the Serb exodus are complex. Some had to leave because the Serb army forced them to, while others feared the revenge of the Croatian army or of their former Croatian neighbours, whom they had driven away and whose homes they had mostly looted (it was later shown that this fear was far from groundless).''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldstein&quot; /&gt;

Most of the refugees ended in Serbia, Bosnia and eastern Slavonia. Some of those who remained were murdered, tortured and forcibly expelled by the Croatian Army and police.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt; Croatia celebrates this victory on 5 August as [[Victory Day (Croatia)|Victory Day]]. There was also accusations of widespread arson committed by the Croatian soldiers, per the indictment of the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY, to be an action organised to prevent the Serbs from returning.  This case is pending judgment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gotovina indictment&quot; /&gt;

A number of Croatian army officers (such as general [[Ante Gotovina]]) were indicted by the ICTY in the Hague for command responsibility for the killings committed by Croatian soldiers against the civilian Serb population. On 15 April 2011, Croatian generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač were convicted on charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war; Ivan Čermak, another Croatian general, was acquitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gotovina indictment&quot;&gt;Gotovina indictment http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/gotovina/cis-gotovina.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later events==
[[File:Srem baranja.png|thumb|right|Map of the remaining Krajina territory in eastern Croatia]]

The parts of the former RSK in eastern Croatia (along the [[Danube]]) remained in place, in what was previously the [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]].

In 1995, Milan Milanović, formerly a Republic of Serbian Krajina official, signed the [[Erdut Agreement]] as a representative of the Serbian side. This agreement, co-signed by the representative of the Croatian Government, was sponsored by the United Nations.

It set up a transitional period during which the [[United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]] (UNTAES) peacekeeping mission would oversee a peaceful reintegration of this territory into Croatia, starting on 15 January 1996. In 1998, the UNTAES mission was complete and the territory was formally returned to Croatia.

Based on the [[Erdut Agreement]] in 1997 was also established institution named [[Joint Council of Municipalities]].

After the peaceful reintegration, two Croatian islands on the Danube, the [[Island of Šarengrad]] and the [[Island of Vukovar]], remained under Serbian military control. In 2004, Serbian military was withdrawn from the islands and replaced with Serbian police. Thus, the islands remain an open question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=1&amp;status=jedna&amp;vest=70384] Serbian refusal of [[Badinter Arbitration Committee]] decision on Serbian&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 a Croatian court sentenced former RSK president [[Goran Hadžić]] [[in absentia]] to 20 years in prison for rocket attacks on [[Šibenik]] and [[Vodice, Croatia|Vodice]]. In 1999 he was sentenced to an additional 20 years for war crimes in [[Tenja]], near [[Osijek]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rferl-hr-2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/hadzic_ne_moze_biti_izrucen_hrvatskoj/24272781.html|language=Croatian|title=Hadžić ne može biti izručen Hrvatskoj|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] – Croatian edition|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 Croatia's state attorney brought another indictment against him for the murder of almost 1,300 Croats in Vukovar, Osijek, Vinkovci, [[Županja]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;rferl-hr-2011&quot;/&gt; On 4 June 2004, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) indicted him on 14 counts of war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/07/25/feature-02|title=War crimes fugitive: Goran Hadzic|publisher=Setimes.com|date=25 July 2008|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he was arrested and extradited to the Hague, where his initial trial hearing was held on 25 July the same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/07/2011725143544135906.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the indictment of prosecutor [[Carla Del Ponte]] against [[Slobodan Milošević]] at the ICTY, the Croat and non-Serb population from the 1991 census was approximately as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/ind/en/mil-2ai020728e.htm The Prosecutor of the Tribunial Against Slobodan Milosevic].

Thus Serbs comprised 52.3% and Croats 35.8% of the population of SAO Krajina respectively in 1991.

According to data set forth at the meeting of the Government of the RSK in July 1992, its ethnic composition was 88% Serbs, 7% Croats, 5% others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dokumenti&quot;/&gt; As of November 1993, less than 400 ethnic Croats still resided in UNPA Sector South,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.hri.org/docs/USSD-Rights/93/Croatia93.html | title = CROATIA HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES, 1993; Section 2, part d.

==Legal status==
During its existence, this entity did not achieve international recognition. In 29 November 1991, the [[Badinter commission]] concluded that Yugoslavia was &quot;in dissolution&quot; and that the republics - including Croatia - should be recognized as independent states when they asked so.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawreview.kentlaw.edu/articles/80-1/Hasani%20PDF3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol3/No1/art13.html The Opinions of the Badinter Arbitration Committee: A Second Breath for the Self-Determination of Peoples&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They also assigned these republics territorial integrity. For most of the world this was a reason to recognize Croatia. However, Serbia did not accept the conclusions of the commission in that period and recognized Croatia only after Croatian military actions (Oluja and Bljesak) and the Dayton agreement.

On 20 November 1991 [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] asked [[Badinter commission]]: &quot;Does the [[Serbs|Serbian]] population in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as one of the constituent peoples of Yugoslavia, have the right to [[self-determination]]?&quot; The commission concluded on 11 January 1992 that &quot;that the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is entitled to all the rights concerned to [[minority group|minorities]] and [[ethnic group]]s[...]&quot; and &quot;that the Republics must afford the members of those minorities and ethnic groups all the [[human right]]s and fundamental [[freedom (political)|freedom]]s recognized in [[international law]], including, where appropriate, the right to choose their [[nationality]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://207.57.19.226/journal/Vol3/No1/art12-13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government in exile==
{{POV-section|date=November 2010}}

There exists a self-proclaimed [[government in exile]] for the Republic of Serbian Krajina. This government existed for a short time period after Operation Storm, but was reconstituted in 2005. This self-proclaimed government has changed the official name of the Republic of Serbian Krajina to Republic of Serb-Krajina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vladarsk.com/&lt;/ref&gt; At the Belgrade meeting, the former legislators declared themselves to be the legitimate continuation of the RSK government and called for the re-creation of the RSK on the basis of the 1994 [[Z-4 plan]], which had called for Krajina to have a status of &quot;more than [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]], less than independence&quot; within [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b92-dokumenti-z-4-plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.b92.net/specijal/oluja/index.php?start=0&amp;nav_id=173983 | publisher = [[B92]] | language = Serbian | title = Dokumenti: Plan Z-4 | work = B92 specijal: 10 godina od ''Oluje'' nad Krajinom | accessdate =2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They announced that a parliamentary election would be held and that the new name of the self-proclaimed state would be &quot;Republic of Serb-Krajina&quot;. The meeting elected [[Milorad Buha]] as [[prime minister]] as well as six ministers without portfolio whose names were not revealed.

This move was criticized by many, including top [[Serbia]]n and [[Croatia]]n government officials, as well as senior representatives of Serbs in Croatia. They all stated that such a meeting would harm Serb-Croat reconciliation and relations between the communities in [[Croatia]]. It was pointed out that the Krajina Serb legislators had rejected the Z-4 proposal when it had originally been put forward. Some Serbian nationalists also criticized the move, saying that a government in exile should have been created as soon as possible after Operation Storm, not 10 years later.
