'''Japan''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Japan.ogg|dʒ|ə|ˈ|p|æ|n}} ({{lang-ja|日本}} '''''Nihon''''' or '''''Nippon'''''; formally {{lang|ja|日本国}} {{audio|help=no|Ja-nippon_nihonkoku.ogg|'''''Nippon-koku'''''}} or '''''Nihon-koku''''', literally the ''State of Japan'') is an [[island country|island nation]] in [[East Asia]]. Located in the [[Pacific Ocean]], it lies to the east of the [[Sea of Japan]], [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]] and [[Russia]], stretching from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north to the [[East China Sea]] and [[Taiwan]] in the south. The [[Kanji|characters]] that make up Japan's name mean &quot;sun-origin&quot;, which is why Japan is sometimes referred to as the &quot;[[Land of the Rising Sun]]&quot;.

Japan is an [[archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]]. The four largest islands are [[Honshu]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Kyushu]] and [[Shikoku]], together comprising about ninety-seven percent of Japan's land area. Japan has the world's [[List of countries by population|tenth-largest population]], with over 127&amp;nbsp;million people. Honshū's [[Greater Tokyo Area]], which includes the [[Capital of Japan|''de facto'' capital city]] of [[Tokyo]] and several surrounding [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]], is the [[World's largest cities|largest metropolitan area]] in the world, with over 30 million residents. 

Archaeological research indicates that people lived in Japan as early as the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period. The first written mention of Japan is in [[History of China|Chinese history]] texts from the 1st century&amp;nbsp;AD. Influence from other nations followed by long periods of isolation has characterized [[History of Japan|Japan's history]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and [[World War I]] allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of 1937 expanded into part of [[World War II]] in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Since adopting its revised [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] and an elected legislature called the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]].

A [[Great power|major economic power]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=World Factbook: Japan|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html|publisher=[[CIA]]|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan has the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|third-largest economy]] by nominal GDP and by [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|purchasing power parity]]. It is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|fourth-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|fourth-largest importer]]. Although Japan has officially [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|renounced its right to declare war]], it maintains a modern military with the [[List of countries by military expenditures|sixth largest military budget]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/15majorspenders SIPRI Yearbook 2012 - 15 countries with the highest military expenditure in 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Names of Japan}}

The English word ''Japan'' derives from the Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese name, {{nihongo2|日本}}, pronounced ''Nippon'' {{Audio|ja-nippon(日本).ogg|listen}} or ''Nihon'' {{Audio|ja-nihon(日本).ogg|listen}} in Japanese. The pronunciation ''Nippon'' is more formal, and is used for most official purposes, including international sporting events.

From the [[Meiji Restoration]] until the end of [[World War II]], the full title of Japan was {{nihongo|''Dai Nippon Teikoku''|大日本帝國}}, meaning &quot;the [[Empire of Japan|Empire of Great Japan]]&quot;. Today the name {{Nihongo|''Nippon-koku'' or ''Nihon-koku''|日本国}} is used as a formal modern-day equivalent; countries like Japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character {{nihongo|''koku''|国}}, meaning &quot;country&quot;, &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;state&quot;.

[[Japanese people]] refer to themselves as {{Nihongo|''Nihonjin''|日本人}} and to their language as {{Nihongo|''Nihongo''|日本語}}. Both ''Nippon'' and ''Nihon'' mean &quot;sun-origin&quot; and are often translated as ''Land of the Rising Sun''. This nomenclature comes from [[Japanese missions to Imperial China]] and refers to Japan's eastward position relative to China. Before ''Nihon'' came into official use, Japan was known as {{Nihongo||倭|[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]}} or {{Nihongo||倭国|Wakoku}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The emergence of Japanese kingship|first=Joan R. |last=Piggott|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-2832-1|pages=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word for Japan came to the West via [[Nanban trade|early trade routes]]. The early [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or possibly [[Wu Chinese]] (吳語) pronunciation of Japan was recorded by [[Marco Polo]] as ''Cipangu''. In modern [[Shanghainese]], a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters {{nihongo2|日本}} 'Japan' is ''Zeppen'' {{IPA-wuu|zəʔpən|}}. The old [[Malay language|Malay]] word for Japan, ''Jepang'', was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect, probably [[Hokkien|Fukienese]] or [[Ningbo dialect|Ningpo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boxer|first=Charles Ralph|title=The Christian century in Japan 1549-1650|year=1951|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=1-85754-035-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2R4DA2lip9gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Christian%20Century%20In%20Japan%201549%E2%80%931650&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=japang&amp;f=false|pages=1–14|quote=As for the name Japan, which with [[Fernão Pires de Andrade|Pires]] enters the European history for the first time in this form, it is generally agreed to be derived, through Malay ''Japun'' or ''Japang'' from the Chinese ''Jihpenkuo'' in one or other of its coastal dialect forms, probably Fukienese or Ningpo. The meaning is literally &quot;sun's origin country,&quot; whence Marco Polo derived his ''Chipangu'' that so fired the imagination of Columbus and led him to the discovery of the New World.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this Malay word was encountered by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] traders in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] in the 16th century. Portuguese traders were the first to bring the word to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Boxer, The Christian Century In Japan 1549–1650, University of California Press, 1951p. 11, 28—36, 49—51, ISBN 1-85754-035-2&lt;/ref&gt; It was first recorded in English in a 1565 letter, spelled ''Giapan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mancall|first=Peter C.|title=Travel narratives from the age of discovery: an anthology|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=156–157|chapter=Of the Ilande of Giapan, 1565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Japanese Paleolithic|Paleolithic]] culture around 30,000&amp;nbsp;BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000&amp;nbsp;BC (the start of the [[Jōmon period]]) by a [[Mesolithic]] to [[Neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] culture, who include ancestors of both the contemporary [[Ainu people]] and [[Yamato people]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumara|first=Hirofumi; Dodo, Yukio|url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/117/2/117_95/_article |title=Dental characteristics of Tohoku residents in Japan: implications for biological affinity with ancient Emishi|journal=Anthropological Science|year=2009|volume=117|issue=2|pages=95–105|doi=10.1537/ase.080325|last2=Dodo|first2=Yukio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Michael F., et al|url=http://www.nature.com/jhg/journal/v51/n1/abs/jhg20068a.html |title=Dual origins of the Japanese: common ground for hunter-gatherer and farmer Y chromosomes|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|year=2006|volume=51|issue=1|pages=47–58|doi=10.1007/s10038-005-0322-0|pmid=16328082|last2=Karafet|first2=TM|last3=Park|first3=H|last4=Omoto|first4=K|last5=Harihara|first5=S|last6=Stoneking|first6=M|last7=Horai|first7=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travis|first=John|title= Jomon Genes|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~annj/courses/notes/jomon_genes.html|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world.

Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese ''[[Book of Han]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Takashi | first=Okazaki | last2=Goodwin | first2=Janet | title=The Cambridge history of Japan, Volume 1: Ancient Japan | year=1993 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | isbn=0-521-22352-0 | page=275 | chapter=Japan and the continent}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called [[Yamataikoku]]. Buddhism was first introduced to Japan from [[Baekje]] of [[Korea]], but the subsequent development of [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] was primarily influenced by China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Brown, Delmer M.|year=1993 |title=The Cambridge History of Japan |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=140–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the [[Asuka period]] (592–710).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Japanese Experience: A Short History of Japan |first=William Gerald|last=Beasley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |page=42 |isbn=0-520-22560-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nara period]] (710–784) of the 8th century marked the emergence of a strong Japanese state, centered on an imperial court in [[Heijō Palace|Heijō-kyō]] (modern [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The Nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent [[Japanese literature|literature]] as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art and [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=64–79 | isbn=978-1-4051-2359-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[smallpox]] epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hays|first=J.N.|title=Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history|year=2005|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=1-85109-658-2|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 784, [[Emperor Kammu]] moved the capital from Nara to [[Nagaoka-kyō]] before relocating it to [[Heian-kyō]] (modern [[Kyoto]]) in 794.
[[File:Byodo-in Uji01pbs2640.jpg|thumb|right|[[Byōdō-in]] (1053) is a temple of [[Pure Land Buddhism]]. It was registered to the UNESCO World Heritage Site.]]
This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and prose. [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki's]] ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem ''[[Kimigayo]]'' were written during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=79–87, 122–123 | isbn=978-1-4051-2359-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism began to spread during the Heian era chiefly through two major sects, [[Tendai]] by [[Saichō]], and [[Shingon]] by [[Kūkai]]. [[Pure Land Buddhism]] ([[Jōdo-shū]], [[Jōdo Shinshū]]) greatly becomes popular in the latter half of the 11th century.

===Feudal era===
Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the [[Taira clan]], sung in the epic [[The Tale of Heike|Tale of Heike]], samurai [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was appointed [[shogun]] and established a base of power in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. After his death, the [[Hōjō clan]] came to power as regents for the shoguns. The [[Zen]] school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kamakura shogunate]] repelled [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually [[Kemmu restoration|overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo]]. Go-Daigo was himself defeated by [[Ashikaga Takauji]] in 1336.

Ashikaga Takauji establishes the shogunate in Muromachi, [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]]. It is a start of [[Muromachi Period]] (1336–1573). The [[Ashikaga shogunate]] receives glory in the age of [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]], and the culture based on Zen Buddhism (art of ''[[Miyabi]]'') has prospered. It evolves to [[Higashiyama Culture]], and has prospered until the 16th century. On the other hand, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (''[[daimyo]]''), and a civil war (the [[Ōnin War]]) began in 1467, opening the century-long [[Sengoku period]] (&quot;Warring States&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George|last=Sansom |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334–1615 |publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=42, 217 | isbn=0-8047-0525-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, traders and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] from Portugal reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct [[Nanban trade|commercial]] and [[Nanban art|cultural]] exchange between Japan and the West. [[Oda Nobunaga]] conquered many other daimyo using European technology and firearms; after he was assassinated in 1582, his successor [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] unified the nation in 1590.

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] served as regent for Hideyoshi's [[Toyotomi Hideyori|son]] and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.

===Modern era===
On 31 March 1854, [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Matthew Perry]] and the &quot;[[Black Ships]]&quot; of the [[United States Navy]] forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries in the [[Bakumatsu]] period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the shogun led to the [[Boshin War]] and the establishment of a [[Abolition of the han system|centralized state]] nominally unified under the Emperor (the [[Meiji Restoration]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=289–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] organized the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]], introduced the [[Meiji Constitution]], and assembled the [[Diet of Japan|Imperial Diet]]. The Meiji Restoration transformed the [[Empire of Japan]] into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895) and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea, and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matsusaka|first=Y.

[[File:Akihito 090710-1600a.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Akihito|Emperor Akihito]] and [[Empress Michiko]]]]

Japan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] where the power of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] as &quot;the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people&quot;. Power is held chiefly by the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/law/index.htm |title=The Constitution of Japan |publisher=House of Councillors of the National Diet of Japan |date=3 November 1946 |accessdate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akihito]] is the current Emperor of Japan; [[Crown Prince Naruhito|Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan]], stands as next in line to the throne.

Japan's legislative organ is the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]], a bicameral parliament. The Diet consists of a [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] with 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and a [[House of Councillors]] of 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms. There is [[universal suffrage]] for adults over 20 years of age,&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; with a [[secret ballot]] for all elected offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;/&gt; In 2009, the social liberal [[Democratic Party of Japan]] took power after 54 years of the liberal conservative [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]'s rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harden|first=Blaine|title=Ruling Party Is Routed In Japan|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/30/AR2009083000854.html|accessdate=7 January 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Prime Minister of Japan is the head of government and is appointed by the Emperor after being designated by the Diet from among its members. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet and appoints and dismisses the [[Minister of State|Ministers of State]]. [[Naoto Kan]] was designated by the Diet to replace [[Yukio Hatoyama]] as the Prime Minister of Japan on 2 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100604x1.html|title=Diet votes in Kan as prime minister|date=4 June 2010|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the Emperor, the Constitution of Japan explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the Diet. Emperor Akihito formally appointed Kan as the country's 94th Prime Minister on 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fackler|first=Martin|title=Focusing on Future, Premier in Japan Unveils Cabinet|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/world/asia/09japan.html|accessdate=7 January 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically influenced by [[Chinese law]], the [[law of Japan|Japanese legal system]] developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as ''[[Kujikata Osadamegaki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Meryll|title=Japanese legal system: text, cases &amp; materials|year=2002|publisher=Cavendish|isbn=978-1-85941-673-0|pages=55–58|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the late 19th century the [[judicial system of Japan|judicial system]] has been largely based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the German [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]; with post–World War II modifications, the code remains in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanamori|first=Shigenari|title=German influences on Japanese Pre-War Constitution and Civil Code|journal=European Journal of Law and Economics|date=1 January 1999|volume=7|issue=1|pages=93–95|doi=10.1023/A:1008688209052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the [[rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] of the Emperor. The Constitution requires that the Emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet, without specifically giving him the power to oppose legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;/&gt; Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] and three levels of lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/judiciary/0620system.html |publisher=Office of the Prime Minister of Japan |title=The Japanese Judicial System |accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the [[Six Codes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Meryll|title=Japanese legal system: text, cases &amp; materials|year=2002|publisher=Cavendish|isbn=978-1-85941-673-0|page=131|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's military is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Japan's military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (JGSDF), the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF). The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the [[Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group|deployment of troops to Iraq]] marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraq deployment&quot;/&gt; [[Nippon Keidanren]] has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the [[Joint Strike Fighter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2010/07/13/idINIndia-50097320100713 |title=Japan business lobby wants weapon export ban eased |publisher=Reuters |date= 13 July 2010|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands of Japan are located in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the [[subduction]] of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south, and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the [[Sea of Japan]] around 15 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|last=Barnes|first=Gina L.|title=Origins of the Japanese Islands|publisher=[[University of Durham]]|year=2003|accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Japan}}
The climate of Japan is predominantly [[temperate]], but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaidō, Sea of Japan, [[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]], [[Seto Inland Sea]], Pacific Ocean, and Ryūkyū Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a [[humid continental]] climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book|last=Karan|first=Pradyumna Prasad|title=Japan in the 21st century|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-2342-9|pages=18–21, 41|coauthor=Gilbreath, Dick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshū's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the [[foehn wind]]. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the [[Chūgoku region|Chūgoku]] and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The Pacific coast features a [[humid subtropical]] climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a [[subtropical climate]], with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. The generally humid, temperate climate exhibits marked seasonal variation such as the blooming of the spring cherry blossoms, the calls of the summer cicada and fall foliage colors that are celebrated in [[Japanese art|art]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The average winter temperature in Japan is {{convert|5.1|C|F}} and the average summer temperature is {{convert|25.2|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate|url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/essential/climate.html|publisher=[[JNTO]]|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest temperature ever measured in Japan—{{convert|40.9|°C}}—was recorded on 16 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japannewsreview.com/society/national/20070816page_id=1553 |title=Gifu Prefecture sees highest temperature ever recorded in Japan – 40.9 |publisher=Japan News Review Society |date=16 August 2007| accessdate=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaidō in late July. In most of Honshū, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, [[typhoon]]s often bring heavy rain.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/essential/climate.html |title=Essential Info: Climate |publisher=[[JNTO]] |accessdate=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiversity===
Japan has nine forest [[ecoregions in Japan|ecoregions]] which reflect the climate and geography of the islands.

===Environment===
{{Main|Environmental issues in Japan}}
In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, [[Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan|environmental pollution]] was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=日本の大気汚染の歴史|url=http://www.erca.go.jp/taiki/history/ko_syousyu.html|publisher=Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency|accessdate=16 January 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis in 1973]] also encouraged the efficient use of energy due to Japan's lack of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sekiyama|first=Takeshi|title=Japan's international cooperation for energy efficiency and conservation in Asian region|url=http://nice.erina.or.jp/en/pdf/C-SEKIYAMA.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080216005103/http://nice.erina.or.jp/en/pdf/C-SEKIYAMA.pdf|archivedate=16 February 2008|publisher=Energy Conservation Center|accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current environmental issues include urban air pollution ([[NOx]], suspended particulate matter, and toxics), [[waste management]], water [[eutrophication]], [[nature conservation]], climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Performance Review of Japan|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/17/2110905.pdf|publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]|accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japanese writing system|Japanese writing]] uses [[kanji]] ([[Chinese character]]s) and two sets of [[kana]] ([[syllabary|syllabaries]] based on [[simplified Chinese characters]]), as well as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Arabic numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miyagawa|first=Shigeru|title=The Japanese Language|url=http://web.mit.edu/jpnet/articles/JapaneseLanguage.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Japanese, the [[Ryukyuan languages]], also part of the [[Japonic languages|Japonic language family]], are spoken in Okinawa; however, few children learn these languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=Patrick|title=Language Planning and Language Ideology in the Ryūkyū Islands|journal=Language Policy|date=January 2004|volume=3|issue=2|pages=153–179|doi=10.1023/B:LPOL.0000036192.53709.fc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ainu language]], which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is [[moribund language|moribund]], with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/works/culture/japan_story.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080106062419/http://www.un.org/works/culture/japan_story.html |archivedate=6 January 2008 |title=15 families keep ancient language alive in Japan |publisher=UN | accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most public and private schools require students to take courses in both Japanese and [[English language education in Japan|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~japan/digest5.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060427225148/http://www.indiana.edu/~japan/digest5.html |archivedate=27 April 2006 |title=Japan Digest: Japanese Education |date=1 September 2005 |first= Lucien|last=Ellington|publisher=Indiana University |accessdate=27 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior [[High school in Japan|high school]], and, according to the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|MEXT]], as of 2005 about 75.9 percent of high school graduates attend a university, junior college, trade school, or other [[Higher education in Japan|higher education]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/05101901/005.pdf |title= School Education |publisher= [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|MEXT]] | accessdate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Japan|Health care system in Japan}}
In Japan, health care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/rodwin/lessons.html |first=Victor|last=Rodwin|title=Health Care in Japan |publisher=New York University |accessdate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/Jasos/Health.html |title=Health Insurance: General Characteristics |publisher=National Institute of Population and Social Security Research |accessdate=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Culture of Japan|Japanese popular culture|Japanese folklore}}
Japanese culture has evolved greatly from its origins. Contemporary culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include [[Japanese handicrafts|crafts]] such as [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|ceramics]], [[Kimono|textiles]], [[Japanese lacquerware|lacquerware]], [[Japanese swords|swords]] and [[Japanese traditional dolls|dolls]]; performances of [[bunraku]], [[kabuki]], [[noh]], [[Japanese traditional dance|dance]], and [[rakugo]]; and other practices, the [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[ikebana]], [[Japanese martial arts|martial arts]], [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[origami]], [[onsen]], [[Geisha]] and [[List of Japanese games|games]]. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible [[Cultural Properties of Japan|Cultural Properties]] and [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/index.html |title=Administration of Cultural Affairs in Japan |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Heritage Sites in Japan|Sixteen sites]] have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, twelve of which are of cultural significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/jp |title=Japan – Properties Inscribed on the World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', one of a [[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji|series]] of [[Ukiyo-e|woodblock prints]] by [[Hokusai]].]]
The [[Ise Grand Shrine|Shrines of Ise]] have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture |author1=Tange, Kenzo |author2=Kawazoe, Noboru |year=1965 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely of wood, [[Minka|traditional housing]] and many [[Japanese Buddhist architecture|temple buildings]] see the use of [[tatami]] mats and [[Shōji|sliding doors]] that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What is Japanese Architecture?: A Survey of Traditional Japanese Architecture with a List of Sites and a Map |author1=Kazuo, Nishi |author2=Kazuo, Hozumi |year=1995 |publisher=Kodansha |isbn=978-4-7700-1992-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese sculpture]], largely of wood, and [[Japanese painting]] are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book|last=Arrowsmith|first=Rupert Richard|title=Modernism and the Museum: Asian, African, and Pacific Art and the London Avant-Garde|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-959369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example [[ukiyo-e]] prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as [[Japonism]], had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on [[post-Impressionism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Famous ukiyo-e artists include [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]]. The fusion of traditional [[woodblock printing]] and Western art led to the creation of [[manga]], a comic book format that is now popular within and outside Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnp.co.jp/museum/nmp/nmp_i/articles/manga/manga1.html |title= A History of Manga |publisher=NMP International |accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manga-influenced animation for television and [[Japanese cinema|film]] is called [[anime]]. Japanese-made [[video game console]]s have been popular since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hov/index.html |title= The History of Video Games |first=Leonard|last=Herman|coauthors=Horwitz, Jer; Kent, Steve; Miller, Skyler|publisher=[[Gamespot]] |accessdate=1 April 2007}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Japan}}
Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many [[Traditional Japanese musical instruments|instruments]], such as the [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]], were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The accompanied [[recitative]] of the [[Noh]] drama dates from the 14th century and the popular [[Music of Japan#Folk music|folk music]], with the guitar-like [[shamisen]], from the sixteenth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malm|first=William P.|title=Traditional Japanese music and musical instruments|year=2000|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-4-7700-2395-7|pages=31–45|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble [[Gagaku]] has influenced the work of some [[20th-century classical music|modern]] Western composers.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [[Olivier Messiaen]], ''Sept haïkaï'' (1962),  (''Olivier Messiaen: a research and information guide'', Routledge, 2008, By Vincent Perez Benitez, page 67) and (''Messiaen the Theologian'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010, page 243-65, By Andrew Shenton)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable classical composers from Japan include [[Toru Takemitsu]] and [[Rentarō Taki]]. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of [[J-pop]], or Japanese popular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3 |title= J-Pop History |work=The Observer | accessdate=1 April 2007 | first=Chris | last=Campion | date=22 August 2005 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karaoke]] is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs|Cultural Affairs Agency]] found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The worlds of Japanese popular culture: gender, shifting boundaries and global cultures|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63729-9|page=76|edition=Repr.|editor=Martinez, D.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest works of Japanese literature include the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' chronicles and the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' [[List of Japanese poetry anthologies|poetry anthology]], all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seeds in the Heart: Japanese Literature from Earliest Times to the Late Sixteenth Century |author=Keene, Donald |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-231-11441-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/~ascj/2000/200015.htm |title= Asian Studies Conference, Japan (2000) |publisher=Meiji Gakuin University |accessdate=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Heian period, the system of [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] known as ''kana'' ([[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]]) was developed. ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'' is considered the oldest Japanese narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;ispmsu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.msu.edu/AsianStudies/wbwoa/eastasia/Japan/literature.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011065654/http://isp.msu.edu/AsianStudies/wbwoa/eastasia/Japan/literature.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 |title= Windows on Asia—Literature : Antiquity to Middle Ages: Recent Past |publisher=Michigan State University |accessdate=28 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account of Heian court life is given in ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' by [[Sei Shōnagon]], while ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] is often described as the world's first novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tale of Genji|editor=Royall, Tyler|publisher=[[Penguin Classics]]|year=2003|isbn=0-14-243714-X|pages=i–ii, xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Edo period, the [[chōnin]] (&quot;townspeople&quot;) overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of [[Saikaku]], for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]] revivified the poetic tradition of the [[Kokinshū]] with his [[haikai]] ([[haiku]]) and wrote the poetic travelogue ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World Within Walls: Japanese Literature of the Pre-Modern Era, 1600–1867 |author=Keene, Donald |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-231-11467-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. [[Natsume Sōseki]] and [[Mori Ōgai]] were the first &quot;modern&quot; novelists of Japan, followed by [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]], [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]], [[Yukio Mishima]] and, more recently, [[Haruki Murakami]]. Japan has two [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize-winning]] authors—[[Yasunari Kawabata]] (1968) and [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] (1994).&lt;ref name=&quot;ispmsu&quot;/&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{main|Japanese cuisine|Kaiseki}}
[[File:Breakfast at Tamahan Ryokan, Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Breakfast at a [[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]] or inn]]
Japanese cuisine is based on combining [[staple food]]s, typically [[Japanese rice]] or [[Japanese noodles|noodles]], with a soup and ''[[okazu]]'' — dishes made from [[Fish (food)|fish]], vegetable, [[tofu]] and the like – to add flavor to the staple food. In the early modern era ingredients such as red meats that had previously not been widely used in Japan were introduced. Japanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on [[Seasonal food|seasonality of food]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjf.or.jp/eng/content/japaneseculture/pdf/ge09shun.pdf &quot;A Day in the Life: Seasonal Foods&quot;], The Japan Forum Newsletter No.14 September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of [[Japanese regional cuisine|regional specialties]] that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. The [[Michelin Guide]] has awarded Japanese cities more Michelin stars than the rest of the world combined.&lt;ref name=michelin20101124&gt;{{cite web|title=「ミシュランガイド東京・横浜・鎌倉2011」を発行　三つ星が14軒、 二つ星が54軒、一つ星が198軒に|url=http://web-cache.stream.ne.jp/www09/michelin/guide/tokyo/|publisher=Michelin Japan|accessdate=7 February 2011|date=24 November 2010|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
