The '''United States of America''' (commonly called the '''United States''', the '''U.S.''', the '''USA''', '''America''', and the '''States''') is a [[federalism|federal]] [[republic|constitutional republic]] consisting of [[U.S. state|fifty states]] and a [[federal district]]. The country is situated mostly in central [[North America]], where its [[Contiguous United States|forty-eight contiguous states]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.]], the [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]], lie between the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, [[Borders of the United States|bordered]] by [[Canada]] to the north and [[Mexico]] to the south. The state of [[Alaska]] is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to the east and [[Russia]] to the west across the [[Bering Strait]]. The state of [[Hawaii]] is an [[archipelago]] in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses [[Territories of the United States|several territories]] in the Pacific and [[Caribbean]]. At 3.79&amp;nbsp;million square miles (9.83&amp;nbsp;million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and with over 314 million people, the United States is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|third- or fourth-largest country by total area]], and the third-largest by both land area and [[List of countries by population|population]]. It is one of the world's most [[Multiethnic society|ethnically diverse]] and [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] nations, the product of large-scale [[Immigration to the United States|immigration from many countries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DD&quot;&gt;Adams, J.

[[Paleoindians]] migrated [[Settlement of the Americas|from Asia]] to what is now the United States mainland around 15,000 years ago. The descendent  and isolated [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population was greatly reduced by European contact, primarily by disease after [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] occurred, beginning in the 1500s. The United States itself was initially derived from [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen British colonies]] located along the Atlantic seaboard. On July&amp;nbsp;4, 1776, delegates to the Continental Congress issued the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which proclaimed their right to [[self-determination]] and establishment of a sovereign union. The rebellious states with direct help from [[France]] and several other European powers, defeated the [[British Empire]] in the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], the first successful [[History of colonialism|colonial war of independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Dull, Jonathan R. (2003). &quot;Diplomacy of the Revolution, to 1783&quot;, p. 352, chap. in ''A Companion to the American Revolution'', ed. Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole. Maiden, Mass.: Blackwell, pp. 352–361. ISBN 1-4051-1674-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[United States Constitution]] was adopted on September&amp;nbsp;17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a stronger central government. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], consisting of ten [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] guaranteeing many [[Natural and legal rights|fundamental civil rights and freedoms]], was ratified in 1791.

Through the 19th century, the United States embarked on a vigorous program of expansion across North America. It displaced native tribes, acquiring the [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana territory]] from France and [[Adams–Onís Treaty|Florida]] from Spain; annexed the [[Republic of Texas]] in 1845, leading to [[Mexican-American war|war]] in which it conquered a [[mexican cession|large area of Mexico]]; and [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]] from Russia in 1867. During the early territorial expansion, significant disputes between the [[Southern United States|agrarian slave-holding South]] and [[Northern United States|industrial North]] led to the [[American Civil War]]. The North's victory reestablished the Union, leading to the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and ending legalized slavery in the United States. The [[Plains Indian Wars]] relocated remaining tribes onto confined reservations, [[Newlands Resolution|a Congressional Resolution]] annexed the [[Republic of Hawaii]], then the treaty ending the [[Spanish-American War]] ceded [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], as well as the [[Philippines]] (which later became independent). By the end of the nineteenth century, the American national economy was the world's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Maddison, Angus |url= http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/Historical_Statistics/horizontal-file_09-2008.xls |title=Historical Statistics for the World Economy |publisher=The Groningen Growth and Development Centre, Economics Department of the University of Groningen |year=2006 |accessdate=November 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Spanish–American War]] and [[World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I]] confirmed the country's status as a global military power.

In 1507, German [[cartography|cartographer]] [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere [[Americas|&quot;America&quot;]] after Italian explorer and cartographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-24-america-turns-500_N.htm?csp=34 |title= Cartographer Put 'America' on the Map 500 years Ago |work=USA Today |location =Washington, D.C. |date=April 24, 2007 |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first documentary evidence of the phrase ''&quot;United States of America&quot;'' was in an anonymously written essay published in the [[The Virginia Gazette|Virginia Gazette]] newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia on April 6, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;To the inhabitants of Virginia,&quot; by A PLANTER.''

On November&amp;nbsp;15, 1777, the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], which states, &quot;The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'.&quot; The Franco-American treaties of 1778 used &quot;United States of North America&quot;, but from July&amp;nbsp;11, 1778, &quot;United States of America&quot; was used on the country's [[bills of exchange]], and it has been the official name ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=McClure, James |url= http://www.ydr.com/ci_9569289 |title=A Primer: The 'First Capital' Debate |work=York Daily Record |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short form &quot;United States&quot; is also standard. Other common forms include the &quot;U.S.&quot;, the &quot;USA&quot;, and &quot;America&quot;. Colloquial names include the &quot;U.S. of A.&quot; and, internationally, the &quot;States&quot;. &quot;[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]&quot;, a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 1700s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get to Know D.C.|url=http://www.historydc.org/aboutdc.aspx|publisher=Historical Society of Washington, D.C.|accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; derives its origin from [[Christopher Columbus]]; it appears in the name &quot;[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]&quot;.

The standard way to refer to a citizen of the United States is as an &quot;[[Americans|American]]&quot;. &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;American&quot; and &quot;U.S.&quot; are used to refer to the country adjectivally (&quot;American values&quot;, &quot;U.S.&amp;nbsp;forces&quot;). &quot;[[American (word)|American]]&quot; is rarely used in English to refer to subjects not connected with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kenneth G. (1993). ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English''. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 27–28. ISBN 0-231-06989-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase &quot;United States&quot; was originally treated as plural—e.g., &quot;the United States are&quot;—including in the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1865. It became common to treat it as singular—e.g., &quot;the United States is&quot;—after the end of the Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom &quot;these United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html |author=Zimmer, Benjamin |date=November 24, 2005 |title=Life in These, Uh, This United States |publisher=University of Pennsylvania—Language Log |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War and protest politics===
[[File:Martin Luther King&amp;nbsp;- March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] delivering his &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech, 1963.]]
The United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power after World War II during the [[Cold War]], dominating the military affairs of Europe through [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], respectively. While they engaged in [[proxy war]]s and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. The U.S. often opposed [[Third World]] left-wing movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought Communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–53. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] pursued a series of investigations into suspected leftist subversion, while Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] became the figurehead of anticommunist sentiment.

The 1961 Soviet launch of the [[Vostok 1|first manned spaceflight]] prompted President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s call for the United States to be first to land [[Apollo program|&quot;a man on the moon&quot;]], achieved in 1969. Kennedy also faced a [[Cuban Missile Crisis|tense nuclear showdown]] with Soviet forces in Cuba. Meanwhile, the United States experienced sustained economic expansion. Amidst the presence of various [[white nationalist]] groups, a growing [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]] used [[nonviolence]] to confront segregation and discrimination. This was symbolized and led by black Americans such as [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. On the other hand, some [[black nationalist]] groups such as the [[Black Panther Party]] had a more militant scope.

Following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]] in 1963, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act of 1965]] were passed under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dallek |first= Robert |year=2004 |title=Lyndon B.

A widespread [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural movement]] grew, fueled by [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the war]], [[black nationalism]], and the [[sexual revolution]]. [[Betty Friedan]], [[Gloria Steinem]], and others led a [[Feminism in the United States|new wave of feminism]] that sought political, social, and economic equality for women.

As a result of the [[Watergate scandal]], in 1974 Nixon became the first U.S. president to resign, to avoid being [[impeachment|impeached]] on charges including obstruction of justice and abuse of power. The [[Jimmy Carter]] administration of the late 1970s was marked by [[stagflation]] and the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. The election of [[Ronald Reagan]] as president in 1980 heralded a [[Conservatism in the United States|rightward shift in American politics]], reflected in major changes in [[Reaganomics|taxation and spending priorities]]. His second term in office brought both the [[Iran–Contra affair|Iran-Contra scandal]] and significant [[Cold War (1985–1991)|diplomatic progress with the Soviet Union]]. The subsequent Soviet collapse ended the Cold War.

===Contemporary era===
[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|[[World Trade Center]], [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]]]
Under President [[George H. W. Bush]], the United States took a lead role in the UN–sanctioned [[Gulf War]]. The longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history—from March 1991 to March 2001—encompassed the [[Bill Clinton]] administration and the [[dot-com bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Voyce, Bill|url=http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003700&amp;print=1|title=Why the Expansion of the 1990s Lasted So Long|publisher=Iowa Workforce Information Network|date=2006-08-21|accessdate=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Paula Jones|civil lawsuit]] and [[Lewinsky scandal|sex scandal]] led to [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton's impeachment]] in 1998, but he remained in office. The [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], one of the closest in American history, was resolved by a [[Bush v. Gore|U.S. Supreme Court decision]]—[[George W. Bush]], son of George H. W. Bush, became president.

On [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists struck the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[The Pentagon]] near Washington, D.C., killing nearly three thousand people. In response, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] launched the global [[War on Terror]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invading Afghanistan]] and removing the [[Taliban]] government and al-Qaeda training camps. [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban insurgents]] continue to fight a guerrilla war. In 2002, the Bush administration began to press for regime change in [[Iraq]] on [[Rationale for the Iraq War|controversial grounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Many Europeans Oppose War in Iraq|work=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-02-14-eu-survey.htm|date=2003-02-14|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Coalition of the willing|Forces led by the U.S.]] [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded Iraq]] in 2003, ousting [[Saddam Hussein]]. In 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] caused severe destruction along much of the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], devastating [[New Orleans]]. In 2008, amid a global [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]], the first African American president, [[Barack Obama]], was elected. Major [[Health care reform in the United States|health care]] and [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|financial system]] reforms were enacted two years later. In 2011, a raid by [[Navy SEAL]]s in [[Pakistan]] [[Death of Osama bin Laden|killed]] al-Qaeda leader [[Osama bin Laden]]. The [[Iraq War]] officially ended with the pullout of the remaining U.S. troops from the country in December 2011.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Federal government of the United States|state governments of the United States|elections in the United States}}
The United States is the world's oldest surviving [[federation]]. It is a [[constitutional republic]] and [[representative democracy]], &quot;in which [[majority rule]] is tempered by [[minority rights]] protected by [[Law of the United States|law]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scheb, John M., and John M. Scheb II (2002). ''An Introduction to the American Legal System''. Florence, KY: Delmar, p. 6. ISBN 0-7668-2759-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The government is regulated by a system of [[separation of powers|checks and balances]] defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm | title=Constitution of the United States | publisher=The Office of the Secretary of the Senate | work=The Office of the Secretary of the Senate | accessdate=February 11, 2012 | author=Killian, Johnny H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Federalism#United States|American federalist system]], citizens are usually subject to [[Political divisions of the United States|three levels of government]], federal, state, and local; the [[Local government in the United States|local government]]'s duties are commonly split between [[County (United States)|county]] and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a [[plurality voting system|plurality vote]] of citizens by district. There is no [[proportional representation]] at the federal level, and it is very rare at lower levels.

{{triple image|right|Capitol Building Full View.jpg|195|WhiteHouseSouthFacade.JPG|115|USSupremeCourtWestFacade.JPG|120|&lt;center&gt;[[U.S. Capitol]] seats the [[United States Congress|Congress]]&lt;br&gt;[[U.S. Senate|Senate]], left N. wing; the [[U.S. House|House]], right|&lt;center&gt;The [[White House]] used by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]]|&lt;center&gt;[[Supreme Court]] and offices for nine [[U.S. Supreme Court|Justices]]&lt;/center&gt;}}  

The federal government is composed of three branches:
* [[Legislature|Legislative]]: The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[United States Congress|Congress]], made up of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], makes [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legislative Branch|publisher=United States Diplomatic Mission to Germany|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/government-legislative.htm|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the power of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove sitting members of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Process for impeachment|publisher=ThinkQuest|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/25673/process.htm|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Executive (government)|Executive]]: The [[President of the United States|president]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can veto [[bill (proposed law)|legislative bills]] before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the [[United States Cabinet|members of the Cabinet]] (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Executive Branch|publisher=The White House|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/executive-branch|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Judiciary|Judicial]]: The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and lower [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a [[congressional district]] for a two-year term. House seats are [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] among the states by population every tenth year. As of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], seven states have the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, has fifty-three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives Based on the 2010 Census|publisher=US Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/maps/apport2010_map1.pdf|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected [[at-large]] to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office [[Term limits in the United States|no more than twice]]. The president is [[United States presidential election|not elected by direct vote]], but by an indirect [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Electoral College|publisher=National Archives|url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court, led by the [[Chief Justice of the United States]], has nine members, who serve for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond politics: Why Supreme Court justices are appointed for life|first=Roger|last=Cossack|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/07/columns/cossack.scotus.07.12/|publisher=CNN|date=July 12, 2000|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; [[Nebraska]] uniquely has a [[unicameral]] legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/407533/Nebraska/78826/Agriculture#toc78830&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.

The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] protects the right to the &quot;great writ&quot; of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] guarantees the [[Jury trial#United States|right to a jury trial]] in all criminal cases. [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Amendments to the Constitution]] require the approval of three-fourths of the states. The Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States Constitution|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first ten amendments, which make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to [[judicial review]] and any law ruled in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was declared by the Supreme Court in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marbury v.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For elective offices at most levels, state-administered [[primary election]]s choose the major party nominees for subsequent [[general election]]s. Since the [[United States presidential election, 1856|general election of 1856]], the major parties have been the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|founded in 1824]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], [[History of the United States Republican Party|founded in 1854]].

Within American [[political culture]], the Republican Party is considered center-right or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and the Democratic Party is considered center-left or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grigsby |first=Ellen|title=Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |isbn=0-495-50112-3 | pages = 106–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states of the [[Northeastern United States#Politics|Northeast]] and [[Western United States#Politics|West Coast]] and some of the Great Lakes states, known as &quot;[[Red states and blue states|blue states]]&quot;, are relatively liberal.

In the [[112th United States Congress]], the Senate consists of 51 Democrats, two [[independent (politician)|independents]] who caucus with the Democrats, and 47 Republicans; the House consists of 242 Republicans and 192 Democrats—one seat is vacant.

The coastal plain of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] seaboard gives way further inland to [[deciduous]] forests and the rolling hills of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. The [[Appalachian Mountains]] divide the eastern seaboard from the [[Great Lakes]] and the grasslands of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]–[[Missouri River]], the world's [[List of rivers by length|fourth longest river system]], runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile [[prairie]] of the [[Great Plains]] stretches to the west, interrupted by [[U.S. Interior Highlands|a highland region]] in the southeast. 

The [[Rocky Mountains]], at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000&amp;nbsp;feet (4,300&amp;nbsp;m) in [[Colorado]]. Farther west are the rocky [[Great Basin]] and deserts such as the [[Chihuahua Desert|Chihuahua]] and [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]]. The [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] mountain ranges run close to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]], both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet. 

The lowest and highest points in the [[Contiguous United States|continental]] United States are in the state of [[California]], and only about 80 miles apart. At 20,320&amp;nbsp;feet (6,194&amp;nbsp;m), Alaska's [[Mount McKinley]] is the tallest peak in the country and in North America. Active [[volcano]]es are common throughout Alaska's [[Alexander Archipelago|Alexander]] and [[Aleutian Islands]], and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The [[supervolcano]] underlying [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/supervolcano/under/under.html |title=Supervolcano: What's Under Yellowstone? |author=O'Hanlon, Larry |publisher=Discovery Channel |accessdate=June 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]], the climate ranges from [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] in the north to [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] in the south. The southern tip of [[Florida]] is tropical, as is Hawaii. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains are [[alpine climate|alpine]]. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in [[coastal California]], and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] in coastal [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the [[Gulf of Mexico]] are prone to [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]], and most of the world's [[tornado]]es occur within the country, mainly in the Midwest's [[Tornado Alley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Perkins, Sid |url= http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070701131631/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp |archivedate=July 1, 2007 |title=Tornado Alley, USA |accessdate=September 20, 2006 |date=May 11, 2002 |work= Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is a [[federation|federal union]] of fifty states. The original thirteen states were the successors of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] that rebelled against British rule. Early in the country's history, three new states were organized on territory separated from the claims of the existing states: [[Kentucky]] from [[Virginia]]; [[Tennessee]] from [[North Carolina]]; and [[Maine]] from [[Massachusetts]]. Most of the other states have been carved from territories obtained through war or purchase by the U.S. government. One set of exceptions includes [[Vermont]], [[Texas]], and [[Hawaii]]: each was an independent republic before joining the union. During the [[American Civil War]], [[West Virginia]] broke away from Virginia. The most recent state—Hawaii—achieved statehood on August 21, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/10/18/special/story4.html |title='The Goal Was Democracy for All |work= Honolulu Star-Bulletin |author=Borreca, Richard |date=October 18, 1999 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states [[Texas v. White|do not have the right]] to unilaterally [[secession|secede]] from the union.

The states compose the vast bulk of the U.S. land mass; the two other areas considered integral parts of the country are the District of Columbia, the [[federal district]] where the capital, Washington, is located; and [[Palmyra Atoll]], an uninhabited but [[territories of the United States|incorporated territory]] in the Pacific Ocean. The United States also possesses five major overseas territories: [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] in the Caribbean; and [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(36) and 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(38) U.S. Federal Code, Immigration and Nationality Act. {{USC|8|1101a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those born in the major territories (except for American Samoa) possess [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30527.pdf| title = Presidential Elections in the United States: A Primer (Page 7)| accessdate = January 18, 2010| date = April 17, 2000| publisher = United States Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; American citizens residing in the territories have many of the same rights and responsibilities as citizens residing in the states; however, they are generally exempt from federal income tax, may not vote for president, and have only [[Delegate (United States Congress)|nonvoting representation in the U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, James B.

American [[public education]] is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the [[United States Department of Education]] through restrictions on federal grants. Children are required in most states to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, [[kindergarten]] or [[first grade]]) until they turn eighteen (generally bringing them through [[twelfth grade]], the end of [[high school]]); some states allow students to leave school at sixteen or seventeen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d02/dt150.asp |title=Ages for Compulsory School Attendance... |accessdate = 2007-06-10 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Education, National Center for Education Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 12% of children are enrolled in [[parochial school|parochial]] or [[nonsectarian]] [[private school]]s.

Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and in thirty-three states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a [[Furman v. Georgia|U.S. Supreme Court ruling]] striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, the Court ruled that under appropriate circumstances capital punishment may be imposed; since then there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/views-executions|title=Searchable Execution Database
|accessdate=October 10, 2012|publisher=[[Death Penalty Information Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four state legislatures in the modern era have abolished the death penalty, though two of those laws (in New Mexico and Connecticut) were not retroactive. Additionally, state courts in Massachusetts and New York struck down death penalty statutes and their legislatures took no action in response. In 2010, the country had the fifth highest number of executions in the world, following China, [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-penalty-international-perspective#interexec |title=Executions Around the World|accessdate = 2011-07-23|year=2010 |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Same-sex marriage in the United States|Same-sex marriage]] is a contentious issue. Some states permit [[Civil union in the United States|civil unions]] or [[Domestic partnership in the United States|domestic partnerships]] in lieu of marriage. Since 2003, [[Same-sex marriage law in the United States by state|several states]] have legalized gay marriage as the result of judicial or legislative action. Meanwhile, the [[Defense of Marriage Act|federal government]] and a majority of states define marriage as between a man and a woman and/or explicitly prohibit same-sex marriage.

The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]]. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of [[sound film]]'s development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around [[Hollywood]], California. 

Director [[D. W.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]] established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. [[Mark Twain]] and poet [[Walt Whitman]] were major figures in the century's second half; [[Emily Dickinson]], virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom|Bloom, Harold]]. 1999.

The [[Beat Generation]] writers opened up new literary approaches, as have [[postmodern literature|postmodernist]] authors such as [[John Barth]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], and [[Don DeLillo]].

The [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]], led by Thoreau and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], established the first major [[American philosophy|American philosophical movement]]. After the Civil War, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and then [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] were leaders in the development of [[pragmatism]]. In the 20th century, the work of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] and [[Richard Rorty]], and later [[Noam Chomsky]], brought [[analytic philosophy]] to the fore of American philosophical academia. [[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]] led a revival of [[political philosophy]].

In the visual arts, the [[Hudson River School]] was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European [[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]. The [[Realist visual arts|realist]] paintings of [[Thomas Eakins]] are now widely celebrated. The 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York City, an exhibition of European [[modern art|modernist art]], shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Milton W. (1988 1963). ''The Story of the Armory Show''. New York: Abbeville. ISBN 0-89659-795-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Marsden Hartley]], and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the [[abstract expressionism]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] and the [[pop art]] of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then [[postmodernism]] has brought fame to American architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Frank Gehry]].

One of the first major promoters of [[Theater of the United States|American theater]] was impresario [[P. T. Barnum]], who began operating a lower [[Manhattan]] entertainment complex in 1841. The team of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan and Hart]] produced a series of popular [[musical theatre|musical]] comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; the songs of musical theater composers such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]] have become [[Traditional pop music|pop standards]]. Playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Edward Albee]], and [[August Wilson]].

Though little known at the time, [[Charles Ives]]'s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as [[Henry Cowell]] and [[John Cage]] created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. [[Aaron Copland]] and [[George Gershwin]] developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. [[Choreography|Choreographers]] [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Martha Graham]] helped create [[modern dance]], while [[George Balanchine]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] were leaders in 20th-century ballet. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of [[photography]], with major photographers including [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], and [[Ansel Adams]]. The newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[American comic book|comic book]] are both U.S. innovations.

===Food===
{{Main|Cuisine of the United States}}
Mainstream [[American cuisine]] is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain. Traditional American cuisine uses indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup, which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. 

Slow-cooked pork and beef barbecue, crab cakes, potato chips, and chocolate chip cookies are distinctively American foods. [[Soul food]], developed by African slaves, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. [[Syncretism|Syncretic]] cuisines such as [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana creole]], [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]], and [[Tex-Mex]] are regionally important.

Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] sources are widely consumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;IFT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/what-when-and-where-americans-eat-in-2003|author=Klapthor, James N. |title=What, When, and Where Americans Eat in 2003 |publisher=Newswise/Institute of Food Technologists |date=2003-08-23|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans generally prefer coffee to tea.

[[Baseball]] has been regarded as the [[national sport]] since the late 19th century, while [[American football]] is now by several measures the most popular spectator sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Krane, David K. |title=Professional Football Widens Its Lead Over Baseball as Nation's Favorite Sport |url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/Insights/HarrisVault8482.aspx?PID=337 |publisher=Harris Interactive |date=2002-10-30|accessdate=2007-09-14}} Maccambridge, Michael (2004). ''America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation''. New York: Random House. ISBN 0-375-50454-0.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basketball]] and [[ice hockey]] are the country's next two leading professional team sports. [[College football]] and [[College basketball|basketball]] attract large audiences. [[Boxing]] and [[horse racing]] were once the most watched [[individual sport]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cowen, Tyler, and Kevin Grier |title=What Would the End of Football Look Like?|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7559458/cte-concussion-crisis-economic-look-end-football|publisher=Grantland/ESPN|date=2012-02-09|accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have been eclipsed by [[golf]] and [[auto racing]], particularly [[NASCAR]]. [[Association football|Soccer]] continues to grow in the United States, as it is played widely at the youth and amateur levels. [[Tennis]] and many outdoor sports are popular as well.

While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, [[volleyball]], [[skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]], and [[cheerleading]] are American inventions. Basketball was invented in Massachusetts by Canadian-born [[James Naismith]]. [[Lacrosse]] and [[surfing]] arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact. Eight [[Olympic Games]] have [[United States at the Olympics|taken place in the United States.]] The United States has won 2,301 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]], more than any other country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Time Medal Standings, 1896–2004 | publisher = Information Please|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0115108.html | accessdate=2007-06-14}} {{cite web|title=Distribution of Medals—2008 Summer Games| publisher = Fact Monster|url=http://www.factmonster.com/sports/olympics/2008/distribution-medals-summer-games.html| accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 253 in the [[Winter Olympic Games]], the second most by 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Time Medal Standings, 1924–2006|publisher=Information Please|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipsa/A0115207.html|accessdate=2007-06-14}} {{cite web|title=Olympic Medals|publisher=Vancouver Organizing Committee|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-medals/|accessdate=2010-03-02}} Norway is first.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement systems===
{{main|United States customary units|Metrication in the United States}}
Although the United States authorized the [[Metrication in the United States|metric system]] in 1866 and was one of the original 17 signatory nations to the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875, the nation primarily relies on the [[United States customary units]], very similar to the British [[imperial units]] system and also derived from the historical [[English units]] system, employing [[international foot|feet]], [[international mile|miles]], and [[Fahrenheit|degrees Fahrenheit]]. Distinctive units include the [[U.S. gallon]] and [[U.S. pint]] volume measurements. According to the CIA Factbook, the United States is one of three countries that has not adopted the [[International System of Units]] (SI) [[metric system]] as their official system of weights and measures. However, SI predominates in science, medicine, technology, and international commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html|title=Appendix G: Weights and Measures|publisher=CIA|work=The World Factbook|date=|accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
