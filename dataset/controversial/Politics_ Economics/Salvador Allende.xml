'''Salvador Allende Gossens'''  ({{IPA-es|salbaˈðoɾ aˈʝende ˈɣosens}}; 26 June 1908 – 11 September 1973) was a [[Chilean people|Chilean]] physician and politician, known as the first [[Marxist]] to become president of a [[Latin America]]n country through open elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3089846.stm |publisher=BBC   |title=Profile of Salvador Allende | date=8 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allende's involvement in [[Chilean politics|Chilean political life]] spanned a period of nearly forty years. As a member of the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]], he was a [[Senate of Chile|senator]], [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|deputy]] and [[cabinet minister]]. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1952|1952]], [[Chilean presidential election, 1958|1958]], and [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964]] elections. In [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970]], he won the presidency in a close three-way race, formally elected by Congress as no candidate had gained a majority.

Allende adopted the policy of [[nationalization]] of industries and [[collectivization]]. On 11 September 1973 the military [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|staged a coup]] against Allende.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communism: A History|last=Pipes|first= Richard|coauthors= |year=2003|publisher=The Modern Library|isbn=0-8129-6864-6|page= 138|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907929,00.html|journal=Time Magazine|title=Chile: The Bloody End of a Marxist Dream...

== Early life ==
Allende was born on 26 June 1908&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.fundacionsalvadorallende.cl/salvador-allende/linea-del-tiempo/]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Valparaíso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salvador-allende.cl/biografia/Trayectoria.pdf |title=Biography of Allende |publisher=salvador-allende.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Salvador Allende Castro and Laura Gossens Uribe. [[Allende family|Allende's family]] belonged to the Chilean [[upper class]] and had a long tradition of political involvement in progressive and [[Liberalism|liberal]] causes. His grandfather was a prominent physician and a [[social reform]]ist who founded one of the first [[Secularity|secular]] schools in Chile.&lt;ref name=Guzman&gt;[[Patricio Guzmán]], ''[[Salvador Allende (film)|Salvador Allende]]'' (film documentary, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Salvador Allende was of [[Belgian]] and [[Basque people|Basque]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealog.cl/Chile/A/Allende/ |title=?}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; descent.

Allende attended high school at the Liceo Eduardo de la Barra in Valparaíso. As a teenager, his main intellectual and political influence came from the shoe-maker [[Juan De Marchi]], an Italian-born [[anarchist]].&lt;ref name=Guzman/&gt; Allende was a talented athlete in his youth, being a member of the [[Everton de Viña del Mar]] sports club (named after the more famous English football club [[Everton F.C.|of the same name]] and which regularly competes at the highest level in Chilean football), where he is said to have excelled at the [[long jump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/aug/03/everton-chile-football/ | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=A hundred years on, Everton face Everton for the first time | date=3 August 2010 | first=Mark | last=Tallentire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allende then graduated with a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] in 1926 from the [[University of Chile]].&lt;ref name=Guzman/&gt;

He co-founded a section of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (founded in 1933 with [[Marmaduque Grove]] and others) in [[Valparaíso]]&lt;ref name=Guzman/&gt; and became its chairman. He married Hortensia Bussi with whom he had three daughters. In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis ''Higiene Mental y Delincuencia'' (Crime and Mental Hygiene) in which he criticized [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elclarin.cl/fpa/temas/20.html |title=Unmasked defamatory libel on Salvador Allende |date=27 May 2005}} with link to thesis, on the [[El Clarín de Chile|Clarin's]] website {{en icon}} (Spanish version available)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Allende was in charge of the electoral campaign of the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]] headed by [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]].&lt;ref name=Guzman/&gt; The Popular Front's slogan was &quot;Bread, a Roof and Work!&quot;&lt;ref name=Guzman/&gt; After its electoral victory, he became [[Minister of Health (Chile)|Minister of Health]] in the [[Reformist]] Popular Front government which was dominated by the [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radicals]].&lt;ref name=Guzman/&gt; While serving in this position, Allende was responsible for the passage of a wide range of progressive social reforms, including safety laws protecting workers in the factories, higher pensions for widows, maternity care, and free lunch programmes for schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Allende by Hedda Garza&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon entering the government, Allende relinquished his parliamentary seat for Valparaíso, which he had won in 1937. Around that time, he wrote ''La Realidad Médico Social de Chile'' (''The social and medical reality of Chile''). After the [[Kristallnacht]] in [[Nazi Germany]], Allende and other members of the Parliament sent a [[telegram]] to [[Adolf Hitler]] denouncing the persecution of [[History of Jews in Germany|Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elclarin.cl/fpa/pdf/p_020605.pdf |title=Telegram protesting against the persecution of Jews in Germany |publisher=El Clarín de Chile's}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following President Aguirre Cerda's death in 1941, he was again elected deputy while the Popular Front was renamed [[Democratic Alliance (Chile)|Democratic Alliance]].

In 1945, Allende became senator for the [[Valdivia Province|Valdivia]], [[Llanquihue Province|Llanquihue]], [[Chiloé Province|Chiloé]], [[Aisén Province|Aisén]] and [[Magallanes Province|Magallanes]] provinces; then for [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]] and [[Antofagasta]] in 1953; for [[Aconcagua]] and [[Valparaíso]] in 1961; and once more for Chiloé, Aisén and Magallanes in 1969. He became president of the [[Chilean Senate]] in 1966.

[[File:Salvador Allende.jpg|thumb|Salvador Allende in 1964.]]
His three unsuccessful bids for the presidency (in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1952|1952]], [[Chilean presidential election, 1958|1958]] and [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 election]]s) prompted Allende to joke that his epitaph would be &quot;Here lies the next President of Chile.&quot; In 1952, as candidate for the ''[[Frente de Acción Popular]]'' (Popular Action Front, FRAP), he obtained only 5.4% of the votes, partly due to a division within socialist ranks over support for [[Carlos Ibáñez]]. In 1958, again as the FRAP candidate, Allende obtained 28.5% of the vote. This time, his defeat was attributed to votes lost to the [[populism|populist]] Antonio Zamorano. In 1964, once more as the FRAP candidate, he lost again, polling 38.6% of the votes against 55.6% for [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]]. As it became clear that the election would be a race between Allende and Frei, the political [[Right-wing politics|right]]{{spaced ndash}}which initially had backed [[Social Democrat Radical Party|Radical]] Julio Durán– settled for Frei as &quot;the lesser evil&quot;.

== Relationship with the Chilean Communist Party ==
Allende had a close relationship with the [[Communist Party of Chile|Chilean Communist Party]] from the beginning of his political career. On his fourth (and successful) bid for the presidency, the Communist Party appointed him as the alternate for its own candidate, the world-renowned poet [[Pablo Neruda]].

During his presidential term, Allende took positions held by the Communists, in opposition to the views of the [[Socialist Party of Chile|socialists]]. Some argue, however, that this was reversed at the end of his period in office.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Rojas Sanchez; Columna Centenaria, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Election ==
[[Image:Allende supporters.jpg|300px|thumb|Chilean workers marching in support of Allende in 1964.]]
{{Main|Chilean presidential election, 1970}}
Allende won the 1970 Chilean presidential election as leader of the [[Unidad Popular]] (&quot;Popular Unity&quot;) coalition. On 4 September 1970, he obtained a narrow [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of 36.2 percent to 34.9 percent over [[Jorge Alessandri]], a former president, with 27.8 percent going to a third candidate ([[Radomiro Tomic]]) of the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC), whose electoral platform was similar to Allende's. According to the Chilean Constitution of the time, if no presidential candidate obtained a majority of the popular vote, Congress would choose one of the two candidates with the highest number of votes as the winner. Tradition was for Congress to vote for the candidate with the highest popular vote, regardless of margin. Indeed, former president Jorge Alessandri had been elected in 1958 with only 31.6 percent of the popular vote, defeating Allende.

One month after the election, on 20 October, while the senate had still to reach a decision and negotiations were actively in place between the Christian Democrats and the Popular Unity, General [[René Schneider]], Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, was shot resisting a kidnap attempt by a group led by General [[Roberto Viaux]]. Hospitalized, he died of his wounds three days later, on 23 October. Viaux's kidnapping plan had been supported by the CIA, although the then U.S. National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] claims to have ordered the plans postponed at the last moment. Many believe Kissinger's statement to be false and evidence points towards CIA director [[Richard Helms]] following orders directly from President Nixon to do whatever was necessary in order “to get rid of him”, referring to Allende. Nixon handed over a blank check to Helms, which allowed him to use full discretion in ridding Chile of Allende’s presence and “making the economy scream”. Schneider was a defender of the [[Schneider Doctrine|&quot;constitutionalist&quot; doctrine]] that the army's role is exclusively professional, its mission being to protect the country's sovereignty and not to interfere in politics.

General Schneider's death was widely disapproved of and, for the time, ended military opposition to Allende,&lt;ref name=Falcoff&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Falcoff |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=10612 |title=Kissinger and Chile originally |publisher=[[Commentary Magazine]] |date= 10 November 2003 |accessdate=21 September 2006 |publisher=frontpagemag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom the parliament finally chose on 24 October. On 26 October, President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]] named General [[Carlos Prats]] as commander in chief of the army to replace René Schneider.

Allende assumed the presidency on 3 November 1970 after signing a ''Statute of Constitutional Guarantees'' proposed by the Christian Democrats in return for their support in Congress. In an extensive interview with [[Régis Debray]] in 1972, Allende explained his reasons for agreeing to the guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Régis Debray |title=The Chilean Revolution: Conversations with Allende |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have interpreted Allende's responses as an admission that signing the ''Statute'' was only a tactical move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elcato.org/node/2108 |title=Como Allende destruyo la democracia en Chile |publisher=elcato.org}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency ==
{{Main|Chile under Allende}}

Upon assuming power, Allende began to carry out his platform of implementing a socialist programme called ''La vía chilena al socialismo'' (&quot;the Chilean Path to Socialism&quot;). This included [[nationalization]] of large-scale industries (notably [[copper mining]] and banking), and government administration of the health care system, educational system (with the help of an [[U.S.]] educator, Jane A. Hobson-Gonzalez from [[Kokomo, Indiana]]), a programme of free milk for children in the schools and shanty towns of Chile, and an expansion of the land seizure and redistribution already begun under his predecessor [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web |url=http://icarito.latercera.cl/icarito/2003/912/pag1a.htm  |title=La Unidad Popular |publisher=icarito.latercera.cl |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050307181050/http://icarito.latercera.cl/icarito/2003/912/pag1a.htm |archivedate = 7 March 2005}}, archived 7 March 2005 on the [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; who had nationalized between one-fifth and one-quarter of all the properties listed for takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Collier &amp; Sater, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The Allende government's intention was to seize all holdings of more than eighty thousand irrigated hectares.&lt;ref&gt;Faundez, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of Chile's poorest citizens;{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalised enterprises or on public work projects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Allende’s first step in early 1971 was to raise minimum wages (in real terms) for blue-collar workers by 37%-41% and 8%-10% for white-collar workers. Educational, food, and housing assistance was significantly expanded, with public-housing starts going up twelvefold and eligibility for free milk extended from age 6 to age 15. A year later, blue-collar wages were raised by 27% in real terms and white-collar wages became fully indexed.&lt;ref&gt;The Macroeconomics of populism in Latin America by Rüdiger Dornbusch and Sebastian Edwards&lt;/ref&gt; Price controls were also set up, while the Allende Government introduced a system of distribution networks through various agencies (including local committees on supply and prices) to ensure that the new rules were adhered to by shopkeepers.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Latin America Volume VIII edited by Leslie Bethell&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Minister of Agriculture, Jacques Chonchol, promised to expropriate all estates which were larger than eighty “basic” hectares. This promise was kept, with no farm in Chile exceeding this limit by the end of 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyofchile&quot;&gt;A History of Chile, 1808–1994, by Simon Collier and William F. Sater&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allende Government also sought to bring the arts (both serious and popular) to the mass of the Chilean population by funding a number of cultural endeavours. With eighteen-year olds and illiterates now granted the right to vote, mass participation in decision-making was encouraged by the Allende government, with traditional hierarchical structures now challenged by socialist egalitarianism. The Allende Government was also able to draw upon the idealism of its supporters, with teams of &quot;Allendistas&quot; travelling into the countryside and shanty towns to perform volunteer work.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyofchile&quot; /&gt;

Social spending was dramatically increased, particularly for housing, education, and health, while a major effort was made to redistribute wealth to poorer Chileans. As a result of new initiatives in nutrition and health, together with higher wages, many poorer Chileans were able to feed themselves and clothe themselves better than they had been able to before. Public access to the social security system was increased, while state benefits such as family allowances were raised significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyofchile&quot; /&gt;

Chilean presidents were allowed a maximum term of six years, which may explain Allende's haste to restructure the economy. Not only was a major restructuring program organized (the ''[[Vuskovic plan]]''), he had to make it a success if a Socialist successor to Allende was going to be elected. In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Minister of the Economy [[Pedro Vuskovic]]'s expansive monetary policy were highly favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). However by 1972, the Chilean ''escudo'' had an inflation rate of 140%. The average Real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of 5.6% (&quot;negative growth&quot;); and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined [Flores, 1997: source requires title/publisher]. The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing, together with the &quot;disappearance&quot; of basic commodities from supermarket shelves, led to the rise of [[black market]]s in rice, beans, sugar, and flour.&lt;ref name=icarito-comienzan&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web |url=http://icarito.latercera.cl/icarito/2003/912/pag1b.htm  |title=Comienzan los problemas |publisher=Enciclopedia Escolar Icarito |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030922064807/http://icarito.latercera.cl/icarito/2003/912/pag1b.htm |archivedate = 22 September 2003}}. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]], 22 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean economy also suffered as a result of a US campaign against the Allende government.&lt;ref name=&quot;covert&quot;&gt;United States Senate Report (1975) &quot;Covert Action in Chile, 1963–1973&quot; ''U.S. Government Printing Office'' Washington. D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Allende government announced it would default on [[debt]]s owed to international creditors and foreign governments. Allende also froze all prices while raising salaries. His implementation of these policies was strongly opposed by landowners, employers, businessmen and transporters associations, and some civil servants and professional unions. The rightist opposition was led by National Party, the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1973 was displeased with the direction of educational policy),&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web |title=http://www.iglesia.cl/iglesiachile/2003/1973/aplenenu.html |title=Declaración de la Asamblea Plenaria del Episcopado sobre la Escuela Nacional Unificada |date=11 April 1973 |accessdate=21 September 2006 |publisher=Conferencia Episcopal de Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]]. There were growing tensions with foreign [[multinational corporation]]s and the government of the United States.

Allende also undertook [[Project Cybersyn]], a system of networked [[telex]] machines and computers. Cybersyn was developed by British [[cybernetics]] expert [[Anthony Stafford Beer|Stafford Beer]]. The network transmitted data from factories to the government in Santiago, allowing for economic planning in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;Eden Medina, [http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/edenm/publications/publications.html &quot;Designing Freedom, Regulating a Nation: Socialist Cybernetics in Allende's Chile,&quot;] Journal of Latin American Studies 38 (2006):571–606.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Chile re-established diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]], joining [[Politics of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Government of Canada|Canada]] in rejecting a previously-established [[Organization of American States]] convention prohibiting governments in the [[Western Hemisphere]] from establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. Shortly afterward, Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] made a month-long visit to Chile. Originally the visit was supposed to be one week, however Castro enjoyed Chile, and one week turned to another.

October 1972 saw the first of what were to be a wave of strikes. The strikes were led first by truckers, and later by small businessmen, some (mostly professional) unions and some student groups. Other than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day strike was to induce Allende to bring the head of the army, general [[Carlos Prats]], into the government as Interior Minister.&lt;ref name=icarito-comienzan/&gt;  Allende also instructed the government to begin requisitioning trucks in order to keep the nation from coming to a halt. Government supporters also helped to mobilize trucks and buses but violence served as a deterrent to full mobilization, even with police protection for the strike breakers. Allende's actions were eventually declared unlawful by the Chilean appeals court and the government was ordered to return trucks to their owners.&lt;ref&gt;Edy Kaufman, &quot;Crisis in Allende's Chile: New Perspectives&quot;, Praeger Publishers, New York, 1988. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this presidency racial tensions between the poor descendants of indigenous people, who supported Allende's reforms, and the white settler elite increased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gott]].[http://www.guardian.co.uk/venezuela/story/0,,1948020,00.html Latin America is preparing to settle accounts with its white settler elite]. [[The Guardian|Guardian Unlimited]], 15 November 2006. Retrieved 22 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allende raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971, but these wage hikes were negated by the in-tandem inflation of Chile's [[fiat currency]]. Although price rises had also been high under Frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, August 1972. In the period 1970–72, while Allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%.&lt;ref&gt;Figures are from November 1986, pp. 4–12, tables 1.1 &amp; 1.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Export income fell due to a hard hit copper industry: the price of copper on international markets fell by almost a third, and post-nationalization copper production fell as well. Copper is Chile's single most important export (more than half of Chile's export receipts were from this sole commodity&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvelt, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;). The price of copper fell from a peak of $66 per ton in 1970 to only $48–9 in 1971 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Nove, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Chile was already dependent on food imports, and this decline in export earnings coincided with declines in domestic food production following Allende's agrarian reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Tier, Mark, 1973, &quot;Allende Erred&quot;, Nation Review (Melbourne, Australia),  12–18 October&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his presidency, Allende remained at odds with the Chilean Congress, which was dominated by the Christian Democratic Party. The Christian Democrats (who had campaigned on a socialist platform in the 1970 elections, but drifted away from those positions during Allende's presidency, eventually forming a coalition with the [[National Party (Partido Nacional--PN)|National Party]]), continued to accuse Allende of leading Chile toward a Cuban-style dictatorship, and sought to overturn many of his more radical policies. Allende and his opponents in Congress repeatedly accused each other of undermining the Chilean Constitution and acting undemocratically.

Allende's increasingly bold socialist policies (partly in response to pressure from some of the more radical members within his coalition), combined with his close contacts with [[Cuba]], heightened fears in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] began exerting economic pressure on Chile via [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] organizations, and continued to back Allende's opponents in the Chilean Congress. Almost immediately after his election, Nixon directed [[CIA]] and [[U.S. State Department]] officials to &quot;put pressure&quot; on the Allende government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Still&quot;&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/42a/127.html Still Hidden: A Full Record Of What the U.S. Did in Chile], [[Peter Kornbluh]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Sunday 24 October 1999; Page B01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign relations during Allende's presidency==
Allende's Popular Unity government tried to maintain normal relations with the United States. When Chile nationalized its copper industry, Washington cut off U.S. credits and increased its support to opposition. Forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, Chile gained commitments from the [[Soviet Union]] to invest some $400&amp;nbsp;million in Chile in the next six years. Allende's government was disappointed that it received far less economic assistance from the [[USSR]] than it hoped for. Trade between the two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked to the purchase of Soviet equipment. Moreover, credits from the Soviet Union were much less than those provided to the People's Republic of China and countries of [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]]. When Allende visited the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in late 1972 in search of more aid and additional lines of credit, after 3 years of political and economic failure and chaos, he was turned down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=B_T9lNx9EJEC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;dq=soviet+relations+cuba+chile+Frei+allende The USSR and Latin America By Eusebio Mujal-León]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign involvement in Chile during Allende's Presidency ==
=== US involvement ===
{{Main|United States intervention in Chile}}
The possibility of Allende winning Chile's 1970 election was deemed a disaster by a [[Federal government of the United States|US administration]] which wanted to protect US business interests and prevent any spread of Communism during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/archivo_1150_299/rev72_fermandois_ing.pdf |title=Pawn or Player? Chile in the cold war}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1970, President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] informed the CIA that an Allende government in Chile would not be acceptable and authorized $10&amp;nbsp;million to stop Allende from coming to power or unseat him.&lt;ref name=Hinchey/&gt; Henry Kissinger's [[40 Committee]] and the CIA planned to impede Allende's investiture as President of Chile with covert efforts known as ''&quot;Track I&quot;'' and ''&quot;Track II&quot;''; ''Track I'' sought to prevent Allende from assuming power via so-called &quot;parliamentary trickery&quot;, while under the ''Track II'' initiative, the CIA tried to convince key Chilean military officers to carry out a coup.&lt;ref name=Hinchey&gt;[http://foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp Hinchey Report] CIA Activities in Chile. 18 September 2000. Retrieved 18 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Nixon's presidency, U.S. officials attempted to prevent Allende's election by financing political parties aligned with opposition candidate [[Jorge Alessandri]] and supporting strikes in the mining and transportation sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbsnews.cbs.com/stories/2000/09/11/world/main232452.shtml CIA Reveals Covert Acts In Chile, Admits Support For Kidnappers, Links To Pinochet Regime – CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1970 election, the Track I operation attempted to incite Chile's outgoing president, [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], to persuade his party ([[Christian Democracy (Chile)|PDC]]) to vote in Congress for Alessandri.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Under the plan, Alessandri would resign his office immediately after assuming it and call new elections. Eduardo Frei would then be constitutionally able to run again (since the Chilean Constitution did not allow a president to hold two consecutive terms, but allowed multiple non-consecutive ones), and presumably easily defeat Allende. The Chilean [[Chamber of Deputies (Chile)|Congress]] instead chose Allende as President, on the condition that he would sign a &quot;Statute of Constitutional Guarantees&quot; affirming that he would respect and obey the [[Constitution of Chile|Chilean Constitution]], and that his reforms would not undermine any of its elements.

''Track II'' was aborted, as parallel initiatives already underway within the Chilean military rendered it moot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foia.state.gov/Reports/ChurchReport.asp &quot;Church Report. Covert Action in Chile 1963–1973&quot;], 18 December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second term of office of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Bill Clinton]], the CIA acknowledged having played a role in Chilean politics prior to the coup, but its degree of involvement is debated. The [[CIA]] was notified by its Chilean contacts of the impending coup two days in advance, but contends it &quot;played no direct role in&quot; the coup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbsnews.cbs.com/stories/2000/09/11/world/main232452.shtml CIA Reveals Covert Acts In Chile], CBS News, 19 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the internal opposition to Allende's policies came from business sector, and recently-released U.S. government documents confirm that the U.S. indirectly&lt;ref name=&quot;covert&quot;/&gt; funded the truck drivers' strike,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Franklin, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,260382,00.html Files show Chilean blood on US hands], ''The Guardian'', 11 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; which exacerbated the already chaotic economic situation prior to the coup.

The most prominent U.S. corporations in Chile prior to Allende's presidency were the [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda]] and [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott]] copper companies, and [[ITT Corporation]], International Telephone and Telegraph. Both the copper corporations aimed to expand privatized copper production in the city of [[El Teniente]] in the Chilean [[Andes]], the world's largest underground copper mine.&lt;ref name=multinationals&gt;{{cite book |title=Multinational Corporations and the Politics of Dependence: CoppeEncyclopedic r in Chile |last=Moran |first=Theodore |coauthors= |year=1974 |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1968, according to [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]] data, U.S. corporate holdings in Chile amounted to $964&amp;nbsp;million. Anaconda and Kennecott accounted for 28% of U.S. holdings, but ITT had by far the largest holding of any single corporation, with an investment of $200&amp;nbsp;million in Chile.&lt;ref name=multinationals /&gt; In 1970, before Allende was elected, ITT owned 70% of Chitelco, the Chilean Telephone Company and funded [[El Mercurio]], a Chilean right-wing newspaper. Documents released in 2000 by the CIA confirmed that before the elections of 1970, ITT gave $700,000 to Allende's conservative opponent, Jorge Alessandri, with help from the CIA on how to channel the money safely. ITT president [[Harold Geneen]] also offered $1&amp;nbsp;million to the CIA to help defeat Allende in the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namebase.org/chile.html |title=U.S. Responsibility for the Coup in Chile |first=Daniel |last=Brandt |date=28 November 1998 |work=[[NameBase]] |publisher= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64k6he2wX |archivedate=16 January 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After General [[Pinochet]] assumed power, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] told [[President of the United States|President]] Richard Nixon that the U.S. ''&quot;didn't do it,&quot;'' but ''&quot;we helped them...created the conditions as great as possible.&quot;'' (referring to the coup itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB123/chile.htm |title=The Kissinger Telcons: Kissinger Telcons on Chile, National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 123, edited by Peter Kornbluh, posted May&amp;nbsp;26, 2004}} This particular dialogue can be found at {{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB123/Box%2022,%20File%203,%20Telcon,%209-16-73%2011,50%20Mr.%20Kissinger-The%20Pres%202.pdf |title=Telcon: September&amp;nbsp;16, 1973, 11:50&amp;nbsp;am Kissinger Talking to Nixon |accessdate=26 November 2006.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent documents declassified under the [[Administration of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]]'s Chile Declassification Project show that the United States government and the CIA sought the overthrow of Allende in 1970 immediately before he took office (&quot;[[Project FUBELT]]&quot;). Many documents regarding the U.S. intervention in Chile remain classified.

===Soviet involvement===

Material based on reports from the [[Mitrokhin Archive]], the [[KGB]] said of Allende that &quot;he was made to understand the necessity of reorganising Chile's army and intelligence services, and of setting up a relationship between Chile's and the USSR's intelligence services&quot;. It is also claimed that Allende was given $30,000 &quot;in order to solidify the trusted relations&quot; with him.&lt;ref name=Allende&gt;Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article568154.ece How 'weak' Allende was left out in the cold by the KGB] (excerpt from The Mitrokhin Archive Volume II), The Times (UK), 19 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Vasili Mitrokhin]], a former KGB major and senior archivist in the KGB intelligence central KGB office in the Yasenevo area of [[Moscow]], Allende made a personal request for Soviet money through his personal contact, KGB officer Svyatoslav Kuznetsov (codenamed LEONID), who urgently came to Chile from [[Mexico City]] to help Allende.&lt;ref name=Mitrokhin&gt;The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World by Christopher Andrew, 736 pages, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The original allocation of money for these elections through the KGB was $400,000, a personal subsidy of $50,000 was sent directly to Allende, with an additional $100,000 funneled through funds provided to the Chilean Communist Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;/&gt;

Historian [[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] has argued that help from the KGB was a decisive factor, because Allende won by a narrow margin of 39,000 votes of a total of the 3 million cast. After the elections, the KGB director [[Yuri Andropov]] obtained permission for additional money and other resources from the Central Committee of the CPSU to ensure an Allende victory in [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]]. In his request on 24 October, he stated that the KGB &quot;will carry out measures designed to promote the consolidation of Allende's victory and his election to the post of President of the country&quot;. In his KGB file, Allende was reported to have &quot;stated his willingness to co-operate on a confidential basis and provide any necessary assistance, since he considered himself a friend of the Soviet Union&quot;. He willingly shared political information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitrokhin&quot;/&gt;

Andrew writes that regular Soviet contact with Allende after his election was maintained by his KGB case officer, Svyatoslav Kuznetsov, who was instructed by KGB's the 'Centre' to &quot;exert a favorable influence on Chilean government policy&quot;. Allende was said to have reacted &quot;positively.&quot;

Political and moral support came mostly through the Communist Party and unions. For instance, Allende received the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] from the Soviet Union in 1972. However, there were some fundamental differences between Allende and Soviet political analysts who believed that some violence – or measures that those analysts &quot;theoretically considered to be just&quot; – should have been used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonov&quot;/&gt; According to Andrew's account of the Mitrokhin archives, &quot;In the KGB's view, Allende's fundamental error was his unwillingness to use force against his opponents. Without establishing complete control over all the machinery of the State, his hold on power could not be secure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allende&quot;/&gt;

Declarations from KGB General [[Nikolai Leonov]], former Deputy Chief of the First Chief Directorate of the KGB, confirmed that the Soviet Union supported Allende's government economically, politically and militarily.&lt;ref name=Leonov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/lang_2/doc_1140.html |title=Soviet intelligence in Latin America during the Cold War – Lectures by General Nikolai Leonov |publisher=Centro de Estudios Publicos (Chile) |date=22 September 1999.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonov stated in an interview at the Chilean Center of Public Studies (CEP) that the Soviet economic support included over $100&amp;nbsp;million in credit, three fishing ships (that distributed 17,000 tons of frozen fish to the population), factories (as help after the 1971 earthquake), 3,100 tractors, 74,000 tons of wheat and more than a million tins of condensed milk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonov&quot;/&gt;

In mid-1973 the USSR had approved the delivery of weapons (artillery, tanks) to the Chilean Army. However, when news of an attempt from the Army to depose Allende through a coup d'état reached Soviet officials, the shipment was redirected to another country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonov&quot;/&gt;

==Crisis==
{{See also|Tanquetazo|Chile under Allende}}

On 29 June 1973, Colonel [[Roberto Souper]] surrounded the presidential palace, [[La Moneda Palace|La Moneda]], with his tank regiment but failed to depose the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20041013002715/http://literature.rebelyouth.ca/educhile_1970s/tanquetazo.html Second coup attempt: ''El Tanquetazo'' (the tank attack)], originally on RebelYouth.ca. Unsigned, but with citations. Archived on [[Internet Archive]] 13 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; That failed ''coup d’état'' – known as the ''[[Tanquetazo]]'' (&quot;tank putsch&quot;) – organised by the nationalist ''[[Patria y Libertad]]'' paramilitary group, was followed by a general strike at the end of July that included the copper miners of El Teniente.

In August 1973, a [[constitutional crisis]] occurred, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]] publicly complained about the inability of Allende government to enforce the law of the land.  On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats uniting with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts through Allende's refusal to promulgate constitutional amendments, already approved by the Chamber, which would have prevented his government from continuing his massive [[nationalization]] plan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geomundos.com/chile/historia/resumen-de-la-historia_doc_16622.html Historia de Chile. Accessed online 15 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Se desata la crisis&quot;&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.latercera.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_178048856_151840547,00.html Se desata la crisis], part of series &quot;Icarito &gt; Enciclopedia Virtual &gt; Historia &gt; Historia de Chile &gt; Del gobierno militar a la democracia&quot; on LaTercera.cl. Retrieved 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

For months, Allende had feared calling upon the [[Carabineros de Chile|''Carabineros'']] (&quot;Carabineers&quot;, the national police force), suspecting them of disloyalty to his government.  On 9 August, President Allende appointed General [[Carlos Prats]] as [[Ministry of National Defense (Chile)|Minister of Defence]]. On 24 August 1973, General Prats was forced to resign both as defense minister and as the [[Chilean Army|commander-in-chief of the army]], embarrassed by both the [[Alejandrina Cox incident]] and a public protest in front of his house by the wives of his generals.  General [[Augusto Pinochet]] replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Se desata la crisis&quot;/&gt;

According to Chilean political scientist Arturo Valenzuela (later becoming a U.S. citizen and Assistant Secretary of State for Hemispheric Affairs in the Obama administration), a greater share of the blame for the breakdown in Chilean democracy lays with the leftist Allende government. While the both sides became increasingly distrustful of the other, the extreme leftists accelerated the process and left less room for political moderatism more than the extreme rightists. He writes &quot;By its actions, the revolutionary Left, which had always ridiculed the possibility of a socialist transformation through peaceful means, was engaged in a self-fulfilling prophecy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valenzuela|first=Arturo|title=The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes: Chile|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=109|isbn=9780801820106|pages=140|editor=Juan J. Linz, and Alfred Stepan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Supreme Court's resolution ===
On 26 May 1973, the [[Supreme Court of Chile]] unanimously denounced the Allende government's disruption of the legality of the nation in its failure to uphold judicial decisions, because of its continual refusal to permit police execution of judicial decisions contrary to the government's own measures.

===Chamber of Deputies' resolution===
On 22 August 1973, the Christian Democrats and the National Party members of the Chamber of Deputies joined together to vote 81 to 47 in favor of a resolution that asked the authorities to &quot;put an immediate end&quot; to &quot;breach[es of] the Constitution . . . with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans.&quot;

The resolution declared that Allende's government sought &quot;to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State . . . [with] the goal of establishing . . . a totalitarian system&quot; and claimed that the government had made &quot;violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent system of conduct.&quot; Essentially, most of the accusations were about disregard by the Socialist government of the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government.

Specifically, the Socialist government of President Allende was accused of:
* [[Ruling by decree]], thwarting the normal legislative system
* Refusing to enforce judicial decisions against its partisans; not carrying out sentences and judicial resolutions that contravened its objectives
* Ignoring the decrees of the independent General Comptroller's Office
* Sundry media offenses; usurping control of the National Television Network and applying economic pressure against those media organizations that are not unconditional supporters of the government
* Allowing its Socialist supporters to assemble with arms, and preventing the same by its right-wing opponents
* Supporting more than 1,500 illegal takeovers of farms
* Illegal repression of the [[El Teniente]] miners’ strike
* Illegally limiting emigration

Finally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected [socialist] armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterized as ''notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks''.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|English translation]] on Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

===President Allende's response===

Two days later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded,&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifiesto_al_pa%C3%ADs_de_Salvador_Allende,_respondiendo_al_acuerdo_de_la_camara_de_diputados|La respuesta del Presidente Allende] on Wikisource. {{en icon}} [[wikisource:Salvador Allende's Last Speech|English translation]] on Wikisource. Retrieved 22 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; characterising the Congress's declaration as ''destined to damage the country’s prestige abroad and create internal confusion'', predicting ''It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors''. He noted that the declaration (passed 81–47 in the Chamber of Deputies) had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority ''constitutionally required'' to convict the president of [[abuse of power]]: essentially, the Congress were ''invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically-elected government'' and ''subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will''.

Allende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a ''coup d’état'' or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that had already been refuted beforehand and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the (then-current) Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.

President Allende wrote: ''Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives''.

Adding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress were obstructing said means; having already paralyzed the State, they sought to destroy it. He concluded by calling upon the workers, all democrats and patriots to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the revolutionary process.

== The coup ==
{{Main|1973 Chilean coup d'état}}
In early September 1973, Allende floated the idea of resolving the constitutional crisis with a [[plebiscite]]. His speech outlining such a solution was scheduled for 11 September, but he was never able to deliver it. On 11 September 1973, the Chilean military staged a [[Chilean coup of 1973|coup]] against Allende.

[[Image:Allende.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Allende in front of the [[Palacio de la Moneda]]]]
Just prior to the capture of [[Palacio de La Moneda|La Moneda]] (the Presidential Palace), with gunfire and explosions clearly audible in the background, Allende gave his [[Salvador Allende's Last Speech|farewell speech]] to Chileans on live radio, speaking of himself in the past tense, of his love for Chile and of his deep faith in its future. He stated that his commitment to Chile did not allow him to take an easy way out, and he would not be used as a propaganda tool by those he called &quot;traitors&quot; (he refused an offer of safe passage), clearly implying he intended to fight to the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60E14FC3B54137A93C0A81782D85F478785F9 | work=The New York Times | date=12 September 1973 | accessdate=10 April 2010 | title=Socialist Says AllendeOnce Spoke of Suicide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, the coup plotters announced that Allende committed suicide. An official announcement declared that he had committed suicide with an automatic rifle. Prior to his death he had been photographed several times holding an [[AK-47]], a gift from [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cohaforum.org/2011/06/02/a-victim-of-u-s-cold-war-policy-rises-from-the-grave/ A Victim of the U.S. Cold War Rises from the Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was found dead with this gun.  In his 2004 documentary ''[[Salvador Allende (film)|Salvador Allende]]'', [[Patricio Guzmán]] incorporates a graphic image of Allende's corpse in the position it was found after his death. According to Guzmán's documentary, Allende shot himself with a pistol and not a rifle.

For years, the Chilean left-wing maintained that Allende had been assassinated, considering that a suicide would weaken Allende's figure. His doctor, José Quiroga, witness of Allende's suicide, who kept silence for a long time, said “It was more important the political issue of everybody believing that Allende had been killed by the military”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Labarca|first=Eduardo|title=Salvador Allende : biografía sentimental|year=2007|publisher=Catalonia|location=Santiago de Chile|isbn=978-956-8303-68-6|page=401|edition=1a. ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years the view that he committed suicide has become more broadly accepted, particularly as different testimonies appear to confirm details of the suicide reported in news and documentary interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908433,00.html | work=Time | title=The World: Allende's Last Day | date=4 February 1974 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/17/world/leftist-journal-concludes-allende-killed-himself.html | work=The New York Times | title=Leftist Journal Concludes Allende Killed Himself | first=Shirley | last=Christian | date=17 September 1990 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/605672702.html?dids=605672702:605672702&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Sep+16%2C+1973&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Wife+admits+Allende+suicide+with+gun+Castro+gave+him&amp;pqatl=google | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Wife admits Allende suicide with gun Castro gave him | date=16 September 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/605674032.html?dids=605674032:605674032&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Sep+16%2C+1973&amp;author=William+Parkinson&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=The+death+of+Allende%3A+Officially+a+suicide&amp;pqatl=google | work=Chicago Tribune | title=The death of Allende: Officially a suicide | first=William | last=Parkinson | date=16 September 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Ignacio Gonzalez, ''El dia en que murio Allende'' (&quot;The day that Allende Died&quot;).

In 2011, the controversy over the cause of death was reopened as the subject of an official investigation. On the basis of the original 1973 autopsy, Luis Ravanal, a medical examiner, expressed the opinion that the wounds on the body were not consistent with the theses of the alleged witnesses, as there were wounds caused by different guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chile Orders Exhumation to Settle How President Allende Died | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/16/world/americas/16chile.html | publisher = The New York Times | date = 15 April 2011 | accessdate =18 May 2011 | first=Agence | last=France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, a Chilean judge ordered an inquiry,&lt;ref name=inquiry&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/americas/28chile.html | title = Chilean Judge Orders Investigation Into Allende’s Death | publisher = The New York Times | accessdate =28 January 2011 | date=27 January 2011 | first=Pascale | last=Bonnefoy}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first judicial investigation of the death. On 23 May 2011, Allende's body was exhumed in order to have an autopsy performed by an international forensic team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldonline.com/2011/05/23/3089889/allendes-body-taken-from-chile.html | title=Allende's body taken from Chile tomb for autopsy | author=Vergara, Eva | publisher = heraldonline | accessdate =24 May 2011 | date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May, TVN, the state television station, reported the discovery of a secret 300-page military account of Allende's death. The document had been kept in the home of a former military justice official, and was discovered when his house was destroyed in the [[2010 Chile earthquake|2010 earthquake]]. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told TVN &quot;that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated.&quot;&lt;ref name=TVN&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chile-tv-secret-military-report-on-allendes-death-raises-doubts-about-suicide/2011/05/31/AG1rkTFH_story.html | title = Chile TV: Secret military report on Allende’s death raises doubts about suicide | publisher = ''Washington Post'' | accessdate =31 May 2011 | date=31 May 2011 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is supported by forensic expert Luis Ravanal who has been studying Allende's autopsy since 2007. Ravanal says he found details in the autopsy that were not in line with the official version of Allende's death. The cranium, he says, shows evidence of a first shot with a small gun, like a pistol, and then, a second shot from a larger weapon — like an AK-47 — which could mean that Allende was shot and killed, then shot a second time with his own gun, to make it look like suicide.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.npr.org/2011/05/31/136831116/chile-investigates-ex-presidents-cause-of-death | title = For Chileans, Allende's Exhumation Raises The Past | publisher = ''National Public Radio'' | accessdate =31 May 2011 | date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile's Legal Medical Service confirmed on 19 July 2011 that the death was suicide, consistent with the beliefs of Allende's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/19/chile.allende/index.html?hpt=hp_p1&amp;iref=NS1 | work=CNN | title=Former Chilean President Allende's death confirmed as suicide | date=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Patricio Bustos, the director of Chile's LMS, described the conclusions as &quot;definitive&quot;. [[British people|Briton]] David Prayer, an expert in ballistics, stated that the former president died as the result of two gunshots wounds which came from an assault rifle placed between his legs and aimed at his chin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/world/Autopsy-reveals-deposed-Chile-president.6804244.jp Scotsman Newspaper website 20 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific autopsy team delivered a unanimous finding that Allende used an [[AK-47]] rifle given to him by [[Fidel Castro]]. The gun was set to fire automatically and the shots tore off the top of his head, killing him instantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/20/salvador-allende-committed-suicide-autopsy Chilean president Salvador Allende committed suicide, autopsy confirms] ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
