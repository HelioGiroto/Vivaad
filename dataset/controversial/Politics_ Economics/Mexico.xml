Mexico is a federation comprising [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|thirty-one states]] and a [[Mexico City|Federal District]], the capital city.

In [[pre-Columbian Mexico]] many cultures matured into advanced civilizations such as the [[Olmec]], the [[Toltec]], the [[Teotihuacan]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and the [[Aztec]] before first contact with Europeans. In 1521, Spain [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered]] and colonized the territory from its base in [[Tenochtitlan|México-Tenochtitlan]], which was administered as the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. This territory would eventually become Mexico following recognition of the colony's [[Mexican War of Independence|independence]] in 1821. The post-independence period was characterized by [[Economic history of Mexico#Independence|economic instability]], the [[Mexican-American War]] and [[Territorial evolution of Mexico|territorial cession]] to the United States, a [[Reform War|civil war]], [[Emperor of Mexico|two empires]] and [[List of Presidents of Mexico|a domestic dictatorship]].

[[Mexican general election, 2000|Elections held in July 2000]] marked the first time that an opposition party won the presidency from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]].

{{Main|Name of Mexico}}
[[File:CodexMendoza01.jpg|thumb|Image of Mexico-[[Tenochtitlan]] from the [[Codex Mendoza]]]]
After New Spain won independence from Spain, it was decided that the new country would be named after its capital, [[Mexico City]], which was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan|México-Tenochtitlan]]. The name comes from the [[Nahuatl language]], but its meaning is unknown.

''[[Name of Mexico|Mēxihco]]'' was the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the [[Aztec Empire]], namely, the [[Valley of Mexico]], and its people, the [[Mexica]], and surrounding territories which became the future [[State of Mexico]] as a division of [[New Spain]] prior to independence (compare ''[[Latium]]''). It is generally considered to be a [[toponym]] for the valley which became the primary [[ethnonym]] for the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] as a result, or vice versa.

The suffix ''-co'' is the Nahuatl [[locative]], making the word a place name. Beyond that, the etymology is uncertain. It has been suggested that it is derived from [[Mextli]] or Mēxihtli, a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Aztecs, [[Huitzilopochtli]], in which case Mēxihco means &quot;Place where Huitzilopochtli lives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aguilar-Moreno|first=Manuel|title=Handbook to Life in the Aztec World|year=2006|publisher=Facts of Life, Inc.|isbn=0-8160-5673-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis&lt;ref name=edomex/&gt; suggests that ''Mēxihco'' derives from a [[portmanteau]] of the Nahuatl words for &quot;moon&quot; (''mētztli'') and navel (''xīctli''). This meaning (&quot;Place at the Center of the Moon&quot;) might then refer to Tenochtitlan's position in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]]. The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans [[pareidolia|pareidolically]] associated with the [[moon rabbit|moon]]. Still another hypothesis suggests that it is derived from Mēctli, the goddess of [[Agave americana|maguey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;edomex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nombre del Estado de México|publisher=Government of the State of Mexico|url=http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/htm/NomMexico.htm|accessdate=October 3, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070427111842/http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/htm/NomMexico.htm |archivedate = April 27, 2007}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the city-state was transliterated to Spanish as México with the phonetic value of the letter &lt;x&gt; in Medieval Spanish, which represented the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}}. This sound, as well as the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, represented by a &lt;j&gt;, evolved into a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} during the 16th century. This led to the use of the variant Méjico in many publications in Spanish, most notably in Spain, whereas in Mexico and most other Spanish–speaking countries México was the preferred spelling. In recent years the [[Real Academia Española]], which regulates the Spanish language, determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative recommended [[spelling]] is México.&lt;ref&gt;http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=méxico&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of publications in all Spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm, even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011|reason=Source cited formerly does not support the assertion}} In English, the &lt;x&gt; in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound, but the consonant cluster {{IPA|[ks]}}.

The official name of the country has changed as the [[form of government]] has changed. On two occasions (1821–1823 and 1863–1867), the country was known as Imperio Mexicano ([[Mexican Empire]]). All three federal constitutions (1824, 1857 and 1917, the current constitution) used the name Estados Unidos Mexicanos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ierd.prd.org.mx/coy128/hlb.htm |title=El cambio de la denominación de &quot;Estados Unidos Mexicanos&quot; por la de &quot;México&quot; en la Constitución Federal |publisher=Ierd.prd.org.mx |accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;—or the variants Estados Unidos mexicanos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/image/A02.html |title=Constitucion Federal de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos (1824) |publisher=Tarlton.law.utexas.edu |date=September 2, 2009 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Estados-Unidos Mexicanos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlahui.com/politic/politi99/politi8/con1857.htm |title=Constitución Mexicana de 1857 |publisher=Tlahui.com |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which have been translated as &quot;United Mexican States&quot;.

===Ancient cultures===

====Archaic period====
The earliest human remains in Mexico are chips of [[stone tool]]s found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon-dated to c. 23,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Native Americans: Earliest Migrations|year=2009|publisher=MSN Encarta|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570777/Native_Americans.html#s76|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257037540134054|archivedate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize and [[phaseolus|beans]] which caused a transition from [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-Indian]] hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 7000 BCE.

====Classic periods====
In the subsequent formative areas maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a complex  mythological and religious complex, a vigesimal numeric system, were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the [[Mesoamerica]]n culture area.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, Paul (1943). &quot;Mesoamérica. Sus Límites Geográficos, Composición Étnica y Caracteres Culturales&quot;. Acta Americana 1 (1): 92–107.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period villages began to become socially stratified and develop into [[chiefdom]]s, and the development of large ceremonial centers.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack, Robert; et al. (1996). The legacy of Mesoamerica: history and culture of a Native American civilization. New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest complex civilizations in Mexico was the [[Olmec]] culture which flourish on the Gulf Coast from around 1500 BCE. Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico. The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Richard A. (2004). The Olmecs : America's First Civilization. London: Thames and Hudson. pp. 9–25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|pre-classical period]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] civilizations developed complex centers at [[Calakmul]] and [[Monte Albán]] respectively. During this period the first true [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] were developed in the [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] and the Zapotec cultures, and the Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya Script|Maya Hieroglyphic script]].&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, Geoffrey; ''Writing Systems: A Linguistic Introduction'', Hutchinson (London), 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of [[Teotihuacan]], which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area as well as north. At its peak, Teotihuacan, containing some of the largest [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramidal structures]] built in the pre-Columbian Americas, had a population of more than 150,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author={{aut|Cowgill, George}} |authorlink=George Cowgill |year=1997 |title=State and Society at Teotihuacan, Mexico |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |url= |format=PDF online reproduction |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=pp.129–161|location=Palo Alto, CA |publisher=[[Annual Reviews|Annual Reviews Inc]] |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.129 |issn=0084-6570 |oclc=202300854}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 CE, competition between several important political centers in central Mexico such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] ensued. At this time during the Epi-Classic [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]].

====Post-classic period====
During the early post-classic Central Mexico was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, Oaxaca by the [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]] and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[Chichén Itzá]] and [[Mayapán]]. Towards the end of the post-Classic period the [[Aztec]]s of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author={{aut|Coe, Michael D.}} |authorlink=Michael D.

===Conquest===
[[File:Xicotencatl-Cortes.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hernán Cortés]] and [[Xicotencatl II]] as depicted in the ''[[History of Tlaxcala]]'']]
The [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] began in February 1519 when [[Hernán Cortés]] arrived at the port in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] with ca. 500 [[conquistador]]es, and later moved on to the Aztec capital. On his search for gold and other riches, Cortés decided to invade and conquer the Aztec empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author={{aut|Hassig, Ross}} |authorlink=Ross Hassig |year=2006 |title=Mexico and the Spanish Conquest |edition=2nd |location=Norman |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |isbn=978-0-8061-3793-3 |oclc=64594483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruler of the Aztec empire upon the arrival of the Spaniards was [[Moctezuma II]], who was later killed; his successor and brother [[Cuitláhuac]] took control of the Aztec empire, but was among the first to fall from the smallpox epidemic a short time later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=True Peters|first=Stephanie|title=Smallpox in the New World|year=2004|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-1637-1|url=http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=v0zEiM_hijsC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=small+pox+killing+aztecs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z4mrxE0Pdo&amp;sig=9Ugb5VPtgITdHXy9aU7p8b-FvmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ty3-TsGeN4rO2AX639WUAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=small%20pox%20killing%20aztecs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unintentionally introduced by Spanish conquerors, [[smallpox]] ravaged Mesoamerica in the 1520s, killing more than 3 million Aztecs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flight|first=Colette|title=Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml|accessdate=December 30, 2011|newspaper=BBC News {{!}} History|date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, mentioned that the death toll of the Aztecs might have reached up to 15 million (out of a population of less than 30 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koplow|first=David A.|title=Smallpox: The Fight to Eradicate a Global Scourge|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23732-2|page=270|url=http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=nlQpbYPuTX0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=small+pox+killing+aztecs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GFvJ9Zq8dc&amp;sig=wtCYmmf9t-Txz7jrjebjuObNAa0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3TL-Tte2F6W42wWW9fSyCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=small%20pox%20killing%20aztecs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severely weakened, the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cortés and his forces on his second return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smallpox: Conquered Killer|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-diseases/smallpox-article/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox was a devastatingly selective disease—it generally only killed the Aztecs, while the Spaniards were immune to the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Irwin W.|title=The power of plagues|year=2006|publisher=American Society for Microbiology|isbn=1-55581-356-9|page=431|url=http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=LOjqWL-u9VMC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=small+pox+killing+aztecs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T8_SUFZDdM&amp;sig=JWxo20cbxLaK_cy2wgM1hyjJYWg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pDT-TsvyGOHq2wWd-YmMAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=small%20pox%20killing%20aztecs&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deaths caused by smallpox are believe to have triggered a rapid growth of Christianity in Mexico and the Americas.

===Independence===

On September 16, 1810, independence from Spain was declared by priest [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], in the small town of [[Dolores Hidalgo|Dolores]], Guanajuato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miguel Hidalgo Biography|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16045a.htm|accessdate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first insurgent group was formed by Hidalgo, the Spanish [[viceregal]] army captain [[Ignacio Allende]], the [[militia]] captain [[Juan Aldama]] and &quot;La Corregidora&quot; [[Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez]]. Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and [[executed by firing squad]] in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], on July 31, 1811. Following his death, the leadership was assumed by priest [[José María Morelos]], who occupied key southern cities.

In 1813 the [[Congress of Chilpancingo]] was convened and, on November 6, signed the &quot;[[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America]]&quot;. Morelos was captured and executed on December 22, 1815. In subsequent years, the insurgency was near collapse, but in 1820 [[Viceroy]] [[Juan Ruiz de Apodaca]] sent an army under the [[Criollo people|criollo]] general [[Agustín de Iturbide]] against the troops of [[Vicente Guerrero]]. Instead, Iturbide approached Guerrero to join forces, and on August 24, 1821 representatives of the [[Spanish Crown]] and Iturbide signed the &quot;[[Treaty of Córdoba]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]]&quot;, which recognized the [[independence of Mexico]] under the terms of the &quot;[[Plan of Iguala]]&quot;.

====Juárez reforms and territorial losses====

[[File:Porfirio Diaz in uniform.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Porfirio Díaz]], president of Mexico with one interruption from 1876 to 1911]]
Agustín de Iturbide immediately proclaimed himself emperor of the [[First Mexican Empire]]. A revolt against him in 1823 established the [[United Mexican States (1824–1864)|United Mexican States]]. In 1824, a [[Constitution of 1824|Republican Constitution]] was drafted and [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of the newly born country. The first decades of the post-independence period were marked by [[Economic history of Mexico|economic instability]], which led to the [[Pastry War]] in 1836, and a constant strife between liberales, supporters of a [[federal republic|federal form of government]], and conservadores, proposals of a [[Unitary state|hierarchical form of government]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], a centralist and two-time dictator, approved the [[Siete Leyes]] in 1836, a radical amendment that institutionalized the centralized form of government. When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, civil war spread across the country, and three new governments declared independence: the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] and the [[Republic of Yucatán]].

Texas successfully achieved independence and was annexed by the United States. A [[territorial dispute|border dispute]] led to the [[Mexican-American War]], which began in 1846 and lasted for two years; the War was settled via the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which forced Mexico to give up over half of its land to the U.S., including [[Alta California]], [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|New Mexico]], and the disputed parts of [[Coahuila y Tejas|Texas]]. A much smaller transfer of territory in what is today southern [[Arizona]] and southwestern [[New Mexico]]&amp;nbsp;— the [[Gadsden Purchase]]&amp;nbsp;— occurred in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J.

Dissatisfaction with Santa Anna's return to power led to the liberal &quot;[[Plan of Ayutla]]&quot;, initiating an era known as [[La Reforma]], after which [[Constitution of 1857|a new Constitution was drafted in 1857]] that established a [[secular state]], federalism as the [[form of government]], and several freedoms. As the conservadores refused to recognize it, the [[Reform War]] began in 1858, during which both groups had their own governments. The war ended in 1861 with victory by the Liberals, led by Amerindian President [[Benito Juárez]]. In the 1860s Mexico underwent a military occupation by France, which established the [[Second Mexican Empire]] under the rule of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Archduke]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian]] of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] with support from the Roman Catholic clergy and the conservadores, who later switched sides and joined the liberales. Maximilian surrendered, was tried on June 14 and was executed on June 19, 1867.

====Porfiriato====
[[Porfirio Díaz]], a republican general during the [[French intervention in Mexico|French intervention]], ruled Mexico from 1876 to 1880 and then from 1884 to 1911 in five consecutive reelections, period known as the [[Porfirio Díaz|Porfiriato]], characterized by remarkable economic achievements, investments in [[the arts]] and sciences, but also of [[income distribution|economic inequality]] and [[political repression]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Mexican Revolution====
[[File:Madero en Cuernavaca.jpg|right|thumb|[[Francisco I. Madero]] with [[Emiliano Zapata]], in [[Cuernavaca]] during the Mexican revolution.]]
A likely electoral fraud that led to Diaz's fifth reelection sparked the [[Mexican Revolution|1910 Mexican Revolution]], initially led by [[Francisco I. Madero]].
Díaz resigned in 1911 and Madero was elected president but [[Decena trágica|overthrown and murdered in a coup d'état two years later]] directed by conservative general [[Victoriano Huerta]]. That event re-ignited the civil war, involving figures such as [[Francisco Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]], who formed their own forces. A third force, the [[Ejército Constitucionalista|constitutional army]] led by [[Venustiano Carranza]], managed to bring an end to the war, and radically amended the 1857 Constitution to include many of the social premises and demands of the revolutionaries into what was eventually called the [[Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]]. It is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/505_mexicanrevolution.html The Mexican Revolution].

Robert McCaa, University of Minnesota Population Center&lt;/ref&gt; Assassinated in 1920, Carranza was succeeded by another revolutionary hero, [[Álvaro Obregón]], who in turn was succeeded by [[Plutarco Elías Calles]]. Obregón was reelected in 1928 but assassinated before he could assume power.

====PRI rule====

In 1929, Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), later renamed the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI), and started a period known as the [[Maximato]], which ended with the election of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], who implemented many economic and social reforms, and most significantly [[Mexican oil expropriation|expropriated the oil industry]] into [[Pemex]] on March 18, 1938, but sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by Cárdenas' radical measure.

In the 1980s the first cracks emerged in PRI's monopolistic position. In [[Baja California]], [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel]] was elected as governor.

Salinas embarked on a program of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms which fixed the exchange rate, controlled inflation and culminated with the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which came into effect on January 1, 1994.

The United Mexican States are a federation of thirty-one free and sovereign states, which form a union that exercises a degree of jurisdiction over the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]] and other [[territory (administrative division)|territories]].

Each state has its own constitution, [[congress]], and a judiciary, and its citizens elect by [[direct vote|direct voting]] a [[List of Mexican state governors|governor]] for a six-year term, and representatives to their respective unicameral state congresses for three-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 116|work=Political Constitution of the United Mexican States|publisher=Congress of the Union of the United Mexican States|url=http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=12|accessdate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Geography of Mexico}}
[[File:Mexico topographic map-blank.svg|thumb|Topographic map of Mexico]]
[[File:North America from low orbiting satellite Suomi NPP.jpg|thumb|right|Mexico as seen from space in a satellite photo taken by NASA's [[Suomi NPP]] in January 2012.]]
Mexico is located between latitudes [[14th parallel north|14°]] and [[33rd parallel north|33°N]], and longitudes [[86th meridian west|86°]] and [[119th meridian west|119°W]] in the southern portion of North America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Almost all of Mexico lies in the [[North American Plate]], with small parts of the [[Baja California peninsula]] on the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Cocos Plate]]s. [[Geophysics|Geophysically]], some geographers include the territory east of the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] (around 12% of the total) within Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Nord-Amèrica, in [http://www.grec.cat/ Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], however, Mexico is entirely considered part of North America, along with Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parsons |first= Alan |coauthors= Jonathan Schaffer |title= Geopolitics of oil and natural gas |publisher= U.S. Department of State |series= Economic Perspectives |year= 2004 |month= May |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's total area is {{convert|1972550|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, making it the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's 14th largest country by total area]], and includes approximately {{convert|6000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of islands in the Pacific Ocean (including the remote [[Guadalupe Island]] and the [[Revillagigedo Islands]]), [[Gulf of Mexico]], Caribbean, and [[Gulf of California]]. From its farthest land points, Mexico is a little over {{convert|2000|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} in length.
[[File:O457e4574jl0.jpg|thumb|right|Snow-capped [[Pico de Orizaba]], the highest point in Mexico]]

On its north, Mexico shares a {{convert|3141|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} [[Mexico – United States border|border with the United States]]. The meandering Río Bravo del Norte (known as the [[Rio Grande]] in the United States) defines the border from [[Ciudad Juárez]] east to the Gulf of Mexico. A series of natural and artificial markers delineate the United States-Mexican border west from Ciudad Juárez to the Pacific Ocean. On its south, Mexico shares an {{convert|871|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} border with Guatemala and a {{convert|251|km|0|mi|abbr=on}} border with Belize.

Mexico is crossed from north to south by two mountain ranges known as [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] and [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], which are the extension of the [[Rocky Mountains]] from northern North America. From east to west at the center, the country is crossed by the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] also known as the Sierra Nevada. A fourth mountain range, the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], runs from [[Michoacán]] to [[Oaxaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Mexico-TOPOGRAPHY.html |title=Mexico Topography |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date=October 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the majority of the Mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes, and the highest elevations are found at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: [[Pico de Orizaba]] ({{convert|5700|m|ft|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}), [[Popocatepetl]] ({{convert|5462|m|ft|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) and [[Iztaccihuatl]] ({{convert|5286|m|ft|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) and the [[Nevado de Toluca]] ({{convert|4577|m|ft|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}). Three major urban agglomerations are located in the valleys between these four elevations: [[Toluca]], [[Greater Mexico City]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia1&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Mexico}}
The [[Tropic of Cancer]] effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones. Land north of the twenty-fourth parallel experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months. South of the twenty-fourth parallel, temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation. This gives Mexico one of the world's most diverse weather systems.

Areas south of the twenty-fourth parallel with elevations up to {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]), have a yearly median temperature between {{convert|24|to|28|C|F|1}}. Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a {{convert|5|C-change|0}} difference between winter and summer median temperatures. Both Mexican coasts, except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja, are also vulnerable to serious [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] during the summer and fall. Although low-lying areas north of the twentieth-fourth parallel are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from {{convert|20|to|24|C|F|1|disp=or}}) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.

Many large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. This gives them a year-round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages (from {{convert|16|to|18|C|F|1|disp=or}}) and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year.

Many parts of Mexico, particularly the north, have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation. For example, many cities in the north like [[Monterrey]], [[Hermosillo]], and [[Mexicali]] experience temperatures of {{convert|40|C|F}} or more in summer. In the [[Sonoran Desert]] temperatures reach {{convert|50|C|F}} or more.

===Biodiversity===
[[File:Standing jaguar.jpg|thumb|The [[jaguar]], a native mammal of Mexico]]
Mexico is one of the 18 [[megadiverse countries]] of the world. With over 200,000 different species, Mexico is home of 10–12% of the world's biodiversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEMARNAT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversidad de México|publisher=SEMARNAT|url=http://cruzadabosquesagua.semarnat.gob.mx/iii.html|accessdate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico ranks first in biodiversity in [[reptile]]s with 707 known species, second in mammals with 438 species, fourth in [[amphibian]]s with 290 species, and fourth in flora, with 26,000 different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversidad en México|publisher=CONEVYT|url=http://oregon.conevyt.org.mx/actividades/diversidad/lectura_biodiversidad.htm|accessdate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is also considered the second country in the world in [[ecosystem]]s and fourth in overall species.&lt;ref name=&quot;SNIB&quot;/&gt; Approximately 2,500 species are protected by Mexican legislations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SNIB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sistema Nacional sobre la Biodiversidad en México|publisher=CONABIO|url=http://www.conabio.gob.mx/institucion/snib/doctos/acerca.html|accessdate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2002, Mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in the world, second only to Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2002&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1854188.stm |title=Mexico's 'devastating' forest loss |publisher=BBC News |date=March 4, 2002 |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has taken another initiative in the late 1990s to expand the people's knowledge, interest and use of the country's esteemed biodiversity, through the [[Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad]].

In Mexico, {{convert|170000|km2|sqmi|0}} are considered &quot;Protected Natural Areas.&quot; These include 34 biosphere reserves (unaltered ecosystems), 67 [[List of national parks of Mexico|national parks]], 4 natural monuments (protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic, scientific or historical value), 26 areas of protected flora and fauna, 4 areas for natural resource protection (conservation of soil, hydrological basins and forests) and 17 sanctuaries (zones rich in diverse species).&lt;ref name=&quot;SEMARNAT&quot;/&gt;

The discovery of the Americas brought to the rest of the world many widely used [[Agriculture|food crops]] and [[edible plants]]. Some of Mexico's native [[culinary art|culinary]] ingredients include: chocolate, [[avocado]], tomato, maize, [[vanilla]], [[guava]], [[chayote]], [[Dysphania ambrosioides|epazote]], [[Sweet potato|camote]], [[jícama]], [[nopal]], [[zucchini]], [[Crataegus mexicana|tejocote]], [[Corn smut|huitlacoche]], [[sapote]], [[mamey sapote]], many varieties of [[bean]]s, and an even greater variety of [[chili pepper|chiles]], such as the [[habanero]] and the [[jalapeño]]. Most of these names come from indigenous languages like [[Nahuatl]].

Due to its high biodiversity Mexico has also been a frequent site of [[bioprospecting]] by international research bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Cori.  2003. When Nature Goes Public.

Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The first highly successful instance being the discovery in 1947 of the tuber &quot;[[Mexican barbasco trade|Barbasco]]&quot; (''[[Dioscorea composita]]'') which has a high content of [[diosgenin]], revolutionizing the production of [[synthetic hormones]] in the 1950es and 1960es and eventually leading to the invention of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Soto Laveaga, Gabriela (2009).

According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], worldwide Mexico is the country with the second highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich, beaten only by Chile – although it has been falling over the last decade. The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36%. OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average – both in absolute and relative numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;OECDREFORMA&quot;&gt;Perspectivas OCDE: México Reformas para el Cambio [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/8/49363879.pdf]{{quote|Si bien la pobreza había venido disminuyendo a lo largo de los últimos decenios, en fechas recientes ha vuelto a aumentar. Entre 2004 y 2008 la proporción de personas que vivían con menos del 50% del ingreso medio aumentó del 18.4% al 21%. También se registró un crecimiento considerable en las últimas estadísticas oficiales sobre la pobreza absoluta, que tienen en cuenta el acceso a alimentos, salud, educación, vivienda y otros factores. De acuerdo con datos recientes del Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social (CONEVAL), entre 2006 y 2010, la proporción de personas que vivían en la pobreza (extrema y moderada) aumentó del 35% al 46% (lo que equivale a 52 millones de personas). El alto nivel de pobreza absoluta se refleja también en otros indicadores relativos a las condiciones de vida: por ejemplo, la mortalidad infantil, que es tres veces superior al promedio de la OCDE, y la tasa de analfabetismo, que supera a la media del conjunto de la Organización. México es el segundo país con las desigualdades más grandes entre los países de la OCDE, después de Chile, si bien la tendencia ha sido descendente en la última década. Las estadísticas más recientes de la OCDE, que figuran en el informe Divided We Stand (diciembre de 2011), señalan que el 10% más pobre de la población de México percibe alrededor del 1.3% del ingreso total disponible, mientras que el 10% más rico recibe casi el 36%.

===Communications===
{{Main|Telecommunications in Mexico}}
[[File:STS-51-G Morelos 1 deployment.jpg|thumb|A [[Satmex]] communications satellite being deployed from its launch vehicle]]

The telecommunications industry is mostly dominated by Telmex (''Teléfonos de México''), privatized in 1990. As of 2006, Telmex had expanded its operations to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and the United States. Other players in the domestic industry are [[Axtel]] and [[Maxcom]]. Due to Mexican [[orography]], providing landline telephone service at remote mountainous areas is expensive, and the penetration of line-phones per capita is low compared to other Latin American countries, at forty-percent, however 82% of Mexicans over the age of 14 own a mobile phone. Mobile telephony has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines.&lt;ref name=ciacom&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html#Comm Communications] CIA Factbook&lt;/ref&gt; The telecommunication industry is regulated by the government through [[Cofetel]] (''Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones'').

The Mexican satellite system is domestic and operates 120 earth stations. There is also extensive microwave radio relay network and considerable use of fiber-optic and coaxial cable.&lt;ref name=ciacom/&gt; Mexican satellites are operated by ''Satélites Mexicanos'' ([[Satmex]]), a private company, leader in Latin America and servicing both North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satmex.com.mx/english/?opcion=0 Satmex.

Usage of radio, television, and Internet in Mexico is prevalent.&lt;ref name=encnations/&gt; There are approximately 1,410 radio broadcast stations and 236 television stations (excluding repeaters).&lt;ref name=ciacom/&gt; Major players in the broadcasting industry are [[Televisa]]—the largest Spanish media company in the Spanish-speaking world&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;—and [[TV Azteca]].

Sherwood Rowland]] for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1995/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995 |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |work=Nobelprize.org |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1995/molina-1018.html |title=Molina wins Nobel Prize for ozone work |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |author=Thomson, Elizabeth A. |date=October 18, 1995 |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the largest scientific project being developed in Mexico was the construction of the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] (Gran Telescopio Milimétrico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}Unravelling unidentified γ-ray sources with the large millimeter telescope, Alberto Carramiñana and the LMT-GTM collaboration, in ''The Multi-Messenger Approach to High-Energy Gamma-Ray Sources'', Josep M.

The electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. In 2007 Mexico surpassed South Korea as the second largest manufacturer of televisions, and in 2008 Mexico surpassed China, South Korea and Taiwan to become the largest producer of smartphones in the world. There are almost half a million (451,000) students enrolled in electronics engineering programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_21/b3985070.htm |title=Mexico: Pumping Out Engineers |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek  |date=May 22, 2006 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[José Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje.&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1981:32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:78–85)&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[mestizo]], often used in literature about Mexican social identities, carries a variety of socio-cultural, economic, racial and biological meanings. For this reason it has been deemed too imprecise to be used for ethnic classification and has been abandoned in Mexican censuses.&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/377246/mestizo |title=mestizo (people) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of &quot;indígena&quot; (indigenous) can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only speakers of one of [[Languages of Mexico|Mexico's 62 indigenous languages]] or people who self-identify as having an indigenous cultural background. According to the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]], as of 2005 there are 10.1 million Mexicans who speak an indigenous language and claim indigenous heritage, representing 9.8% of the total population.&lt;ref name=CDI1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/cedulas/sintesis_resultados_2005.pdf |title=Síntesis de Resultados |publisher=Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas |year=2006 |accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;mestizo&quot; is sometimes used with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood. This usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure indigenous genetic heritage would be considered Mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language,&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:2)&lt;/ref&gt; and a person with a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:73)&lt;/ref&gt;

México |publisher=Cdi.gob.mx |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yucatán]], with 59%, [[Quintana Roo]] with 39% and [[Campeche]] with 27% of the population being indigenous, most of them [[Maya people|Maya]]; [[Oaxaca]] with 48% of the population, the most numerous groups being the [[Mixtec]] and [[Zapotec people]]s; [[Chiapas]] has 28%, the majority being [[Tzeltal]] and [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]] Maya; [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] with 24%, the majority being [[Otomi people|Otomi]]; [[Puebla]] with 19%, and [[Guerrero]] with 17%, mostly [[Nahua people]] and the states of [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Veracruz]] both home to a population of 15% indigenous people, mostly from the [[Totonac]], Nahua and [[Huastec people|Teenek (Huastec)]] groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;inegi.org.mx&quot;&gt;http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/poblacion_indigena/Pob_ind_Mex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average. In all states indigenous people have higher [[infant mortality]], in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations. Literacy rates are also much lower, with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12%. The indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average, starting earlier and continuing longer. However, 55% of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary, compared to 20% for the national average. Many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries. Indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;inegi.org.mx&quot;/&gt;

===Population genetics===
[[File:Mestizo.jpg|thumb|An 18th century indigenous woman with her Spanish husband and their child]]
A study by the [[National Institute of Genomic Medicine, Mexico]] reported that Mestizo Mexicans are 58.96% European, 35.05% &quot;Asian&quot; (Amerindian), and 5.03% African. Sonora shows the highest European contribution (70.63%) and Guerrero the lowest (51.98%) where we also observe the highest Asian contribution (37.17%). African contribution ranges from 2.8% in Sonora to 11.13% in Veracruz. 80% of the Mexican population was classed as mestizo (defined as &quot;being racially mixed in some degree&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In May 2009, Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine issued a report on a genomic study of 300 mestizos from the states of Guerrero, Sonora, Veracruz, Yucatán, Zacatecas, and Guanajuato. The study found that the Mestizo population of these Mexican states were on average 55% of indigenous ancestry followed by 41.8% of European, 1.8% of African, and 1.2% of East Asian ancestry.  The study also noted that whereas Mestizo individuals from the southern state of Guerrero showed on average 66% of indigenous ancestry, those from the northern state of Sonora displayed about 61.6% European ancestry. The study found that there was an increase in indigenous ancestry as one traveled towards to the Southern states in Mexico, while the indigenous ancestry declined as one traveled to the Northern states in the country, such as Sonora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/05/11/0903045106.abstract |title=Analysis of genomic diversity in Mexican Mestizo populations to develop genomic medicine in Mexico |publisher=Pnas.org |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan areas===

* the group of two or more municipalities in which a city with a population of at least 50,000 is located whose urban area extends over the limit of the municipality that originally contained the core city incorporating either physically or under its area of direct influence other adjacent predominantly urban municipalities all of which have a high degree of social and economic integration or are relevant for urban politics and administration; or
* a single municipality in which a city of a population of at least one million is located and fully contained, (that is, it does not transcend the limits of a single municipality); or
* a city with a population of at least 250,000 which forms a [[conurbation]] with other cities in the United States.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Mexico}}
[[File:Tradicionalranchero.JPG|thumb|right|[[Jarabe Tapatío]], an example of traditional Mexican dance and costumes.]]
Mexican culture reflects the complexity of the [[History of Mexico|country's history]] through the blending of indigenous cultures and the [[culture of Spain]], imparted during Spain's 300-year colonization of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements mainly from the United States have been incorporated into Mexican culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Porfirian era (''el [[Porfirio Díaz|Porfiriato]]''), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the [[Mexican Revolution]], cultural identity has had its foundation in the ''mestizaje'', of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[José Vasconcelos]] in his publication ''La Raza Cósmica'' (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the ''mestizo'') not only biologically but culturally as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;vasconcelos160&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vasconcelos|first=José|coauthors=Didier T. Jaén (translator)|title=La Raza Cósmica (The Cosmic Race)|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-8018-5655-8|page=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This exalting of ''mestizaje'' was a revolutionary idea that sharply contrasted with the idea of a superior pure race prevalent in Europe at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Literature===
{{Main|Mexican literature|Mesoamerican literature}}
[[File:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|thumb|upright|A late 18th century painting of [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]], Mexican poet and writer.]]
The literature of Mexico has its antecedents in the literatures of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. The most well known prehispanic poet is [[Nezahualcoyotl]]. Modern Mexican literature was influenced by the concepts of the Spanish colonialization of [[Mesoamerica]]. Outstanding colonial writers and poets include [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón]] and [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]].

In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[José Vasconcelos]] in his publication [[La Raza Cósmica]] (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races, biologically as well as culturally.&lt;ref name=&quot;vasconcelos160&quot;/&gt;

Other writers include [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi]], [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Octavio Paz]] (Nobel Laureate), [[Renato Leduc]], [[Carlos Monsiváis]], [[Elena Poniatowska]], [[Mariano Azuela]] (&quot;Los de abajo&quot;) and [[Juan Rulfo]] (&quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;).

Post-revolutionary art in Mexico had its expression in the works of renowned artists such as [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], [[Federico Cantú Garza]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Juan O'Gorman]]. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of Mexican muralism, painted the [[Man at the Crossroads]] at the [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed the next year due to the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rockefeller Controversy|publisher=Diego Rivera Prints|url=http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|accessdate=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palace of Fine Arts]].

[[Mesoamerican architecture]] is mostly noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} [[Spanish Colonial architecture]] is marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Mexico, as the center of New Spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style.

===Cinema and media===
{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}

[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican films]] from the [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Golden Age]] in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Latin America and Europe. [[Maria Candelaria]] (1944) by [[Emilio Fernández]], was one of the first films awarded a [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. The famous Spanish-born director [[Luis Buñuel]] realized in Mexico, between 1947 to 1965 some of him master pieces like [[Los Olvidados]] (1949), [[Viridiana]] (1961) and [[El angel exterminador]] (1963). Famous actors and actresses from this period include [[María Félix]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Jorge Negrete]] and the comedian [[Cantinflas]].

More recently, films such as [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|Como agua para chocolate]] (1992), [[Cronos (film)|Cronos]] (1993), [[Y tu mamá también]] (2001), and [[Pan's Labyrinth]] (2006) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised, as in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Mexican directors [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]] ([[Amores perros]], [[Babel (film)|Babel]]), [[Alfonso Cuarón]] ([[Children of Men]], [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]), [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Carlos Carrera]] ([[El crimen del Padre Amaro|The Crime of Father Amaro]]), and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are some of the most known present-day film makers.

Two of the major television networks based in Mexico are [[Televisa]] and [[TV Azteca]]. Televisa is also the largest producer of Spanish-language content in the world and also the world's largest Spanish-language media network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Televisa Brings 2006 FIFA World Cup to Mexico in HD With Snell &amp; Wilcox Kahuna SD/HD Production Switcher|work=Press release|date=June 27, 2006 | publisher=[[Snell &amp; Wilcox]] | url=http://www.snellwilcox.com/news_events/press_releases/203 | accessdate=September 30, 2007}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grupo Multimedios]] is another media conglomerate with Spanish-language broadcasting in Mexico, Spain, and the United States.

Some well-known Mexican singers are
[[Thalía]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Alejandro Fernández]], [[Julieta Venegas]] and [[Paulina Rubio]]. Mexican singers of traditional music are: [[Lila Downs]], [[Susana Harp]], [[Jaramar]], [[GEO Meneses]] and [[Alejandra Robles]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Mexican cuisine}}
[[File:Carnitas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tacos]]]]
[[File:Hot chocolate.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Chocolate&quot; originates from Mexico's [[Aztec]] cuisine, derived from the [[Nahuatl]] word [[xocolatl]].]]

Mexican cuisine is known for its intense and varied flavors, colorful decoration, and variety of spices. Most of today's Mexican food is based on pre-Columbian traditions, including the Aztecs and Maya, combined with culinary trends introduced by Spanish colonists.

The [[conquistador]]es eventually combined their imported diet of rice, beef, pork, chicken, wine, garlic and onions with the native pre-Columbian food, including maize, tomato, [[vanilla]], [[avocado]], [[guava]], [[papaya]], [[pineapple]], [[chili pepper]], [[bean]]s, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[sweet potato]], peanut, and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]].

Mexican food varies by region, because of local climate and geography and ethnic differences among the indigenous inhabitants and because these different populations were influenced by the Spaniards in varying degrees. The north of Mexico is known for its beef, goat and [[ostrich]] production and meat dishes, in particular the well-known [[Arrachera]] cut.

Central Mexico's cuisine is largely made up of influences from the rest of the country, but also has its authentics, such as [[barbacoa]], [[pozole]], [[menudo (soup)|menudo]], [[tamales]], and [[carnitas]].

Southeastern Mexico, on the other hand, is known for its spicy vegetable and chicken-based dishes. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico also has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. [[Veal]] is common in the [[Yucatan]]. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, in particular à la veracruzana.

In modern times, other cuisines of the world have become very popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, sushi in Mexico is often made with a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] or [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili-blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, [[habanero]] and [[chipotle]] peppers

The most internationally recognized dishes include chocolate, [[taco]]s, [[quesadilla]]s, [[enchilada]]s, [[burrito]]s, [[tamale]]s and [[mole (sauce)|mole]] among others. Regional dishes include [[mole (sauce)|mole poblano]], [[chiles en nogada]] and [[chalupa]]s from [[Puebla]]; [[cabrito]] and [[machaca]] from Monterrey, [[cochinita pibil]] from [[Yucatán]], [[Tlayuda]]s from [[Oaxaca]], as well as [[barbacoa]], [[chilaquiles]], [[milanesa]]s, and many others.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Mexico}}
[[File:Azteca entrance.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Estadio Azteca]] (Aztec Stadium) is the official home stadium of the [[Mexico national football team]].]]
Mexico City hosted the [[1968 Summer Olympics|XIX Olympic Games]] in 1968, making it the first Latin American city to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Binational Olympics|month=December | year=2003|publisher=San Diego Metropolitan|url=http://www.sandiegometro.com/2003/dec/coverstory2.html|accessdate=October 7, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930043448/http://www.sandiegometro.com/2003/dec/coverstory2.html |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has also hosted the [[FIFA World Cup]] twice, in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CONCACAF|publisher=The Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF)|url=http://www.concacaf.com/about.asp|accessdate=October 7, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071006070253/http://www.concacaf.com/about.asp |archivedate = October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's most popular sport is association football (soccer). It is commonly believed that Football was introduced in Mexico by [[Cornish people|Cornish]] miners at the end of the 19th century. By 1902 a five-team league had emerged with a strong British influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Introduction|publisher=Federacion Mexicana de Futbol|url=http://www.femexfut.org.mx/portalv2/(hjfqs545niz5yh55yipntw55)/default.aspx?s=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Mexico&amp;nbsp;– List of Final Tables|publisher=Rec.Sports.Soccer Statistics Foundation|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mexhist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico's top clubs are [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] with 11 championships, [[Club América|América]] with 10 and [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]] with 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Mexico&amp;nbsp;– List of Champions|publisher=Rec.Sports.Soccer Statistics Foundation|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mexchamp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Carbajal]] was the first player to appear in five World Cups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/carbajal/ |title=CNNSI.com - 2002 World Cup - World Cup Hall of Fame: Antonio Carbajal - Wednesday May 08, 2002 10:46 PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2002-05-08 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hugo Sánchez]] was named best [[CONCACAF]] player of the 20th century by IFFHS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terra.com/deportes/articulo/html/fox507174.htm ''Hugo Sánchez donó trofeos pichichi y mejor jugador CONCACAF al Real Madrid'' (Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Estadio de beisbol en Monterrey.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey|Baseball stadium]] in Monterrey, home to [[Monterrey Sultans]].]]

Baseball has traditionally been more popular than soccer in some regions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Mexican professional league is named the [[Liga Mexicana de Beisbol]]. While usually not as strong as the United States, the Caribbean countries and Japan, Mexico has nonetheless achieved several international baseball titles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Mexico has had several players signed by Major League teams, the most famous of them being Dodgers pitcher [[Fernando Valenzuela]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Bullfighting]] is a popular sport in the country, and almost all large cities have bullrings. [[Plaza México]] in Mexico City, is the largest bullring in the world, which seats 55,000 people. Professional wrestling (or [[Lucha libre]] in Spanish) is a major crowd draw with national promotions such as [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración|AAA]], LLL, [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|CMLL]] and others.

Mexico is an international power in [[professional boxing]] (at the amateur level, [[Mexico at the Olympics|several Olympic boxing medals]] have also been won by Mexico). [[Vicente Saldivar]], [[Rubén Olivares]], [[Salvador Sánchez]], [[Julio César Chávez]], [[Ricardo Lopez Nava|Ricardo Lopez]] and [[Erik Morales]] are but a few Mexican fighters who have been ranked among the best of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/greatest/featureVideo?page=greatest4150 ESPN.com: ALL-TIME GREATEST BOXERS:]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Mexican athletes include golfer [[Lorena Ochoa]], who was ranked first in the [[LPGA]] world rankings prior to her retirement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LPGA Rolex Women's World Golf Rankings|date=October 1, 2007|url=http://www.lpga.com/content/RolexRankings10-1-2007.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=October 7, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ana Guevara]], former world champion of the {{convert|400|m|ft|}} and Olympic subchampion in Athens 2004, and [[Fernando Platas]], a numerous Olympic medal winning diver.

==Health care==
{{Main|Health care in Mexico}}
[[File:Mexicohospital.jpg|thumb|''Hospital Angeles'' in Mexico City, the largest Mexican private hospital chain.]]
Since the early 1990s, Mexico entered a transitional stage in the health of its population and some indicators such as mortality patterns are identical to those found in highly developed countries like Germany or Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/mexico/63.htm |title=Mexico&amp;nbsp;– Health Care and Social Security |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although all Mexicans are entitled to receive medical care by the state, 50.3 million Mexicans had no medical insurance as of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinais.salud.gob.mx/descargas/pdf/SE01_PoblacionesInst.pdf |title=Sistema Nacional de Información en Salud&amp;nbsp;– Poblaciones de las Instituciones Prestadoras de Servicios de Salud de México: Definición y Construcción|format=PDF |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to increase the number of people are being made, and the current administration intends to achieve [[universal health care]] by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/prensa/presidencia/?contenido=38260 |title=De seguir por el camino correcto en materia de salud, en tres años todos los mexicanos, sin excepción, contarán con médico, medicinas y tratamiento cuando lo necesiten: Presidente Calderón |publisher=Presidencia.gob.mx |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/009174/calderon-promete-cobertura-universal-salud |title=Calderón promete cobertura universal de salud |publisher=.esmas.com |date=August 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's medical infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent in major cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Care in Mexico&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatforum.com/articles/health/health-care-in-mexico.html |title=Health Care in Mexico |publisher=Expatforum.com |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/article/Mexico/Health-Care-Issues-Mexico/695 |title=Health Care Issues Mexico |publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk |accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rural communities still lack equipment for advanced medical procedures, forcing patients in those locations to travel to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care.&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt;

State-funded institutions such as [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS) and the [[Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers]] (ISSSTE) play a major role in health and social security. Private health services are also very important and account for 13% of all medical units in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinais.salud.gob.mx/medicinaprivada/index.html |title=Sistema Nacional de Información en Salud&amp;nbsp;– Infraestructura |publisher=Sinais.salud.gob.mx |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical training is done mostly at public universities with much specializations done in vocational or internship settings. Some public universities in Mexico, such as the [[University of Guadalajara]], have signed agreements with the U.S. to receive and train American students in Medicine. Health care costs in private institutions and prescription drugs in Mexico are on average lower than that of its North American economic partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Care in Mexico&quot;/&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Mexico}}
[[File:Biblioteca Central de la UNAM .jpg|thumb|right|The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].]]
In 2004, the literacy rate was at 97%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=medu15&amp;s=est&amp;c=3283 |title=INEGI literacy report −14, 2005 |publisher=Inegi.gob.mx |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for youth under the age of 14 and 91% for people over 15,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=medu16&amp;s=est&amp;c=3284 |title=INEGI literacy report 15+, 2005|publisher=Inegi.gob.mx |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing Mexico at the 24th place in the world rank accordingly to [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexico: Youth Literacy Rate|publisher=Global Virtual University|url=http://globalis.gvu.unu.edu/indicator_detail.cfm?IndicatorID=41&amp;Country=MX|accessdate=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] ranks 190th place in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by The Times Higher Education Supplement in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Times Higher Awards 2009|publisher=The Times Higher Education Supplement |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/hybrid.asp?typeCode=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private business schools also stand out in international rankings. [[IPADE]] and [[EGADE]], the business schools of [[Universidad Panamericana]] and of [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] respectively, were ranked in the top 10 in a survey conducted by The Wall Street Journal among recruiters outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recruiter's scoreboard Highlights|work=The Wall Street Journal/Harris Interactive survey of corporate recruiters on business schools|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/MB_06_Scoreboard.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement==
Public security is enacted at the three levels of government, each of which has different prerogatives and responsibilities. Local and state police department are primarily in charge of law enforcement, whereas the [[Mexican Federal Police]] are in charge of specialized duties. All levels report to the Secretaría de Seguridad Pública (Secretary of Public Security). The General Attorney's Office (Procuraduría General de la República, PGR) is the [[executive (government)|executive power]]'s agency in charge of investigating and prosecuting crimes at the federal level, mainly those related to drug and arms trafficking,&lt;ref&gt;&quot; An Inside Look at Mexican Guns and Arms Trafficking,&quot; by Barnard R.

While the government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, serious abuses of power have been reported in security operations in the southern part of the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt; The National Human Rights Commission has had little impact in reversing this trend, engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10696136 Big, expensive and weirdly spineless].

Despite the efforts of the authorities to fight crime and fraud, few Mexicans have strong confidence in the police or the judicial system, and therefore, few crimes are actually reported by the citizens.&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt; The ''Global Integrity Index'' which measures the existence and effectiveness of national anti-corruption mechanisms rated Mexico 31st behind Kenya, Thailand, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/globalindex/results.cfm |title=Global Integrity Report |publisher=Report.globalintegrity.org |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, president Calderón proposed a major reform of the judicial system, which was approved by the Congress of the Union, which included oral trials, the presumption of innocence for defendants, the authority of local police to investigate crime—until then a prerogative of special police units—and several other changes intended to speed up trials.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, JC Jr. (March 7, 2008) [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/07/world/americas/07mexico.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Mexico’s Congress Passes Overhaul of Justice Laws].

===Crime===
{{Main|Crime in Mexico|Mexican Drug War}}

According to a 2012 OECD study 15% of Mexicans report having been a victim of crime in the past year, a figure which among OECD countries is only higher in South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;OECDREFORMA&quot;/&gt; As of 2010 Mexico's [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] was 18 per 100,000 inhabitants;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icesi.org.mx/documentos/estadisticas/estadisticasOfi/denuncias_homicidio_doloso_1997_2010.pdf |title=Homicidios dolosos 1997-2010 |accessdate=2011-04-02 |format=PDF |publisher=Instituto Ciudadano de Estudios Sobre la Inseguridad, A.C. |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the world average is 6.9 per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Globa_study_on_homicide_2011_web.pdf Global Study on Homicide].

Current president Felipe Calderón made abating drug-trafficking one of the top priorities of his administration deploying military personnel to cities where drug cartels operate. This move has been criticized by the opposition parties and the National Human Rights Commission for escalating the violence, but its effects have been positively evaluated by the [[Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] as having obtained &quot;unprecedented results&quot; with &quot;many important successes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.
