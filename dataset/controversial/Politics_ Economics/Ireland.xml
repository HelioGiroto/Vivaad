Relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain epitomise Ireland's geography with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, a product of its mild but changeable oceanic climate, which avoids extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until the 17th century. Today, it is one of the most deforested areas in Europe.&lt;ref name=guardexa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/total-forest-area-by-country |title=Total forest coverage by country |author=Brown, Felicity |publisher=The Guardian |date=2 September 2009 |work=Environment Data |accessdate=24 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Solnit |first=Rebecca |title=Book of Migrations: Some Passages in Ireland |publisher=Verso |year=1997 |location=London |page=100 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=M7PixoY16fkC&amp;pg=PA100 |isbn=1-85984-186-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are twenty-six extant [[mammal]] species native to Ireland.

A [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] in the Middle Ages gave way to a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] resurgence in the 13th century. Over sixty years of [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|intermittent warfare in the 1500s]] led to English dominance after 1603. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and [[Protestant]] [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. In 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century led to the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades. Northern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom and saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973, both parts of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]].

[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, particularly in the fields of [[literature]] and, to a lesser degree, [[science]] and [[education]]. A strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed for example through [[Gaelic games]], [[Irish music]] and the [[Irish language]], alongside mainstream [[Western culture]], such as [[contemporary music]] and [[drama]], and a culture with much in common with Great Britain, as expressed through sports such as [[soccer]], [[rugby union|rugby]], [[horse racing]], and [[golf]], as well as the [[English language]].

===Pre-history===
{{main|Prehistoric Ireland}}

Most of Ireland was covered with ice until the end of the last [[ice age]] over 9,000 years ago. Sea levels were lower and Ireland, like Great Britain, was part of [[continental Europe]]. [[Mesolithic]] [[stone age]] inhabitants arrived some time after 8,000&amp;nbsp;BC and agriculture followed with the [[Neolithic Age]] around 4,500 to 4,000&amp;nbsp;BC when sheep, goats, cattle and cereals were imported from the [[Iberian peninsula]].

At the [[Céide Fields]], preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day [[County Mayo]], is an extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/West/CeideFields/ |title=Céide Fields |author=Heritage Ireland |publisher=Office of Public Works|accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating from not long after this period. Consisting of small divisions separated by [[dry-stone wall]]s, the fields were farmed for several centuries between 3,500 and 3,000&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] were the principal crops.

The [[Bronze Age]] – defined by the use of metal – began around 2,500&amp;nbsp;BC, with technology changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the [[wheel]], harnessing [[oxen]], [[weaving|weaving textiles]], brewing [[alcohol]], and skillful [[metalworking]], which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[torc]]s. According to [[John T. Koch]] and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] that also included Britain, France, Spain and Portugal where [[Celtic languages]] developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2008/may/title-80370-en.html |title=O'Donnell Lecture 'People called Keltoi, the La Tène Style, and ancient Celtic languages: the threefold Celts in the light of geography' |publisher=[[Aberystwyth University]] |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/Resources/Documents/Research/ODonnell.pdf|title=O'Donnell Lecture 2008 Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch2009&gt;{{Cite book|last = Koch|first = John|title = Tartessian: Celtic from the Southwest at the Dawn of History in Acta Palaeohispanica X Palaeohispanica 9 (2009)| publisher = Palaeohispanica|year = 2009|pages = 339–351|url = http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/29/54/26koch.pdf|issn = 1578-5386|accessdate = 2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146413465|title=New research suggests Welsh Celtic roots lie in Spain and Portugal|last=Koch|first=John|accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko|title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|page=384|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rethinking the Bronze Age and the Arrival of Indo-European in Atlantic Europe|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/pdfs/books/Celtic%20West%20conf.pdf|publisher=University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies and Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=A Race Apart: Insularity and Connectivity in Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 75, 2009, pp. 55–64|year=2008| publisher=The Prehistoric Society|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iron Age]] in Ireland is traditionally associated with people known as the ''[[Celts]]''. The Celts were commonly thought to have colonised Ireland in a series of invasions between the 8th and 1st centuries&amp;nbsp;BC. The [[Gaels]], the last wave of Celts, were said to have divided the island into five or more kingdoms after conquering it. However, some academics favour a theory that emphasises the diffusion of culture from overseas as opposed to a military colonisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Mascheretti|first1 = Silvia|last2 = Rogatcheva|first2= Margarita|last3 = Gündüz|first3 = Islam|last4 = Fredga |first4= Karl|last5= Searle|first5= Jeremy|title = How did pygmy shrews colonize Ireland?

===Late antiquity and early medieval times===
{{Main|History of Ireland (800–1169)}}

The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] geographers. [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' refers to Ireland as ''Mikra Brettania'' (''Lesser Britain''), in contrast to the larger island, which he called ''Megale Brettania'' (''Great Britain'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Freeman |first=Philip |title=Ireland and the classical world |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2001 |location=Austin, Texas |page=65 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA65 |isbn=0-292-72518-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to Ireland as ''[[Hibernia|Iouernia]]'' and to Great Britain as ''Albion''. These &quot;new&quot; names were likely to have been the Celtic names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, [[Exonym and endonym|in contrast]], were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Philip|last=Freeman|title=Ireland and the Classical World|publisher=University of TexasPress|location=Austin|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] would later refer to Ireland by this name too in its [[Latinised]] form, ''[[Hibernia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Hibernia|work = Roman Empire|publisher = United Nations of Roma Victrix|url = http://www.unrv.com/provinces/hibernia.php|accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Hart |first=John |title=Irish Pedigrees: or, The Origin and Stem of the Irish Nation |publisher=J. Duffy and Co. |year=1892 |location=Dublin |page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy records sixteen tribes inhabiting every part of Ireland in 100&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1=R|last1=Darcy|first2= William|last2= Flynn| title = Ptolemy's Map of Ireland: a Modern Decoding |journal=Irish Geography|volume=14|issue=1|date=March 2008 |pages=49–69 |publisher=Informaworld.com |doi=10.1080/00750770801909375}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the Roman Empire and the tribes of ancient Ireland is unclear. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been found, for example at [[New Grange]].&lt;ref&gt;Carson, R.A.G. and O'Kelly, Claire: ''A catalogue of the Roman coins from Newgrange, Co. Meath and notes on the coins and related finds'', pages 35–55. Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, volume 77, section C&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival tribes but, beginning in the 7th century&amp;nbsp;AD, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a [[High King of Ireland]]. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOC&quot;&gt;[[Dáibhí Ó Cróinín]], &quot;Ireland, 400–800&quot;, in Dáibhí Ó Cróinín (ed.), ''A New History of Ireland 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 182–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

The High King was said to preside over the patchwork of provincial kingdoms that together formed Ireland. All of these kingdoms had their own kings but were at least nominally subject to the High King. The High King was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal [[kingdom of Meath]], with a ceremonial capital at the [[Hill of Tara]]. The concept only became a political reality in the [[Viking Age#Ireland|Viking Age]] and even then was not a consistent one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Jaski |first=Bart |year=2005 |title=Kings and kingship |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland. An Encyclopedia |location=Abingdon and New York |pages=251–254|ref=}}, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ireland did have a unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the [[Brehon Laws]], administered by a professional class of jurists known as the ''brehons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ginnell |first=Laurence |authorlink=Laurence Ginnell |title=The Brehon laws: a legal handbook |publisher=T Fisher Unwin |year=1894 |page=81 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=t6wuAAAAIAAJ&amp;vq=%22The%20Brehons%22&amp;pg=PA81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Chronicle of Ireland]]'' records that in 431&amp;nbsp;AD Bishop [[Palladius]] arrived in Ireland on a mission from [[Pope Celestine I]] to minister to the Irish &quot;already believing in Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy |wstitle=St. Palladius |title=St. Palladius |author=Patrick Francis Moran |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same chronicle records that [[Saint Patrick]], Ireland's best known [[Patron saints of places|patron saint]], arrived the following year. There is continued debate over the missions of Palladius and Patrick but the consensus is that they both took place&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = De Paor|first = Liam|title = Saint Patrick's World: The Christian Culture of Ireland's Apostolic Age|publisher = Four Courts, Dublin|year = 1993|location = Dublin|pages = 78, 79|isbn = 1-85182-144-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the older [[druid]] tradition collapsed in the face of the new religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;cah&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cahill|first=Tim| title= How the Irish Saved Civilization |year=1996|publisher= Anchor Books |isbn= 0-385-41849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Christian scholars excelled in the study of [[Latin]] and Greek learning and Christian theology. In the monastic culture that followed the Christianisation of Ireland, Latin and Greek learning was preserved in Ireland during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] in contrast to elsewhere in Europe, where the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] followed the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cah&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Dowley, Tim, et al.| title=Eerdman's Handbook to the History of Christianity |year=1977|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. |location= Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn= 0-8028-3450-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arts of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]], metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the ''[[Book of Kells]]'', ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stokes |first=Margaret |authorlink=Margaret Stokes |title=Early Christian art in Ireland |publisher=Chapman and Hall |year=1888 |location=London |pages=9, 87, 117 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=25gTAAAAQAAJ |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on [[Iona]] by the Irish monk Saint [[Columba]] began [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|a tradition of Irish missionary]] work that spread Christianity and learning to [[Scotland]], [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and the [[Frankish Empire]] on [[Continental Europe]] after the [[fall of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|
first=Thomas|last=Bartlett|title=Ireland: A History|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19720-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These missions continued until the [[late Middle Ages]], establishing [[monasteries]] and centres of learning, producing scholars such as [[Sedulius Scottus]] and [[Johannes Eriugena]] and exerting much influence in Europe.

From the 9th century, waves of [[Viking]] raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ó Corráin |first=Donnchadh |authorlink=Donnchadh Ó Corráin |title=Vikings &amp; Ireland |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/General%20Vikings%20in%20Ireland.pdf |accessdate=2010-03-19 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These raids added to a pattern of raiding and [[endemic warfare]] that was already deep-seated in Ireland. The Vikings also were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in Ireland: [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], and also Carlingford, Strangford, Annagassan, Arklow, Youghal, Lough Foyle and Lough Ree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlkik/ihm/ire800.htm |title=Ireland's History in Maps (800 AD) |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=1998-12-06 |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1169, an expedition of [[Wales|Cambro]]-[[Norman people|Norman]] knights with an army of about six hundred landed at [[Bannow|Bannow Strand]] in present-day [[County Wexford]].

In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to Anjou, France following a war involving [[Tighearnán Ua Ruairc]], of [[Breifne]], and sought the assistance of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] king, [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]], in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the [[Gaelic Ireland|Irish]] kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor 1175|Treaty of Windsor]].

The invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', issued by [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] in 1155. The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the [[Celtic Church|Irish Church]] and its integration into the Roman Church system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis 2002 49&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Curtis|first=Edmund|title=A History of Ireland from Earliest Times to 1922 |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2002|page=49|isbn=0-415-27949-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Ruth et al| last = Edwards| title = An Atlas of Irish History| publisher = Routledge| year = 2005| page = 106 | isbn=978-0-415-33952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been significant controversy regarding authenticity of ''Laudabiliter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Ó Clabaigh|first=Colmán N. |year=2005 |title=Papacy |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

In 1172, the new pope, [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]], further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a [[tithe]] of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called [[Peter's Pence]], is still extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of [[Lord of Ireland]] which Henry conferred on his younger son, [[John Lackland]], in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the [[Lordship of Ireland]]. When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.

Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law so that by the late 13th century the [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman-Irish]] had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of Ireland]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and ''Irish Church'' for ''Church of England'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was founded in 1297.

However, from the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf |title=The Great Irish Famine: Laws that Isolated and Impoverished the Irish |publisher=New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education |year=1998 |work=Irish Famine Curriculum Committee |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the 15th century central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as [[The Pale]] and under the provisions of [[Poynings' Law]] of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the [[English Parliament]].

The title of ''[[King of Ireland]]'' was re-created in 1542 by [[Henry VIII]], then [[King of England]], of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. English rule of law was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century leading to the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]. A near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] and the [[Flight of the Earls]]. This control was further consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, which witnessed English and Scottish colonisation in the [[Plantations of Ireland]], the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]]. Irish losses during the Wars of the three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the [[Irish Confederacy]] and the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war.

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of [[Test Act#1672 Act|the Test Act 1672]], and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|penal laws]] Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery |publisher=University of Minnesota Law School |url=http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

An extraordinary climatic shock known as the &quot;[[Irish Famine (1740–1741)#Cause|Great Frost]]&quot; struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples and the poor summers severely damaged harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=David|last=Dickson|title=Arctic Ireland: The Extraordinary Story of the Great Frost and Forgotten Famine of 1740–41|publisher=White Row Press Ltd |location=Belfast |year=1997|isbn=978-1-870132-85-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the [[Irish Famine (1740–1741)|famine of 1740]].

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the [[Georgian architecture|architectural legacy of Georgian]] Ireland was built. In 1782, [[Poynings' Law]] was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.

In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]], with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward 1994 28&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782–1992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |year=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=0-8132-0784-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union with Great Britain===
The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward 1994 28&quot;/&gt; Thus, Ireland became part of an extended United Kingdom, ruled directly by a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|united parliament at Westminster]] in [[London]].

Aside from the development of the [[linen]] industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the [[industrial revolution]], partly because it lacked coal and iron resources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |title=Ireland AD 1750–1900 The Industrial Age |publisher=worldtimelines.org.uk |accessdate=2010-03-28 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101226180112/http://worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |archivedate=2011-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LamjgLbhTvwC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=ireland+failed+to+industrialize+due+to+lack+of+coal+and+iron&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=ireland%20failed%20to%20industrialize%20due%20to%20lack%20of%20coal%20and%20iron|first=Cormac|last=O'Grada|title=Ireland: A New Economic History, 1780–1939|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|pages=314–330|isbn=978-0-19-820598-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Capitalism in Contemporary Ireland|first1=Paul|last1=Keating|first2=Derry|last2=Desmond|publisher=Avebury|place=Hants, UK|year=1993|isbn=1-85628-362-3|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|first=John|last=Jacobsen|title=Chasing Progress in the Irish Republic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1994|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|first=Joel|last=Mokyr|title=Why Ireland Starved: A Quantitative and Analytical History of the Irish Economy, 1800–1850|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Oxon|year=1983|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern [[Irish nationalism]], primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

A subsequent campaign, led by O'Connell, for the repeal of the Act of Union failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or &quot;[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]&quot;. Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Kee|first = Robert|title = The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism|publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicholson|year = 1972|location = London|pages = 376–400|isbn = 0-297-17987-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the [[Ulster Volunteers]] were formed in 1913 under the leadership of [[Edward Carson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kee 1972 478–530&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Kee|first = Robert|title = The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism|publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicholson|year = 1972|location = London|pages = 478–530| isbn = 0-297-17987-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the [[Irish Volunteers]], whose aim was to ensure that the [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]] was passed. The Act was passed but with the &quot;temporary&quot; exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported Irish involvement in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers' name, and opposed Ireland's involvement in the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kee 1972 478–530&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|thumb|Sackville Street (now [[O'Connell Street]]), Dublin, after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]]]
The failed [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 was carried out by the latter group in alliance with a smaller socialist militia, the [[Irish Citizen Army]]. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]]. The pro-independence republican party, [[Sinn Féin]], received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]], setting up its own parliament ([[Dáil Éireann]]) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), launched a three-year guerilla war, which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated34&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morough|first=Michael|title=History Review |month=December |year=2000 |pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1921, the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was concluded between the British Government and representatives of the [[Second Dáil]]. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed [[Northern Ireland]] to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an oath of allegiance to the King was to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Kee|first = Robert|title = The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism|publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicholson|year = 1972|location = London|pages = 719–748 |isbn = 0-297-17987-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] between the new government of the [[Irish Free State]] and those opposed to the treaty, led by [[Éamon de Valera]]. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gwynn|first=Stephen|title=Ireland Since the Treaty|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=12|issue=2|month=January|year=1934|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first decade the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] and [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|political circumstances]] to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated34&quot;/&gt; This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence.

Northern Ireland was created as a division of the United Kingdom by the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] and until 1972 it was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941. [[Conscription]] was not extended to Northern Ireland and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south. One, [[James Joseph Magennis]], received the Victoria Cross for valour.

Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the Government of Northern Ireland (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|&quot;first-past-the-post&quot;]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fueled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and [[discrimination]] in housing and employment.&lt;ref name=whyte&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm|title = 'How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968?' by John Whyte|accessdate = 2008-10-23|last = Whyte|first = John|work = Contemporary Irish Studies|publisher = [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm|title = Fair Employment in Northern Ireland|accessdate = 2008-10-23|publisher = [[Northern Ireland Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm|title = &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; ...

In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass [[civil rights]] protests, which were often confronted by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] counter-protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first= Peter |year=1997|title=Provos: The IRA and Sinn Féin|pages=33–56|location=London|publisher= Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|isbn= 0-7475-3392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter-communal violence increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first= Peter |year=1997|title=Provos: The IRA and Sinn Féin|pages=56–100|location=London|publisher= Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|isbn= 0-7475-3392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Ireland government requested the [[British Army]] to aid the police, who were exhausted after several nights of [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|serious rioting]]. In 1969, the [[paramilitary]] [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]], which favoured the creation of a [[united Ireland]], emerged from a split in the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] and began a campaign against what it called the &quot;British occupation of the six counties&quot;.

Other groups, on both the unionist side and the nationalist side, participated in violence and a period known as [[the Troubles]] began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/467904.stm |title=Turning the pages on lost lives |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2010-01-04 |date=1999-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the [[British government]] suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed [[direct rule]]. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the [[Her Majesty's Government|British]] and [[Government of Ireland|Irish]] governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks. The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first=Brigadier Tauno |last=Nieminen |coauthors=General John de Chastelain, Andrew D. Sens|title=Independent International Commission on Decommissioning |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]) and began withdrawing troops.
On Wednesday, 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, a handshake symbolizing reconciliation between the two nations.

==All-island institutions==
{{Further2|For the agreement establishing a number of all-island institutions, see [[Good Friday Agreement]]. For the political institutions of the two jurisdictions separately, see [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland]] and [[Demography and politics of Northern Ireland]].}}

[[File:North-South Ministerial Council Offices.jpg|thumb|right|The offices of the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] on Upper English Street, [[Armagh]]. The council moved into this new building in April 2010.]]

Since 1922, Ireland has been [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] between two political entities:
* The [[Republic of Ireland]], formed as the [[Irish Free State]] on 6 December 1922, a [[sovereign state]] that covers five-sixths of the island. Its [[capital (political)|capital]] is [[Dublin]].
* [[Northern Ireland]], established on 3 May 1921, a part of the [[United Kingdom]] that covers the remaining portion of the island. Its capital is [[Belfast]], with the capital of the United Kingdom being at [[London]], [[England]].

The [[North/South Ministerial Council]], established under the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]], is an institution through which [[Government minister|ministers]] from the [[Government of Ireland]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island &quot;implementation bodies&quot; and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. For example, food safety is managed on an all-island basis by the [[Food Safety Promotion Board]] and [[Waterways Ireland]] is responsible for the maintenance and development of certain inland waterways on the island of Ireland. On the other hand, the two jurisdictions have common health and transport policies but these are implemented separately by already-existing bodies in each jurisdiction.

The current six areas for co-operations, implemented separately, are:
* Agriculture
* Education
* Environment
* Health
* Tourism, including [[Tourism Ireland]]
* Transport

The current six all-island implementation bodies are:
* [[Waterways Ireland]]
* [[Food Safety Promotion Board]]
* [[InterTradeIreland]]
* [[Special European Union Programmes Body]]
* [[The North/South Language Body]]
* [[Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission]]

Further development of the role and function of the Council are possible &quot;with the specific endorsement of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Oireachtas, subject to the extent of the competences and responsibility of the two Administrations.&quot;

The North/South Ministerial Council and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] are defined in the Good Friday Agreement as being &quot;mutually inter-dependent, and that one cannot successfully function without the other.&quot; Participation in the Council is a requisite for the operation of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and participation in the Northern Ireland Executive. When devolution in Northern Ireland is suspended, the powers of the Northern Ireland Executive revert to the [[British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference]].

The [[British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matter of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of Ireland's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, &quot;regular and frequent&quot; meetings co-chaired by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved [[all-Ireland]] issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.

There is no joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland, like there is [[British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly|between the UK and Ireland as a whole]]. However, under the Good Friday Agreement, the Oireachtas and Northern Ireland Assembly are asked to consider developing one. The Agreement also contains a suggestion for the creation of a consultative forum composed of members of [[civil society]] from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Under the 2007, [[St. Andrew's Agreement]], the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to support the establishment of a North/South Consultative Forum and to encourage parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to support the creation of a North/South parliamentary forum.

Three major political parties, [[Sinn Féin]], the [[Irish Green Party]] and, most recently, [[Fianna Fáil]], and several smaller parties are organised on an all-island basis. However, only Sinn Féin and the Greens have contested elections and have held legislative seats in both jurisdictions. The two jurisdictions share [[transport]], [[telecommunications]], energy and water systems. With a few notable exceptions, the island is the main organisational unit for major [[Religion in Ireland|religious]], cultural and sporting organisations.

===Single energy market===
Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the [[Euro]] and [[Pound Sterling]]), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-island basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions' shared membership of the [[European Union]], and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an &quot;all-island economy&quot; to take advantage of [[economies of scale]] and boost competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf| archivedate=2008-11-09|url=http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf| year= 2006|title=National Competitiveness Council Submission on the National Development Plan 2007–2013|publisher= National Competitiveness Council|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area in which the island already operates as a single market is [[electricity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sem-o.com/AboutSEMO/Pages/default.aspx |title=About SEMO: The Single Electricity Market |publisher=SEMO, Single Electricity Market Operator |accessdate=2011-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are plans for the creation of an all-island [[Natural gas|gas]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/ukandireland/politics/dup-minister-expresses-support-for-single-gas-market-13442926.html |date=2011-03-18 |title=DUP minister expresses support for single gas market|publisher= Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of their existence [[electricity network]]s in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cer.ie/en/electricity-transmission-network-interconnection.aspx |title=Interconnection |publisher=Commission for Energy regulation |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also connected through [[Great Britain]] to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying [[Northern Ireland Electricity]] (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. [[EirGrid]] is building a [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=East-West Interconnector |url=http://www.eirgridprojects.com/projects/east-westinterconnector/projectactivity/ |title=Project Activity |date=2009-09-16 |publisher=[[EirGrid]] |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with electricity, the [[natural gas]] distribution network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking [[Gormanston, County Meath]], and [[Ballyclare]], [[County Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bord Gáis Networks : Northern Ireland : South-North Pipeline|publisher = [[Bord Gáis]] |url = http://www.bordgais.ie/networks/index.jsp?1nID=102&amp;pID=109&amp;nID=313 |accessdate = 2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Ireland's gas comes through interconnectors between [[Twynholm]] in [[Scotland]] and [[Ballylumford power station|Ballylumford]], County Antrim and [[Loughshinny]], [[County Dublin]]. A decreasing supply is coming from the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Northern Ireland Energy Holdings—Frequently Asked Questions|publisher = [[Northern Ireland Energy Holdings]] |url = http://www.nienergyholdings.com/FAQs/Index.php |accessdate = 2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Gas Capacity Statement 2007|publisher = [[Commission for Energy Regulation]] |url = http://www.cer.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=d9f0b11e-3a13-42bb-86b7-f7470a9c68cc|format = PDF|accessdate = 2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Corrib Gas Field]] off the coast of [[County Mayo]] has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over [[Corrib gas controversy|a controversial decision]] to refine the gas onshore.

There have been recent efforts in Ireland to use [[renewable energy]] such as [[wind power]]. Large [[wind farm]]s are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom consider the [[wind turbine]]s to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's [[Turlough Hill]] facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Options For Future Renewable Energy Policy, Targets And Programmes issued by Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|publisher =Hibernian Wind Power Ltd|date =2004-02-27|url =http://www.hibernianwindpower.ie/hiberwindresponse_dcmnr.pdf|accessdate =2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Ireland|Geology of Ireland}}
{{See also|Climate of Ireland}}
[[File:Ireland physical large.png|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Physical features of Ireland.]]

The island of Ireland is located in the [[North-West Europe|north-west of Europe]], between latitudes [[51st parallel north|51°]] and [[56th parallel north|56° N]], and longitudes [[11th meridian west|11°]] and [[5th meridian west|5° W]]. It is separated from the neighbouring island of [[Great Britain]] by the [[Irish Sea]] and the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]], which has a width of {{convert|23|km}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Across the waters |last1=Ritchie |first1=Heather |last2=Ellis |first2=Geraint |year=2009 |url=http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/atw_north_channel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]] and to the south is the [[Celtic Sea]], which lies between Ireland and [[Brittany]], in France. Ireland and Great Britain, together with nearby islands, are known collectively as the [[British Isles]]. As [[British Isles naming dispute|the term British Isles is controversial]] in relation to Ireland, the alternate term ''Britain and Ireland'' is often used as a neutral term for the islands.

A ring of coastal mountains surround low [[plain]]s at the centre of the island. The highest of these is [[Carrauntoohil]] ({{lang-ga|Corrán Tuathail}}) in [[County Kerry]], which rises to {{convert|1038|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSIFAQS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title =Frequently Asked Questions |work=osi.ie|publisher=[[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] |url=http://www.osi.ie/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx |accessdate=2012-04-04}} &lt;/ref&gt; The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Victor|last=Meally|title=Encyclopaedia of Ireland|publisher=A. Figgis|location=Dublin|year=1968|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western areas can be mountainous and rocky with green [[panorama|panoramic vistas]]. The [[River Shannon]], the island's longest river at {{convert|386|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long, rises in [[County Cavan]] in the north west and flows {{convert|113|km|mi}} to [[Limerick]] city in the mid west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nature and Scenery |work=Discover Ireland |publisher=Tourism Ireland |url =http://www.discoverireland.com/gb/about-ireland/nature/ |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the [[sobriquet]] ''the Emerald Isle''. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperateness|temperate]] avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEclimate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title =Climate of Ireland|work = Climate|publisher = Met Éireann|url =http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp|accessdate =2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

[[File:Twelve pins.JPG|thumb|left|The rugged hills of [[Connemara]], [[County Galway]].]]
Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north [[County Galway]] and east [[County Mayo]] have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightening occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;MErainfall&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Rainfall|work= Climate|publisher = Met Éireann|url = http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp|accessdate = 2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.

Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing {{nowrap|0 °C}} {{nowrap|(32 °F)}} at inland [[weather station]]s, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in 1995, [[2003 European heat wave|2003]] and [[2006 European heat wave#Ireland|2006]]. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during [[Winter of 2009–2010 in Europe|the winter of 2009/10]]. Temperatures fell as low as −17.2 °C (1 °F) in County Mayo on December 20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/subzero-temperatures-make-2010-a-recordbreaking-year-2475709.html |title=Sub-zero temperatures make 2010 a record-breaking year |first=Kevin |last=Keane |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |date=2010-12-28 |accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to a metre (3&amp;nbsp;ft) of snow in mountainous areas.

[[File:A view from Scrabo - geograph.org.uk - 1324261.jpg|thumb|Green pasture in [[County Down]], with the [[Mourne Mountains]] in the background.]]
The island consists of varied [[geologic province|geological provinces]]. In the far west, around County Galway and [[County Donegal]], is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of [[Caledonides|Caledonide]] affinity, similar to the [[Scottish Highlands]]. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to [[Longford]] and south to [[Navan]] is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the [[Southern Uplands]] province of [[Scotland]]. Further south, along the [[County Wexford]] coastline, is an area of granite [[intrusion|intrusives]] into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Geology of Ireland|work = Geology for Everyone|publisher = Geological Survey of Ireland|url = http://www.gsi.ie/Education/Geology+for+Everyone/Geology+of+Ireland.htm|accessdate = 2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bedrock Geology of Ireland|work = Geology for Everyone|publisher = Geological Survey of Ireland|url = http://www.gsi.ie/NR/rdonlyres/0302F251-C4ED-4938-BCF0-CF228A3E8F6A/0/GSI_GeolIreland_A4.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southwest, around [[Bantry Bay]] and the mountains of [[Macgillicuddy's Reeks]], is an area of substantially deformed, but only lightly [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]], Devonian-aged rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Geology of Kerry-Cork—Sheet 21|work = Maps|publisher = Geological Survey of Ireland|year = 2007|url = http://www.gsi.ie/Publications+and+Data/Maps/Geology+of+Kerry-Cork+-+Sheet+21.htm|accessdate = 2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partial ring of &quot;hard rock&quot; geology is covered by a blanket of Carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country, giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape.

[[Stately home]]s, built during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries in [[Palladian]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[neo-Gothic]] styles, such as, [[Castle Ward]], [[Castletown House]], [[Bantry House]], are also of interest to tourists. Some have been converted into hotels, such as [[Ashford Castle]], [[Castle Leslie]] and [[Dromoland Castle]].

As Ireland was isolated from [[mainland Europe]] by rising sea levels after the [[ice age]], it has less diverse animal and plant species than either Great Britain or mainland Europe. There are [[List of mammals of Ireland|55 mammal species]] in Ireland and of them only 26 land [[mammal]] species are considered native to Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costello, M.J 93&quot; &gt;'''Costello, M.J. and Kelly, K.S.''', 1993 ''Biogeography of Ireland: past, present and future'' Irish Biogeographic Society Occasional Publications Number 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some species, such as, the [[red fox]], [[hedgehog]] and [[badger]], are very common, whereas others, like the [[Mountain Hare|Irish hare]], [[red deer]] and [[pine marten]] are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of [[sea turtle]], [[shark]], [[Earless seal|seal]], [[whale]], and [[dolphin]], are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the [[Barn Swallow]]. Most of Ireland's bird species come from [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]] and [[Africa]].

Several different [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]], [[conifer]] plantations, [[peat]] [[bogs]] and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,&lt;ref name=&quot;www2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Land cover and land use|work = Environmental Assessment|publisher = Environmental Protection Agency|year = 2011|url = http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/assessment/land/|accessdate = 2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no top [[predator]] in Ireland, populations of animals, such as semi-wild deer, that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual [[culling]].

There are no snakes in Ireland and only one reptile (the [[Viviparous lizard|common lizard]]) is native to the island. Extinct species include the [[Irish Elk|Irish elk]], the [[great auk]] and the [[Wolves in Ireland|wolf]]. Some previously extinct birds, such as, the [[Golden Eagle]], have recently been reintroduced after decades of [[Local extinction|extirpation]].

Until medieval times Ireland was heavily forested with [[oak]], [[pine]] and [[birch]]. Forests today cover about 12.6% of Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/assessment/land/ |title=EPA, Land Use Cover |publisher=Epa.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 4,450&amp;nbsp;km² or one million acres is owned by [[Coillte]], the Republic's forestry service.&lt;ref name=&quot;coillte&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = National|work = Forest Facts|publisher = [[Coillte Teoranta]]|url =http://www.coillte.ie/coillteforest/forest_facts/forest_facts_by_county/national/|date = 2008-11-05|accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic lies in 42nd place (out of 55) in a list of the most forested countries in Europe.&lt;ref name=forester&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blatantworld.com/feature/europe/most_forested_countries.html |title =Most Forested Countries In Europe |author=FAO |publisher=BlatantWorld.com |date=August 2009 |work=Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations |accessdate=24 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild-flower. Gorse (''[[Ulex europaeus]]''), a wild [[furze]], is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been &quot;invaded&quot; by some grasses, such as ''[[Spartina anglica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hackney|first=Paul|url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/invasive/species.asp?item=2680 |title=Spartina Anglica|work= Invasive Alien Species in Northern Ireland|accessdate=2009-01-01 |publisher=National Museums Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gorse-Ulex europaeus.jpg|thumb|Furze (''[[Ulex europaeus]]'')]]
The [[algae|algal]] and seaweed flora is that of the cold-temperate variety. The total number of species is 574 &lt;ref name=&quot;Guiry and Nic Dhonncha 01&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Guiry|first = M.D.|last2 = Nic Dhonncha|first2 = E.N|title = The Marine Macroalgae of Ireland: Biodiversity and Distribution in Marine Biodiversity in Ireland and Adjacent Waters|location = Belfast|publisher = Ulster Museum|year = 2001|journal = Proceedings of a Conference 26–27 April 2001|issue = Publication No. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is distributed as follows:
* 264 [[Rhodophyta]] (red algae)
* 152 [[Phaeophyceae]] (brown algae including kelps)
* 114 [[Green algae|Chloropyta]] (green algae)
* 31 [[Cyanophyta]] (Blue-green algae)

The island has been invaded by some algae, some of which are now well established. For example:&lt;ref name=&quot;Minchin 01&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Minchin|first = D.|title = Biodiversity and Marine Invaders|place = Belfast|publisher = Ulster Museum|year = 2001|journal = Proceedings of a Conference 26–27 April 2001|issue = Publication No. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Codium fragile]]'' ssp. ''fragile'' (formerly reported as ssp. ''tomentosum''), now well established.

''Codium fragile'' ssp. ''atlanticum'' has recently been established to be native, although for many years it was regarded as an alien species.

Because of its mild climate, many species, including [[subtropics|sub-tropical]] species such as [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], are grown in Ireland. [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The island itself can be subdivided into two [[ecoregion]]s: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.

===Impact of agriculture===
[[File:Pasture at the Viewpoint - geograph.org.uk - 15065.jpg|thumb|Rolling green pastures near [[Bantry]], [[County Cork]].]]
The long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, impact the natural fresh-water ecosystems and have placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarecoco.ie/water-waste-environment/biodiversity/ |title=Biodiversity|publisher=Clare County Council |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasthills.org/minisite/adult_version/draftottersapmar07-2.pdf|title=Otter Lutra Lutra|work=Northern Ireland Species Action Plan|publisher=Environment and Heritage Service|format= PDF|year = 2007|accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but recent reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;cap_reforms&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=CAP Reform—A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |work=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |accessdate=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, most of it designated for commercial production.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2000&quot;/&gt; Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the [[Killarney National Park]]. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by [[Deer of Ireland|deer]] and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Dick|last = Roche|authorlink = Dick Roche|title = National Parks|publisher = Seanad Éireann|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0185/S.0185.200611080008.html|volume = 185|date = 2006-11-08|accessdate = 2007-07-30}} [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] Debate involving Former Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government&lt;/ref&gt;

People have lived in Ireland for over 9,000 years, although only a limited amount is known about the [[palaeolithic]], [[neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] inhabitants of the island. Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of dozens of different peoples that may or may not be mythological, for example the [[Cruithne (people)|Cruithne]], [[Attacotti]], [[Conmaicne]], [[Eóganachta]], [[Érainn]], and [[Soghain]], to name but a few. Over the past 1000 years or so, [[Vikings]], [[Normans]], [[Scottish people|Scots]] and [[English people|English]] have all added to the Gaelic population and have had significant influences on Irish Culture.

Ireland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]]. The largest denomination is [[Roman Catholicism]] representing over 73% for the island (and about 87%&lt;ref name=&quot;census2006-religion&quot;/&gt; of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various [[Protestant]] denominations (about 53% of Northern Ireland).&lt;ref name=&quot;niprotestants&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last = McKittrick|first = David|title = Census Reveals Northern Ireland's Protestant Population is at Record Low|publisher = Independent|date = 2002-12-19| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/census-reveals-northern-irelands-protestant-population-is-at-record-low-611500.html|accessdate = 2009-12-30|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest is the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]]. The [[Islam in Ireland|Muslim community]] is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration. The island has a small [[History of the Jews in Ireland|Jewish community]]. About 4% of the Republic's population&lt;ref name=&quot;census2006-religion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/census2006results/volume_13/volume_13_religion.pdf|title=Census 2006 Volume 13 Religion|format=PDF|publisher=Central Statistics Office |accessdate=2008-01-29}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population&lt;ref name=&quot;niprotestants&quot; /&gt; describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the [[Irish Times]],&lt;!-- Republic of Ireland only? --&gt; 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once a week.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, but a devastating [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.

===Divisions and settlements===
{{See|Provinces of Ireland|Counties of Ireland|City status in Ireland}}

Traditionally, Ireland is subdivided into [[Provinces of Ireland|four provinces]]: [[Connacht]] (west), [[Leinster]] (east), [[Munster]] (south), and [[Ulster]] (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Crawford|first =John|title =Anglicizing the Government of Ireland: The Irish Privy Council and the Expansion of Tudor Rule 1556–1578|publisher =Irish Academic Press|year =1993|isbn=0-7165-2498-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland has [[Counties of Ireland|32 traditional counties]]. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland and [[Counties of Northern Ireland|six are in Northern Ireland]]. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, ''Ulster'' is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.

In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example postal addresses and by the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]]. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetteer.co.uk/section1.htm |title=The Gazetteer of British Place Names: Main features of the Gazetteer |publisher=www.gazetteer.co.uk |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/destinationNI/ |title= NI by County |work=Discover Northern Ireland |publisher= Northern Ireland Tourist Board |accessdate=2010-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

City status in Ireland is decided by [[legislation|legislative]] or [[royal charter]]. [[Dublin]], with over 1 million residents in the [[Greater Dublin Area]], is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, [[Armagh]], with 14,590 is the seat of the [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Primate of All Ireland]] and was re-granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994 (having lost that status in [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840|local government reforms of 1840]]). In the Republic of Ireland, [[Kilkenny]], seat of the [[Butler dynasty]], while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 [[Local Government Act 2001|Local Government Act]]), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.

===Migration===
[[File:Population of Ireland since 1500.png|thumb|upright=1.5|right|The population of Ireland since 1603 showing the consequence of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine (1845–9)]] (Note: figures before 1841 are contemporary estimates).]]

The population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century. A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was due to death from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.

Emigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia where today a large [[Irish diaspora]] lives. Today 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of her population, are of Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=2&amp;Data=Count&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories—20% sample data]&quot;. Statistics Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 36 million Americans claim Irish ancestry – more than 12% of the total population and 20% of the white population.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_DP2&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-format=|title = U.S. Census|publisher = U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] is the most Irish of US states with 23.8% of the population claiming Irish ancestry. The pattern of immigration over this period particularly devastated the western and southern seaboards. Prior to the Great Famine, the provinces of Connacht, Munster and Leinster were more or less evenly populated whereas Ulster was far less densely populated than the other three. Today, Ulster and Leinster, and in particular Dublin, have a far greater population density than Munster and Connacht.

With growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the [[European Union]] expanded to include [[Poland]] in 2004, [[Polish people]] have made up the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Sullivan| first =Kevin|authorlink =Kevin Sullivan (journalist)|title = Hustling to Find Classrooms For All in a Diverse Ireland|publisher = Washington Post|date = 2007-10-24| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/23/AR2007102302162_pf.html|accessdate = 2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Central Europe]]. There has also been significant immigration from [[Lithuania]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tovey |first=Hilary |authorlink= |coauthors=Share, Perry |title=A sociology of Ireland |publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan |year=2003 |location=Dublin |page=156 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EU4NqA7RIHUC&amp;pg=PA156 |isbn=0-7171-3501-2 |accessdate=2011-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Ireland in particular has seen large-scale immigration. The 2006 census recorded that 420,000 foreign nationals, or about 10% of the population, lived in the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last = Seaver|first = Michael|title = Ireland Steps Up as Immigration Leader|publisher = The Christian Science Monitor|date = 2007-09-05| url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0905/p06s02-woeu.html|accessdate = 2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Nigerian]]s, along with people from other African countries, have accounted for a large proportion of the non–[[European Union]] migrants to Ireland.

===Languages===
Two main languages are spoken in Ireland: [[Irish Language|Irish]] and [[Hiberno-English|English]]. Both languages have widely contributed to literature. Irish, now a minority but official language of the Republic of Ireland, was the vernacular of the Irish people for over two thousand years and was probably introduced by some sort of proto-Gaelic migration during the Iron age, possibly earlier. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively. It has a vast treasure of written texts from many centuries, and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman|French]] and [[English Language|English]]. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language, although [[Gaelic Revival|revival efforts]] are continuing in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, [[Gaeltacht]] or Irish-speaking areas are still seeing a decline in the language. Irish language is a compulsory subject in the state education system in the Republic, and the [[Gaelscoil]] movement has seen many Irish medium schools established in both jurisdictions.

[[Hiberno-English|English]] was first introduced to Ireland in the Norman invasion. It was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England, and was largely replaced by Irish before the Tudor Conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced [[Irish language|Irish]] with English as the first language for a vast majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Spolsky|first = Bernard|title = Language policy| publisher = Cambridge University|year = 2004|location = Cambridge|page = 191|isbn = 0-521-01175-2, 9780521011754}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 10% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish regularly outside of the education system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Table 15: Irish speakers aged 3 years and over in each Province, County and City, classified by frequency of speaking Irish, 2006|work =Census 2006—Volume 9—Irish Language|publisher =CSO|url = http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75639|accessdate =2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as &quot;Irish speakers.&quot; In Northern Ireland, English is the de facto official language, but official recognition is afforded to Irish, including specific protective measures under Part III of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. A lesser status (including recognition under Part II of the Charter) is given to [[Ulster Scots dialects]], which are also spoken by some in the Republic of Ireland. In recent decades, with the increase in immigration, many more languages have been introduced, particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Ireland|Culture of Northern Ireland}}
[[File:Ardboe Cross.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ardboe High Cross]], [[County Tyrone]]|alt=Tall stone cross, with intricate carved patterns, protected by metal railings surrounded by short cut grass. Trees are to either side, cows in open countryside are in the middle distance.]]
Ireland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient immigration and influences (such as [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]]) and more recent [[Anglicisation]] and [[Americanisation]] as well as participation in a broader [[European culture]]. In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the [[Celtic nations]] of Europe, which also includes [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Isle of Mann]] and [[Brittany]]. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed ''Irish [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlace]]'' or ''[[Celtic knot]]work.'' These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tionchar na gCeilteach|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/irish/articles/view/720/english/|accessdate=2010-01-23|publisher=BBC|date=2009-05-23|work=BBC Northern Ireland website}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the distinctive style of [[traditional Irish music]] and dance, and has become indicative of modern &quot;Celtic&quot; culture in general.

[[Religion in Ireland|Religion]] has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century [[Plantations of Ireland|plantations]], has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland's pre-Christian heritage fused with the [[Celtic Church]] following the missions of [[Saint Patrick]] in the 5th century. The [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]s, begun by the Irish monk Saint [[Columba]], spread the Irish vision of Christianity to [[pagan]] [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and the [[Frankish Empire]]. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] that followed the [[fall of Rome]], earning Ireland the sobriquet, &quot;the island of saints and scholars&quot;. In more recent years, the [[Irish pub]]s have become outposts of Irish culture worldwide.

The [[Republic of Ireland]]'s national theatre is the [[Abbey Theatre]] founded in 1904 and the national Irish-language theatre is [[An Taibhdhearc]], established in 1928 in [[Galway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Stair na Taibhdheirce|publisher = An Taibhdheirce|year = 2005|url = http://www.antaibhdhearc.com/stair.html|accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = An Taibhdhearc|publisher = Fodors|url =http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/the-west/review-102098.html|accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playwrights such as [[Seán O'Casey]], [[Brian Friel]], [[Sebastian Barry]], [[Conor McPherson]] and [[Billy Roche]] are internationally renowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Houston|first =Eugenie|title =Working and Living in Ireland|publisher =Working and Living Publications|year =2001|isbn=0-9536896-8-9|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of languages used in Ireland. [[Irish language|Irish]] is the only language to have originated from within the island. Since the late 19th century, [[English language|English]] has become the predominant first language having been a spoken language in Ireland since the Middle Ages. A large minority claim some ability to speak Irish today, although it is the first language only of a small percentage of the population. Under [[Constitution of Ireland]], both languages have official status with Irish being the national and first official language. In Northern Ireland English is the dominant state language, whilst Irish and [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] are recognised minority languages.

Ireland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, particularly in the English language. Poetry in Irish is the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century. In English, [[Jonathan Swift]], still often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the [[English language]], was wildly popular in his day for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' and [[Oscar Wilde]] is known most for his often quoted witticisms.

In the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as &quot;[[Bloomsday]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bloomsday 2007 Community Wide Events|work = Past Events|publisher = The James Joyce Centre|url = http://www.jamesjoyce.ie/detail.asp?ID=86|accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first= Andrew|last=Higgins Wyndham|title=Re-imagining Ireland|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; through writers such as [[John McGahern]] and poets such as [[Seamus Heaney]].

[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century.]]

The Irish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a recent surge in popularity, not least through the phenomenon of ''[[Riverdance]]'', a theatrical performance of Irish traditional dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Butler|first = Jean|coauthor = Edited by Andrew Higgins Wyndham|title = Re-imagining Ireland: Re-imageing Irish Dance|publisher = University of Virginia Press|year = 2006|location = Virginia|page = 141|url = http://books.google.com/?id=Oo-u0p31yjQC|isbn = 0-8139-2544-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music fell out of favour, especially in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Geraghty|first =Des|title =Luke Kelly: A Memoir|publisher =Basement Press|year =1994|pages = 26–30|isbn= 1-85594-090-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, inspired by the American folk music movement, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[Emmet Spiceland]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like [[Seán Ó Riada]] and [[Christy Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Moore|first =Christy|title =One Voice: My Life in Song|publisher =Hodder and Stoughton/Lir|year =2000|isbn= 0-340-76839-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]], [[Black 47]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.

During the 1990s a sub-genre of [[folk metal]] emerged in Ireland that fused [[heavy metal music]] with Irish and Celtic music. The pioneers of this sub-genre were [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]], [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]], and [[Waylander (band)|Waylander]]. Some contemporary music groups stick closer to a &quot;traditional&quot; sound, including [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Téada]], [[Danú]], [[Dervish]], [[Lúnasa (band)|Lúnasa]], and [[Solas (group)|Solas]]. Others incorporate multiple cultures in a fusion of styles, such as [[Afro Celt Sound System]] and [[Kíla]].

The earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = O'Kelly|first = Michael J.|coauthors = O'Kelly, Claire|title = Newgrange. Archaeology Art and Legend|publisher = Thames and Hudson|year = 1982|location = London|url = http://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ|isbn = 978-0-500-27371-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is traced through [[Bronze age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as [[John Butler Yeats]], [[William Orpen]], [[Jack Yeats]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]]. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include [[Sean Scully]], [[Kevin Abosch]], and [[Alice Maher]].

===Science===
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Boyle]] formulated Boyle's Law.]]
The Irish philosopher and theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] was considered one of the leading intellectuals of his early Middle Ages. Sir [[Ernest Henry Shackleton]], an Anglo-Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of [[Mount Erebus]] and the discovery of the approximate location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. [[Robert Boyle]] was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early [[gentleman scientist]]. He is largely regarded one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of [[Boyle's law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scientists&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Reville|first = William|title = Ireland's Scientific Heritage|work = Understanding Science&quot; series: Famous Irish Scientists|publisher = [[University College Cork]]; Faculty of Science|date = 2000-12-14|url = http://understandingscience.ucc.ie/pages/irishscientists.htm|accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19th century physicist, [[John Tyndall]], discovered the [[Tyndall effect]], which explains why the sky is blue. [[Father Nicholas Joseph Callan]], Professor of Natural Philosophy in [[Maynooth College]], is best known for his invention of the [[induction coil]], [[transformer]] and he discovered an early method of [[galvanisation]] in the 19th century.

Other notable Irish [[physicists]] include [[Ernest Walton]], winner of the 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. With [[Sir John Douglas Cockcroft]], he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of [[wave equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1951/press.html?print=1 |title=Nobel Prize in Physics 1951 - Presentation Speech |first=Professor I. |last=Waller |publisher=[[Nobel Prize]] |year=1951 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Thomson, or [[Lord Kelvin]], is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the [[Kelvin]], is named after. Sir [[Joseph Larmor]], a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;physicsworld&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Mark |last=McCartney |title=William Thomson: king of Victorian physics |work=Features |publisher=[[Physics World]] |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/16484|date=2002-12-01 |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Johnstone Stoney]] introduced the term ''[[electron]]'' in 1891. [[John Stewart Bell]] was the originator of [[Bell's Theorem]] and a paper concerning the discovery of the [[Chiral anomaly|Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly]] and was nominated for a Nobel prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientists&quot;/&gt; Notable mathematicians include Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], famous for work in [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical mechanics]] and the invention of [[quaternions]]. [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]]'s contribution of the [[Edgeworth Box]] remains influential in neo-classical microeconomic theory to this day; while [[Richard Cantillon]] inspired [[Adam Smith]], among others. [[John B. Cosgrave]] was a specialist in [[number theory]] and discovered a 2000-digit [[prime number]] in 1999 and a record composite [[Fermat number]] in 2003. [[John Lighton Synge]] made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] as one of his students.

Ireland has nine universities, seven in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and the [[University College Dublin]], as well as numerous third-level colleges and institutes and a branch of the Open University, the [[Open University in Ireland]].

===Sport===
{{Main|Sport in Ireland}}
{{See also|Irish people#Sports|l1=List of Irish sports people}}

The island of Ireland fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is [[Association football]], although both associations continued to field international teams under the name &quot;Ireland&quot; until the 1950s. An all-Ireland club competition for soccer, the [[Setanta Cup]], was created in 2005.

[[Gaelic football]] is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, with about 2,600 clubs on the island. In 2003 it represented 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by [[hurling]] at 23%, [[soccer]] at 16% and rugby at 8%&lt;ref name=&quot;esri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esri.ie/pdf/BKMNINT180_Main%20Text_Social%20and%20Economic%20Value%20of%20Sport.pdf|publisher=The Economic and Social Research Institute |format=PDF |title=The Social Significance of Sport|accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[All-Ireland Football Final]] is the most watched event in the sporting calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10004396.shtml |title=Initiative’s latest ViewerTrack study shows that in Ireland GAA and soccer still dominate the sporting arena, while globally the Superbowl (sic) was the most watched sporting event of 2005 |publisher=Finfacts.com |date=2006-01-04 |accessdate=2010-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association football|Soccer]] is the most widely played team game on the island, and the most popular in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;esri&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FootballSoccer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/709/soccer-in-northern-ireland|title=Soccer in Northern Ireland|publisher=Culture Northern Ireland|date=2008-07-14|accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swimming, golf, aerobics, soccer, cycling, Gaelic football and billiards/snooker are the sporting activities with the highest levels of playing participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esri.ie/UserFiles/publications/20070223162340/BKMNINT178_Main%20Text%20Chapters%201-4.pdf |title=Sports Participation and Health Among Adults in Ireland |publisher=The Economic and Social Research Institute |accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport is also the most notable exception where the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] field separate international teams.

In recent years ice hockey has seen an increase in popularity, notably with the [[Belfast Giants]] ice hockey team in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland have also produced two World Snooker Champions. Many other sports are also played and followed, including [[basketball]], [[boxing]], [[cricket]], [[fishing]], [[greyhound racing]], [[Gaelic handball|handball]], [[hockey]], [[horse racing]], [[motor sport]], [[show jumping]] and [[tennis]].

====Field sports====

[[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]] are the best-known of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as [[Gaelic games]]. Gaelic games are governed by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA), with the exception of ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crokepark.ie/ |title=Croke Park. Not just a venue. A destination.|publisher=Croke Park Stadium|accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; capacity [[Croke Park]] in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]. During the redevelopment of the [[Lansdowne Road|Lansdowne Road stadium]] in 2007–10, international rugby and soccer were played there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501459.html|title=For First Time, Croke Park Is Ireland's Common Ground |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2008-08-14 |publisher=The Washington Post|first=Michael|last=Moynihan}}&lt;/ref&gt; All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.

The [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = FAI History: 1921–1930|publisher = Football Association of Ireland|date = 2009-06-05|url = http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=222&amp;Itemid=226|accessdate = 2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.

[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]
In 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as &quot;[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]&quot; and that the IFA's team be known as &quot;[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]&quot; (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]] in [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]]. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the [[Premier League|English]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish]] soccer leagues.

Unlike soccer, Ireland continues to field a single [[Ireland national rugby union team|national rugby team]] and a single association, the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] (IRFU), governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every [[Rugby World Cup]], making the quarter-finals in four of them. Ireland also hosted games during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]]s (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the [[Magners League]] (now called the RaboDirect Pro12) and at least three compete for the [[Heineken Cup]]. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994. During that time, [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] ([[1998–99 Heineken Cup|1999]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Fourth Heineken Cup Final|work = Match report| publisher = European Rugby Cup|date = 1999-01-30|url = http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/82_629.php|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930195030/http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/82_629.php|archivedate = 2007-09-30|accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] ([[2005–06 Heineken Cup|2006]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/european/4998452.stm

In addition to this, the Irish International side has had increased success in the [[Six Nations Championship]] against the other European elite sides. This success, including [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crowns]] in 2004, 2006 and 2007, culminated with a clean sweep of victories, known as a [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]], in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Ireland cricket team]] was among the associate nations that qualified for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. It defeated [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and finished second in its pool, earning a place in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup Super Eight stage|Super 8 stage]] of the competition.

Three golfers from Northern Ireland have been particularly successful. In 2010, [[Graeme McDowell]] became the first Irish golfer to win the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and the first European to win that tournament since 1970. [[Rory McIlroy]], at the age of 22, won the 2011 U.S. Open, while [[Darren Clarke]]'s latest victory was the [[2011 Open Championship]] at Royal St. George's. In August 2012, McIlroy won his 2nd major championship by winning the USPGA Championship by a record margin of 8 shots.

The west coast of Ireland, [[Lahinch]] and [[Donegal Bay]] in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. In recent years, [[Bundoran]] has hosted European championship surfing. [[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best [[wreck dives]] being in [[Malin Head]] and off the [[County Cork]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDaid |first=Brendan |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/shipwrecks-ahoy-in-area-13745285.html |title=Shipwrecks ahoy in area |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=2004-06-09 |accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With thousands of lakes, over {{convert|14000|km|mi|-2}} of fish bearing rivers and over {{convert|3700|km|mi|-1}} of coastline, Ireland is a popular [[angling]] destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While [[salmon]] and [[trout]] fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon driftnet fishery. [[Coarse fishing]] continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url=http://www.fishinginireland.info |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the range of sea angling species is around 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url=http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and drink===
{{main|Irish cuisine}}
[[File:Cheese 61 bg 080106.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gubbeen cheese]], an example of the resurgence in Irish cheese making]]
Food and cuisine in Ireland takes its influence from the [[crops]] grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;food_companion&quot; &gt;{{Cite book|first1=Alan|last1=Davidson|first2=Tom|last2=Jaine |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2006 |pages=407–408 |isbn=0-19-280681-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.&lt;ref name=&quot;food_companion&quot; /&gt;

For this reason, pork and white meat were more common than beef and thick fatty strips of salted bacon (or [[rashers]]) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;food_companion&quot; /&gt; The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]]) was common&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=The History and Social Influence of the Potato|first1=Redcliffe Nathan|last1=Salaman|first2=William Glynn|last2=Burton|first3=John Gregory|last3=Hawkes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1985|pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[black pudding]], made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the &quot;[[breakfast roll]]&quot;.

The introduction of the [[potato]] in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid-19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garrow |first=John |title =Feast and Famine: a History of Food and Nutrition in Ireland 1500–1920 |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95|issue=3 |pages=160–161 |date = March 2002|issn=1758-1095 |pmc=1279494|doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.3.160|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical family, consisting of a man, a woman and four children, would eat {{convert|18|st|kg}} of potatoes a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;food_companion&quot; /&gt; Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking, such as the [[Irish stew]], [[bacon and cabbage]], [[boxty]], a type of potato pancake, or [[colcannon]], a dish of [[mashed potatoes]] and [[kale]] or [[cabbage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;food_companion&quot; /&gt;

Since the last quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a &quot;New Irish Cuisine&quot; based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ireland for Dummies |first=Elizabeth |last=Albertson |publisher=Wiley Publishing |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2009 |isbn=0-470-10572-0|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ireland|first=Fionn|last=Davenport|publisher=Lonely Planet |place=London|year=2008 |isbn=1-74104-696-3|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[oyster]]s, [[mussel]]s and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made [[List of Irish cheeses|cheeses]] that are now being produced across the country. The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita&lt;ref name=&quot;food_companion&quot; /&gt; consumers of potatoes in Europe. An example of this new cuisine is &quot;Dublin Lawyer&quot;: lobster cooked in whiskey and cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dublin|first1=Fionn|last1=Davenport|last2=Hughes|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=London |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-710-2 |page=15|first2=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example [[coddle]] in Dublin or [[drisheen]] in Cork, both a type of sausage, or [[blaa]], a doughy white bread particular to [[Waterford]].

Ireland once dominated the world's market for [[whiskey]], producing 90% of the world's whiskey at the start of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the [[prohibition in the United States]] (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture|first=W. J. |last1=McCormack |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2001 |isbn=0-631-16525-8|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tariffs]] on Irish whiskey across [[British Empire]] during the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]] of the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|first1=Brian |last1=Leavy |first2=David |last2=Wilson |title=Strategy and Leadership|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1994|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Conor |last1=O'Clery|title=Whiskey Resists the Downturn|publisher=GlobalPost|date=February 25 |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/ireland/090225/whiskey-resists-the-downturn |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of [[Irish whiskey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Jack |last1=Blocker |first2=David |last2=Fahey |first3=Ian|last3=Tyrrell|title=Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|year=2003 |isbn=1-57607-833-7|page=653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish whiskey, however, remained popular domestically and in recent decades has grown in popularity again internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;not_luck&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Irish Whiskey's Growth Not Just About Luck| date=2009-03-19 |first=Christina|last=Berk |url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/29636538/Irish_Whiskey_s_Growth_Not_Just_About_Luck |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a [[Scotch whisky]], but not as sweet as [[American whiskey|American]] or [[Canadian whiskey|Canadian]] whiskies.&lt;ref name=&quot;not_luck&quot;/&gt; Whiskey forms the basis of traditional [[Irish Cream|cream liqueurs]], such as [[Baileys Irish Cream|Baileys]], and the &quot;[[Irish coffee]]&quot; (a [[cocktail]] of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at [[Foynes|Foynes flying-boat station]]) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.

[[Porter (beer)|Stout]], a kind of [[porter beer]], particularly [[Guinness]], is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with [[London]]. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to [[lager]]. [[Cider]], particularly ''[[Magners]]'' (marketed in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as ''Bulmers''), is also a popular drink. [[Red lemonade]], a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davenport |first=Fionn |title=Discover Ireland |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2010 |location=London |page=348 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hhP4ieoRiuIC&amp;pg=PA348 |isbn=1-74179-998-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
