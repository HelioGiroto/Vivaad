      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46529">{{Politics of Iran}}
The '''politics of Iran''' take place in a framework of [[theocracy]] guided by an Islamist ideology. The December 1979 [[Constitution of Iran|constitution]], and its 1989 amendment, define the political, economic, and social order of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], declaring that  [[Shi'a Islam]] of the [[Twelver]] school of thought is Iran's official religion.

Iran has an elected [[President of Iran|president]], parliament (or [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]), and an &quot;[[Assembly of Experts]]&quot; (which elects the [[Supreme Leader]] of Iran), and local councils. According to the constitution all candidates running for these positions must be vetted by the Guardian Council (with the exception of those running for &quot;[[Assembly of Experts]]&quot;) before being elected. 

In addition there are nontransparent unelected organizations (usually under Supreme Leader's control) trying to &quot;protect the state's Islamic character&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/1997/issue3/jv1n3a4.html IRAN: POLITICS, THE MILITARY AND GULF SECURITY] by Darius Bazargan, v.1, n.3, September 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the [[Political parties in Iran|Iranian political parties]] are banned.

==Political conditions==
As in almost all revolutions, the early days of the regime were characterized by political tumult. In November 1979 the American embassy was seized and its occupants [[Iran Hostage Crisis|taken hostage]] and kept captive for 444 days. The eight-year [[Iran–Iraq War]] killed hundreds of thousands and cost the country thousands of dollars.  By mid 1982, a succession of power struggles eliminated first the center of political spectrum and then the Republicans&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini'' (2001), p.21-234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arjomand, Said Amir, The Turban for the Crown : The Islamic Revolution in Iran, Oxford University Press, c1988,  p.144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhash, Shaul, Reign of the Ayatollahs : Iran and the Islamic Revolution by Shaul, Bakhash, Basic Books, c1984  p.158-9&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the Ayatollah Khomeini and his supporters in power.

Iran's post-revolution challenges have included the imposition of [[Sanctions against Iran|economic sanctions]] and suspension of diplomatic relations with Iran by the [[United States]] because of the hostage crisis and other acts of terrorism that the U.S. government and some others have accused Iran of sponsoring. Emigration has cost Iran &quot;two to four million entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople (and their capital).&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=23 ''Iran's Economic Morass: Mismanagement and Decline under the Islamic Republic''] ISBN 0-944029-67-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6240287.stm |title=Huge cost of Iranian brain drain By Frances Harrison |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-08 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other reasons Iran's economy has not prospered. Poverty rose in absolute terms by nearly 45% during the first 6 years of the Islamic revolution &lt;ref&gt;Based on the government's own Planning and Budget Organization statistics, from: Jahangir Amuzegar, `The Iranian Economy before and after the Revolution,` ''Middle East Journal'' 46, n.3 (summer 1992): 421)&lt;/ref&gt; and per capita income has yet to reach pre-revolutionary levels.&lt;ref&gt;Low reached in 1995, from: Mackey, ''Iranians'', 1996, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;According to World Bank figures, which take 1974 as 100, per capita GDP went from a high of 115 in 1976 to a low of 60 in 1988, the year war with Iraq ended ...&quot; (Keddie, ''Modern Iran'', 2003, p.274)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic Republic Party]] was Iran's ruling political party and for some years its only political party until its dissolution in 1987. Iran had no functioning political parties until the [[Executives of Construction Party]] formed in 1994 to run for the fifth parliamentary elections, mainly out of executive body of the government close to the then-president [[Rafsanjani|Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani]]. After the election of [[Mohammad Khatami]] in 1997, more parties started to work, mostly of the [[reformist]] movement and opposed by hard-liners. This led to incorporation and official activity of many other groups, including hard-liners.

The Iranian Government is opposed by a few armed political groups, including the [[Mujahideen al-Khalq|Mojahedin-e-Khalq]], the [[Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas|People's Fedayeen]], and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran|Kurdish Democratic Party]].

''For other political parties see [[List of political parties in Iran]].''

==Supreme Leader==
{{Main|Supreme Leader of Iran}}
The most powerful political office in the Islamic Republic is that of the Supreme Leader, of which there have been two: the founder of the Republic, Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], and his successor, [[Ali Khamenei]].

Historically the Supreme Leader has remained aloof from election politics. However, in the 2009 election, some of the pronouncements by [[Ali Khamenei]] were perceived by many to favor the incumbent candidate. 

The Leader appoints the heads of many powerful posts - the commanders of [[Military of Iran|the armed forces]], the director of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting|national radio and television network]], the heads of the [[Bonyad|major religious foundations]], the prayer leaders in city mosques, and the members of [[Supreme National Security Council|national security councils]] dealing with defence and foreign affairs. He also appoints the [[Judicial system of Iran#Islamic Republic|chief judge]], the chief prosecutor, special tribunals and, with the help of the chief judge, half of the 12 jurists of the [[Guardian Council]] – the powerful body that decides both what bills may become law and who may run for president or [[Majlis of Iran|parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Who's in Charge?&quot; by
Ervand Abrahamian ''London Review of Books'', 6 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Iranian constitution the Supreme Leader asserts the authority of the president. He can veto the laws made by the parliament and traditionally he permits for presidential candidates to proclaim their candidacy.

==Executive branch==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Suffrage]] --&gt;
{{Main|President of Iran}}
The Constitution defines the [[President of Iran|President]] as the highest state authority ''after'' the Supreme Leader. The President is elected by [[universal suffrage]], by those 18 years old and older,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for a term of four years. Presidential candidates must be approved by the [[Council of Guardians]] prior to running. After being elected, the president must be appointed by the Supreme Leader. The President is responsible for the implementation of the Constitution and for the exercise of executive powers, except for matters directly related to the Supreme Leader. The President appoints and supervises the [[List of Iranian officials|Council of Ministers]], coordinates government decisions, and selects government policies to be placed before the legislature. Currently, [[Vice President of Iran|10 Vice-Presidents]] serve under the President, as well as a cabinet of 21 ministers, who must all be approved by the legislature. Unlike many other states, the executive branch in Iran does not control the armed forces. Although the President appoints the Ministers of Intelligence and Defense, it is customary for the President to obtain explicit approval from the Supreme Leader for these two ministers before presenting them to the legislature for a vote of confidence.

==Legislative branch==

The current legislature of Iran is [[unicameral]]. Before the [[Iranian Revolution]], the legislature was [[bicameral]], with the senate ([[Iranian Senate|upper house]]) half elected, half appointed by the Shah. The senate was removed in the new constitution.

===Parliament===
{{Main|Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran|Parliament of Iran}}
The [[Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran|Parliament of Iran]] comprises 290 members elected for four-year terms. The Parliament drafts [[legislation]], ratifies international [[treaties]], and approves the national budget. All Parliament candidates and all legislation from the assembly must be approved by the [[Council of Guardians]].

===Guardian Council===
{{Main|Guardian Council}}
The [[Guardian Council]] is composed of 12 jurists, including six clerics appointed by the Supreme Leader, and six jurists elected by the [[Majlis of Iran|Majles]] from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the [[Judicial system of Iran|Judicial System]]. The Council interprets the constitution and may reject bills from parliament deemed incompatible with the ''constitution'' or ''[[Sharia]]'' (Islamic law). These are referred back to parliament for revision. In a controversial exercise of its authority, the Council has drawn upon a narrow interpretation of Iran's constitution to veto parliamentary candidates.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

As of the early 1990s, the Guardian Council vets (approves) candidates for national election in Iran.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

According to the CIA World Factbook, The Guardian Council is a part of the Executive branch of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html#Govt |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expediency Council===
{{Main|Expediency Discernment Council}}
The [[Expediency Discernment Council|Expediency Council]] has the authority to mediate disputes between the Majlis and the Council of Guardians, and serves as an advisory body to the Supreme Leader, making it one of the most powerful governing bodies in the country.

Its members include heads of the three government branches, the clerical members of the Guardian Council and various other members appointed by the supreme leader for three-year terms. Cabinet members and parliamentary leaders also serve as temporary members when issues under their jurisdictions are under review.
&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State Background Notes, Iran Chamber Society: &quot;The Structure of Power in Iran,&quot; BBC: &quot;Iran: Who Holds the Power?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial branch==
{{Main|Judicial system of Iran}}
The Supreme Leader appoints the head of the Judiciary, who in turn appoints the head of the supreme court and the chief public prosecutor. There are several types of courts including public courts that deal with civil and criminal cases, and &quot;revolutionary courts&quot; which deal with certain categories of offenses, including crimes against [[national security]]. The decisions of the revolutionary courts are final and cannot be appealed. The Special Clerical Court handles crimes allegedly committed by [[cleric]]s, although it has also taken on cases involving [[lay people]]. The Special Clerical Court functions independently of the regular judicial framework and is accountable only to the Supreme Leader. The Court’s rulings are final and cannot be appealed. It has also been known to organizations such as the United Nations and the World Criminal Court that a very complex system of bribery has developed because of the high crime rate.{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}}

==Assembly of Experts==
{{Main|Assembly of Experts}}
The [[Assembly of Experts]], which meets for at least two days, twice annually,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khobregan.ir/persian/ashnaee/07.htm Khobregan - Ashnaee]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises 86 &quot;virtuous and learned&quot; clerics elected by adult suffrage for eight-year terms. Based on the laws approved by the first Assembly, the [[Council of Guardians]] has to determine candidates' eligibility using a written examination. The Assembly elects the Supreme Leader and has the constitutional authority to remove the Supreme Leader from power at any time. As all of their meetings and notes are strictly confidential, the Assembly has never been known to challenge any of the Supreme Leader's decisions.

==Political parties and elections==
{{elect|political parties in Iran|Elections in Iran}}
{{Main|Results of the Iranian presidential election, 2009}}
{{Iranian presidential election, 2009}}
:''More info: [[Iranian presidential election, 2009]]''
For the parliamentary elections of February 20, 2004, the Ministry of Interior Affairs announced a 50% turnout, the lowest in any general election since 1979. It was disputed by the Guardian Council, which claimed the result was closer to 60%. Conservative forces received 54% (156 seats), reformists received 14% of the vote (40 seats), and independents (34 seats); 60 seats were up for runoff election in May 2004. In the run-up to the election many reformist candidates, including about 80 members of the outgoing parliament, were disqualified by the Guardian Council; more than a 100 MPs protested by staging a sit-in in the parliament that lasted for about 3 weeks and ended to no avail. About 120 MPs then resigned and major reformist parties and groups stated they will not take part in the election but did not boycott it. The crisis resulted in a crack in the reformist front, when the [[Militant Clerics League]], of which [[Mohammad Khatami|President Khatami]] is a member, announced they will participate in the election.

===Political pressure groups and leaders===
Active student groups include the pro-reform &quot;[[Office for Strengthening Unity]]&quot; and &quot;the Union of Islamic Student Societies';
*Groups that generally support the Islamic Republic include Ansar-e Hizballah, The Iranian Islamic Students Association, Muslim Students Following the Line of the Imam, Islam's Students, and the Islamic Coalition Association. The conservative power base is said to be made up of a &quot;web of Basiji militia members, families of war martyrs, some members of the Revolutionary Guard, some government employees, some members of the urban and rural poor, and conservative-linked foundations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran,'' Norton, (2005), p.353&lt;/ref&gt;
*opposition groups include the Freedom Movement of Iran and the Nation of Iran party;
*armed political groups that have been almost completely repressed by the government include Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK), People's Fedayeen, Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan; the Society for the Defense of Freedom.

Iranian opposition groups have been severely repressed by the regime, an example being the Freedom party of Iran that is now &quot;forbidden&quot;. Repression of opposition groups is becoming more harsh as of mid 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esfandiari |first=Golnaz |url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/07/a1ce3b05-64d7-4ddc-8d56-3181d0033564.html |title=Iran has recently intensified its harassment of critics and people it deems threatening to the government, July 17, 2007 |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2007-07-17 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result the political pressure inside Iran many opposition figures have left Iran and now live abroad.

==Military==
{{Main|Military of Iran}}
The [[Military of Iran|military]] and the Corps of the Guardians (often mistranslated as ''guards'') of the Islamic Revolution (or ''Sepaah'' in Persian meaning ''the Corps'') are charged with defending Iran's borders and ''Baseej'' (Persian for ''Mobilization'') militia are charged with maintaining both external and internal security.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Provinces of Iran}}
Iran consists of 30 provinces (''ostaan-haa'', singular: ''ostan''): Ardabil, Azarbayjan-e Gharbi, Azarbayjan-e Sharqi, Bushehr, Chahar Mahall va Bakhtiari, Esfahan, Fars, Gilan, Golestan, Hamadan, Hormozgan, Ilam, Kerman, Kermanshahan, North Khorasan, Khorasan, South Khorasan, Khuzestan, Kohkiluyeh va Buyer Ahmadi, Kordestan, Lorestan, Markazi, Mazandaran, Qom, Qazvin, Semnan, Sistan va Baluchestan, Tehran, Yazd, Zanjan.
The [[Provinces of Iran|provinces]] are each headed by a governor general. The provinces are further divided into counties, districts, and villages.

==Local government==
{{Main|City and Village Councils of Iran}}
Local councils are elected by public vote to 4-year terms in all cities and villages of Iran. According to article 7 in Iran's Constitution, these local councils together with the Parliament are &quot;decision-making and administrative organs of the State&quot;. This section of the constitution was not implemented until 1999 when the first local council elections were held across the country. Councils have many different responsibilities including electing mayors, supervising the activities of municipalities; studying the social, cultural, educational, health, economic, and welfare requirements of their constituencies; planning and coordinating national participation in the implementation of social, economic, constructive, cultural, educational and other welfare affairs.

===Budget===
{{See also|Bonyad}}
[[File:Iran-Budget.JPG|thumb|right|Government [[budget deficit]] has been a chronic problem in Iran in the past. In 2004, about 45 percent of the government's budget came from exports of [[Energy in Iran|oil and natural gas revenues]] and 31 percent came from [[Labor and tax laws in Iran#Tax Laws|taxes and fees]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encarta&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Iran - MSN Encarta&gt;|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567300_6/Iran.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023610265363|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Iran has two types of budget:
#Public or &quot;General&quot; [[Government Budget]]
#&quot;Total&quot; Government Budget; which includes [[state-owned]] companies

A unique feature of [[Economy of Iran|Iran's economy]] is the large size of the [[Bonyad|religious foundations]] whose combined budgets make up more than 30% that of the [[Government of Iran#Public finance and fiscal policy|central government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist, Jan 18, 2003&quot;&gt;''Economist'', Jan 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iran/mjf.htm The Rise of the Pasdaran: RAND corporation] Retrieved June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

====Revenues====
{{See also|Taxation in Iran}}
[[File:Iranoilandgas.jpg|thumb|Iran's projected oil and gas projected revenues by the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Officials in Iran estimate that Iran's annual oil and gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015 once the current projects come on stream.&lt;ref name=&quot;oil&quot;&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/10/dec/1216.html Mehr News Agency: Iran eyes $250 billion annual revenue in 5 years] Retrieved December 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2004, about 45 percent of the government's budget came from exports of [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)#Revenues from crude oil|oil and natural gas revenues]], although this varies with the [[oil price|fluctuations in world petroleum markets]] and 31 percent came from [[Labor and tax laws in Iran#Tax Laws|taxes and fees]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encarta&quot;/&gt; Overall, an estimated 50 percent of Iran’s GDP was exempt from taxes in FY 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, oil income accounts for 80% of [[Central Bank of Iran#Foreign reserves|Iran's foreign currency revenues]] and 60% of the nation's overall budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=130736&amp;sectionid=351020102 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any surplus revenues from the sale of crude oil and gas are to be paid into the [[Central Bank of Iran#Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) and National Development Fund|Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF)]]. The approved ''&quot;total budget&quot;'', including state owned commercial companies, was $295 billion for the same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;turquoise&quot;/&gt;

The Government seeks to increase the share of [[Labor and tax laws in Iran#Tax Laws|tax revenue]] in the budget through the implementation of the so-called “[[Iranian Economic Reform Plan|economic reform plan]]” through more effective [[Public finance#Financing of government expenditures|tax collection]] from businesses.

====Expenditures====
{{See also|Iranian Economic Reform Plan}}
[[File:Socio-eco expenditures IRAN.jpg|thumb|right|National Budget Expenditures for Social and Economic Purposes, Fiscal Year 2004. Government spending as percent of total [[budget]] was 6% for [[Health care in Iran|health care]], 16% for [[Education in Iran|education]] and 8% for the [[Iranian Military Industry|military]] in the period 1992-2000 and contributed to an average annual [[inflation rate]] of 14 percent in the period 2000-2008.]]
[[File:Military expenditures-Iran.png|thumb|[[Military of Iran|Military expenditures]] (% GDP)]]

Because of changes in the classification of budgetary figures, comparison of categories among different years is not possible. However, since the Revolution the government’s general budget payments have averaged:&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;
* 59 percent for social affairs,
* 17 percent for economic affairs,
* 15 percent for national defense, and
* 13 percent for general affairs.

For a breakdown of expenditures for social and economic purposes, see attached chart.

In FY 2004, central government expenditures were divided as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt;

* current expenditures, 59 percent, and
* capital expenditures, 32 percent.
* Other items (earmarked expenditures, foreign-exchange losses, coverage of liabilities of letters of credit, and net lending) accounted for the remainder.

Among current expenditures, wages and salaries accounted for 36 percent; subsidies and transfers to households accounted for 22 percent (not including ''indirect'' subsidies). Earmarked expenditures totaled 13 percent of the central government total. Between FY 2000 and FY 2004, total expenditures and net lending accounted for about 26 percent of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;lcweb2.loc.gov&quot;/&gt; According to the Vice President for Parliamentary Affairs, [[Iranian Economic Reform Plan#Subsidy reform plan|Iran's subsidy reforms]] would save 20 percent of the country's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/152977.html |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the head of the [http://amar.sci.org.ir/index_e.aspx Department of Statistics of Iran], if the rules of budgeting were observed in this very structure, the government could save at least 30 to 35 percent on its expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/may/1316.html |title=Ten Million Iranians Under &quot;Absolute Poverty Line&quot; |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2010-03-20 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complexity of the system==
[[Image:Iran gov power structure.svg|thumb|right|300px| Iran's complex and unusual political system combines elements of a modern Islamic theocracy with democracy. A network of elected and unelected institutions influence each other in the government's power structure.]]

According to the constitution, the [[Guardian Council]] oversees and approves electoral candidates for most national elections in Iran. The Guardian Council has 12 members, six clerics, appointed by the [[Supreme Leader]] and six jurists, elected by the [[Majlis]] from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the [[Judicial system of Iran|Judicial System]], who is appointed by the Supreme Leader. According to the current law, the Guardian Council approves the [[Assembly of Experts]] candidates, which in turn supervise and elect the Supreme Leader.

The [[2nd of Khordad Movement|reformists]] say this system creates a closed circle of power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mojahedin-enghelab.org/ShowItem.aspx?ID=54&amp;p=1 Mojahedin-enghelab]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian reformists, such as [[Mohammad-Ali Abtahi]] have considered this to be the core legal obstacle for the [[2nd of Khordad Movement|reform movement in Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308224 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=2006-10-08 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308301 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146307117 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=2005-09-07 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/media.asp?id=10588595 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Media - Articles |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=1779650752 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=2004-01-11 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
