'''Canada''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|æ|n|ə|d|ə|audio=En-ca-Canada.ogg}}) is a [[North America]]n country consisting of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]]. Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic  to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean. Canada is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|second-largest country by total area]], and its [[Canada – United States border|common border]] with the [[United States]] is the world's longest [[land border]].

The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]]. Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonial expeditions]] explored, and later settled, the region's Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] to Britain in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[Canadian federalism|federal dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy, culminating in the [[Canada Act 1982]].

Canada is a [[federation|federal state]] governed as a [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as its head of state. The country is [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] at the federal level, with a population of approximately 33.4 million as of 2011. Canada's advanced economy is [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|one of the world's largest]] and relies largely upon its natural resources and international trade, particularly with the United States, with which it has had a [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]]. Per capita income is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|ninth highest]], and Canada [[List of countries by Human Development Index|ranks sixth]] globally in human development. It [[International rankings of Canada|performs favourably]] in international rankings of education, quality of life, government transparency, and economic freedom. Canada is a member of the [[G7]], [[G8]], [[G-20 major economies|G20]], [[NATO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], and the [[United Nations]].

==Etymology==
&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Name of Canada}}&lt;!--Please see the talk page before editing this to specify which languages produced the word Canada. There are differences of opinion, which may be best discussed at Name of Canada--&gt;
The name ''Canada'' comes from the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word ''kanata'', meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the Name, Canada|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/o5-eng.cfm|publisher=Canadian Heritage|year=2008|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] to the village of [[Stadacona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maura&quot;/&gt; Cartier later used the word ''Canada'' to refer not only to that particular village, but the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]] (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as ''Canada''.&lt;ref name=&quot;maura&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maura|first=Juan Francisco|year=2009|title=Nuevas aportaciones al estudio de la toponimia ibérica en la América Septentrional en el siglo XVI|journal=Bulletin of Spanish Studies|volume=86|issue=5|pages=577–603|doi=10.1080/14753820902969345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, &quot;[[Canada (New France)|Canada]]&quot; referred to the part of [[New France]] that lay along the [[St. Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]]. The area was later split into two British colonies, [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]]. They were reunified as the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|pages = 1–22}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, ''Canada'' was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and the word ''[[Dominion]]'' was conferred as the country's title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Toole|first=Roger|title=Holy nations and global identities: civil religion, nationalism, and globalisation|year=2009|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-17828-1|editor=Hvithamar, Annika; Warburg, Margit; Jacobsen, Brian Arly|page=137|chapter=Dominion of the Gods: Religious continuity and change in a Canadian context}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Canada asserted its political autonomy from the United Kingdom, the federal government increasingly used simply ''Canada'' on state documents and treaties, a change that was reflected in the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;buckner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Canada and the British Empire|editor= Buckner, Philip|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|pages=37–40, 56–59, 114, 124–125|isbn=978-0-19-927164-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Canada}}
Canada occupies a major northern portion of [[North America]], sharing land borders with the [[contiguous United States]] to the south and the US state of [[Alaska]] to the northwest. Canada stretches from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west; to the north lies the [[Arctic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Canada: Geography| work = Country Profiles | publisher = Commonwealth Secretariat | url =http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/138398/geography/ | accessdate=May 23, 2011}}

By total area (including its waters), Canada is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|second-largest country]] in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, Canada [[List of countries and outlying territories by land area|ranks fourth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The country lies between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[84th parallel north|84°N]], and longitudes [[52nd meridian west|52°]] and [[141st meridian west|141°W]].

The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] granted full autonomy and the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], ended all legislative ties to the UK, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be overridden by any government—though a [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] allows the federal parliament and provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakan|first=Joel|coauthors= Elliot, Robin M|title=Canadian Constitutional Law|publisher=Emond Montgomery Publications|year=2003|pages=3–8, 683–687, 699|isbn=978-1-55239-085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provinces and territories===
{{Main|Provinces and territories of Canada}}
{{See also|Canadian federalism}}

Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]]. In turn, these may be grouped into [[List of regions of Canada|four main regions]]: Western Canada, Central Canada, [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Northern Canada]] (&quot;Eastern Canada&quot; refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[Social programs in Canada|welfare]]. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-516-x/sectionh/4057752-eng.htm|title=Government Finance|last=Bird|first=Richard M|date=October 22, 2008|work=Historical Statistics of Canada|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The [[Automotive Products Trade Agreement]] of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.
