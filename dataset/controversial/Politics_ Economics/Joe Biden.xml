'''Joseph Robinette''' &quot;'''Joe'''&quot; '''Biden, Jr. ''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|s|ɨ|f|_|r|ɒ|b|ɨ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|_|ˈ|b|aɪ|d|ən}}; born November 20, 1942) is the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|47th]] and current [[Vice President of the United States]], jointly elected with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and was a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Delaware]] from January 3, 1973 until his resignation on January 15, 2009, following his [[United States presidential election, 2008|election to the Vice Presidency]].

Biden was born in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] and lived there for ten years before moving to Delaware.  He became an attorney in 1969, and was elected to a [[County council#United States|county council]] in 1970.  Biden was first [[United States Senate elections, 1972|elected to the Senate in 1972]] and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.  He was re-elected to the Senate six times, was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth most senior senator]] at the time of his resignation, and is the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|15th-longest serving Senator in history]].  Biden was a long-time member and former chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]].  His strong advocacy helped bring about U.S. military assistance and intervention during the [[Bosnian War]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.  He voted in favor of the [[Iraq War Resolution]] in 2002, but later proposed resolutions to alter U.S. strategy there.  He has also served as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to [[drug policy]], crime prevention, and [[civil liberties]], and led creation of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and [[Violence Against Women Act]]. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]].

Biden unsuccessfully [[Joe Biden presidential campaign, 1988|sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988]] and [[Joe Biden presidential campaign, 2008|2008]], both times dropping out early in the race.  [[Barack Obama]] selected Biden to be the Democratic Party nominee for Vice President in the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]]. Biden is the first Roman Catholic and the first [[Delaware]]an to become Vice President of the United States.  As Vice President, Biden has been heavily involved in Obama's decision-making process and held the oversight role for [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package]] aimed at counteracting the [[late-2000s recession]].  His ability to negotiate with Congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] played a key role in bringing about the bipartisan deals that resulted in the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] that resolved a taxation deadlock and the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] that resolved the [[United States debt ceiling crisis]].

Biden attended the [[University of Delaware]] in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], where he was more interested in sports and socializing than in studying,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-father&quot;/&gt; although his classmates were impressed by his [[cramming (education)|cramming]] abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-43&quot;&gt;''Current Biography Yearbook 1987'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  He played halfback with the [[Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football|Blue Hens]] freshman football team,&lt;ref name=&quot;tnj092808&quot;/&gt; but he dropped a junior year plan to play for the varsity team as a [[defensive back]], enabling him to spend more time with his out-of-state girlfriend.&lt;ref name=&quot;tnj092808&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biden, ''Promises to Keep'' (paperback), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  He [[double major]]ed in history and [[political science]] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1965,&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-timeline&quot;/&gt; ranking 506th of 688 in his class.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''See How They Run'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to receive his [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Syracuse University]]'s [[Syracuse University College of Law|College of Law]] in 1968,&lt;ref name=&quot;cong-bio&quot;/&gt; where by his own description he found it to be &quot;the biggest bore in the world&quot; and pulled many [[all-nighter]]s to get by.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-43&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt091887&quot; /&gt;  During his first year there, he was accused of having plagiarized 5 of 15 pages of a law review article. Biden said it was inadvertent due to his not knowing the proper rules of citation, and he was permitted to retake the course after receiving a [[Grade (education)|grade]] of F, which was subsequently dropped from his record.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt091887&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DB143FF93BA2575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden Admits Plagiarism in School But Says It Was Not 'Malevolent' | author=Dionne Jr., E.

His entry into the [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 1972|1972 U.S. Senate election in Delaware]] presented Biden with a unique circumstance. Longtime Delaware political figure and Republican incumbent Senator [[J. Caleb Boggs]] was considering retirement, which would likely have left [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV|Pete du Pont]] and Wilmington Mayor [[Harry G. Haskell, Jr.]] in a divisive [[primary election|primary]] fight. To avoid that, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Only in Delaware, Politics and Politicians in the First State |oclc=51588740

When Biden took office on January 3, 1973, at age 30 (the minimum age to become a [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]]), he became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm | title=Youngest Senator | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, freshman Senator Biden was named one of the ''200 Faces for the Future'' by ''Time'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879402-6,00.html |title=200 Faces for the Future|magazine=Time |date =July 15, 1974|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biden was subsequently elected to six additional terms, in the [[United States Senate elections, 1978|elections of 1978]], [[United States Senate elections, 1984|1984]], [[United States Senate elections, 1990|1990]], [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 1996|1996]], [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2002|2002]], and [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2008|2008]], usually getting about 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap08-366&quot;/&gt;  He did not face strong opposition; Governor [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV]] chose not to run against him in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-44&quot;&gt;''Current Biography Yearbook 1987'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biden spent 28 years as a junior senator due to the two-year seniority of his Republican colleague [[William V.

In this capacity, he dealt with issues related to [[drug policy]], crime prevention, and [[civil liberties]].

While chairman, Biden presided over the two most contentious [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] confirmation hearings in history, those for [[Robert Bork]] in 1987 and [[Clarence Thomas]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap08-bio&quot; /&gt;  In the [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|Bork hearings]], Biden stated his opposition to Bork soon after the nomination, reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical Bork nomination he had made the previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately.&lt;ref name=&quot;bronner&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Bronner | first=Ethan | title=Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America | publisher=[[W.

Biden was involved in crafting many federal crime laws.  In 1984, he was Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act]]; civil libertarians praised him for modifying some of the Act's provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment at that point in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-44&quot;/&gt;  He later spearheaded the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, also known as the Biden Crime Law, and the landmark [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 1994 (VAWA), which contains a broad array of measures to combat [[domestic violence]] and provides billions of dollars in federal funds to address [[gender]]-based crimes. In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v.

Biden was critical of the actions of [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]] during the 1990s [[Whitewater controversy]] and [[Lewinsky scandal]] investigations, and said &quot;it's going to be a cold day in hell&quot; before another Independent Counsel is granted the same powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Almanac of American Politics'' 2000, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biden voted to acquit on both charges during the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment of President Clinton]].

As chairman of the [[International Narcotics Control Caucus]], Biden wrote the laws that created the U.S. &quot;[[Drug Czar]]&quot;, who oversees and coordinates national drug control policy.

He continued to work to stop the spread of &quot;[[date rape]] drugs&quot; such as [[flunitrazepam]], and drugs such as [[MDMA|Ecstasy]] and [[Ketamine]]. In 2004, he worked to pass a bill outlawing [[steroid]]s like [[androstenedione]], the drug used by many baseball players.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap08-bio&quot; /&gt;

Biden's legislation to promote [[Student financial aid|college aid]] and [[student loan|loan]] programs allows families to deduct on their annual [[income tax]] returns up to $10,000 per year in higher education expenses. His &quot;Kids 2000&quot; legislation established a public/private partnership to provide computer centers, teachers, Internet access, and technical training to young people, particularly to low-income and at-risk youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=229820&amp;&amp;|title=Kids 2000 Program|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071223064751/http://biden.senate.gov/newsroom/details.cfm?id=229820&amp;&amp; |archivedate=December 23, 2007|accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first decade in the Senate, Biden focused on [[arms control]] issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-foreign&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-45&quot;/&gt;  In response to the refusal of the [[U.S. Congress]] to ratify the [[SALT II]] Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and President [[Jimmy Carter]], Biden took the initiative to meet the Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]], educated him about American concerns and interests, and secured several changes to address objections of the Foreign Relations Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salacuse | first=Jeswald W. | title=Leading Leaders: How to Manage Smart, Talented, Rich and Powerful People | publisher=[[American Management Association]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-8144-0855-9}} p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the [[Reagan administration]] wanted to interpret the 1972 [[SALT I]] Treaty loosely in order to allow the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] to proceed, Biden argued for strict adherence to the treaty's terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-foreign&quot;/&gt;  Biden clashed again with the Reagan administration in 1986 over [[economic sanctions against South Africa]], leading to a heated exchange between the senator and Secretary of State [[George P. Shultz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-45&quot;&gt;''Current Biography Yearbook 1987'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biden became interested in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] after hearing about [[Serbs|Serbian]] abuses during the [[Croatian War of Independence]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-foreign&quot;/&gt;  Once the [[Bosnian War]] broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the &quot;[[Lift and strike (Bosnia)|lift and strike]]&quot; policy of lifting the arms embargo, training [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]] and supporting them with [[NATO]] air strikes, and investigating [[war crimes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aap08-365&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-foreign&quot;/&gt;  Both the [[George H.

Political writer [[Howard Fineman]] has said that, &quot;Biden is not an academic, he’s not a theoretical thinker, he’s a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;watn020109&quot;/&gt;  Political columnist [[David S.

And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;watn020109&quot;/&gt;  Traub concludes that &quot;Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytm-traub&quot;/&gt;

=== Final year ===
After ending his second presidential bid in January 2008, Biden focused instead on running for a seventh Senate term against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Christine O'Donnell]]. In late August 2008, he was picked by Obama to be his running mate. Biden nevertheless continued to run for Senate re-election as well as Vice President,&lt;ref name=&quot;ap082408&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Aug24/0,4670,CVNBidenTwoCampaigns,00.html | title=Biden Wages 2 Campaigns At Once | agency=Associated Press | date=August 24, 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2008 | first=Randall | last=Chase | publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; as permitted by Delaware state law.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap08-366&quot;&gt;''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, 2008, Biden was re-elected as senator, in addition to winning the vice presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap110408&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-11-04-420465768_x.htm | title=Biden wins 7th Senate term but may not serve | author=Nuckols, Ben | agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today | date=November 4, 2008 | accessdate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Political positions of Joe Biden}}

A method that political scientists use for gauging ideology is to compare the annual ratings by the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) with the ratings by the [[American Conservative Union]] (ACU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mayer, William|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28761-2004Mar27?language=printer|title=Kerry's Record Rings a Bell|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=August 24, 2008|date=March 28, 2004}} &quot;The question of how to measure a senator's or representative's ideology is one that political scientists regularly need to answer. For more than 30 years, the standard method for gauging ideology has been to use the annual ratings of lawmakers' votes by various interest groups, notably the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) and the American Conservative Union (ACU).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Biden has a lifetime [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] 72 percent score from the ADA through 2004,&lt;!-- Really want through 2008, but ADA does not supply lifetime averages, and have not yet found reliable media source for it--&gt; while the ACU awarded Biden a lifetime [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] rating of 13 percent through 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2005-11-11-judiciarycommitteeprofiles_x.htm|title=Judging Judge Roberts: A look at the Judiciary Committee |newspaper=USA Today | date=September 12, 2005 | accessdate=August 24, 2008|author=Kiely, Kathy}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.acuratings.org/2008senate.htm|title=2008 U.S. Senate Votes|publisher=[[American Conservative Union]]|accessdate=March 20, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} Lifetime rating is given. {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Using another metric, Biden has a lifetime average liberal score of 77.5 percent, according to a ''[[National Journal]]'' analysis that places him ideologically among the center of Senate Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biden's Senate Vote Record|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/conventions/co_20080823_9669.php|date=August 23, 2008|accessdate=August 23, 2008|publisher=[[National Journal]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080827100649/http://www.nationaljournal.com/conventions/co_20080823_9669.php &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the [[political spectrum]], in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Biden's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 80&amp;nbsp;percent liberal and 13&amp;nbsp;percent conservative, the social rating was 78&amp;nbsp;percent liberal and 18&amp;nbsp;percent conservative, and the foreign rating was 71&amp;nbsp;percent liberal and 25&amp;nbsp;percent conservative.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap-08&quot;&gt;''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 363. In 2005, the ratings were E 73 26, S 83 10, F 76 15; in 2006, E 87 0, S 73 26, F 65 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has not changed much over time; his liberal ratings in the mid-1980s were also in the 70–80&amp;nbsp;percent range.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-44&quot;/&gt;

Various [[Interest group|advocacy groups]] have given Biden scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group.
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) gives him an 86 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.aclu.org/site/VoteCenter?congress=110&amp;repId=199&amp;session_num=0&amp;page=legScore|title=ACLU Congressional Scorecard|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Biden received a 91&amp;nbsp;percent voting record from the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) showing a pro-teacher union voting record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States to be a part of the United Nations climate negotiations and the [[Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007|Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act]], the most stringent climate bill in the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |magazine=[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]] | date=January 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 4, 2008 | url=http://www.grist.org/feature/2007/08/29/biden_factsheet/ | title=A look at the environmental record of Joe Biden, Barack Obama's ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biden cites high health care and energy costs as two major threats to the prosperity of American businesses, and believes that addressing these issues will improve American economic competitiveness. Biden was given a 100&amp;nbsp;percent approval rating from [[AFL-CIO]] indicating a heavily pro-union voting record. Biden is opposed to the [[Social Security debate (United States)|privatization of Social Security]] and was given an 89&amp;nbsp;percent approval rating from the [[Alliance for Retired Americans]] (ARA), an organization of retired union members.

== Presidential campaigns ==
Biden has twice run for the Democratic nomination for President, first in 1988, and again in 2008. He first considered running in 1984, after he gained notice for giving speeches to party audiences that simultaneously scolded and encouraged Democrats.&lt;ref name=&quot;fj-216&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Germond | first=Jack | authorlink=Jack Germond | coauthors=[[Jules Witcover|Witcover, Jules]] | title=Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?

By August 1987, Biden's campaign, whose messaging was confused due to staff rivalries,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''See How They Run'', pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; had begun to lag behind those of [[Michael Dukakis]] and [[Dick Gephardt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt083187&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6123AF932A0575BC0A961948260 | title= Biden, Once the Field's Hot Democrat, Is Being Overtaken by Cooler Rivals | author=Toner, Robin | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 31, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but Dukakis, and was seeing an upturn in Iowa polls.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor-83&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Cook | first=Rhodes | chapter=The Nominating Process | title=The Elections of 1988 | editor=Nelson, Michael (ed.) | publisher=[[Congressional Quarterly]] | year=1989 | isbn=0-87187-494-6}} p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1987, the campaign ran into trouble when he was accused of [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] a speech that had been made earlier that year by [[Neil Kinnock]], leader of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DD1531F931A2575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden's Debate Finale: An Echo From Abroad | author=Dowd, Maureen | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 12, 1987 | authorlink= Maureen Dowd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinnock’s speech included the lines: &lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; While Biden’s speech included the lines: &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?  [Then pointing to his wife in the audience] Why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college? Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? Is it because I'm the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that I was smarter than the rest?&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt; Though Biden had cited Kinnock as the source for the formulation many times before, he made no reference to the original source at the August 23 [[Iowa State Fair]] debate in question or in another appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Germond and Witcover, ''Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?'', pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mm-87&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200808230003 |publisher=[[Media Matters for America]]|title=Media outlets reported allegations Biden plagiarized Kinnock, but not that he had previously credited him |accessdate=August 28, 2008|date=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While political speeches often appropriate ideas and language from each other, Biden's use came under more scrutiny because he somewhat distorted his own family's background to match Kinnock's.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap08-bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mm-87&quot;/&gt; Biden was soon found to have earlier that year lifted passages from a 1967 speech by [[Robert F.

During his campaign, Biden focused on the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] and his support for the implementation of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy.  Despite speculation to the contrary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/candidate-secretary-state |title=A Candidate For Secretary Of State|newspaper=[[The New York Observer]]|date = June 12, 2007 |accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, &quot;I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates?

Biden made remarks during the campaign that attracted controversy.  On the day of his January 2007 announcement, he spoke of fellow Democratic candidate and Senator [[Barack Obama]]: &quot;I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, I mean, that's a storybook, man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/node/36658|title=Biden Unbound: Lays Into Clinton, Obama, Edwards |author=Horowitz, Jason|publisher=[[The New York Observer]]|date=February 4, 2007}}  Several [[linguistics|linguists]] and political analysts stated that the correct transcription includes a comma after the word &quot;African-American&quot;, which &quot;would significantly change the meaning (and the degree of offensiveness) of Biden's comment&quot;.

In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs070706&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/07/politics/main1785303.shtml|title=Biden's Comments Ruffle Feathers, Senator Forced To Explain His Remarks About Indian-Americans|date=July 7, 2006|accessdate=August 24, 2008|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatory.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs070706&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Indian-American activist who was on the receiving end of Biden's comment stated that he was &quot;100 percent behind (Biden) because he did nothing wrong.&quot; See {{cite news | first = John | last = Distaso | title = Indian-American activist defends Sen.

Overall, Biden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/conventions/co_20080825_3122.php | title=Conventions 2008: Sen.

In the initial contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa caucuses]], garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iowacaucusresults.com/ | title=Iowa Democratic Party Caucus Results | publisher=[[Iowa Democratic Party]] | accessdate=August 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biden withdrew from the race that evening, saying &quot;There is nothing sad about tonight....

Despite the lack of success, Biden's stature in the political world rose as the result of his campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamechange-336&quot;/&gt;  In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama.  Although the two had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close, with Biden having resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom&lt;ref name=&quot;nytm-traub&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wolffe-218&quot;&gt;Wolffe, ''Renegade'', p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and Obama having viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamechange-338&quot;&gt;Heilemann and Halperin, ''Game Change'', pp. 28, 337–338.&lt;/ref&gt;  Now, having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaigning style and appeal to working class voters, and Biden was convinced that Obama was &quot;the real deal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wolffe-218&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamechange-338&quot;/&gt;
