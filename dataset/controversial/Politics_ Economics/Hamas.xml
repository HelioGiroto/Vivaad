The result was a de facto geographic division of Palestinian-held territory, with Hamas holding sway in Gaza and Fatah maintaining the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority government in the West Bank town of Ramallah.&quot;

==Etymology==
''Hamas'' is an [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase حركة المقاومة الاسلامية, or '''Harakat al-Muqāwama al-Islāmiyya''' or &quot;Islamic Resistance Movement&quot;. The Arabic word Hamas also means devotion and zeal in the path of Allah.&lt;ref name=&quot;webman&quot;&gt;Anti-semitic motifs in the ideology of Hizballah and Hamas, Esther Webman, Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism, 1994. ISBN 978-965-222-592-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamas covenant interprets its name to mean &quot;strength and bravery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;charter1&quot;/&gt;

==Leadership and structure==
[[File:Hamasleadership.png|thumb|Map of Key Hamas Leadership Nodes. 2010]]
[[Image:Khaled Meshaal 01.jpg|thumb|Current leader, [[Khaled Meshaal]]]]
Hamas comprises three interrelated wings. The social welfare and political wings, which are responsible for the social, administrative, political, and propaganda activities of Hamas, and the military wing, which is engaged in covert activities, such as acting against suspected collaborators, gathering intelligence on potential targets, procuring weapons, and carrying out military attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;structure&quot;/&gt;

===Consultative councils===
The [[Majlis al-Shura]] (consultative council) is the group's overarching political and decision making body. It includes representatives from Gaza, the West Bank, Israeli prisons, and the exiled external leadership, the Political Bureau, based in Damascus. Under this Shura council are committees responsible for supervising Hamas activities, from media relations to military operations. In the West Bank and Gaza, local Shura committees answer to the Shura council and carry out its decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Political Hardball Within Hamas: Hardline Militants Calling Shots in Gaza, By Matthew Levitt. January 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas's highest decision-making body is its Political Bureau, which consists of 15 members and operates in exile in Damascus, Syria. The bureau is elected by members who select their representatives in local Consultative Councils in specific geographic regions. The councils then nominate representatives to the General Consultative Council, and the Political Bureau is elected by members of the General Consultative Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;politburo&quot;&gt;

===Military wing===
{{main|Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades}}

The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing formed in 1992, is named in commemoration of influential [[Palestinian nationalist]] Sheikh [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]]. Armed Hamas cells sometimes refer to themselves as &quot;Students of Ayyash&quot;, &quot;Students of the Engineer&quot;, or &quot;Yahya Ayyash Units&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Kushner, Harvey W. (2002). Encyclopedia of Terrorism, p.160 Sage Publications, ISBN 0-7619-2408-6&lt;/ref&gt; to commemorate [[Yahya Ayyash]], an early Hamas bomb-maker killed in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Hamas-who&quot;/&gt; Since its establishment, the military capability of Hamas has increased markedly, from rifles to Qassam rockets and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot;&gt;[Hamas's Tactics: Lessons from Recent Attacks], By Jamie Chosak and Julie Sawyer. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. October 19, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive [[Military training|military style training]], including training in [[Iran]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/nationalsecurity.nsf/Page/What_Governments_are_doing_Listing_of_Terrorism_Organisations_Hamas&amp;apos |title=Hamas's Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades |publisher=Ag.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000 operatives &quot;of varying degrees of skill and professionalism&quot; who are members of Hamas or their supporters and the internal security forces. These operatives can be expected to reinforce the Brigades in an &quot;emergency situation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terror+Groups/The%20HAMAS%20Terror%20Organization%20-%202007%20update The HAMAS Terror Organization - 2007 update] Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades]] are an integral part of Hamas, they also operate independently of Hamas, and at times contrary to Hamas' stated aims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/agd/WWW/nationalsecurity.nsf/Page/What_Governments_are_doing_Listing_of_Terrorism_Organisations_Hamas&amp;apos al-Qassam Brigades: Details of the organisation] Australian Government National Security September 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most analysts agree that although differences of opinion between the Hamas military and political wing exist, Hamas's internal discipline is strong enough to contain them.&lt;ref name=&quot;sundaytimes1&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article685619.ece Who controls Hamas - Haniya or Mashaal?], The Sunday Times, BY Stephen Farrell in Gaza and Nicholas Blanford, July 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientists Ilana Kass and Bard O'Neill liken Hamas's relationship with the Brigades to the Northern Ireland political party [[Sinn Féin]]'s relationship to the military arm of the [[Irish Republican Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ApANDp1XzmgC&amp;dq=hamas+qassam+brigades+independent&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The deadly embrace: the impact of Israeli and Palestinian rejectionism on the peace process] University Press of America, Ilana Kass &amp; Bard E. O'Neill, 1997, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; To further explain the relationship, they quote a senior Hamas official: &quot;The Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigade is a separate armed military wing, which has its own leaders who do not take their orders from [Hamas] and do not tell us of their plans in advance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; However, according to former U.S. Department of Treasury official and terrorism expert [[Matthew Levitt]], the Hamas Political Bureau operates as the highest ranking leadership body determining the policy of the Hamas organization and has responsibility for directing and coordinating [[terrorism|terrorist acts]]. Hamas' founder, [[Sheikh Ahmad Yassin]], stated in 1998: &quot;We can not separate the wing from the body. If we do so, the body will not be able to fly. Hamas is one body.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;David H. Gray&quot;&gt;http://www.eurojournals.com/rjis_8_12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew Levitt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Levitt |url=http://www.meforum.org/582/hamas-from-cradle-to-grave |title=Hamas from Cradle to Grave |publisher=Meforum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social welfare===
Hamas is particularly popular among Palestinians in the [[Gaza Strip]], though it also has a following in the [[West Bank]], and to a lesser extent in other Middle Eastern countries. Its popularity stems in part from its [[social welfare|welfare]] wing providing social services to Palestinians in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]]. Such services are not generally provided by the Palestinian Authority. Israeli scholar [[Reuven Paz]] estimates that 90% of Hamas activities revolve around &quot;social, welfare, cultural, and educational activities.&quot; Social services include running relief programs and funding schools, orphanages, mosques, healthcare clinics, soup kitchens, and sports leagues.&lt;ref name=&quot;welfare&quot;&gt;

In particular, Hamas funded health services where people could receive free or inexpensive [[medical treatment]]. Hamas greatly contributed to the health sector, and facilitated hospital and physician services in the Palestinian territory. On the other hand, Hamas's use of hospitals is sometimes criticised as purportedly serving the promotion of violence against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Emerson|Emerson, Steven]].

November 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Charities affiliated with Hamas are known to financially support families of those who have been killed or imprisoned while carrying out militant actions or supporting such actions. Families typically receive a one time grant of $500 to $5,000 and for those whose homes had been destroyed by the IDF, have their rent paid for temporary housing. Families of militants not affiliated with Hamas sometimes receive less.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite book| title=Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad| last=Levitt| first=Matthew| year=2007| page=122 - 123| publisher=Yale University Press| isbn=0-300-12258-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas has funded education as well as the health service, and built Islamic charities, libraries, mosques and education centers for women. They also built nurseries, kindergartens and supervised religious schools that provide free meals to children. When children attend their schools and mosques, parents are required to sign oaths of allegiance.
Refugees, as well as those left without homes, are able to claim financial and technical assistance from Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hilsenrath {{Cite news|title=Health policy as counter-terrorism: Health services and the Palestinians |month=October|year=2005|url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/media/78u409g64p5jvh491v5m/contributions/x/2/6/5/x26530218g04pll8.pdf|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite [[building materials]] needing to be smuggled into the territory, luxury beach resorts and tourist facilities operated by the interior ministry have been constructed by Hamas government linked charities which include gardens, playgrounds, football fields, a zoo and restaurants aimed to provide employment and low cost entertainment for citizens.

Hamas's 1988 charter calls for the replacement of Israel and the Palestinian Territories with an Islamic Palestinian state. After the elections in 2006, Hamas co-founder [[Mahmoud Al-Zahar]] did not rule out the possibility of accepting a &quot;temporary two-state solution&quot;, and stated that he dreamed &quot;of hanging a huge map of the world on the wall at my Gaza home which does not show Israel on it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuanet.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamas leader urges int'l community to respect Palestinian people's choice|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=April 2, 2006|url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/02/content_4373348.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xinhua reports that Al-Zahar &quot;did not rule out the possibility of having [[Jews]], [[Muslims]] and [[Christians]] living under the sovereignty of an Islamic state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuanet.com&quot;/&gt; In late 2006, [[Ismail Haniyeh]], the political leader of Hamas, said that if a [[Palestinian state]] was formed within the 1967 lines, Hamas was willing to declare a truce that could last as long as 20 years, and stated that Hamas will never recognize the &quot;usurper Zionist government&quot; and will continue &quot;[[jihad]]-like movement until the liberation of Jerusalem&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/haniyeh-calls-for-formation-of-palestinian-state-on-1967-lines-1.207641 &quot;Haniyeh calls for formation of Palestinian state on 1967 lines.&quot;] ''Haaretz''.

In March 2006, Hamas released its official legislative program. The document clearly signaled that Hamas could refer the issue of recognizing Israel to a national referendum. Under the heading &quot;Recognition of Israel,&quot; it stated simply (AFP, 3/11/06): &quot;The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people.&quot; This was a major shift away from their 1988 charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2974 |title=Nixed Signals |author=Seth Ackerman |date=September/October 2006 |work=Extra! |publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] |accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, via [[University of Maryland|Maryland]]'s Jerome Segal, the group sent a letter to US President [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] stating they &quot;we don't mind having a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders&quot;, and asked for direct negotiations: &quot;Segal emphasized that a state within the 1967 borders and a truce for many years could be considered Hamas' ''de facto'' recognition of Israel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hatz 14Aug2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/in-2006-letter-to-bush-haniyeh-offered-compromise-with-israel-1.257213 |title=In 2006 letter to Bush, Haniyeh offered compromise with Israel |author=Barak Ravid |date=14 August 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2008 meeting between Hamas leader [[Khaled Meshal]] and former US President [[Jimmy Carter]], an understanding was reached in which Hamas agreed it would respect the creation of a [[Palestinian state]] in the territory seized by Israel in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], provided this were ratified by the Palestinian people in a [[referendum]].

In February 2012, according to the Palestinian authority, Hamas forswore the use of violence.

Among the charter's controversial statements is the following: &quot;The time will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews [and kill them]; until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: Oh Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;webman&quot;/&gt; The document also quotes Islamic religious texts to provide justification for fighting against and killing the Jews of Israel,&lt;ref name = &quot;PalestineCenter&quot;&gt;{{cite web

With its takeover of Gaza after the [[Six Day War|1967 war with Egypt]], Israel hunted down secular [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] factions but dropped the previous Egyptian rulers' harsh restrictions against Islamic activists.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins |first=Andrew |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB123275572295011847.html |title=How Israel Helped to Spawn Hamas |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-01-24 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Israel for many years tolerated and at times encouraged Islamic activists and groups as a counterweight to the secular nationalists of the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&amp;dq=%22Mujama+al-Islamiya%22+israel+charity&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad] Matthew Levitt &amp; Dennis Ross, Yale University Press, 2007, p. 24.  &quot;Scholars and historians on both sides . . . agree that from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s the [Muslim] Brotherhood benefited from the Israeli government's support of non-violent Islamist Palestinian factions, believing these groups would function as a useful counterweight to the secular nationalist Palestinian groups . . .&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the activists benefited was [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]], leader of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Gaza, who had also formed the Islamist group [[Mujama al-Islamiya]] in 1973, a charity recognized by Israel in 1979. Israel allowed the organization to build [[mosques]], clubs, schools, and a library in Gaza.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tabraz |first= S.S. |year= 2006 |title= 'Homecoming' of Hamas |url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/4417817 |journal= [[Economic and Political Weekly]] |volume= 41 |issue= 7 |pages= 566–568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yitzhak Segev, the acting governor of Gaza in 1979, said he had no illusions about Yassin's intentions, having watched an Islamist movement topple the [[Shah]] as Israel's military attache in [[Iran]]. According to Segev, Yassin and his charity were completely peaceful towards Israel during this time, and Segev and other Israeli officials feared being viewed as an enemy of Islam. Segev maintained regular contact with Yassin, met with him around a dozen times, and arranged for Yassin to be taken to Israel for hospital treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;

Also, Segev said, [[Fatah]] was &quot;our main enemy.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135098 |title=Suicide Voters |publisher=Slate.com |date=2006-01-30 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamists frequently attacked secular and leftist Palestinian movements, including Fatah, but the Israeli military avoided getting involved in those quarrels.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt; It stood aside, for example, when Mujama al-Islamiya activists stormed the [[Red Crescent]] charity's headquarters in Gaza, but Segev did send soldiers to prevent the burning down of the home of the head of the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;

In 1984 the Israeli army received intelligence that Sheikh Yassin's followers were collecting arms in Gaza. Israeli troops raided mosques and found a cache of weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt; Yassin was arrested, but told his interrogators the weapons were meant to be used against secular Palestinians, not Israel. The cleric was released a year later and allowed to continue to develop his movement in Gaza.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;

Around the time of Yassin's arrest, Avner Cohen, an Israeli religious affairs official, sent a report to senior military officers and civilian leadership in Gaza advising them of the dangers of the Islamic movement, but this report and similar ones were ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt; Former military intelligence officer Shalom Harari said the warnings were ignored out of neglect, not a desire to fortify the Islamists: &quot;Israel never financed Hamas. Israel never armed Hamas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shavit |first=Ari |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/06/060206ta_talk_shavit |title=Watching Hamas |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
{{See also|First Intifada}}
In 1987, several Palestinians were killed in a traffic accident involving an Israeli driver, and the events that followed – a Palestinian uprising (now known as the First Intifada) against Israel's West Bank and Gaza occupation – led Yassin and six other Palestinians to found Hamas as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood movement. The new group was supported by Brotherhood-affiliated charities and social institutions that had already gained a strong foothold in the occupied territories. The acronym &quot;Hamas&quot; first appeared in 1987 in a leaflet that accused the Israeli [[Mossad|intelligence service]]s of undermining the moral fiber of Palestinian youth as part of [[Mossad]]'s recruitment of what Hamas termed collaborators. Nonetheless, Israeli military and intelligence was still focused on Fatah, and continued to maintain contacts with Gaza's Islamic activists. Numerous Islamist leaders, including senior Hamas founder [[Mahmoud Zahar]], met with [[Yitzhak Rabin]] as part of &quot;regular consultations&quot; between Israeli officials and Palestinians not linked to the PLO.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;

Hamas carried out its first attack against Israel in 1989, abducting and killing two soldiers. The [[Israel Defense Forces]] immediately arrested Yassin and sentenced him to life in prison, and deported 400 Hamas activists, including Zahar, to [[South Lebanon]], which at the time was occupied by Israel. During this time Hamas built a relationship with [[Hezbollah]].

===The 1990s===
Hamas's military branch, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was created in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=7ZPQm5cQ4AwC&amp;dq=Mehola+Junction+bombing+islamic+jihad&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Martyrdom, Not Suicide: The Legality of Hamas' Bombings in the Mid-1990s in Modern Islamic Jurisprudence] By M.A. Philipp Holtmann, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the al-Qassam Brigades conducted numerous attacks on Israel, with both civilian and military victims.

In December 1992 Israel responded to the killing of a border police officer by deporting 415 leading figures of Hamas and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] to Lebanon, which provoked international condemnation and a unanimous UN Security Council resolution condemning the action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/middle-east/2010/08/israel-palestinian-jerusalem For Arabs in Israel, a house is not a home] by Edward Platt, [[New Statesman]], August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rWEg6Tfai_oC&amp;dq=arafat+israel+hamas&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Inside Hamas: the untold story of militants, martyrs and spies] By Zaki Chehab, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the suicide attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades and other groups violated the 1993 [[Oslo accords]] (which Hamas opposed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,CHRON,ISR,,469f38a8c,0.html Chronology for Palestinians in Israel] [[The UN Refugee Agency]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Palestinian Authority]] President [[Yasir Arafat]] was reluctant to pursue the attackers and may have had inadequate means to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Palestinian people: a history&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=6NRYEr8FR1IC&amp;dq=%22black+hand%22+al-qassam+british+palestine&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Palestinian people: a history] By Baruch Kimmerling &amp; Joel S. Migdal, pp. 372-373&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts state that the Palestinian Authority could have stopped the suicide and other attacks on civilians but refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Efraim Karsh|Karsh, Efraim]]. ''Arafat's War: The Man and His Battle for Israeli Conquest''. New York: Grove Press, 2003. p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Congressional Research Service]], Hamas admitted to having executed Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities in the 1990s. A transcript of a training film by the al-Qassam Brigades tells how Hamas operatives kidnapped Palestinians accused of collaboration and then forced confessions before executing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs1993&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, [[Yahya Ayash]], the chief bombmaker of Hamas and the leader of the West Bank battalion of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was assassinated by the [[Shin Bet|Israeli secret service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Palestinian people: a history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Samuel.

In September 1997, Israeli agents in Jordan attempted but failed to assassinate Hamas leader [[Khaled Mashal]], leading to chilled relations between the two countries and release of Sheikh Yassin, Hamas's spiritual leader, from Israeli prison. Two years later Hamas was banned in [[Jordan]], reportedly in part at the request of the United States, Israel, and the [[Palestinian Authority]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan curbs Hamas&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/nov/22/israel &quot;Jordan curbs Hamas&quot;], ''The Guardian'', November 22, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan's King Abdullah feared the activities of Hamas and its Jordanian allies would jeopardize peace negotiations with Israel, and accused Hamas of engaging in illegitimate activities within Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamas Leader Khaled Mashaal&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1869481,00.html Hamas Leader Khaled Mashaal] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', January 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;unhcr.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3df4be501d.html Jordan: Whether Hamas persecute, kidnap, torture or abuse with impunity Jordanian citizens who disagree with its methods, policies and ideology] Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 25 October 2000, JOR35666.E, accessed 28 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-September 1999, authorities arrested Hamas leaders Khaled Mashal and Ibrahim Ghosheh on their return from a visit to Iran, and charged them with being members of an illegal organization, storing weapons, conducting military exercises, and using Jordan as a training base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamas Leader Khaled Mashaal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;unhcr.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Levitt&quot;&gt;Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad, by Matthew Levitt, Dennis Ross.

===Second Intifada===
[[Image:SbarroAfter1.jpg||left|thumb|220px|August 2001 [[Sbarro pizza restaurant bombing]] in Jerusalem, in which 15 Israeli civilians were killed. Hamas said the attack was in response to Israel's assassination of its officials, including two senior leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/aug/10/israel2 Who carried out suicide bombing?] The Guardian, August 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Al-Qassam Brigades militants were among the armed groups that launched both military-style attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli civilian and military targets during the [[Second Intifada]] (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada ({{lang-ar|انتفاضة الأقصى}}, ''Intifā{{transl|ar|DIN|ḍ}}at El Aq{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣ}}a''; {{lang-he|אינתיפאדת אל-אקצה}}, ''Intifādat El-Aqtzah''), which began in late September 2000. This [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories was much more violent than the [[First Intifada]]. The military and civilian death toll is estimated at 5500 Palestinians and more than 1100 Israelis, as well as 64 foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp ''B'Tselem – Statistics – Fatalities''], [[B'Tselem]].&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings during the [[second intifada]] (September 2000 through August 2005) found that about 40 percent were carried out by the al-Qassam Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/benmelech/files/JEP_0807.pdf Human Capital and the Productivity of Suicide Bombers pdf] [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] Volume 21, Number 3, Summer 2007. Pages 223–238&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate trigger for the uprising is disputed, but a more general cause, writes U.S. political science professor Jeremy Pressman, was &quot;popular Palestinian discontent [that] grew during the Oslo peace process because the reality on the ground did not match the expectations created by the peace agreements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/Fall03/pressman.pdf The Second Intifada: Background and Causes of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict]
 Jeremy Pressman, Fall 2003 (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas would be the beneficiary of this growing discontent in the 2006 Palestinian Authority legislative elections.

In January 2004, Hamas leader Sheikh [[Ahmed Yassin]] said that the group would end armed resistance against Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state in the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], and [[east Jerusalem]], and that restoring Palestinians' &quot;historical rights&quot; (relating to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]]) &quot;would be left for future generations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Running out of time&quot;&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/675/re1.htm Running out of time] ''Al-Ahram Weekly'' January 29 – February 4, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, 2004, senior Hamas official [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] offered a 10-year truce, or ''[[hudna]]'', in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the complete withdrawal by Israel from the [[Green Line (Israel)|territories captured]] in the 1967 [[Six Day War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Running out of time&quot;/&gt; Al-Rantissi stated that Hamas had come to the conclusion that it was &quot;difficult to liberate all our land at this stage, so we accept a phased liberation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Running out of time&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-rejects-insincere-hamas-offer-of-10year-truce-574542.html Israel rejects 'insincere' Hamas offer of 10-year truce] ''The Independent'' January 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Israel immediately dismissed al-Rantissi's statements as insincere and a smokescreen for military preparations.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Yassin was assassinated on March 22, 2004, by a [[targeted Israeli air strike]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3636207.stm Fury as Gaza buries Hamas leader] ''BBCNews'' April 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and al-Rantisi was assassinated by a similar air strike on April 18, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3556099.stm Hamas chief killed in air strike] ''BBCNews'' March 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 presidential and legislative elections===
While Hamas boycotted the [[Palestinian presidential election, 2005|2005 Palestinian presidential election]], it did participate in the [[Palestinian municipal election, 2005|2005 municipal elections]] organized by Yasser Arafat in the occupied territories. In those elections it won control of over one third of Palestinian municipal councils, besting [[Fatah]], which had for long been the biggest force in Palestinian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas success in Fatah heartland| publisher=BBC News|date=May 13, 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4541383.stm | accessdate=January 5, 2010 | first=Matthew | last=Price}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its election manifesto for the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 Palestinian legislative election]], Hamas omitted a call for an end to Israel, though it did still call for armed struggle against the occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;guard1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Guardian|date=January 12, 2006|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1684472,00.html|title=Hamas drops call for destruction of Israel from manifesto|location=London|first=Chris|last=McGreal|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ynetnews-40yearslater&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hamas: Ceasefire for return to 1967 border|publisher=Y Net News |date=January 30, 2006|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3207845,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas won the 2006 elections, winning 76 of the 132 seats to Fatah's 43.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/international/middleeast/27mideast.html Hamas Routs Ruling Faction, Casting Pall on Peace Process], [[The New York Times]], January 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by many as primarily a rejection of the Fatah government's corruption and ineffectiveness, the Hamas victory seemingly had brought to an end 40 years of PLO domination of Palestinian politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Ess.

After the election, the [[Quartet on the Middle East]] (the United States, Russia, the European Union (EU), and the United Nations) stated that assistance to the Palestinian Authority would only continue if Hamas renounced violence, recognized Israel, and accepted previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements, which Hamas refused to do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pike&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hamas.htm |title=Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quartet then imposed a freeze on all international aid to the Palestinian territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6469217.stm Palestinian sanctions to remain] BBC, March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 after the Gaza election, Hamas leader sent a letter addressed to George W. Bush where he among other things declared that Hamas would accept a state on the 1967 borders including a truce. However, the Bush administration did not reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ravid |first=Barak |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/in-2006-letter-to-bush-haniyeh-offered-compromise-with-israel-1.257213 |title=In 2006 letter to Bush, Haniyeh offered compromise with Israel|publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2006-06-06 |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electoral Platform for Change and Reform'''

The Change and Reform List adopts a set of principles stemming from the Islamic tradition that we embrace. We see these principles as agreed upon not only by our Palestinian people, but also by our Arab and Islamic nation as a whole. These principles are:

1. True Islam with its civilized achievements and political, economic, social, and legal aspects is our frame of reference and our way of life.
2. Historic Palestine is part of the Arab and Islamic land and its ownership by the Palestinian people is a right that does not diminish over time. No military or legal measures will change that right.
3. The Palestinian people, wherever they reside, constitute a single and united people and form an integral part of the Arab and Muslim nation . . . [Quranic verse]. Our Palestinian people are still living a phase of national liberation, and thus they have the right to strive to recover their own rights and end the occupation using all means, including armed struggle. We have to make all our resources available to support our people and defeat the occupation and establish a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
4. The right of return of all Palestinian refugees and displaced persons to their land and properties, and the right to self-determination and all other national rights, are inalienable and cannot be bargained away for any [[concession (politics)|political concessions]].
5. We uphold the indigenous and inalienable rights of our people to our land, Jerusalem, our holy places, our water resources, borders, and a fully sovereign independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
6. Reinforcing and protecting Palestinian national unity is one of the priorities of the Palestinian national action.
7. The issue of the prisoners is at the top of the Palestinian agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;palestine-studies2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.palestine-studies.org/journals.aspx?id=7087&amp;jid=1&amp;href=fulltext A &quot;New Hamas&quot; through Its New Documents] Journal of Palestine Studies 2006.Retrieved 30th May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislative policy and reforming the judiciary.

&quot;stress the separation between the three powers, the legislative, executive and judicial; activate the role of the Constitutional Court; re-form the Judicial Supreme Council and choose its members by elections and on the basis of qualifications rather than partisan, personal, and social considerations . . . ; enact the necessary laws that guarantee the neutrality of general prosecutor . . . [and] laws that will stop any transgression by the executive power on the constitution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;palestine-studies2006&quot;/&gt;

Public freedoms and citizen rights.

&quot;Achieve equality before the law among citizens in rights and duties; bring security to all citizens and protect their properties and assure their safety against arbitrary arrest, torture, or revenge; stress the culture of dialogue . . . ; support the press and media institutions and maintain the right of journalists to access and to publish information; maintain freedom and independence of professional syndicates and preserve the rights of their membership&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;palestine-studies2006&quot;/&gt;

===Hamas–Fatah conflict===
{{Main|Fatah–Hamas conflict|Battle of Gaza (2007)}}
After the formation of the Hamas-led cabinet on March 20, 2006, tensions between Fatah and Hamas militants progressively rose in the Gaza strip as Fatah commanders refused to take orders from the government while the Palestinian Authority initiated a campaign of demonstrations, assassinations and abductions against Hamas which led to Hamas responding.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Proof Is in the Paper Trail&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/04/gaza_documents200804 |title=The Proof Is in the Paper Trail |publisher=Vanityfair.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli intelligence warned Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas had planned to kill him at his office in Gaza. According to a Palestinian source close to Abbas, Hamas considers president Abbas to be a barrier to its complete control over the Palestinian Authority and decided to kill him.

In another case, a Palestinian had criticized Hamas in a conversation on the street with some friends.

Hamas security forces attacked hundreds Fatah officials who supported Israel. Human Rights Watch interviewed one such person:
{{quote|&quot;There were eight of us sitting there. We were all from Fatah. Then three masked militants broke in. They were dressed in brown camouflage military uniforms; they all had guns. They pointed their guns at us and cursed us, then they began beating us with iron rods, including a 10-year-old boy whom they hit in the face.

{{as of|2009}} the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] estimates Hamas's annual budget at $70 million.&lt;ref name='CFR'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfrterrorism.org/groups/hamas.html|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=March 16, 2006|title=Hamas: Background Q&amp;A}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 2000s the largest backer of Hamas was [[Saudi Arabia]], with over 50% of its funds coming from that country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4DB143AF934A2575AC0A9659C8B63 Flow of Saudis' Cash to Hamas Is Scrutinized] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; mainly through Islamic charity organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp504.htm |title=Saudi Arabia's denials of involvement in international terrorism |publisher=Jcpa.org |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier estimate by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] estimated a $50 million annual budget, mostly supplied by private charitable associations but with $12 million supplied directly by Gulf states, primarily Saudi Arabia, and a further $3 million from [[Iran]]. In 2002, a Saudi Arabian charity, the ''Saudi Council to Support the Palestinian Intefada'' run by then Saudi Interior Minister Prince [[Nayef bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud|Nayef Bin Abdul Aziz]] stated the council will give the families of 102 Hamas militants killed, including eight suicide bombers, $5,340 each.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funding Evil - Ehrenfeld, Rachel&quot;&gt;http://eufunding.org.uk/terror/FundingEvil.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPR Strategic Business Information Database.

Saudi owned [[Al Taqwa Bank|al-Taqwa Bank]] has been identified of holding money for Hamas as early as 1997. Jamie C. Zarate, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], told [[United States Congress|Congress]] that 60 million was moved to Hamas accounts with Al Taqwa bank. The Al Taqwa bank has also been used to launder funds for [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A.

In 2004, reports citing unidentified U.S. and Israeli intelligence officials indicated that Saudi funding for Hamas had been curtailed and replaced by other regional sponsors.  In June 2004 testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, former Treasury Department General Counsel David Aufhauser quoted &quot;informed intelligence sources&quot; as saying that &quot;for whatever reason, the money going to Hamas from Saudi Arabia has substantially dried up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS1&quot;&gt;{{CRS|article = Saudi Arabia: Terrorist Financing Issues |url = http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL32499.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aufhauser indicated that Saudi financial support &quot;has been supplemented by money from Iran and Syria flowing through even more dangerous rejectionist groups in the West Bank.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS1&quot;/&gt; Similarly, Israeli daily Maariv quoted in 2004 an unidentified Israeli military official as saying that &quot;for the first time in years the Saudis have begun to reduce the flow of funds to Hamas and to the Gaza Strip.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS1&quot;/&gt; This source attributes this change largely to U.S. pressure on Saudi Arabia to stem the flow of funding to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS1&quot;/&gt; According to the [[US Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), another reported funding source for Hamas is through the 21,000 Arabs of Palestinian and Lebanese descent who live in the [[Foz do Iguaçu]] area of the tri-border region of [[Latin America]]. According to Paraguayan Interior Minister Julio César Fanego, they have donated &quot;something between $50 and $500 million&quot; to 16 Arab extremist groups between 1999 and 2001, in amounts ranging from $500 to $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/NarcsFundedTerrs_Extrems.pdf A Global Overview Of Narcotics-Funded Terrorist And Other Extremist Groups], May 2002, Library of Congress – Federal Research Division&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Victor Comras to the US House Subcommittee on Financial Oversight and Investigations, hearings on Current and Evolving Trends in Terrorism Financing.

In the late 1980s, 10% of all Hamas funding came [[History of the islamic republic of iran#Foreign affairs|Islamic Republic of Iran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS2&quot;&gt;{{CRS|article =Fatah and Hamas: the New Palestinian Factional Reality  |url = http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22395.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, from 1993 to 2006, Iran provided Hamas with approximately $30 US million annually. More recent assessments indicate that Iranian funding has increased significantly between 2006–2009, to hundreds of millions of Euros per year. After 2009, sanctions on Iran made funding difficult, forcing Hamas instead to rely on religious donations by individuals in the West Bank, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=5167 The Iran-Hamas Alliance], In Focus Quarterly, by Meyrav Wurmser, Fall 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligenceonline.com/government-intelligence/2010/04/22/hamas-receives-blow-to-wallet,83363183-ART Hamas receives blow to wallet], Intelligence Online, April 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Since June 2011 funding from the Islamic Republic of Iran has been cut to show &quot;displeasure at Hamas's failure to hold public rallies in support of President [[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]]&quot; in the face of the [[2011 Syrian uprising|Syrian uprising]], and funding from the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt]] has been cut so the MB can diverts funds &quot;to support [[Arab Spring]] revolts&quot;.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; The shortages have meant that Gaza's 40,000 civil service and security employees were not paid July 2011.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;

===Gaza domestic funding===
Hamas approved a 540 million dollar government budget for 2010 with up to 90% coming from &quot;undisclosed&quot; foreign aid which includes funding from [[Iran]] and [[Egypt]]'s [[Muslim Brotherhood]] according to western intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; Due to the Gaza blockade, Hamas still faces a financial crisis. With a bureaucracy of around 30,000 staff, the organisation is growing faster than can be handled with salaries being delayed or prioritised for the lowest paid. To fund it's budget, Hamas has raised new taxes on businesses and imposed a 14.5% tax on luxury goods [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels|smuggled through the tunnels]]. Gaza businessmen have accused Hamas of profiting from the blockade and using these taxes to buy large tracts of land and private buildings for public facilities in competition to established businesses.&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/world/iran-punishes-hamas-for-not-backing-assad-20110822-1j6lb.html#ixzz1Vy95go2v Iran punishes Hamas for not backing Assad]| August 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/08/hamas-taxes-gaza Hamas imposes new Gaza taxes to pay for burgeoning bureaucracy], The Guardian, by Rory McCarthy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/0817/p09s01-wome.html |title=Hamas profits from Israel's Gaza blockade |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the U.S State Department threatened to cut a 100 million dollars in aid it sends to the Gaza Strip if Hamas continues to insist upon auditing American foreign aid organizations after Hamas suspended operations of the [[International Medical Corps]] following the group's refusal to submit to an onsite audit.  Most foreign charities submit their own audits to the Interior Ministry in [[Ramallah]]. Charities must be audited by law, possibly to ensure money is not diverted for political or intelligence-gathering purposes but as the U.S. government forbids direct contact with Hamas the action prompted Washington to issue the threat via a third party.  Aid provided by American and other foreign groups goes to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, where most of the 1.6 million residents are refugees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= U.S. Threatens to Halt Gaza Aid Over Hamas Audits|first= Ethan|last= Bronner|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/world/middleeast/12gaza.html|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date= 11 August 2011|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=233365 US may cut Gaza aid over Hamas probes]&lt;/ref&gt;

A US official based in the region said &quot;[[USAID]]-funded partner organizations operating in Gaza are forced by Hamas's actions to suspend their assistance work. (They) were put on hold effective August 12.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4108159,00.html
US suspends work of aid groups in Gaza Strip&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official, Hamas demanded access to files and records of NGOs, which would reveal financial and administrative information, details of staff members and information on beneficiaries. He said Hamas shut down IMC and USAID after the US objected to &quot;unwarranted audits&quot;. Hamas administration official [[Taher al-Nono]] said Hamas had a right to monitor their work in the territory but an understanding had been reached that would allow independent auditing teams to inspect the files of NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/13/us-palestinians-us-gaza-idUSTRE77C03Q20110813 U.S. suspends work of aid groups in Gaza Strip]&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after the US announced it was suspending financial aid to Gaza, Hamas officials said they had reached an agreement with the United States that would allow USAID to continue operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=233619 'Hamas, US reach compromise on Gaza aid']&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip imposed new travel restrictions on Palestinians active in non-governmental organizations by requiring them to provide details of the trip to the ministry in what the Palestinian NGO Network regards as another Hamas attempt to control and hamper them. [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights|The Palestinian Center for Human Rights]] condemned the new laws. Tharut al Bic, head of the interior ministry's NGO department, stated that &quot;the new instructions are intended to make it easier for travellers to better organize their trip and to preserve order&quot;. Hamas requires sick people wishing to leave the Gaza Strip to submit applications and meet various conditions, in addition to restrictions Israel imposes on Palestinians leaving Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/gaza-ngos-express-horror-at-new-hamas-travel-restrictions-on-palestinians-1.381428 Gaza NGOs express 'horror' at new Hamas travel restrictions on Palestinians&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

In 2005, Hamas announced its intention to launch an experimental TV channel, &quot;[[Al-Aqsa TV]]&quot;. The station was launched on January 7, 2006, less than three weeks before the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|Palestinian legislative elections]]. It has shown television programs, including some children's television, which deliver anti-semitic messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-Semitic Hate Speech in the Name of Islam|date=May 16, 2008|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,553724,00.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas has stated that the television station is &quot;an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Palestinian government headed by Ismail Haniyeh or of the Hamas movement,&quot; and that Hamas does not hold anti-semitic views.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamas Condemns the Holocaust&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/may/12/hamascondemnstheholocaust Hamas Condemns the Holocaust] ''The Guardian'' May 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamization efforts==
===In the Gaza Strip===
{{main|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}
From 1987 to 1991, during the [[first intifada]], Hamas campaigned for the wearing of the [[hijab]] alongside other measures, including insisting women stay at home be segregated from men, and the promotion of polygamy. In the course of this campaign women who chose not to wear the hijab were verbally and physically harassed, with the result that the hijab was being worn 'just to avoid problems on the streets'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruben&quot;&gt;Rubenberg, C., ''Palestinian Women: Patriarchy and Resistance in the West Bank'' (USA, 2001) p.230-231&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, some of its members have attempted to impose Islamic dress or the [[Hijab]] head covering on women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/world/middleeast/06gaza.html Hamas Fights Over Gaza's Islamist Identity] New York Times, September 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhua&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2010-01/03/content_12748559.htm |title=Hamas encourages Gaza women to follow Islamic code _English_Xinhua |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the government's &quot;Islamic Endowment Ministry&quot; has deployed Virtue Committee members to warn citizens of the dangers of immodest dress, card playing and dating.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloomberg&quot;&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aB2RfynNbLmk Hamas Bans Women Dancers, Scooter Riders in Gaza Push] By Daniel Williams, Bloomberg, November 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no government laws imposing dress and other moral standards, and the Hamas education ministry reversed one effort to impose Islamic dress on students.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; There has also been successful resistance to attempts by local Hamas officials to impose Islamic dress on women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/18/hamas-gaza-islamist-dress-code Hamas patrols beaches in Gaza to enforce conservative dress code] The Guardian (UK), October 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the West Bank===

In 2005, the human rights organization [[Freemuse]] released a report titled &quot;Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music&quot;, which said that [[Palestinian musicians]] feared that harsh religious laws against music and concerts will be imposed since Hamas group scored political gains in the Palestinian Authority local elections of 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;freemuse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw10095.asp |title=Palestine: Taliban-like attempts to censor music |publisher=Freemuse.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt by Hamas to dictate a cultural code of conduct in the 1980s and early 1990s led to a violent fighting between different Palestinan sectors. Hamas members reportedly burned down stores that stocked videos which they deemed indecent and destroyed books which they described as &quot;heretical.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;barel&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, an outdoor music and dance performance in [[Qalqiliya]] were suddenly banned by the Hamas led municipality, for the reason that such an event would be forbidden by Islam, or &quot;[[Haram]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;otterbeck&quot;&gt;Battling over the public sphere: Islamic reactions to the music of today.

===Tayyip Erdoğan's Turkey as a Role Model===
Some Hamas members stated that the model of Islamic government that Hamas seeks to emulate is that of Turkey under the rule of [[Tayyip Erdoğan]]. The foremost members to distance Hamas from the practices of Taliban and to publicly support the Erdoğan model were [[Ahmad Yousef]] and [[Ghazi Hamad]], advisers to Prime Minister Hanieh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sayigh&quot;&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB41.pdf Hamas Rule in Gaza: Three Years On], [[Yezid Sayigh]], Crown Center for Middle East studies, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/features/letters-from/letter-from-gaza?page=show Letter from Gaza], Hamas's tunnel diplomacy, By Thanassis Cambanis, June 18, 2010.

==Antisemitism and anti-Zionism==
{{See also|Racism in the Palestinian territories}}

According to academic Esther Webman, antisemitism is not the main tenet of Hamas ideology, although antisemitic rhetoric is frequent and intense in Hamas leaflets. The leaflets generally do not differentiate between Jews and Zionists. In other Hamas publications and in interviews with its leaders attempts at this differentiation have been made.&lt;ref name=Webman1994&gt;Webman, Esther. ''Anti-semitic Motifs in the Ideology of Hizballah and Hamas'', Project for the study of Anti-semitism, Tel Aviv University, 1994, p. 22.

===Hamas Charter (1988)===
{{Main|Hamas Covenant}}
*Article 7 of the Hamas Covenant provides the following quotation, attributed to [[Mohammed]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avalon.law.yale.edu&quot;&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp The Avalon Project: Hamas Covenant 1988]. Retrieved February 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Article 22 states that the [[French revolution]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists or forces supportive of Zionism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;You may speak as much as you want about regional and world wars. They were behind [[World War I]], when they were able to destroy the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Islamic Caliphate]], making financial gains and controlling resources. They obtained the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]], formed the [[League of Nations]] through which they could rule the world. They were behind [[World War II]], through which they made huge financial gains by trading in armaments, and paved the way for the establishment of their state. It was they who instigated the replacement of the League of Nations with the United Nations and the Security Council to enable them to rule the world through them. There is no war going on anywhere, without having their finger in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yale1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |title=Hamas Covenant 1988 |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Article 32 of the Covenant refers to an antisemitic forgery, [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Today it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another. The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the [[Nile]] to the [[Euphrates]]. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avalon.law.yale.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Statements by Hamas members and clerics===

In 2008 [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|Imam]] Yousif al-Zahar of Hamas said in his sermon at the ''[[Welayat Mosque|Katib Wilayat]]'' mosque in Gaza that &quot;Jews are a people who cannot be trusted. They have been traitors to all agreements. Go back to history. Their fate is their vanishing.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamas's Insults&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Erlanger |first=Steven |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/world/middleeast/01hamas.html |title=In Gaza, Hamas's Insults to Jews Complicate Peace - New York Times |location=Gaza Strip |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamas ratchets&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/31/mideast/hamas.php|accessdate=November 21, 2008 |title=Hamas ratchets up its rhetoric against Jews|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Hamas legislator and imam, Sheik Yunus al-Astal, discussed a Koranic verse suggesting that &quot;suffering by fire is the Jews' destiny in this world and the next&quot;.

In January 2009, Gazan Hamas Health Minister [[Basim Naim]] published a letter in [[The Guardian]], stating that Hamas has no quarrel with Jewish people, only with the actions of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We believe in resistance, not revenge |author=Basim Naim |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/13/gaza-israelandthepalestinians |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2012-01-10 |location=London |title=Basim Naim: Hamas has no quarrel with Jews, only with the actions of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, senior Hamas MP [[Sayed Abu Musameh]] said that &quot;in our culture, we respect every foreigner, especially Jews and Christians, but we are against Zionists, not as nationalists but as fascists and racists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hamas against Zionism, not Judaism |author=David Cronin |url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&amp;cat=Palestine&amp;article=2200 |newspaper=Arab American News |date=2009-05-15 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the rededication of the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem in March 2010, senior Hamas figure al-Zahar called on Palestinians everywhere to observe five minutes of silence &quot;for Israel's disappearance and to identify with Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa mosque.&quot; He further stated stated that &quot;Wherever you have been you've been sent to your destruction. You've killed and murdered your prophets and you have always dealt in loan-sharking and destruction. You've made a deal with the devil and with destruction itself – just like your synagogue.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/israel-defies-the-us-over-east-jerusalem-buildings/story-e6frg6so-1225841572051&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3863184,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2012, during a visit to [[Tunis]], Gazan Hamas PM Ismail Haniyeh told The Associated Press on that he disagrees with the anti-Semitic slogans. &quot;We are not against the Jews because they are Jews.

In response to a statement by Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas preferred non-violent means and had agreed to adopt &quot;peaceful resistance,&quot; Hamas contradicted Abbas. According to Hamas spokesman Sami Abu-Zuhri, &quot;We had agreed to give popular resistance precedence in the West Bank, but this does not come at the expense of armed resistance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times of Israel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Elhanan|title=Contradicting Abbas, Hamas says it still believes in ‘armed resistance’ against Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/contradicting-abbas-hamas-says-it-still-believes-in-armed-resistance-against-israel/|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2012, Ahmad Bahr, Deputy Speaker of the Hamas Parliament, stated in a sermon which aired on ''[[Al-Aqsa TV]]'' that:

In an interview with [[Al-Aqsa TV]] in September 12, 2012, Marwan Abu Ras, a Hamas MP, who is also a member of the [[International Union of Muslim Scholars]], stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]):

===Statements on the Holocaust===
Hamas has been explicit in its [[Holocaust Denial]]. In reaction to the Stockholm conference on the Jewish Holocaust, held in late January 2000, Hamas issued a press release which it published on its official website, containing the following statements from a senior leader:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This conference bears a clear Zionist goal, aimed at forging history by hiding the truth about the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis. (...) The invention of these grand illusions of an alleged crime that never occurred, ignoring the millions of dead European victims of Nazism during the war, clearly reveals the racist Zionist face, which believes in the superiority of the Jewish race over the rest of the nations. (...) By these methods, the Jews in the world flout scientific methods of research whenever that research contradicts their racist interests.&lt;ref&gt;www.palestine-info.com.  qtd in [http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1946 Paz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In August 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper ''Al-Risala'' that the Zionists encouraged murder of Jews by the Nazis with the aim of forcing them to immigrate to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/feature/feature-03a.html{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Khaled Mashal]] called [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s December 14, 2005 statements on the Holocaust that Europeans had &quot;created a myth in the name of Holocaust&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10460807/ Iran leader's Holocaust remarks condemned] MSNBC, December 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) as &quot;courageous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2005/12/2008410111928749358.html &quot;Hamas springs to Iran's defense&quot;] Al Jazeera, December 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2008, [[Basim Naim]], the minister of health in the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government in Gaza countered holocaust denial, and said &quot;it should be made clear that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian government in Gaza denies the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].

In an open letter to Gaza Strip [[UNRWA]] chief [[John Ging]] published August 20, 2009, the movement's Popular Committees for Refugees called the Holocaust &quot;a lie invented by the Zionists,&quot; adding that the group refused to let Gazan children study about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=153336 Hamas rips UN over Holocaust lessons], Jerusalem Post 30-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas leader [[Younis al-Astal]] continued by saying that having the Holocaust included in the UNRWA curriculum for Gaza students amounted to &quot;marketing a lie and spreading it.&quot; Al-Astal continued &quot;I do not exaggerate when I say this issue is a war crime, because of how it serves the Zionist colonizers and deals with their hypocrisy and lies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;YahooAstal&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In February 2011, Hamas voiced opposition to UNRWA's teaching of the Holocaust in Gaza.

In October 2012, Hamas said that they were opposed to teaching about the Holocaust in Gaza Strip schools run by the UN Relief and Works Agency. The Refugee Affairs Department of Hamas said that teaching the Holocaust was a “crime against the issue of the refugees that is aimed at canceling their right of return.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=288246 Hamas opposes Holocaust study at UNRWA schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, an errant Israeli mortar strike killed dozens of people near a UN school. Hamas said that the mortar killed 42 people and left dozens wounded. Israel said that Hamas militants had launched a rocket from a yard adjacent to the school and one mortar  of three rounds hit the school, due to a [[GPS]] error. According to the Israeli military probe, the remaining two rounds hit the yard used to launch rockets into Israel, killing two members of Hamas' military wing who fired the rockets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054284.html IDF investigation shows errant mortar hit UN building in Gaza] [[Haaretz]] January 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Right Watch]] called Hamas to &quot;publicly renounce&quot; the rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and hold those responsible to account. Human Right Watch program director Iain Levine said the attacks by Hamas were &quot;unlawful and unjustifiable, and amount to war crimes&quot;, and accused Hamas of putting Palestinians at risk by launching attacks from built-up areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;/&gt; Hamas spokesman relied that the report was &quot;biased&quot; and he denied that Hamas uses human shields.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;/&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] investigated 19 incidents involving 53 civilian deaths in Gaza which Israel said were the result of Hamas fighting in densely populated areas and did not find evidence for existence of Palestinian fighters in the areas at the time of the Israeli attack. In other cases where no civilians had died, the report concluded that Hamas may have deliberately fired rockets from areas close to civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/89574/section/2 Turning a Blind Eye] [[Human Rights Watch]] April 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; HRW also investigated 11 deaths that Israel said were civilians being used as human shields by Hamas.

The Israeli 'human shields' charge against Hamas was called &quot;full of holes&quot; by &quot;[[The National (Abu Dhabi)]]&quot;, which stated that only Israel accused Hamas of using human shields during the conflict, though Hamas &quot;may be guilty&quot; of &quot;locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas&quot; and for &quot;deliberately firing indiscriminate weapons into civilian populated areas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090113/FOREIGN/591536290/1011/rss &quot;Israeli 'human shield' claim is full of holes&quot;] ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National (UAE)]]'' January 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of rocket and mortar attacks===
The rocket attacks by Hamas have been condemned by Human rights organizations as [[war crime]]s, both because they usually target civilians and because the weapons' inaccuracy would disproportionately endanger civilians even if military targets were chosen. [[Human Rights Watch]] has also condemned the attackers for firing from near residential structures, thus putting Gazan civilians at unnecessary risk.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/10911/section/3 Indiscriminate Fire], [[Human Rights Watch]] 30-06-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The August 2, 2010 [[Rocket attacks on Eilat and Aqaba]] and Aqaba sparked rage in Egypt at Hamas and [[Iran]]. The Egyptian press stated that the firing of the rockets from Egyptian territory by Hamas or by organizations cooperating with it constituted the crossing of a red line. The Egyptian position is that Iran is employing local proxies, such as Hamas, to escalate violence in the Middle East and to sabotage the Palestinian reconciliation efforts, as well as efforts to renew Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4568.htm Rage in Egypt at Hamas and Iran following Rocket Attacks on Eilat, Aqaba], MEMRI Special Dispatch No.3200&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the Egyptian government daily [[Al-Gumhouriyya]] also slammed Hamas's firing of &quot;primitive&quot; rockets at Israel that, according to the writer, serve only to prompt a deadly response from Israel. He blamed Hamas for turning the Gaza Strip into a &quot;big prison&quot; isolated from the world, where the residents suffer poverty while the leaders live in luxury.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Gumhouriyya (Egypt), October 22, 2010.

====Children as human shields====
Israel has accused Hamas of using [[children]] as [[human shield]]s. The Israeli government released video footage of Hamas in which it describes as two Hamas militants grabbing a young boy's arm from behind holding him to walk in front of them toward a group of people waiting near a wall. The IDF argues the militants were placing the boy between themselves and an Israeli sniper. The second scene shows an individual, described as a Hamas militant, grabbing a school boy off of a floor, where he is hiding behind a column from IDF fire, and using him as a human shield to walk to a different location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=58&amp;ar=HamasExploitationofCiviliansV&amp;ak=null &quot;IDF Video: Hamas uses civilians as a means to achieving military goals.&quot;] 2009.

In November 2006, the Israeli Air Force warned Muhammad Weil Baroud, a Palestinian militant accused of launching rockets into Israeli territory, to evacuate his home in a Jabalya refugee camp &lt;!-- While the source says Beit Lahiya, the home was actually in the Jabalya refugee camp in the city of Jabalia which is adjacent to Beit Lahiya --&gt; apartment block in advance of a planned Israeli air strike. Hamas responded by calling for volunteers to protect the apartment block and nearby buildings and, according to the [[Jerusalem Post]], hundreds of local residents, mostly women and children, responded. Israel suspended the air strike. Israel termed the Hamas action an example of the use of human shields, although surrounding an apartment block under most interpretations of international law is not such an example, since the term &quot;human shield&quot; involves warring parties placing civilians in &quot;proximity to a legitimate military target.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/schoenekase.pdf AF.mil] Targeting Decisions Regarding [[Human Shield]]s, by Captain Daniel P.

====Children as combatants====
The Israeli government released a video compiled mostly from Arab news sources showing Palestinian children under the age of 15 going through military training and carrying and firing arms. The video's narration explains that Hamas indoctrinates these child combatants and that Hamas operators send the children &quot;on missions from which they would not risk their own lives.&quot; According to the Israeli government, the children are used as spotters, to transport explosives and weapons, sent to play in areas to deter Israeli attacks and are sent unknowingly with explosive devices in their schoolbags to be blown up in the vicinity of Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=58&amp;ar=HamasExploitationofCiviliansV&amp;ak=null &quot;Video: Hamas uses civilians as a means to achieving military goals.&quot;] 2009.

Although Hamas admits to sponsoring summer schools to train teenagers in handling weapons they condemn attacks by children. Following the deaths of three teenagers during a 2002 attack on [[Netzarim (settlement)|Netzarim]] in central Gaza, Hamas banned attacks by children and &quot;called on the teachers and religious leaders to spread the message of restraint among young boys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79948&amp;page=1 Youths' Suicide Mission Stuns Palestinians] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] April 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://middleeastfacts.com/Articles/teenage-suicide-bombers.php Teenage Suicide Bombers] MEF 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

====Children's Magazine====
{{main|Al-Fateh}}
Al-Fateh (&quot;the conqueror&quot;) is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website. It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007. The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for &quot;the young builders of the future&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineTerrorists&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalpolitician.com/24252-terror |title=Online Terrorists Prey on the Vulnerable |publisher=Globalpolitician.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[MEMRI]], the magazine includes incitement to jihad and martyrdom and glorification of terrorist operations and of their planners and perpetrators. as well as characterizations of Jews as &quot;murderers of the prophets&quot; and laudatory descriptions of parents who encourage their sons to kill Jews. In each issue, a regular feature titled &quot;The Story of a Martyr&quot; presents the &quot;heroic deeds&quot; of a [[mujahid]] from one of the organizations who died in a suicide operation, including operations against civilians, or who was killed by the IDF. MEMRI also noted that the magazine includes illustrations of figures, including child warriors, who embody the ethos of jihad and martyrdom, presenting them as role models. These include the magazine's titular character, Al-Fateh (&quot;The Conqueror&quot;) - a small boy on a horse brandishing a drawn scimitar - as well as children carrying guns, and photos of Hamas fighters launching Qassam rockets.&lt;ref name=&quot;memri.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=ia&amp;ID=IA39307 |title=Hamas Children's Magazine Al-Fateh Encourages Terrorism, Glorifies Martyrdom |publisher=Memri.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/al_fateh_hamas.htm |title=Hamas Magazine for Kids Promotes Martyrdom and Hatred |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teenage Academic Scholars Travel Ban====
In September 2011, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, the Hamas minister of education informed eight high school [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholar]] students that they could not leave the Gaza Strip to study in the United States, saying the reasons were &quot;social and cultural.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/08/31/3089187/palestinian-scholarship-winners-barred-from-leaving-gaza Hamas bans Palestinian merit scholars from leaving Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent and the media===
[[Human rights]] groups and Gazans have accused the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip of restricting [[freedom of the press]] and forcefully suppressing dissent. Both foreign and Palestinian journalists report [[harassment]] and other measures taken against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/25/africa/ME-GEN-Palestinians-Journalists-Protest.php |title=Hamas forces try to arrest prominent Gaza journalist – |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=March 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.wafa.ps/?action=detail&amp;id=10320 Spokesperson of Presidency Condemns Hamas Militias New Crimes against Citizens in Gaza Strip], [[WAFA]], August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007 the Gaza Interior Ministry disbanded the Gaza Strip branch of the pro-Fatah Union of Palestinian Journalists, a move criticized by [[Reporters without borders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/palestinian-territories-hamas-disbands-journalists-union-06-09-2007,23565.html Hamas disbands journalists union amid continuing incidents], [[Reporters without borders]], September 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year the Hamas government arrested a British journalist and for a time canceled all press cards in Gaza.&lt;ref name=&quot;B92License&quot;&gt;{{cite web

More widely, in late August 2007 the group was accused in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', a conservative British newspaper, of torturing, detaining, and firing on unarmed protesters who had objected to policies of the Hamas government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph-HamasHoneymoon&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hamas honeymoon ends with torture|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/26/wgaza126.xml|publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|first = Charles|last = Levinson|date = August 26, 2007|accessdate = May 17, 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in late August, Palestinian health officials reported that the Hamas government had been shutting down Gaza clinics in retaliation for doctor strikes – The Hamas government confirmed the &quot;punitive measure against doctors&quot; because, in its view, they had incited other doctors to suspend services and go out on strike.&lt;ref&gt;al-Mughrabi, Nidal.

November 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007 the Hamas government banned public prayers, after Fatah supporters began holding worship sessions that quickly escalated into raucous protests against Hamas rule. Government security forces beat several gathering supporters and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3447034,00.html Hamas blocks Fatah protests in Gaza], [[ynetnews]], September 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, the Hamas government announced it would release all political prisoners in custody in Gaza. Several hours after the announcement, 17 Fatah members were released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/10/20081030141046326720.html Hamas frees Fatah prisoners], [[Al-Jazeera]], October 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2012, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) accused Hamas of harassing elected officials belong to the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate (PJS) in Gaza.  The IFJ said that journalists' leaders in Gaza have faced a campaign of intimidation, as well as threats designed to force them to stop their union work.  Some of these journalists are now facing charges of illegal activities and a travel ban, due to their refusal &quot;to give in to pressure.&quot;  The IFJ said that these accusations are &quot;malicious&quot; and &quot;should be dropped immediately.&quot;  The IFJ explained that the campaign against PJS members began in March 2012, after their election, and included a raid organized by Hamas supporters who took over the PJS offices in Gaza with the help of the security forces, and subsequently evicted the staff and elected officials.  Other harassment includes the targeting of individuals who were bullied into stopping union work.  The IFJ backed the PJS and called on Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to intervene to stop &quot;his officials' unwarranted intereference in journalists' affairs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IFJ August&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/ifj-condemns-hamas-meddling-in-gaza-journalists-affairs | title=IFJ Condemns Hamas Meddling in Gaza Journalists' Affairs | publisher=International Federation of Journalists | date=August 2, 2012 | accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights abuses===
In June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights based in [[Ramallah]] published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] were subjected in 2010 to an &quot;almost systematic campaign&quot; of human rights abuses by the [[Palestinian Authority]] and Hamas, as well as by [[Israel]]i authorities, with the security forces belonging to the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liel |first=Alon |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=224143 |title='PA bans journalists from reporting human rights abuses' |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012  the [[Human Rights Watch]] presented a 43 page long list of human rights violation committed by Hamas. Among actions attributed to Hamas the HRW report mentions beatings  with metal clubs and rubber hoses, hanging of alleged collaborationists with Israel, and torture of 102 individuals. According  to the report, Hamas also tortured civil society activists and peaceful protesters. Reflecting on the captivity of [[Gilad Shalit]], the HRW report described it as &quot;cruel and inhuman&quot;. The report also slams Hamas for harassment of people based on so called morality offenses and for media censorship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4288204,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-israeloccupied-palestinian-territories&lt;/ref&gt; In a public statement [[Joe Stork]], the deputy Middle East director of HRW claimed that &quot;after five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights and grants impunity to abusive security services&quot;. Hamas responded by denying charges and describing them as &quot;politically motivated&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/uk-palestinians-hamas-justice-idUKBRE8920V020121003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political violence and terrorism==
{{Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel}}
Hamas uses both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals. For example, while politically engaged in the 2006 Palestinian Territories parliamentary election campaign, Hamas stated in its election manifesto that it was prepared to use &quot;armed resistance to end the occupation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/6296|title= Islamistisk politik vinner mark|author=Madelene Axelsson|date=January 27, 2006|publisher=[[Stockholms Fria Tidning]]}} {{Sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2004, Hamas was responsible for killing nearly 400 Israelis and wounding more than 2,000 in 425 attacks, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2001 through May 2008, Hamas launched more than 3,000 Qassam rockets and 2,500 mortar attacks into Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox1&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473448,00.html Israel At 'War to the Bitter End,' Strikes Key Hamas Sites] December 29, 2008, Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on civilians===

The attack has also been referred to as the [[Netanya suicide attack|Passover massacre]] since it took place on the first night of the Jewish festival of [[Passover]] at a [[Passover Seder|Seder]].

Hamas defended the suicide attacks as a legitimate aspect of its [[asymmetric warfare]] against Israel, but the practice is illegal under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asil.org/insigh133.cfm |title=Israel's Targeted Killings of Hamas Leaders |publisher=Asil.org |date=1907-10-18 |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While the suicide attacks ceased in 2005, al-Qassam Brigades rocket and mortar attacks on towns and settlements near Gaza continued. Since 2002, paramilitary soldiers of al-Qassam Brigades and other groups have used homemade Qassam rockets to hit Israeli towns in the [[Negev]], such as [[Sderot]].

===Rocket attacks on Israel===
According to Human Rights Watch, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range. Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the &quot;accidental result&quot; of the weapons' poor quality. According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects. From January 2009, following [[Operation Cast Lead]], Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, &quot;showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/89574/section/3 HRW report] April 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war. It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas. Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mughrabi, Nidal, &quot;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE6141LC Hamas &quot;regrets&quot; civilian deaths, Israel unmoved],&quot; [[Reuters]], February 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts to derail 2010 peace talks===
{{see also|2010 Palestinian militancy campaign}}

In 2010, Hamas, who have been actively sidelined from the peace talks by Israel{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, spearheaded a coordinated effort by 13 [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant groups, in attempt to derail the stalled [[Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2010|peace talks]] between [[Israel]] and [[Mahmoud Abbas]], President of the [[Palestinian Authority]]. According to the Israeli [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories]] Major Gen. Eitan Dangot, Israel seeks to work with [[Salam Fayyad]], to help revive the Palestinian economy, and hopes to ease restrictions on the Gaza Strip further, &quot;while somehow preventing the Islamic militants who rule it from getting credit for any progress&quot;. According to Dangot, Hamas must not be seen as ruling successfully or be allowed to &quot;get credit for a policy that would improve the lives of people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130827853 Israeli General Lays Out Plan For Reviving Gaza]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign consists of attacks against Israelis in which, according to a Hamas declaration in early September, &quot;all options are open&quot;.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/0904/1224278203442.html &quot;Islamist groups attempt to derail Middle East talks,&quot;] Mark Weiss, September 4, 2010, Irish Times.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitnick&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0831/Hamas-targets-Israeli-Palestinian-talks-by-killing-four-Israelis &quot;Hamas targets Israeli-Palestinian talks by killing four Israelis; Hamas took responsibility for the fatal shooting of four Israeli settlers outside Hebron today, on the eve of Israeli-Palestinian talks in Washington,&quot;] Joshua Mitnick,  August 31, 2010, Christian Science Monitor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jerusalempoststaff&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=186963 &quot;Hamas to launch 'more effective attacks' on Israel,&quot;] September 3, 2010, Jerusalem Post.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=excathedraeditorial&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/07/AR2010090705977.html &quot;The Shadow of Hamas,&quot;] Staff Editorial,  September 8, 2010, Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt; The participating groups also include [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] and an unnamed splinter group of [[Fatah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6811J620100902 Gaza militants vow wave of attacks against Israel], Reuters 02-09-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes of martyrdom===
{{See also|Martyrdom in Islam}}
[[File:Izz al-Din Shuheil al-Masri.jpg|thumb|[[Izz al-Din Shuheil al-Masri]], perpetrator of the 2001 [[Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing]].]]

According to a translation by Palestinian Media Watch, in 2008, Fathi Hamad, a member of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]], stated on [[Al-Aqsa TV]], &quot;For the Palestinian people death became an industry, at which women excel and so do all people on this land: the elderly excel, the Jihad fighters excel, and the children excel. Accordingly (Palestinians) created a human shield of women, children, the elderly and the Jihad fighters against the Zionist bombing machine, as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death as you desire life'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=582&amp;doc_id=507 &quot;Hamas explains using civilians as human shields&quot;], ''[[Palestinian Media Watch]]'', (December 28, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Hamas speaker Ahmad Bahr praised the virtues of martyrdom and Jihad, and said that 2.5 million black-eyed virgins were waiting in the [[Garden of Eden]] which could be entered only by prophets, by the righteous, and by martyrs. He continued by saying that nobody on Earth &quot;will be able to confront the resistance, or to confront the mujahideen, those who worship Allah and seek martyrdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Middle East Research Institute, [http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4600.htm Special Dispatch No.3227]: Hamas PLC Speaker Ahmad Bahr: 2.5 Million Virgins Await the Prophets, the Righteous, and the Martyrs in a Single Palace in the Garden of Eden, September 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guerrilla warfare===

According to a 2006 report by rival Fatah party, Hamas had smuggled between several hundred and 1,300 tons of advanced rockets, along with other weaponry, into Gaza.&lt;ref name=&quot;ynetnews_weight&quot; /&gt;

Hamas has used [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]s and [[anti-tank rocket]]s against the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in Gaza. The latter include standard [[RPG-7]] warheads and home-made rockets such as the [[Al-Bana]], Al-[[Batar]] and Al-[[Yasin (RPG)|Yasin]]. The IDF has a difficult, if not impossible time trying to find hidden weapons caches in Palestinian areas — this is due to the high local support base Hamas enjoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/history/levineconference/papers/aburaiya.pdf#search=%22hamas%20enjoys%20great%20popular%20support%22|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070605021001/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/history/levineconference/papers/aburaiya.pdf#search=%22hamas%20enjoys%20great%20popular%20support%22|archivedate=June 5, 2007|author=Issam Aburaiya|date=October 3, 2006|title=Hamas and Palestinian Nationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other targets and activities===
In addition to killing Israeli civilians and armed forces, Hamas has also attacked suspected Palestinian [[Collaborationism|collaborators]], and Fatah rivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;pubid=968163964505&amp;cid=1159712646109&amp;col=968705899037&amp;call_page=TS_News&amp;call_pageid=968332188492&amp;call_pagepath=News/News Fatah, Hamas gunbattles kill 7] (Toronto Star) October 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the Israeli invasion of Gaza in January 2009, Hamas has been accused of systematically rounding up, torturing and summarily executing Fatah supporters suspected of supplying information to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/21/MNHV15EHUT.DTL San Francisco Chronicle] January 22, 2009 ''Hamas executes suspected Fatah traitors in Gaza''&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2007, members of the [[Palestinian Red Crescent]], speaking on conditions of anonymity, said that Hamas had confiscated their humanitarian supply convoys that were destined for Palestinian civilians.

[[Human Rights Watch]] has cited a number of summary executions as particular examples of violations of the rules of warfare, including the case of Muhammad Swairki, 28, a cook for Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard, who was thrown to his death, with his hands and legs tied, from a 15-story apartment building in Gaza City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/13/isrlpa16156.htm Gaza: Armed Palestinian Groups Commit Grave Crimes], [[Human Rights Watch]], June 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups are accused of frequently extrajudicially executing or otherwise punishing those considered collaborators with Israel. Frequent killings of unarmed people have also occurred during Hamas-Fatah clashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2090520.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Unrest erupts in Gaza Strip |publisher=BBC News |date=July 3, 2002 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Levinson |first=Charles |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/10/wirq310.xml |title=Shot by their own side, healed by the enemy – Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=June 10, 2007 |accessdate=May 27, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States designation of Hamas===
The State Department decided to add Hamas to its [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]] in April 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs1993&quot;&gt;
{{CRS| article = Hamas: The Organizations, Goals and Tactics of a Militant Palestinian Organization | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/931014-hamas.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2009}}, Hamas is still listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm |title=US Department of State's Foreign Terrorist Organizations fact sheet, released July 7, 2009 |publisher=State.gov |date=January 19, 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States states that its strong stand against Hamas arises from the group's use of violence, its opposition to U.S. interests in the Middle East, and because Hamas is allegedly receiving support from Iran and collaborating with the Lebanese group [[Hezbullah]]. The Hamas representative in Iran denied the allegation that it had received $30 million from Iran in 1992, but acknowledged Iranian assistance to Palestinian groups. In particular, the U.s. alleges that Hamas soldiers have been given refuge in southern Lebanon, where they receive training and support from Hezbollah guerrillas.

The [[FBI]] and [[United States Department of Justice]] also stated, in 2004, that Hamas threatened the United States through [[covert cells]] on US soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2004/marzook_et_al.pdf United States v.

He added that Hamas had &quot;maintained a longstanding policy of focusing their attacks on Israeli targets in Israel and the Palestinian territories, and that the FBI believed that the main interest of Hamas in the U.S.remained &quot;the raising of funds to support their regional goals.&quot; Mueller also stated that, &quot;of all the Palestinian groups, Hamas has the largest presence in the US, with a robust infrastructure, primarily focused on fundraising, propaganda for the Palestinian cause, and proselytizing. Although it would be a major strategic shift for Hamas, its US network is theoretically capable of facilitating acts of terrorism in the US&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress05/mueller021605.htm FBI Press Room:]{{dead link|date=August 2011}} Testimony of Robert S.

==Public opinion of Hamas==
===In Arab countries===
[[File:Pro Hamas Rally in Damascus.jpg|thumb|upright|Pro-Hamas rally in Damascus]]
A 2010 [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] Global Attitudes Survey found that 60% of Jordanian Muslims and 49% of Muslims in both Lebanon and Egypt held a favorable opinion of Hamas.&lt;ref name=pew2010&gt;[[Pew Research Center]] Global Attitudes Survey: [http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2010/12/Pew-Global-Attitudes-Muslim-Report-FINAL-December-2-2010.pdf Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah], December 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 Pew survey found 62% of Palestinians holding a favorable opinion of the group.&lt;ref name=pew2007&gt;[[Pew Research Center]] Global Attitudes Survey: [http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/256.pdf Global Unease With Major World Powers], June 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Israel===
In February 2008 a [[Haaretz]] poll indicated that 64% of Israelis favour their government holding direct talks with Hamas in Gaza about a cease-fire and the release of captives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/958473.html|title=Poll: Most Israelis back direct talks with Hamas on Shalit|author=Yossi Verter|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=February 27, 2008|accessdate=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a November 2009 survey conducted by [[Haaretz]], 57% of Israelis support the view of MK [[Shaul Mofaz]] of [[Kadima]], that Israel should establish a dialogue with Hamas under certain conditions, for example, that Hamas renounces violence, recognizes Israel's right to exist as a Jewish nation, and loses its designation as a terrorist organization. Hamas responded to this by labeling it &quot;Zionist vulgarity&quot; and stating that they will never negotiate with or recognize their &quot;enemy&quot;, the state of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1127911.html Haaretz poll: 57% of Israelis support plan to talk to Hamas.

===In the USA===
The [[charitable trust]] [[Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development]] was accused in December 2001 of funding Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/po837.htm |title=PO-837: Secretary O'Neill – Statement on the Blocking of Hamas Financiers' Assets |publisher=Ustreas.gov |date=December 4, 2001 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Justice Department]] filed 200 charges against the foundation. The case first ended in a [[trial#Mistrials|mistrial]], in which jurors acquitted on some counts and were deadlocked on charges ranging from tax violations to [[providing material support for terrorists]]. In a retrial, on November 24, 2008, the five leaders of the Foundation were convicted on 108 counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/25/us/25charity.html| title=Five Convicted in Terrorism Financing Trial| accessdate=December 29, 2008| author=Kovach, Gretel C.| date=November 24, 2008| publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a federal court in the United States found Hamas liable in a civil lawsuit for the 1996 [[Murder of Yaron and Efrat Ungar|murders of Yaron and Efrat Ungar]] near [[Bet Shemesh]], [[Israel]]. Hamas has been ordered to pay the families of the Ungars $116 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/01/29/116m_awarded_in_terrorism_suit/ $116m awarded in terrorism suit] The Boston Globe&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, 2004, the court issued a default judgment against the [[Palestinian National Authority|PNA]] and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] regarding the Ungars' said that the Palestinian Authority and the PLO provide safe haven to Hamas.

On August 20, 2004, three Palestinians, one a naturalized American citizen, were charged with a &quot;lengthy racketeering conspiracy to provide money for [[terrorism|terrorist]] acts in Israel.&quot; The indicted include [[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook]], senior member of Hamas, believed to be currently in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] and considered a [[fugitive]] by the US.

On February 1, 2007, two men were acquitted of contravening US law by supporting Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020101377.html?nav=rss_world |title=Two Men Acquitted of Conspiracy To Fund Hamas Activities in Israel – |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= February 2, 2007|accessdate=May 27, 2010|first=Dan|last=Eggen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men argued that they helped move money for Palestinian causes aimed at helping the Palestinian people and not to promote terrorism.

In January 2009,  a Federal prosecutor accused the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] of having links to a charity designated as a support network for Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/30/fbi-cut-ties-cair-following-terror-financing-trial/ |title=FBI Cuts Ties With CAIR Following Terror Financing Trial |publisher=Foxnews.com |accessdate=May 27, 2010 | date=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department identified CAIR as an &quot;un-indicted co-conspirator&quot; in the [[Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development|Holy Land Foundation]] case in [[Dallas]], which concluded with the sentencing of the two founders of the foundation to life in prison for funneling $12 million to Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yager |first=Jordy |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/63023-republicans-accuse-muslim-advocacy-group-of-trying-to-plant-spies |title=House Republicans accuse Muslim group of trying to plant spies |publisher=Thehill.com |date=October 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a federal appeals court removed that label for all parties and instead, named them &quot;joint venturers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/nation/article/court_removes_co-conspirator_tag_from_muslim_groups_20101022/ Court removes 'co-conspirator' tag from Muslim groups | Nation].

===In Germany===
A German federal court ruled in 2004 that Hamas was a unified organisation whose humanitarian aid work could not be separated from its &quot;terrorist and political activities.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Expatica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/news/german-news/germany-bans-hamas-linked-donor-group_82832.html |title=Germany bans Hamas-linked donor group |publisher=Expatica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, [[Germany]] also outlawed Frankfurt-based International Humanitarian Aid Organization (IHH e.V.), saying it had used donations to support Hamas-affiliated relief projects in Gaza.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilfsorganisation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3918670,00.html |title=Germany bans group accused of Hamas links |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=07.12.10 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IHH&quot;/&gt; While presenting their activities to donors as humanitarian assistance, German Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maiziere]] said, IHH e.V. had &quot;exploited trusting donors' willingness to help by using money that was given for a good purpose for supporting what is, in the final analysis, a terrorist organization.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilfsorganisation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IHH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=By DPA |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/germany-outlaws-ihh-over-claimed-hamas-links-1.301483 |title=Germany outlaws IHH over claimed Hamas links|publisher=Haaretz.com |date=12.07.10 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-215989-germany-ihh-ev-ban-shameful-illegal-says-group-leader.html Germany IHH e.V. ban shameful, illegal, says group leader] Today's Zaman, July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the [[Islamic Human Rights Commission]] described the decision as &quot;a victory for those who seek to stigmatise all Islamic activism as supporting terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihrc.org.uk/activities/press-releases/9380--press-release-germany-banning-of-ihh-stigmatises-all-islamic-humanitarian-activism- PRESS RELEASE: Germany – Banning of IHH stigmatises all Islamic humanitarian activism] July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
