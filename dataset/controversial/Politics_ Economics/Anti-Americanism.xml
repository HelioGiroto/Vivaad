The term '''anti-Americanism''', or '''anti-American sentiment''', refers to opposition or hostility to the policies, culture, society, economics or international role of the United States. Common contemporary negative [[stereotypes of Americans]] include that Americans are: [[Aggression|aggressive]], [[:wikt:arrogant|arrogant]], [[Ignorance|ignorant]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], [[know-it-all]]s, loudmouthed, [[Militarism|militaristic]], obsessed with making money rather than making friends, too [[Moralism|moralistic]], [[obnoxious]], and that many Americans are overweight.&lt;ref&gt;William Russell Melton. ''The new American expat: thriving and surviving overseas in the post-9/11 world''. Intercultural Press, 2005. p. XIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist Brendan O'Connor suggests that Anti-Americanism cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon and that the term originated as a rough composite of stereotypes, prejudices and criticisms towards Americans or the United States, evolving to more politically-based criticism.  French scholar Marie-France Toinet says use of the term &quot;is only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition – a sort of allergic reaction – to America as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref name=OConnor&gt;
O'Connor, Brendan: [http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/1_04/OConnor.pdf &quot;A Brief History of Anti-Americanism from Cultural Criticism to Terrorism&quot;], Australasian Journal of American Studies, July 2004, pp. 77–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise definition of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led to the term being used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Brendan, p 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the first edition of Webster's [[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language]] (1828) the word 'anti-American'  was defined as &quot;opposed to America, or to the true interests or government of the United States; opposed to the revolution in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=antiamerican&amp;use1913=on&amp;use1828=on |title=The ARTFL Project – Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913+1828) |publisher=Machaut.uchicago.edu |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France the use of the noun form 'antiaméricanisme' has been catalogued from 1948,&lt;ref&gt;Le Petit Robert ISBN 2-85036-668-4&lt;/ref&gt; entering ordinary political language in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Roger, Phillipe. ''The American Enemy: The History of French Anti-Americanism,'' [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/723682.html introductory excerpt], University of Chicago Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Interpretations of anti-Americanism have often been [[polarization (psychology)|polarized]].  Anti-Americanism has been described by sociologist [[Paul Hollander]] as &quot;a relentless critical impulse toward American social, economic, and political institutions, traditions, and values.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hollander2007&gt;Hollander, Paul [http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/politics_of_envy.htm The Politics of Envy], The New Criterion, November 2002. Retrieved 29 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Nordlinger, [http://old.nationalreview.com/nordlinger/nordlinger200407221016.asp Hollander’s Clear Eye], 22 July 2004, National Review Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

German newspaper publisher and political scientist [[Josef Joffe]] suggests five classic aspects of the phenomenon: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing the United States to have an irremediably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the United States responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit the influence of the United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one's society off from its polluting products and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060501fareviewessay85311a/walter-russell-mead/through-our-friends-eyes-defending-and-advising-the-hyperpower.html|title=Through Our Friends' Eyes – Defending and Advising the Hyperpower |accessdate=12 April 2008 |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell  |date=May/June 2006 |publisher=[[Foreign Affairs]]}} Review of Josef Joffe's ''Überpower: The Imperial Temptation of America.''&lt;/ref&gt; Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti-Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous [[ideology|ideological]] current, comparable to [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-markovits-05.htm|title=European Anti-Americanism (and Anti-Semitism): Ever Present Though Always Denied
|first=Andrei S.|last=Markovits|publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Americanism has also been described as an attempt to frame the consequences of U.S. policy choices as evidence of a specifically American moral failure, as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Robert. ''Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Its status as an &quot;[[-ism]]&quot; is a greatly contended aspect, however. Brendon O'Connor notes that studies of the topic have been &quot;patchy and impressionistic,&quot; and often one-sided attacks on anti-Americanism as an irrational position.&lt;ref name=&quot;OConnor&quot;/&gt; American academic [[Noam Chomsky]], a prolific critic of U.S. policy, asserts that the use of the term within the U.S. has parallels with methods employed by [[totalitarian]] states or military dictatorships; he compares the term to &quot;anti-Sovietism&quot;, a label used by the [[Kremlin]] to suppress [[dissident]] or critical thought, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/chomskypa.htm Interviewing Chomsky] Preparatory to Porto: Alegre ''Zmagazine''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The concept &quot;anti-American&quot; is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as &quot;anti-Soviet.&quot; That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture. In contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some have attempted to recognize both positions. French academic [[Pierre Guerlain]] has argued that the term represents two very different tendencies: &quot;One systematic or essentialist, which is a form of prejudice targeting all Americans. The other refers to the way criticisms of the United States are labeled &quot;anti-American&quot; by supporters of U.S. policies in an ideological bid to discredit their opponents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejas.revues.org/document1523.html |title=Pierre Guerlain, '&amp;#39;A Tale of Two Anti-Americanisms'&amp;#39; (European Journal of American Studies 2007) |publisher=Ejas.revues.org |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerlain argues that these two &quot;ideal types&quot; of anti-Americanism can sometimes merge, thus making discussion of the phenomenon particularly difficult. Other scholars have suggested that a plural of anti-Americanisms, specific to country and time period, more accurately describe the phenomenon than any broad generalization.&lt;ref&gt;Katzenstein, Peter and Robert Keohane. &quot;[http://www.princeton.edu/~rkeohane/publications/AntiAmerInWPConclusion.pdf Conclusion: Anti-Americanisms and the Polyvalence of America]&quot;, in ''Anti-Americanisms in World Politics,'' Katzenstein and Keohane, eds., Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2006 (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt; The widely used &quot;anti-American sentiment&quot;, meanwhile, less explicitly implies an ideology or belief system.

Globally, increases in perceived anti-American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies or actions,&lt;ref&gt;Rodman, Peter W. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2751/is_2000_Summer/ai_63649343#continue The world’s resentment], ''The National Interest,'' Washington D.C., vol. 601, Summer 2001&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wws.princeton.edu/ppns/papers/speulda.pdf Documenting the Phenomenon of Anti-Americanism]
By Nicole Speulda, The Princeton Project on National Security, Princeton University, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; wars. For this reason, critics sometimes argue the label is a propaganda term that is used to dismiss any censure of the United States as irrational.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Brendan, op. cit., p 78: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;Cold War (1945–1989) ... In this period the false and disingenuous labeling of objections to American policies as ‘anti-Americanism’ became more prominent.&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th and 19th centuries==

===Degeneracy thesis===

In the mid- to late-eighteenth century, a theory emerged among some European intellectuals that the New World landmasses were inherently inferior to Europe. The so-called &quot;degeneracy thesis&quot; held that climatic extremes, humidity and other atmospheric conditions in America physically weakened both men and animals.&lt;ref name=hatingamerica&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Rubin |authorlink=Barry Rubin |coauthors=Rubin, Judith Colp |title=Hating America: A History |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-530649-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–19}} Some authors such as James W. Ceaser and Philippe Roger, have interpreted this theory as &quot;a kind of prehistory of anti-Americanism.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ceaser&gt;Ceaser, James W. [http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/a_genealogy_of_antiamericanism.htm &quot;A genealogy of Anti-Americanism&quot;], ''The Public Interest,'' Summer 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Granthem&gt;{{cite journal | last =Grantham | first =Bill | year =2003 | month =Summer | title =Brilliant Mischief: The French on Anti-Americanism | journal =World Policy Journal | volume =20 | issue =2 |url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/articles/wpj03-2/grantham.html|accessdate=16 May 2008 | ref =harv | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430075751/http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/articles/wpj03-2/grantham.html| archivedate = 30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have (in the words of Philippe Roger) been a historical “constant” since the 18th century, or again an endlessly repetitive “semantic block”.

The theory originated with [[Comte de Buffon]], a leading French naturalist, in his ''Histoire Naturelle'' (1766).&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; The French writer [[Voltaire]] joined Buffon and others in making the argument.&lt;ref name=Meunier/&gt;  Dutchman [[Cornelius de Pauw]], court philosopher to [[Frederick II of Prussia]] became its leading proponent.&lt;ref name=Ceaser/&gt; While Buffon focused on the American biological environment, de Pauw attacked people native to the continent.&lt;ref name=Popkin/&gt; James Ceaser has noted that the denouncement of America as inferior to Europe was in part motivated by the German government's fear of mass emigration; de Pauw called on to convince the Germans that the new world was inferior. De Pauw is also known to have influenced the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in a similar direction.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan O'Connor, Anti-Americanism – Historical Perspectives, p.8 [http://books.google.no/books?id=KF0pySH-ozsC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=%22jackson+pollock%22+%2B%22americanism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6sXBdkD73C&amp;sig=_JKOhWX74h70jsh7KIk6D44o59M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q7lMT-ezMpL74QTIupDMAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jackson%20pollock%22%20%2B%22americanism%22&amp;f=false Brendan O'Connor, Anti-Americanism – Historical Perspectives, p.8]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was extended to argue that the natural environment of the United States would prevent it from ever producing true culture. Paraphrasing de Pauw, the [[Encyclopédie|French Encyclopedist]] [[Abbé Raynal]] wrote, &quot;America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Raynal, Abbé Guillaume-Thomas. ''Histoire philosophique et politique des deux Indes.'' Amsterdam, 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was debated and rejected by early American thinkers such as [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Thomas Jefferson]]; Jefferson, in his ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1781), provided a detailed rebuttal of de Buffon.&lt;ref name=Ceaser/&gt; Hamilton also vigorously rebuked the idea in [[Federalist No. 11]] (1787).&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt;

One critic, citing Raynal's ideas, suggests that it was specifically extended to the English colonies that would become the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Danzer | first =Gerald A. | year =1974 | month =February | title =Has the Discovery of America Been Useful or Hurtful to Mankind?

Roger suggests that the idea of degeneracy posited a symbolic, as well as a scientific America, that would evolve beyond the original thesis. He argues that Buffon's ideas formed the root of a &quot;stratification of negative discourses&quot; that has recurred throughout the two countries' relationship (and has been matched by persistent [[Francophobia|anti-Gallic]] sentiment in the United States).&lt;ref name=Granthem/&gt;

===Politics and ideology===
The young United States also faced criticism on political and ideological grounds. Ceaser argues that the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the Enlightenment view of [[reason]] and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the rationalistic American project. The German poet [[Nikolaus Lenau]] commented: &quot;With the expression ''Bodenlosigkeit'' (absence of ground), I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme.&quot; Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref name=Ceaser/&gt; Lenau had emigrated to the United States in 1833 and found that the country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the USA were the subject of a novel entitled ''Tired of America'' (''Der Amerika-Müde'') (1855) by fellow German [[Ferdinand Kürnberger]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1974) edited by William Rose Bennet: 556&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of American democracy was also questioned. The sentiment was that the country lacked &quot;[a] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system,&quot; according to Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans in the early nineteenth century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; The [[French Revolution]], which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles.&lt;ref name=Ceaser/&gt; That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery.&lt;ref name=Schama/&gt; &quot;How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?&quot; asked [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDA113EF937A35755C0A9609C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title= Give Us Liberty|accessdate=26 May 2008 |last=Staples |first=Brent |date=4 June 2006 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He famously stated that, &quot;I am willing to love all mankind, except an American.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;

===Communist critiques===
The Soviet Union and other Communist nations emphasized capitalism as the great enemy of Communism, and identified the U.S. as the leader of the capitalist nations. They sponsored anti-Americanism of all kinds among followers and fellow travellers. Berman notes that, &quot;Marx himself largely admired the dynamism of American capitalism and democracy and did not participate in the anti-Americanism  that came to be the hallmark of Communist ideology in the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Russell A. Berman|title=Anti-Americanism in Europe: A Cultural Problem|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8687I9FjRm8C&amp;pg=PT58|year=2004|publisher=Hoover Press|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor argues that, &quot;communism represented the starkest version of anti-Americanism  – a coherent worldview that challenged the free market, private property, limited government, and individualism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan O'Conner|title=The Rise of Anti-Americanism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=au8edbGaTGQC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his ''Anti-Americanism'' (2003), French writer [[Jean François Revel]] argues that anti-Americanism emerges primarily from anticapitalism, and this critique also comes from non-Communist totalitarian regimes.

===Fascist critiques===
[[File:Liberators-Kultur-Terror-Anti-Americanism-1944-Nazi-Propaganda-Poster.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|1944]] [[Nazi propaganda]] poster aimed at the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] with the words: &quot;The U.S.A. will save [[European culture]] from destruction&quot;]]
Drawing on the ideas of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816–1882), European fascists decried the supposed degenerating effect of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] on the racial mix of the American population. The Nazi philosopher [[Alfred Rosenberg]] argued that race mixture in the United States made it inferior to countries like [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], which had a supposedly pure-bred racial stock.&lt;ref name=hatingamerica/&gt;{{rp|91–2}}

[[Anti-Semitism]] was another factor in these critiques. The belief that America was ruled by a Jewish conspiracy was common in countries ruled by fascists before and during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=hatingamerica/&gt;{{rp|91–7}} The Jews, the assumed puppet masters behind American plans for world domination, were also seen as using [[jazz]] in a crafty plan to eliminate racial distinctions.&lt;ref name=hatingamerica/&gt;{{rp|91–7}} However, despite this belief, [[Adolf Hitler]] did not count America as a credible adversary of the Third Reich because of its incoherent racial mix; he saw Americans as a &quot;mongrel race&quot;, &quot;half-Judaised&quot; and &quot;half-Negrified&quot;.&lt;ref name=hatingamerica/&gt;{{rp|94–7}}

In an address to the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] on 11 December 1941, Hitler declared war on the United States and lambasted [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]:

:&quot;He [Roosevelt] was strengthened in this [political diversion] by the circle of Jews surrounding him, who, with Old Testament-like fanaticism, believe that the United States can be the instrument for preparing another [[Purim]] for the European nations that are becoming increasingly [[anti-Semitic]]. It was the Jew, in his full Satanic vileness, who rallied around this man [Roosevelt], but to whom this man also reached out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Friedlander (2008) ''The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews 1939–1945''.

===9/11===

In a book called ''The Rise of Anti-Americanism'', published in 2006, Brendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths said that the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] were &quot;quintessential anti-American acts, which satisfy all of the competing definitions of Anti-Americanism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Griffiths|2006|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=lJLIIZN8szYC&amp;pg=PA21 21]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They ask, &quot;If 9/11 can be construed as the exemplar of anti-Americanism at work, does it make much sense to imply that all anti-Americans are complicit with terrorism?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Griffiths|2006|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=lJLIIZN8szYC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders in most Middle Eastern countries, including Afghanistan, condemned the attacks. [[Saddam Hussein]]’s Iraq was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that &quot;the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attacks draw mixed response in Mideast|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/12/mideast.reaction/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=12 September 2001|accessdate=30 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll conducted {{as of|2010|alt=in 2010}} by the [[BBC World Service]] found positive views in most countries about the influence of the U.S. for the first time since tracking began in 2005. 19 countries rated U.S. influence positively, while six leaned negative and two were divided. 46 per cent of the 27 countries polled viewed US influence positively and 34 per cent viewed it negatively.

===Middle East, South Asia and North Africa===
[[File:Houthis Logo.png|thumb|260px|Anti-American banner of the [[Houthi]] militia. It reads: [[Takbir|Allah is Great]], Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews, Victory to Islam.]]
After [[World War I]], admiration was expressed for American President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s promulgation of democracy, freedom and self-determination in the [[Fourteen Points]] and, during [[World War II]], the high ideals of the [[Atlantic Charter]] received favorable notice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamim Ansary 2009&quot;/&gt;

Cultural anti-Americanism in the Middle East, however, may have its origins with [[Sayyid Qutb]]. Qutb, an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] who was the leading intellectual of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], studied in [[Greeley, Colorado]] from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, ''The America I Have Seen'' (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts.&lt;ref&gt;David Von Drehle, [http://web.archive.org/web/20070822102733/http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2006/february/presence.php A Lesson In Hate] ''Smithsonian Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; Wrote Qutb, &quot;They danced to the tunes of the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire...&quot;&lt;ref name=Siegel2003-05-06&gt;Siegel, Robert [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1253796 Sayyid Qutb's America], NPR, ''All Things Considered'', 6 May 2003. Retrieved 29 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: &quot;The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Siegel2003-05-06 /&gt; He was particularly disturbed by [[jazz]], which he called the American's preferred music, and which &quot;was created by [[Negro]]es to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Amrika allati Ra'aytu'' (The America that I Have Seen) quoted on Calvert (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as a cultural temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially with respect to the relations between the sexes. As [[Paul Hollander]] has written: &quot;The most obvious and clear link between anti-Americanism and modernization is encountered in Islamic countries and other traditional societies where modernization clashes head on with entrenched traditional beliefs, institutions, and patterns of behavior, and where it challenges the very meaning of life, social relations, and religious verities. What becomes of the world when women can go to work and show large surfaces of skin to men they are not related to? In a recent case, the indignant male members of a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] family in Sweden were 'provoked' by the transgressing female of their family who had the temerity to have a job and a boyfriend and dress in Western ways. She was finally killed by her father.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hollander2007/&gt;

Hollander went on to explain:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In Arab countries and among Muslim populations, anti-Americanism is not only the monopoly of intellectuals but also a widespread disposition of the masses. In these areas, traditional religion, radical politics, and economic backwardness combine to make anti-Americanism an exceptionally widespread, virulent, and reflexive response to a wide range of collective and personal frustrations and grievances-and a welcome alternative to any collective or individual self-examination or stock-taking.

More generally, it is the rise of alternatives, ushered in by modernization, that threatens traditional societies and generates anti-American reaction. The stability of traditional society (like that of modern totalitarian systems) rests on the lack of alternatives, on the lack of choice. Choice is deeply subversive-culturally, politically, psychologically.

The recent outburst of murderous anti-Americanism has added a new dimension to the phenomenon, or at any rate, throws into relief the intense hatred it may encapsulate. The violence of 11 September shows that when anti-Americanism is nurtured by the kind of indignation and resentment that in [turn] is stimulated and sanctioned by religious convictions, it can become spectacularly destructive.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hollander2007 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Qutb's ideas influenced [[Osama Bin Laden]], an anti-American Islamic militant from Saudi Arabia, who was believed to be the founder of the [[Jihadi]]st organization [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Scheuer, ''Through Our Enemies' Eyes'', p.110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Bari Atman (2007) ''The Secret History of Al-Qa'ida''. London: Abacus: 34-5, 65–7&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with several other Islamic militant leaders, bin Laden issued two [[fatwa|fatawa]] – [[Fatāwā of Osama bin Laden|in 1996 and then again in 1998]] – that Muslims should kill [[combatant|military personnel]] from the United States until they withdraw military forces from [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]] and withdraw support for Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |title=Bin Laden'S Fatwa |publisher=Pbs.org |date=20 August 1998 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html|title=Online NewsHour: Al Qaeda's 1998 Fatwa|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=21 August 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060901093550/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html| archivedate= 1 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1996 fatwa, entitled &quot;Declaration of War against the  Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places&quot;, bin Laden was put on a criminal file by the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) under an [[American Civil War]] statute which forbids instigating violence and attempting to overthrow the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Wright (2007) ''The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda's Road to 9/11''.

In 2002 and in mid-2004 [[Zogby International]] polled the favorable/unfavorable ratings of the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Zogby's 2002 survey, 76% of Egyptians had a negative attitude toward the United States, compared with 98% in 2004. In Morocco, 61% viewed the country unfavorably in 2002, but in two years, that number had jumped to 88 percent. In Saudi Arabia, such responses rose from 87% in 2002 to 94% in 2004. Attitudes were virtually unchanged in Lebanon but improved slightly in the UAE, from 87% who said in 2002 that they disliked the United States to 73% in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zogby&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7080-2004Jul22.html|title=Poll Shows Growing Arab Rancor at U.S|first=Dafna|last=Linzer| month=23 July|year=2004 |work=The Washington Post|page=A26|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most of these countries mainly objected to foreign policies that they considered unfair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zogby&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Yankee go home.jpg|thumb|250px|Banner expressing anti-American sentiments in [[Stockholm]], Sweden in 2006.]]
In a 2003 article, historian David Ellwood identified what he called three great roots of anti-Americanism:
*Representations, images and stereotypes (from the birth of the Republic onwards)
*The challenge of economic power and the American model of modernization (principally from the 1910s and 1920s on)
*The organized projection of U.S. political, strategic and ideological power (from World War II on)
He went on to say that expressions of the phenomenon in the last 60 years have contained ever-changing combinations of these elements, the configurations depending on internal crises within the groups or societies articulating them as much as anything done by American society in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/1426.html |title=Anti-Americanism: Why Do Europeans Resent Us? |author=David Ellwood  |publisher=George Mason university : History News Network |date=5 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Sergio Fabbrini wrote that the perceived post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] unilateralism of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] fed deep rooted anti-American feeling in Europe, bringing it to the surface. In his article, he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy, culture and political process of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fabbrini |first=Sergio |title=Layers of Anti-Americanism: Americanization, American Unilateralism and Anti-Americanism in a European Perspective |journal=European Journal of American Culture |year=2004 |month=September |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=79–94 |doi=10.1386/ejac.23.2.79/0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fabbrini in 2011 identified a cycle in anti-Americanism: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003 and 2008, then declined after 2008.

In her contribution to the seminal book ''Anti-Americanisms in World Politics'' edited by Peter Katzenstein and Robert Keohane in 2006, [[Sophie Meunier]] writes about French anti-Americanism. She contends that although it has a long history (older than the U.S. itself) and is the most easily recognizable anti-Americanism in Europe, it may not have had real policy consequences on the United States and thus may have been less damaging than more pernicious and invisible anti-Americanism in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cup_detail.taf?ti_id=4604 Book Review: Anti-Americanisms in world politics], Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[George W. Bush]] administration, public opinion of America declined in most European countries. A Pew Global Attitudes Project poll showed &quot;favourable opinions&quot; of America between 2000 and 2006 dropping from 83% to 56% in the United Kingdom, from 62% to 39% in France, from 78% to 37% in Germany and from 50% to 23% in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=====China=====
[[File:Anti-American Protests Liu Kai b3.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Anti-American protests in Beijing, 1999]]
In China, there has been a history of anti-Americanism, beginning with the general disdain for foreigners in the early 19th century that culminated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1900. 

When [[Mao Zedong]] and the Communists came to power in 1948, he launched an anti-American campaign that intensified as China and the U.S. fought a major [[proxy war]] in [[Korea War|Korea, 1950–53]]. One of Mao's goals was to identify and destroy factions inside China that might be favorable to [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Guang Qiu Xu, &quot;U.S. Air Aid and the CCP's Anti-American Campaign, 1945–1949,&quot; ''Air Power History'' (2000) 47#1 pp. 24–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Sheng, &quot;Chinese Communist Policy Toward the United States and the Myth of the 'Lost Chance,' 1948–1950,&quot; ''Modern Asian Studies'' 28 (1994); Chen Jian, ''China's Road to the Korean War: The Making of the Sino-American Confrontation'' (Columbia University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao never intended on friendly relations with the U.S., Sheng argues.&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Sheng, ''Battling Western Imperialism: Mao, Stalin, and the United States'' (Princeton University Press, 1997) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; Mao ridiculed the U.S. as a &quot;paper tiger,&quot; occupiers of Taiwan, &quot;the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself&quot; and &quot;monopoly capitalist groups.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mao Tse Tung |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch06.htm |title=Quotations from Mao Tse Tung – Chapter 6 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Mao's death and the Chinese economic reforms of the 1980s，hostility diminished sharply, and large-scale trade and investments, as well as cultural exchanges became major factors. 

The [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|Taiwanese Strait Crisis]] has led China to blame the U.S. for any issues that arise in the bilateral relationship between China and Taiwan, as they believe that American support of Taiwan is an effort to weaken their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ma, Ying |title=China's America Problem |journal title=Policy Review|date=February, March 2002|page numbers=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, in 2009, [[Luo Ping]] criticized America's laissez-faire capitalism and said that he hated America when the [[United States Treasury]] would start to print money and depreciate the value of the US dollar, thus cheapening the value of China's purchase of U.S. bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sender |first=Henny |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ba857be6-f88f-11dd-aae8-000077b07658.html#axzz1ET01xP6U |title=China to stick with US bonds |work=Financial Times  |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese hackers have also conducted extensive [[cyberwarfare]] against American institutions and citizens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Menn |first=Joseph |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a4b497a-34b4-11e0-9ebc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1ET01xP6U |title=Chinese hackers hit energy groups |work=Financial Times  |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/computersecurity/hacking/2007-03-11-chinese-hackers-us-defense_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Jon | last=Swartz | title=Chinese hackers seek U.S. access | date=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;{{Registration required|date=December 2010}} {{Cite news |author=Shane, Scott; Lehren, Andrew W. |title=Cables Shine Light Into Secret Diplomatic Channels|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29cables.html |work=The New York Times |date=28 November 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101129062533/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29cables.html| archivedate= 29 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;/&gt; targeting the U.S. and its Western allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi King Urged U.S. To Attack Iran: WikiLeaks|first=Ross |last=Colvin |agency=Reuters |date=28 November 2010|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AP06Z20101128 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/06/wikileaks_chinese_hacking/&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, China's leaders present their country as an alternative to the meddling power of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kurlantzick23jun23,0,6663104.story?coll=la-opinion-center | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Joshua | last=Kurlantzick | title=China's charm offensive | date=23 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Japan=====
In Japan, objections to the behavior and presence of American military personnel are sometimes reported as anti-Americanism, such as the [[1995 Okinawan rape incident]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNOkinawa&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9510/okinawa_protest/index.html|title=Thousands rally against U.S. bases in Okinawa|accessdate=11 April 2008 |publisher=CNN |date=21 October 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iht.com/articles/2002/08/01/kor_ed1_.php |title=Road deaths ignite Korean anti-Americanism|accessdate=11 April 2008 |work=International Herald Tribune |date=1 August 2002}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing U.S. military presence in [[Okinawa]] remains a contentious issue in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/27/rice/|title=Rice soothes Japan on rape case |accessdate=13 March 2008 |publisher=CNN |date=27 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While protests have arisen over specific incidents, they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments. Robert Hathaway, director of the Wilson Center's Asia program, suggests: &quot;The growth of anti-American sentiment in both Japan and South Korea must be seen not simply as a response to American policies and actions, but as reflective of deeper domestic trends and developments within these Asian countries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonProgram&quot;&gt;{{Cite document

=====South Korea=====
{{See also|Anti-American sentiment in Korea}}
Speaking to the Wilson Center, Katherine Moon notes that while the majority of South Koreans support the American alliance &quot;anti-Americanism also represents the collective venting of accumulated grievances that in many instances have lain hidden for decades.&quot;&lt;ref name=WilsonProgram/&gt; In the 1990s, scholars, policy makers, and the media noted that anti-Americanism was motivated by the rejection of authoritarianism and a resurgent nationalism, this nationalist Anti-Americanism continued into the 2000s fuelled by a number of incidents such as the ‘IMF’ crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Korea's democratisation, Ed Samuel S. Kim, Cambridge university press 2003, Page 135 and 136&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Fucking USA]]&quot; is an anti-American [[protest song]] written by South Korean singer and activist Yoon Min-suk. Strongly anti-US foreign policy and anti-Bush, the song was written in 2002 at a time when, following the [[Apolo Ohno]] Olympic controversy and an incident in which two Korean middle school students were killed under the wheels of a U.S. Army vehicle, anti-American sentiment in South Korea reached high levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2010/02/20/ohno-reviled-athlete-south-korea/ Ohno Becomes Most Reviled Athlete in South Korea], Fox News, 20 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2009, a majority of South Koreans were reported as having a favorable view of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/database/?indicator=1 Opinion of the United States : 2010], Pew Global Attitudes Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]]'s tour of South America in 1958 prompted a spectacular eruption of anti-Americanism.

Anti-Americanism in [[Canada]] has unique historic roots.  When the [[Continental Congress]] was called in 1774, an invitation was sent to [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]] (then known as [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]) and [[Nova Scotia]].  However Canadians expressed little interest in joining the Congress, and the following year the American army invaded Canada, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]].  Although the American [[Articles of Confederation]] later pre-approved Canada as a U.S. state, public opinion had turned against them.  Soon 40,000 [[United Empire Loyalists|loyalist refugees]] arrived from the United States, including 2,000 [[Black Loyalists]], many of whom had fought for [[the Crown]] against the American Revolution.  To them, the republic they left behind was violent and anarchic, [[plutocracy|ruled by money]] and [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Nossal, Kim Richard, &quot;Anti-Americanism in Canada&quot;, ''Anti-Americanism: comparative perspectives (2007), ed. Brendon O'Connor, pp. 62–66&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-British imperialists repeatedly warned against American-style republicanism and democracy as little more than mob rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sara Jeannette Duncan|author2=Misao Dean|title=The Imperialist|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=54osezQz_eQC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Broadview Press|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Americanism, as a political tactic, was sometimes used by the Conservatives to attack the supposed Liberal Party affinity for Americans, as in [[Canadian federal election, 1911|the 1911 elections.]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Johnston and Michael B. Percy. &quot;Reciprocity, Imperial Sentiment, and Party Politics in the 1911 Election,&quot; ''Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique'' (1980) 13#4 pp. 711–729 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3230240 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-Americanism thus remained a fixture in Canadian partisan politics, as employed by such leaders as prime minister [[John G. Diefenbaker]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Granatstein. ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997) pp. 121–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian intellectuals, who wrote about the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century, identified America as the world center of modernity, and deplored it. Imperialists (who admired the British Empire) explained that Canadians had narrowly escaped American conquest with its rejection of tradition, its worship of &quot;progress&quot; and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and societal harmony.  There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as [[F. R. Scott]] and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891–1967).&lt;ref&gt;Damien-Claude Bélanger, ''Prejudice and Pride: Canadian Intellectuals Confront the United States, 1891–1945'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 16, 180&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brendon O'Connor &amp; Martin Griffiths state in their book ''Anti-Americanism'' that they would at first glance think that Canadians seem as likely as others to embrace characteristics that are characterised as anti-American. O'Conner and Griffiths include such actions as criticising Americans as a people, or the US as a country as being anti-American often demonising, denigrating and resorting to stereotypes.  They have also written that the Anti-Americanism found in Canada had unique qualities, nowhere else has it been so entrenched for so long, nor so central to the political culture as in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brendon O'Connor 2007 http://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&amp;pg=PA71 71&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendon O'Connor|title=Anti-Americanism: Comparative perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84645-026-6|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&amp;pg=PA71 71]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian historian [[Kim Richard Nossal]] thinks that a low level attenuated form of anti-Americanism permeates Canadian political culture, though &quot;designed primarily as a means to differentiate Canadians from Americans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brendon O'Connor 2007 http://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&amp;pg=PA71 71&quot;/&gt; Although J.L Granatstien has suggested that Anti-Americanism was dead in Canada, John Herd Thompson and Stephen J. Randall in their book ''Canada and the United States'' (2002) states that there is anecdotal evidence that it still flourishes, and that it continues to nourish the Canadian sense of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Herd Thompson|author2=Stephen J.
