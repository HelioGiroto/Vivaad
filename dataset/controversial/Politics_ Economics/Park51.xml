'''Park51''' (originally named '''Cordoba House''') is a planned 13-story [[Islamic]] [[community center]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. The majority of the center will be open to the general public and its proponents have said the center will promote [[interfaith dialog]]ue. Plans for the center include a Muslim prayer space which, due to its location two blocks from the [[World Trade Center site]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot;/&gt; has controversially&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38730223/ns/msnbc_tv-countdown_with_keith_olbermann/ &quot;Olbermann: There is no 'Ground Zero Mosque{{'&quot;}}] MSNBC's Keith Olbermann questions Americä's religious tolerance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anushay-hossain/park-51-the-ground-zero-m_b_686950.html &quot;The Ground Zero 'mosque' is not a mosque&quot;]. ''The Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; been referred to as the &quot;Ground Zero mosque&quot;, though numerous commentators argued that it was neither a [[mosque]] nor at Ground Zero.

It would replace an existing 1850s building of [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style of architecture]] that was being used as a [[Burlington Coat Factory]] before it was damaged in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The proposed multi-faith aspects of the design include a 500-seat auditorium, theater, a [[performing arts center]], a [[fitness center]], a swimming pool, a basketball court, a childcare area, a bookstore, a [[culinary school]], an art studio, a food court, and a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The prayer space for the Muslim community will accommodate 1,000–2,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;park51facilities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.park51.org/?page_id=23|title=Proposed Facilities for the Community Center at Park51|home=Blog.Park51.org|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming of the project==
[[File:Park51 location map.png|thumb|The proposed location of Park51 is indicated by a red dot.]]
The project was originally called Cordoba House, then renamed Park51, in reference to the street address on Park Place. Later, the Imam leading the project introduced some ambiguity by again referring to the project as &quot;Cordoba House&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes7&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/opinion/08mosque.html|title= Building on Faith|author= Feisal Abdul Rauf|work=The New York Times|date=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Park51 website then clarified that Park51 is the community center, while Cordoba House is the &quot;interfaith and religious component of the center&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Park51 Issues a Statement Regarding the Name of the Planned Muslim Community Center Being Built in Lower Manhattan|url=http://blog.park51.org/?p=129|home=Park51.org|accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amira1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Amira |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/ground_zero_mosque_gets_lets_m.html |title=Ground Zero Mosque Gets Less Muslim-Invasion-Sounding Name |work=New York|date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wcbstv1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/ground.zero.mosque.2.1837909.html |title=Commission Expected to OK Ground Zero Mosque |publisher=WCBS TV|date= |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordobainitiative.org|title=Cordoba Initiative|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the media widely described the center as a mosque, and the protests were against the mosque, the Initiative's official blog portrayed it as a community center with prayer space, making comparisons to the [[YMCA]] or [[Jewish Community Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Community Center |url=http://cordobainitiative.wordpress.com/2010/07/01/what-is-a-community-center/ |homer=CordobaInitiative.org |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative said that some services planned for Park51 such as the restaurant and performance center, disqualify it from being a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Prayer Space?|url=http://cordobainitiative.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/what-is-prayer-space/|home=CordobaInitiative.org|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daisy Khan, Imam Rauf's wife and partner, in August 2010 also said:

The board's chairwoman, [[Julie Menin]], supported deletion of references to the building as a mosque and interfaith center that were in an earlier draft of the resolution, saying: &quot;I personally was uncomfortable with the language that talked about the religious institution.

One obstacle to construction was the potential conferment of landmark status on the building. It had been constructed between 1857 and 1858, in the [[Italian Renaissance]] [[palazzo]] style.&lt;ref name=poll/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;observer1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boston1&quot;/&gt;

On August 3, 2010, New York City's [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] voted 9–0 against granting landmark status and historic protection to the building.

On July 10, 2011, Justice Paul G.

==Controversy==
{{main|Park51 controversy}}
Opponents of the Park51 project argued that it is &quot;a mosque&quot; and have that establishing a mosque &quot;so close&quot; to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] would be offensive since the hijackers in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] were [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]].

Project supporters have argued that the Park51 building would not be visible from the World Trade Center site,&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorker-16Aug&quot;/&gt; that some victims and victims' families are in favor of the Park51 project, and that some victims were also Muslims.

''Newsweek'' quotes a [[Taliban]] operative as explicitly connecting increased opposition to the mosque with increased support for the Taliban's cause. &quot;By preventing this mosque from being built, America is doing us a big favor,&quot; the Taliban operative stated. &quot;It's providing us with more recruits, donations, and popular support.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sami Yousafzai and Ron Moreau |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/30/taliban-using-mosque-controversy-to-recruit.html |title=The Taliban vs. the Mosque |work=Newsweek |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] does not directly oppose the building of a mosque near ground zero but says that the sentiments of non-Muslims should not be unduly hurt. They state that there are other places where mosques can be built and they do not see why that particular location has been chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;movemosque&quot;/&gt;

===Opposition===

A CNN poll conducted August 6–10 found that two out of three Americans – including four out of five Republicans – opposed the Park51 project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/08/poll-nearly-70-of-americans-op.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=CNN Poll: Nearly 70% Of Americans Oppose NYC Mosque Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/11/overwhelming-majority-oppose-mosque-near-ground-zero/ | publisher=CNN | title=Overwhelming majority oppose mosque near Ground Zero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks said they found the proposal offensive because the perpetrators who committed the attacks did so in the name of Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/06/2010-05-06_plan_for_mosque_near_world_trade_center_site_moves_ahead.html |title=Plan for mosque near World Trade Center site moves ahead |author=Joe Jackson and Bill Hutchinson |work=Daily News|location=New York|date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of victims' relatives, 9/11 Families for a Safe &amp; Strong America, called the proposal &quot;a gross insult to the memory of those who were killed on that terrible day&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boston2&quot;/&gt; 

A number of American politicians spoke out against the Park51 project, such as [[John McCain]], [[Sarah Palin]], and [[Mitt Romney]]. Former House Speaker Republican [[Newt Gingrich]] said: &quot;It's not about religion and is clearly an aggressive act that is offensive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes4&quot;/&gt;
Commenting on the project's initial proposed name, he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Cordoba House&quot; is a deliberately insulting term. It refers to Cordoba, Spain – the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|capital of Muslim conquerors]], who symbolized their victory over the Christian Spaniards by transforming a church there into the [[Great Mosque of Córdoba|world's third-largest mosque complex]]... every Islamist in the world recognizes Cordoba as a symbol of Islamic conquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/07/29/james-pinkerton-world-trade-centre-arizona-alqaeda-wikileaks-ground-zero-mosque/ |title=America Needs Willpower – And the Right Leaders |publisher=Fox News |author=James P.

Former New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] called it a &quot;desecration; Nobody would allow something like that at Pearl Harbor ... Let's have some respect for who died there and why they died there.&quot;)

Paul Sipos, a member of NYC Community Board 1, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;If the Japanese decided to open a cultural center across from [[Pearl Harbor]], that would be insensitive. If the Germans opened a Bach choral society across from [[Auschwitz]], even after all these years, that would be an insensitive setting. I have absolutely nothing against Islam. I just think: Why there?&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldsun1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Democratic Independent Connecticut Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] indicated that he felt the project should be halted, pending further evaluation of its impact on the families and friends of 9/11 victims, project's sponsors' intentions, and their sources of funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt;

Senate Majority Leader Democrat [[Harry Reid]] of Nevada said &quot;it is time to bring people together, not a time for polarization and I think it would be better off for everyone if it were built somewhere else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|home=YouTube|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cfVWxZ4eGU |title=Harry Reid Discusses Ground Zero Mosque Issue |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Manley, a spokesperson for Reid earlier said, &quot;The First Amendment protects freedom of religion...

More than 20,000 people signed an online petition for the Committee to Stop the Ground Zero Mosque, and unsuccessfully lobbied the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission to give the location landmark status, which would have added a major hurdle to construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;chron1&quot;/&gt;

[[Zuhdi Jasser]], President of the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]], called for transparency in the funding of the project, suggesting foreign sources could imply an ulterior agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews2&quot;/&gt; Reza Aslan said that it would be acceptable to demand that mosques be transparent about funding if the same was also demanded of a Catholic church or a Jewish temple.&lt;ref name=CNN_debate/&gt;

===Support===
A [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll of New York State residents released August 31, 2010 found a 54–40 percent majority of voters agreeing &quot;that because of American freedom of religion, Muslims have the right to build the mosque near Ground Zero&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;quinn&quot;/&gt;

Some relatives of victims of the 9/11 attacks expressed support for the project.
Colleen Kelley, who lost her brother William on 9/11, says, the &quot;irony in the debate over the section of the building that would house a mosque is that one might assume that God (the same God to Jews-Christians-Muslims) would be pleased with any type of effort that involves prayer and service to others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citylimits.org/conversations/111/mosque-debate-religious-intolerance |title=Not All 9-11 Families Oppose The Mosque | date=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marvin Bethea, a former EMS worker who was forced to retire in 2004 because of breathing problems caused by working at the 9/11 site, believes racism is a factor in the controversy, He said &quot;even though my life has changed, I don't hate the Muslims. Especially being a black man, I know what it's like to be discriminated against. I've lived with that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aolnews1&quot; /&gt;

The anti-war group [[September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows]], released a statement in support of the center, saying &quot;we believe that welcoming the Center, which is intended to promote interfaith tolerance and respect, is consistent with fundamental American values of freedom and justice for all,&quot; adding it will be &quot;an emblem for the rest of the world that Americans stand against violence, intolerance, and overt acts of racism and that we recognize that the evil acts of a few must never damn the innocent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boston3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacefultomorrows.org/article.php?id=977 |title=9/11 Families Group Announces Support for Islamic Cultural Center in Lower Manhattan|date=May 20, 2010|home=[[September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows]]|accessdate=May 20, 2010|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] acknowledged the right of Muslims to build the Islamic center. Obama said, &quot;Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country. And that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Gilgoff |publisher=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/08/13/obama.islamic.center.support/index.html#fbid=qlMj9FlaYim&amp;wom=false |title=Obama throws support behind controversial Islamic center |date=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/politics/2012618969_apusobamamosquetext.html |title=Obama's comments on mosque plans near ground zero |work=Seattle Times|date=August 13, 2010 |agency=AP|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] strongly endorsed the project, saying that Ground Zero was a &quot;very appropriate place&quot; for a mosque, because it &quot;tells the world&quot; that the U.S. has freedom of religion for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dorothy Rabinowitz |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703545604575407160266158170.html |title=Liberal Piety and the Memory of 9/11; The enlightened class can't understand why the public is uneasy about the Ground Zero mosque |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to opposition, he said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The government should never, never be in the business of telling people how they should pray, or where they can pray. We want to make sure that everybody from around the world feels comfortable coming here, living here, and praying the way they want to pray.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-2010-07-13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chron1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additional New York politicians supported the proposal. They included [[Manhattan Borough President]] [[Scott Stringer]] (&quot;I'll do everything I can to make sure this mosque does get opened&quot;), U.S. Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] (&quot;the government has no business deciding&quot;), NY State Senator [[Daniel Squadron]], NYC Comptroller [[John Liu]], NYC Council Speaker [[Christine Quinn]], and [[New York City Public Advocate|NYC Public Advocate]] [[Bill de Blasio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tribecatrib1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boston1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;montrealgazette1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adam Dickter |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/short_takes/mosque_wars_hit_new_york_governor's_race |title=Mosque Wars Hit New York Governor's Race |work=The Jewish Week |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Reich |url=http://www.salon.com/news/ground_zero_mosque/?story=/politics/war_room/2010/08/05/nadler_defends_the_mosque |title=Nadler: Attacks on mosque &quot;shameful and divisive&quot; – Ground Zero Mosque |work=Salon|date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2010/politics/de-blasio-currently-okay-mosque |title=De Blasio Is Currently Okay With the Mosque |author=Reid Pillifant |work=The New York Observer |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] gave his support to Park51, arguing that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] allows for a mosque to be built near Ground Zero. Ventura also argued that denying the right for a mosque to be built near Ground Zero would be similar to removing churches from [[Oklahoma City]], where the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] occurred (the deadliest act of terrorism in the United States prior to 9/11), if [[Timothy McVeigh]], the man who perpetrated the attack, was a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcripts|url=http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/15/cnr.08.html|publisher=www.cnn.com|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orrin Hatch]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Utah]], voiced support of the project on religious freedom grounds. Hatch is a Mormon and cited an instance where a neighborhood tried to prevent a [[Mormon temple]] from being built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/09/01/hatch_backs_muslims_on_planned_nyc_mosque/|title=Hatch backs Muslims on planned NYC mosque|work=The Boston Globe|date=September 1, 2010|accessdate=March 1, 2011|first=Lisa|last=Wangsness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[US President]] [[Bill Clinton]] also supported Park51, after noting that many Muslims were also killed on September 11. He suggested that the developers could have avoided controversy if they dedicated the center to the Muslim victims of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Clinton Endorses Muslim Center Near Ground Zero |url=http://dnainfo.com/20100921/downtown/bill-clinton-endorses-muslim-center-near-ground-zero |work=DNAinfo Beta |date=September 21, 2010 |author=Julie Shapiro |accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
