{{Sustainable energy}}
An '''electric car''' is an [[automobile]] that is [[ground propulsion|propelled]] by one [[electric motor]] or more, using electrical energy stored in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or another energy storage device. [[Electric motor]]s give electric cars instant torque, creating strong and smooth acceleration.

Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in [[internal combustion engine]] technology and [[mass production]] of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of [[electric drive vehicle]]s. The [[energy crises]] of the 1970s and '80s brought a short-lived interest in electric cars, though those cars did not reach mass marketing as today's electric cars experience it. Since the mid-2000s, the production of electric cars is experiencing a renaissance due to advances in battery and power management technologies and concerns about increasingly volatile [[2000s energy crisis|oil prices]] and the need to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B.

Electric cars have several benefits compared to conventional [[internal combustion engine]] automobiles, including a significant reduction of local [[air pollution]], as they have no tailpipe, and therefore do not emit harmful [[motor vehicle emissions|tailpipe pollutants]] from the onboard source of power at the point of operation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth2tech.com/2010/03/17/should-pollution-factor-into-electric-car-rollout-plans/ |title=Should Pollution Factor Into Electric Car Rollout Plans?|publisher=Earth2tech.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electroauto.com/info/pollmyth.shtml |title=Electro Automotive: FAQ on Electric Car Efficiency &amp; Pollution |publisher=Electroauto.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cleanairnet.org/baq2003/1496/articles-58076_resource_1.doc |first=Anil K. |last=Raut |title=Role of electric vehicles in reducing air pollution: a case of Katmandu, Nepal |publisher=The Clean Air Initiative |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from the onboard source of power, depending on the fuel and technology used for [[electricity generation]] to charge the batteries;&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt; and less dependence on foreign oil, which for the [[United States energy independence|United States]] and other [[developed countries|developed]] or [[emerging countries]] is cause for concern about vulnerability to oil price volatility and [[supply (economics)|supply]] [[Energy security|disruption]].&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinventing&gt;{{cite book|title=Reinventing the Automobile: Personal Urban Mobility for the 21st Century|last1=Mitchell |first1=William J. |last2=Borroni-Bird |first2=Christopher |last3=Burns |first3=Lawrence D. |year=2010|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0-262-01382-6|edition=1st.|url=http://ilp.mit.edu/webpubdetail.jsp?id=40|pages=85–95}} ''See Chapter 5: Clean Smart Energy Supply.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs1&gt;{{cite book|author=[[R.

Other factors discouraging the adoption of electric cars are the lack of public and private [[charging station|recharging infrastructure]] and  the driver's fear of the batteries running out of energy before reaching their destination ([[range anxiety]]) due to the limited range of existing electric cars. Several governments have established policies and economic incentives to overcome existing barriers, to promote the sales of electric cars, and to fund further development of electric vehicles, more cost-effective battery technology and their components. The U.S. has pledged {{USD|2.4 billion}} in federal grants for electric cars and batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2010/07/obama-pushes-electric-cars-battery-power-this-week-/1 |title=Obama pushes electric cars, battery power this week | work=USA Today | date=2010-07-14 |first=Chris |last=Woodyard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[People's Republic of China|China]] has announced it will provide {{USD|15 billion}} to initiate an electric car industry within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=24054|title=Freidman OpEd: China's 'Moon Shot' Versus America's}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several national and local governments have established [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles|tax credits, subsidies, and other incentives]] to reduce the net purchase price of electric cars and other [[plug-in electric vehicle|plug-ins]].&lt;ref name=JAMAFact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jama.org/pdf/FactSheet10-2009-09-24.pdf|title=Fact Sheet - Japanese Government Incentives for the Purchase of Environmentally Friendly Vehicles|publisher=[[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]]|accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT0610&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/china-to-start-pilot-program-providing-subsidies-for-electric-cars-and-hybrids/|title=China to Start Pilot Program, Providing Subsidies for Electric Cars and Hybrids|publisher=New York Times|date=2010-06-02|accessdate=2010-06-02 | first=Jim | last=Motavalli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC0420&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/04/acea-tax-20100421.html#more|title=Growing Number of EU Countries Levying CO2 Taxes on Cars and Incentivizing Plug-ins|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2010-04-21|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IRS2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/irb/2009-48_IRB/ar09.html|title=Notice 2009-89: New Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit|publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]]|date=2009-11-30|accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Electric cars are a variety of [[electric vehicle]] (EV); the term &quot;electric vehicle&quot; refers to any vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while &quot;electric car&quot; generally refers to road-going [[automobiles]] powered by electricity. While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric cars with motors powered by other energy sources are generally referred to by a different name: an electric car powered by sunlight is a [[solar car]], and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of [[hybrid car]]. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Most often, the term &quot;electric car&quot; is used to refer to battery electric vehicles.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-1126-500, Kraftdroschke.jpg|thumb|German electric car, 1904]]
{{Main|History of the electric vehicle}}
Electric cars enjoyed popularity between the mid-19th century and early 20th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for automobile propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Advances in [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] technology, especially the electric starter, soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles by companies such as the [[Ford Motor Company]], which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric propulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the [[United States]] by the 1930s.  However, in recent years, increased concerns over the [[Automobile#Environmental impact|environmental impact of gasoline cars]], higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery technology, and the prospect of [[peak oil]], have brought about renewed interest in electric cars, which are perceived to be more environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run, despite high initial costs, after a failed reappearance in the late 90s.

===1890s to 1900s: Early history===
Before the pre-eminence of [[internal combustion engines]], electric automobiles held many speed and distance records. Among the most notable of these records was the breaking of the {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} speed barrier, by [[Camille Jenatzy]] on April 29, 1899 in his 'rocket-shaped' vehicle [[Jamais Contente]], which reached a top speed of {{convert|105.88|km/h|abbr=on}}. Before the 1920s, electric automobiles were competing with petroleum-fueled cars for urban use of a quality service car.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;electric automobile.&quot; Encyclopaedia Britannica Online. N.p., n.d. Web. 5 Oct. 2009..&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed as early as 1896 in order to overcome the lack of recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable battery service was first put into practice by [[Hartford Electric Light Company]] for electric trucks. The vehicle owner purchased the vehicle from General Electric Company (GVC) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. The service was provided between 1910 to 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar service was operated in [[Chicago]] for owners of [[Milburn Wagon Company|Milburn Light Electric]] cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.&lt;ref name=HistEV&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kirsch|first=David A.|title=The Electric Vehicle and the Burden of History| year = 2000| pages= 153–162| publisher =Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2809-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:EdisonElectricCar1913.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Edison]] and a [[Detroit Electric]] car in 1913.]]
In 1897, electric vehicles found their first commercial application in the U.S. as a fleet of electrical New York City taxis, built by the Electric Carriage and Wagon Company of Philadelphia. Electric cars were produced in the US by Anthony Electric, [[Baker Motor Vehicle|Baker]], [[Columbia Automobile Company|Columbia]], [[Detroit Electric|Anderson]], [[Oliver Parker Fritchle#Fritchle Automobile &amp; Battery Company|Fritchle]], [[Studebaker Electric (automobile)|Studebaker]], [[Riker Electric Vehicle Company|Riker]], [[Milburn Wagon Company|Milburn]], and others during the early 20th century.

Despite their relatively slow speed, electric vehicles had a number of advantages over their early-1900s competitors. They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They did not require gear changes, which for gasoline cars was the most difficult part of driving. Electric cars found popularity among well-heeled customers who used them as [[city cars]], where their limited range was less of a disadvantage. The cars were also preferred because they did not require a manual effort to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand crank to start the engine. Electric cars were often marketed as suitable vehicles for women drivers due to this ease of operation.

In 1911, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the electric car has long been recognized as &quot;ideal&quot; because it was cleaner, quieter and much more economical than gasoline-powered cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electric Vehicles Attract Attention|accessdate=February 11, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 12, 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting this in 2010, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' commented that &quot;the same unreliability of electric car batteries that flummoxed Thomas Edison persists today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wp100425&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first=Robert | last=Bryce | title=5 Myths about green energy |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/23/AR2010042302220.html| work= | newspaper=Washington Post | pages= B4 | date=25 April 2010 | id=| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s to present: Revival of interest===
{{Main|History of the electric vehicle#1990s_to_present:_Revival_of_mass_interest|l1=History of the electric vehicle: Revival of mass interest}}
The [[energy crises]] of the 1970s and 80s brought about renewed interest in the perceived independence that electric cars had from the fluctuations of the hydrocarbon energy market. In the early 1990s, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s such as electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sperling, Daniel and Deborah Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year =2009| pages=22–26|publisher =[[Oxford University Press]], New York| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boschert06&gt;{{Cite book | last = [[Sherry Boschert]] | title = Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America | year = 2006 | pages=15–28| publisher = New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada| isbn = 978-0-86571-571-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, automakers developed electric models, including the [[Chrysler TEVan]], [[Ford Ranger EV]] pickup truck, [[GM EV1]] and [[Chevrolet S10 EV|S10 EV]] pickup, [[Honda EV Plus]] hatchback, Nissan lithium-battery [[Nissan Altra|Altra EV]] miniwagon and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]].  These cars were eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First Customer owned Nissan Leaf.jpg|thumb|left|First [[Nissan Leaf]] delivered in the U.S. on the road south of [[San Francisco]]]]
The [[Late-2000s recession|global economic recession in the late 2000s]] led to increased calls for automakers to abandon fuel-inefficient SUVs, which were seen as a symbol of the excess that caused the recession, in favor of small cars, hybrid cars, and electric cars.

==Comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles==
An important goal for electric vehicles is overcoming the disparity between their costs of development, production, and operation, with respect to those of equivalent [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion engine vehicles]] (ICEVs).

===Price===
[[File:Mitsubishi Electric Car.jpg|thumb|right|Sales of the [[Mitsubishi i MiEV]] to the public began in [[Japan]] in April 2010, in [[Hong Kong]] in May 2010 and in [[Australia]] in July 2010.]]
The purchase price of electric cars is significantly more expensive than conventional [[internal combustion engine]] cars, even after considering [[government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles]] available in several countries. The primary reason is the high cost of car [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/66529/20100928/electric-cars-study-chevrolet-volt-nissan-leaf-energy-renewable-energy.htm| title=Reduced CO2 Emissions Should Start With Electric Cars}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high purchase price is hindering the mass transition from [[Internal combustion engine|gasoline cars]] to electric cars. According to a survey taken by [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]] for the [[Financial Times]] in 2010, around three quarters of American and British car buyers have or would consider buying an electric car, but they are unwilling to pay more for an electric car. The survey showed that 65% of Americans and 76% of Britons are not willing to pay more for an electric car above the price of a conventional car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/acc0a646-c405-11df-b827-00144feab49a.html | title=Buyers loath to pay more for electric cars|author=John Reed|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=2010-09-19|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a 2010 report by [[J.D. Power and Associates]] states that it is not entirely clear to consumers the [[total cost of ownership]] of battery electric vehicles over the life of the vehicle, and &quot;''there is still much confusion about how long one would have to own such a vehicle to realize cost savings on fuel, compared with a vehicle powered by a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE). The resale value of HEVs and BEVs, as well as the cost of replacing depleted battery packs, are other financial considerations that weigh heavily on consumers’ minds''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://businesscenter.jdpower.com/news/pressrelease.aspx?ID=2010213|author=[[J.D.

The electric car company [[Tesla Motors]] is using [[battery (electricity)|laptop battery technology]] for the battery packs of their electric cars that are 3 to 4 times cheaper than dedicated electric car battery packs that other auto makers are using. While dedicated battery packs cost $700–$800 per kilowatt hour, battery packs using small laptop cells cost about $200. That could potentially drive down the cost of electric cars that are using Tesla's battery technology such as the [[Toyota RAV4 EV]] and the [[Smart ED]] as well as their own upcoming 2014 models such as the [[Tesla Model X|Model X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70A4QY20110111 | title=Toyota sees Tesla EV battery cost at 1/3 | date=2011-01-11 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-12-08/toyota-adopts-tesla-laptop-strategy-for-electric-cars.html | title=Toyota Adopts Tesla Laptop Strategy for Electric Cars | date=2010-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/12/30/report-tesla-model-s-will-be-profitable-thanks-to-cheaper-batte/ | title=Tesla says Model S will be profitable thanks to cheaper batteries }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012|06}}, and based on the three battery size options offered for the [[Tesla Model S]], the [[New York Times]] estimated the cost of automotive battery packs between {{USD|400}} to {{USD|500}} per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/tesla-model-s-offers-a-lesson-in-electric-vehicle-economics/?ref=automobiles|title=Tesla Model S Offers a Lesson in Electric-Vehicle Economics|author=Paul Stenquist|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-06-25|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2011 by the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs|Belfer Center]], [[Harvard University]], found that the gasoline costs savings of [[plug-in electric car]]s over the vehicles’ lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase prices. This finding was estimated comparing their lifetime [[net present value]] at 2010 purchase and operating costs for the U.S. market, and assuming no [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#United States|government subidies]].&lt;ref name=KSG11/&gt;&lt;ref name=KSGpdf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/Lee%20Lovellette%20Electric%20Vehicles%20DP%202011%20web.pdf|

The study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years, assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase. Under the future scenarios considered, the study found that BEVs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars ({{USD|1,155}} to {{USD|7,181}} cheaper), while PHEVs, will be more expensive than BEVs in almost all comparison scenarios, and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices. Savings differ because BEVs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel, while PHEVs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines.&lt;ref name=KSG11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/21216/will_electric_cars_transform_the_us_vehicle_market.html?hq_e=el&amp;hq_m=1303999&amp;hq_l=5&amp;hq_v=4613decb42|title=Will Electric Cars Transform the U.S. Vehicle Market?|author= Henry Lee and Grant Lovellette|publisher=[[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]], [[Kennedy School of Government]]|month=July|year=2011|accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Running costs and maintenance===
[[File:Roadster Goodwood.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Tesla Roadster]], launched in 2008, has a [[all-electric range|range]] of {{convert|244|mi|abbr=on}} and ended production in 2011.]]
Most of the running cost of an electric vehicle can be attributed to the maintenance of the battery pack, and its eventual replacement, because an electric vehicle has only around 5 moving parts in its motor, compared to a gasoline car that has hundreds of parts in its [[internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= THINK's CEO Richard Canny|url=http://www.thinkev.com/Press/Press-releases/THINK-marks-Earth-Day-2010-with-the-release-of-CEO-Richard-Canny-s-Top-10-myths-about-electric-vehicles-busted! |title=Top 10 myths about electric vehicles&amp;nbsp;— busted!}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric cars have expensive batteries that must be replaced but otherwise incur very low maintenance costs, particularly in the case of current lithium-based designs.

To calculate the cost per kilometer of an electric vehicle it is therefore necessary to assign a monetary value to the wear incurred on the battery. This can be difficult because the battery will have a slightly lower capacity each time it is charged; it is at the end of its life when the owner decides its performance is no longer acceptable. Even then an 'end of life' battery is not completely worthless as it can be re-purposed, recycled or used as a spare.

Since a battery is made of many individual cells that do not necessarily wear evenly, periodically replacing the worst of them can retain the vehicle's range.

The Tesla Roadster's very large battery pack is expected to last seven years with typical driving and costs {{USD|12000}} when pre-purchased today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=09:56 PM |url=http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/faq.php#batterycost |title=Tesla Motors Club Forum - FAQ |publisher=Teslamotorsclub.com |date=2007-06-23|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/01/17/tesla-offers-laundry-list-of-new-options-12k-prepaid-battery-r/ |title=Tesla offers laundry list of new options, $12k prepaid battery replacement |publisher=Green.autoblog.com |date=2009-01-17 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driving {{convert|40|mi|km}} per day for seven years or {{convert|102200|mi|km}} leads to a battery consumption cost of {{USD|0.1174}} per {{convert|1|mi|km}} or {{USD|4.70}} per {{convert|40|mi|km}}.

|quote      = See we're bound by today's technology on batteries, which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within reasonable space and weight limitations. 120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people. But you never want to get stuck. So what we added as a second element to our network is a battery swap system. You drive. You take your depleted battery out. A full battery comes on. And you drive on. You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine. It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash. And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in. Within two minutes you're back on the road. And you can go again. If you had charge spots everywhere, and you had battery swap stations everywhere, how often would you do it? And it ends up that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station. As a matter of fact, we add it to the contract. We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year we start paying you money because it's an inconvenience.

===Range and refueling time===
Most cars with internal combustion engines can be considered to have indefinite range, as they can be refueled very quickly almost anywhere.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
Electric cars often have less maximum range on one charge than cars powered by fossil fuels, and they can take considerable time to recharge. This is a reason that many automakers marketed EVs as &quot;daily drivers&quot; suitable for city trips and other short hauls.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The average American drives less than {{convert|40|mi}} per day; so the [[GM EV1]] would have been adequate for the daily driving needs of about 90% of U.S. consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;wctec&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s2798who.html |publisher=dvdtalk.com|title=DVD Savant Review:Who Killed the Electric Car? |date=10 January 2009|last=Erickson |first=Glenn|accessdate=17 November 2009}} See main article [[Who killed the electric car]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, people can be concerned that they would run out of energy from their battery before reaching their destination, a worry known as [[range anxiety]].

The [[Tesla Roadster]] can travel {{convert|245|mi}} per charge;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/roadster/specs |title=Roadster / features and specs}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than double that of prototypes and [[evaluation]] [[fleet vehicle|fleet car]]s currently on the roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=23236 |title=EV WORLDwire: Tesla Receives First Panasonic Lithium-ion Batteries |publisher=Evworld.com |date=|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roadster can be fully recharged in about 3.5 hours from a 220-volt, 70-[[Ampere|amp]] outlet which can be installed in a home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/tesla-roadster.htm | title=How the Tesla Roadster Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way [[automakers]] can extend the short range of electric vehicles is by building them with [[Battery exchange station#Battery swapping|battery switch technology]]. An EV with battery switch technology and a {{convert|100|mi}} driving range will be able to go to a [[Battery exchange station#Battery swapping|battery switch station]] and switch a depleted battery with a fully charged one in 59.1 seconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2010/08/27/better-place-expands-tokyo-battery-swap-trials-taxis-have-chang/ | title=Tokyo battery swap trials}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the EV an additional {{convert|100|mi}} driving range. The process is cleaner and faster than filling a tank with gasoline and the driver remains in the car the entire time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betterplace.com/the-solution-switch-stations | title=Better Place, battery switch stations}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because of the high investment cost, its economics are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.green-and-energy.com/blog/is-there-really-a-need-for-infrastructure/ | title=Is there really a need for a charging Infrastructure?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2010 there were only 2 companies with plans to integrate battery switching technology to their electric vehicles: [[Better Place]] and [[Tesla Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betterplace.com/the-solution |title=Better Place, the solution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/18/idUS245189596520110318 | title=Tesla’s Model S Battery Is Swappable, Just in Case | accessdate=2011-03-18 | work=Reuters | date=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20090327/CARNEWS/903279971 | title=Tesla Model S customers will be able to swap batteries at Tesla dealerships with the possibility to rent 300 mile batteries for longer trips.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Better Place]] operated a battery-switch station in Japan until November 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betterplace.com/the-company-pressroom-pressreleases-detail/index/id/better-place-extends-tokyo-trial-for-additional-three-months | title=Better Place Extends Tokyo Trial for Additional Three Months}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced a commitment to open four battery switch stations in [[California, USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betterplace.com/the-company-pressroom-pressreleases-detail/index/id/better-place-to-bring-electric-taxi-program-to-the-san-francisco-bay-area |title=Better Place to Bring Electric Taxi Program to the San Francisco Bay Area}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way is the installation of [[Battery exchange station#Fast charging|DC Fast Charging]] stations with high-speed charging capability from [[three-phase electric power|three-phase]] industrial outlets so that consumers could recharge the 100 mile battery of their electric vehicle to 80 percent in about 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecotality.com/pressreleases/10132010_Blink_DC_Fast_Charger.pdf | title=DC Fast Charger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/news/13-key-questions-and-answers-about-nissan-leaf-battery-pack-and-ordering-28007.html | title=13 Key Questions and Answers about Nissan Leaf Battery Pack and Ordering}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nationwide fast charging infrastructure is currently being deployed in the US that by 2013 will cover the entire nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theevproject.com/ | title=The EV Project.

===Air pollution and carbon emissions===
{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle#Air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions|l1=Greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in electric vehicles|Plug-in hybrid#Greenhouse gas emissions|l2=Greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in hybrids}}

Electric cars contribute  to cleaner air in cities because they produce no harmful [[Motor vehicle emissions|pollution at the tailpipe]] from the onboard source of power, such as [[particulate]]s ([[soot]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[lead]], and various [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]]. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the [[electricity generation|generation plants]].&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt; The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the [[emission intensity]] of the power source used to charge the vehicle, the efficiency of the said vehicle and the energy wasted in the charging process.

For [[mains electricity]] the emission intensity varies significantly per country and within a particular country it will vary depending on demand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eirgrid.com/operations/systemperformancedata/co2intensity/ |title=CO2 Intensity |publisher=Eirgrid |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the availability of renewable sources and the efficiency of the fossil fuel-based generation used at a given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark |first=Duncan|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/17/realtime-carbon-counter |title=Real-time &quot;CO2 intensity&quot; site makes the case for midnight dishwashing|publisher=Guardian |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Charging a vehicle using off-grid renewable energy yields very low carbon intensity (only that to produce and install the off-grid generation system e.g. domestic wind turbine).

;United States
[[File:2008 US electricity generation by source v2.png|thumb|right|px=300|Sources of electricity in the U.S. in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eia.doe.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table1_1.html|title=Electric Power Monthly - Table 1.1. Net Generation by Energy Source|publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=|accessdate=2010-04-18}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An EV recharged from the US grid electricity in 2008 emits about 115&amp;nbsp;grams of {{chem|CO|2}} per kilometer driven (6.5&amp;nbsp;oz({{chem|CO|2}})/mi), whereas a conventional US-market gasoline powered car emits {{convert|250|gCO2/km|abbr=on}} (most from its tailpipe, some from the production and distribution of gasoline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_wtw.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wheel to Well Analysis of EVs |work=MIT Electric Vehicle Team |publisher=MIT|month=April | year=2008 |accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) published in 2012 a report with an assessment of average greenhouse gas emissions resulting from charging plug-in car batteries considering the full life-cycle ([[well-to-wheel]] analysis) and according to fuel and technology used to generate electric power by region in the U.S. The study used the [[Nissan Leaf]] all-electric car to establish the analysis's baseline. The UCS study expressed the results in terms of [[miles per gallon]] instead of the conventional unit of grams of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|carbon dioxide]] emissions per year. The study found that in areas where electricity is generated from natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric or other renewable sources, the potential of plug-in electric cars to reduce greenhouse emissions is significant. On the other hand, in regions where a high proportion of power is generated from coal, [[hybrid electric car]]s produce less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions than [[plug-in electric car]]s, and the best fuel efficient gasoline-powered [[subcompact car]] produces slightly less emissions than a plug-in car. In the worst-case scenario, the study estimated that for a region where all energy is generated from coal, a plug-in electric car would emit greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a gasoline car rated at a combined city/highway fuel economy of {{Convert|30|mpgUS|abbr=on}}. In contrast, in a region that is completely reliant on natural gas, the plug-in would be equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at {{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}} combined.&lt;ref name=UCS2012EVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf|title=State of Charge: Electric Vehicles’ Global Warming Emissions and Fuel-Cost Savings across the United States|author=Don Anair and Amine Mahmassani|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]]|date=April 2012|accessdate=2012-08-08}} ''pp. 5, 11, 16-20''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO201&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/automobiles/how-green-are-electric-cars-depends-on-where-you-plug-in.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=How Green Are Electric Cars?

The study found that for 45% of the U.S. population, a plug-in electric car will generate lower CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions than a gasoline-powered car capable of a combined fuel economy of {{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Toyota Prius (XW30)|Toyota Prius]]. Cities in this group included [[Portland, Oregon]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], and [[Salt Lake City]], and the cleanest cities achieved  well-to-wheel emissions equivalent to a fuel economy of {{Convert|79|mpgUS|abbr=on}}. The study also found that for 37% of the population, the electric car emissions will fall in the range of a gasoline-powered car rated at a combined fuel economy between {{Convert|41|to|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Honda Civic Hybrid#Third generation (2011- )|Honda Civic Hybrid]] and the [[Lexus CT200h]]. Cities in this group include [[Phoenix, Arizona]], [[Houston]], [[Miami]], [[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. An 18% of the population lives in areas where the power supply is more dependent on burning carbon, and emissions will be equivalent to a car rated at a combined fuel economy between {{Convert|31|to|40|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Chevrolet Cruze#2008–present (J300)|Chevrolet Cruze]] and [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus]].

;United Kingdom
A study made in the [[UK]] in 2008 concluded that electric vehicles had the potential to cut down [[carbon dioxide]] and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions by at least 40%, even taking into account the emissions due to current electricity generation in the UK and emissions relating to the production and disposal of electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file48653.pdf | title=Investigation into the Scope for the Transport Sector to Switch to Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles |publisher= Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform: Department for Transport, UK| month=October |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The savings are questionable relative to hybrid or diesel cars (according to official British government testing, the most efficient European market cars are well below 115&amp;nbsp;grams of {{chem|CO|2}} per kilometer driven, although a study in Scotland gave 149.5g{{chem|CO|2}}/km as the average for new cars in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news193501752.html |title=Electric vehicles given thumbs up|publisher=Physorg |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but would be more significant in countries with cleaner electric infrastructure.

;Germany
In a worst-case scenario where incremental electricity demand would be met exclusively with coal, a 2009 study conducted by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and IZES found that a mid-size EV would emit roughly {{convert|200|gCO2/km|abbr=on}}, compared with an average of {{convert|170|gCO2/km|abbr=on}} for a gasoline-powered compact car.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palm010509&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10231102-54.html |accessdate=2009-05-04|date=1 May 2009 |title=Study: Electric cars not as green as you think |last=Palm|first=Erik |publisher=CNET Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study concluded that introducing 1&amp;nbsp;million EV cars to Germany would, in the best-case scenario, only reduce {{chem|CO|2}} emissions by 0.1%, if nothing is done to upgrade the electricity infrastructure or manage demand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palm010509&quot;/&gt;

;France
In [[France]], which has a clean energy grid, {{chem|CO|2}} emissions from electric car use would be about 12g per kilometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/news/green-motoring/2010-09/renault-ze |title=Renault to sell electric cars for the same price as diesels &amp;#124; Motoring News|publisher=Honest John |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Emissions during production
A 2011 report prepared by [[Ricardo plc|Ricardo]] found that [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, [[plug-in hybrid]]s and all-electric cars generate more carbon emissions during their production than current conventional vehicles, but still have a lower overall [[carbon footprint]] over the [[life cycle assessment|full life cycle]]. The initial higher carbon footprint is due mainly to battery production. As an example, the study estimated that 43 percent of production emissions for a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] electric car are generated from the battery production.&lt;ref name=Ricardo2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/lowcvp-20110608.html|title=Ricardo study finds electric and hybrid cars have a higher carbon footprint during production than conventional vehicles, but still offer a lower footprint over the full life cycle|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2011-06-08|accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceleration and drivetrain design===
Electric motors can provide high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, and batteries can be designed to supply the large currents to support these motors.

Although some electric vehicles have very small motors, {{convert|15|kW|abbr=on}} or less and therefore have modest acceleration, many electric cars have large motors and brisk acceleration. In addition, the relatively constant torque of an electric motor, even at very low speeds tends to increase the acceleration performance of an electric vehicle relative to that of the same rated [[horsepower|motor power]] internal combustion engine. Another early solution was [[American Motors]]’ experimental [[Amitron]] piggyback system of batteries with one type designed for sustained speeds while a different set boosted acceleration when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Next: the Voltswagon? |journal=Time |date=1967-12-22 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899945,00.html |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric vehicles can also use a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the amount of available [[power (physics)|power]]. Having multiple motors connected directly to the wheels allows for each of the wheels to be used for both propulsion and as braking systems, thereby increasing [[traction (engineering)|traction]]. In some cases, the motor can be housed directly in the wheel, such as in the [[Whispering Wheel]] design, which lowers the vehicle's [[center of gravity]] and reduces the number of moving parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Wes Siler: Comment Email Facebook Twitter |url=http://jalopnik.com/5515071/raceabout-finlands-first-electric-sports-car |title=Helsinki Metropolia University's RaceAbout |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Mike Spinelli: Comment |url=http://jalopnik.com/307457/nissan-pivo-2-360-degrees-no-reverse |title=Nissan Pivo 2 |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/plug-in-hybrid-retrofit-kit-ice-vehicle/11631/ |title=Charles Perry's Plug-In Hybrid Retrofit Kit |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not fitted with an [[axle]], [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], or [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], electric vehicles have less drivetrain rotational inertia. Housing the motor within the wheel can increase the [[unsprung weight]] of the wheel, which can have an adverse effect on the handling of the vehicle.

===Transmission===
A gearless or single gear design in some EVs eliminates the need for gear shifting, giving such vehicles both smoother acceleration and smoother braking. Because the torque of an electric motor is a function of current, not rotational speed, electric vehicles have a high torque over a larger range of speeds during acceleration, as compared to an internal combustion engine. As there is no delay in developing torque in an EV, EV drivers report generally high satisfaction with acceleration.

The gearless design is the least complex, but high acceleration requires high torque from the motor, which requires high current and results in [[Joule heating]]. This is because the internal wiring of the motor has electrical resistance, which dissipates power as heat when a current is put through it, in accordance to [[Ohm's Law]]. While the torque of the electric motor is not dependent on its rotational speed, the output [[power (physics)|power]] of the motor is the product of both the torque and the rotational speed, which means that more power is lost in proportion to the output power when the motor is turning slowly. In effect, the drivetrain becomes less efficient the slower the vehicle moves.

In the single gear design, this problem is mitigated by using a gear ratio that allows the motor to turn faster than the wheel, which translates low torque and high rotational speed of the motor into high torque and low rotational speed of the wheels, giving equal or better acceleration without compromising efficiency as much. However, since the motor does have a top speed at which it can operate, the tradeoff is lower top speed for the vehicle. If a higher top speed is desired, the tradeoff is lower acceleration and lower efficiency at slow speeds.

The use of a multiple-speed transmission allows the vehicle to operate efficiently at both high and low speeds, but comes with more complexity and cost.

For example, the [[Venturi Fetish]] delivers [[supercar]] acceleration despite a relatively modest 220&amp;nbsp;kW (295&amp;nbsp;hp), and top speed of around {{convert|160|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}. Some [[Direct current motor|DC motor]]-equipped drag racer EVs, have simple two-speed [[manual transmission]]s to improve top speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hedlund|first=R. |month=November | year=2008 |title=The Roger Hedlund 100&amp;nbsp;MPH Club |publisher=National Electric Drag Racing Association |url=http://nedra.com/100mph_club.html |accessdate=9009-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tesla Roadster]] 2.5 Sport can accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 3.7&amp;nbsp;seconds with a motor rated at {{convert|215|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/roadster/specs#specs-2 | title=Roadster Sport 2.5 Specifications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy efficiency===
{{Main|Fuel efficiency|Electrical efficiency|Thermal efficiency|Energy conversion efficiency}}
[[Internal combustion engine]]s are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion as most of the energy is wasted as heat. On the other hand, [[electric motor]]s are more [[thermal efficiency|efficient]] in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle, and [[electric drive vehicle]]s do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and some of the energy lost when braking is captured and reused through [[regenerative braking]], which captures as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sperling |first=Daniel|first2=Deborah |last2=Gordon | title=Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability | year = 2009 | pages= 23 and 26| publisher =Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt; Typically, conventional [[gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles have on-board efficiency of around 80%.&lt;ref name=PEVs2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|first=Saurin D. |last=Shah|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |edition=1st |chapter=2|pages=29, 37 and 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production and [[Electric vehicle conversion|conversion]] electric cars typically use 10 to 23&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.17 to 0.37&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref name=&quot;ev1datasheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |date=30 May 2006 |title=Full Size Electric Vehicles |chapter=Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity |url=http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20% of this power consumption is due to [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficiencies]] in charging the batteries. Tesla Motors indicates that the vehicle efficiency (including charging inefficiencies) of their [[lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicle is 12.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.21&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi) and the well-to-wheels efficiency (assuming the electricity is generated from natural gas) is 24.4&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.39&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency |publisher=Tesla Motors |title=Energy Efficiency of Tesla Electric Vehicles |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard [[ISO]] 6469. This document is divided in three parts dealing with specific issues:
*On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery
*Functional safety means and protection against failures
*Protection of persons against electrical hazards.

;Chevrolet Volt
As a result of a crashed tested Chevolet Volt that caught fire in June 2011 three weeks after the testing, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] ( NHTSA) issued a statement saying that the agency does not believe the Volt or other electric vehicles are at a greater risk of fire than gasoline-powered vehicles.

General Motors said the fire would have been avoided if GM's protocols for deactivating the battery after the crash had been followed, and also stated that they ''&quot;are working with other vehicle manufacturers, first responders, tow truck operators, and salvage associations with the goal of implementing industrywide protocols.&quot;''&lt;ref name=Fire2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fire4&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/business/energy-environment/regulators-examine-electric-car-batteries-after-fire.html?_r=1&amp;ref=electricvehicles|title=Batteries in Electric Cars Examined After Chevy Volt Fire|author=Nick Bunkley|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-11-11|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In further testing of the Volt's batteries carried out by NHTSA in November 2011, two of the three tests resulted in thermal events, including fire.

On January 5, 2012, General Motors announced that it would offer a customer satisfaction program to provide modifications to the Chevrolet Volt to reduce the chance that the battery pack could catch fire days or weeks after a severe accident. General Motors explained the modifications will enhance the vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthen an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket to the top of the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill.&lt;ref name=NYT010512&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/business/gm-to-reinforce-battery-in-hybrid-car.html?ref=automobiles|title=G.M. to Reinforce Battery in Hybrid Car|author=Nick Bunkley|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-01-05|accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010512&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/volt-20120105.html|title=GM makes modifications to Chevrolet Volt vehicle structure and battery coolant system to further protect from delayed electrical fire after severe crash|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2012-01-05|accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2012, the NHTSA closed the Volt's safety defect investigation related to post-crash fire risk.

;Fisker Karma
In December 2011, [[Fisker Automotive]] recalled the first 239 Karmas delivered to the U.S. due to a risk of battery fire caused by coolant leak. Of the 239 cars, less than fifty have been delivered to customers, the rest were in dealerships. In the report filed by Fisker Automotive with the NHTSA, the carmaker said some hose clamps were not properly positioned, which could allow a coolant leak and an electrical short could possibly occur if coolant enters the battery compartment, causing a thermal event within the battery, including a possible fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/fisker-recalling-239-karma-electric-cars-for-fire-hazard/?ref=automobiles|title=Fisker Recalling 239 Karma Plug-In Hybrids for Fire Hazard |author=Christopher Jensen|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-12-30|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 a [[Fisker Karma]] was involved in a home fire that also burnt two other cars in [[Fort Bend County, Texas]]. The chief fire investigator said the Karma was the origin of the fire that spread to the house, but the exact cause is still unknown. The plug-in hybrid electric car was not plugged in at the time the fire started and it was reported that the Karma's battery was intact. The carmaker release a public statement saying that &quot;''...there are conflicting reports and uncertainty surrounding this particular incident.

[[File:Ram Pickup plug-in hybrid rear -- 2011 DC.jpg|thumb|[[Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid]] demonstrator]]
In September 2012 Chrysler temporarily suspended a demonstration program that was conducting with 109 [[Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid]]s and 23 [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country#Town &amp; Country Plug-in hybrid|Chrysler Town &amp; Country plug-in hybrid]]s. All units deployed in the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 [[kWh]] battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back on service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The carmaker reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the [[ U.S. Department of Energy]] that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079368_chrysler-yanks-plug-in-hybrid-test-fleet-off-roads-will-replace-batteries |title=Chrysler Yanks Plug-In Hybrid Test Fleet Off Roads, Will Replace Batteries|author=John Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120924/AUTO0101/209240429|title=Chrysler halts tests on plug-in hybrid fleet after batteries overheat|author=Bryce G.

====Vehicle safety====

Great effort is taken to keep the mass of an electric vehicle as low as possible to improve its range and endurance. However, the weight and bulk of the batteries themselves usually makes an EV heavier than a comparable gasoline vehicle, reducing range and leading to longer braking distances; it also has less interior space. However, in a collision, the occupants of a heavy vehicle will, on average, suffer fewer and less serious injuries than the occupants of a lighter vehicle; therefore, the additional weight brings safety benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yRybeDbz8R8C&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=effect%20of%20mass%20on%20a%20vehicle's%20performance&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=effect%20of%20mass%20on%20a%20vehicle's%20performance|title=Effectiveness and impact of ...|publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= 2002-08|accessdate=2009-10-17 | isbn=978-0-309-07601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having a negative effect on the car's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=a76NLkq-QwIC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=effect%20of%20mass%20on%20a%20vehicle's%20performance&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q= |title=Modern electric, hybrid electric ... - Google Books|publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17 | first=Mehrdad | last=Ehsani | isbn=978-0-8493-3154-1|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accident in a {{convert|2000|lb|-2|abbr=on}} vehicle will on average cause about 50% more injuries to its occupants than a {{convert|3000|lb|-2|abbr=on}} vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/regrev/evaluate/pdf/809662.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |month=October | year=2003 |title=Vehicle Weight, Fatality Risk and Crash Compatibility of Model Year 1991-99 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a single car accident,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and for the other car in a two car accident, the increased mass causes an increase in accelerations and hence an increase in the severity of the accident.

====Hazard to pedestrians====
{{See also|Electric vehicle warning sounds}}
At low speeds, electric cars produced less [[roadway noise]] as compared to vehicles propelled by [[internal combustion engine]]s. Blind people or the [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence electric cars and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]]s could pose an unexpected hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|publisher=[[USA Today]]|first=Ben|last=Nuckols |date=3 March 2007|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist0509&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=Economist|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|20|mph|-1|abbr=on}} for all types of road users and not only the visually impaired. At higher speeds, the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist0509&quot;/&gt;

The [[US Congress]] and the [[Government of Japan]] passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist0509&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110104/AUTO01/101040430/Obama-signs-law-to-require-%E2%80%98quiet%E2%80%99-cars-to-get-noisier|title=Obama signs law to require 'quiet' cars to get noisier|work=[[The Detroit News]]|author=David Shepardson|date=2011-01-04|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Nissan Leaf]] is the first electric car to use Nissan's [[Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians]] system, which includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.&lt;ref name=NYT0610&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/blind-advocates-disappointed-in-nissan-e-v-sounds-for-pedestrians/?ref=automobiles|title=Blind Advocates ‘Disappointed’ in Nissan E.V.

===Differences in controls===
Presently most EV manufacturers do their best to emulate the driving experience as closely as possible to that of a car with a conventional [[automatic transmission]] that motorists are familiar with. Most models therefore have a PRNDL selector traditionally found in cars with automatic transmission despite the underlying mechanical differences. Push buttons are the easiest to implement as all modes are implemented through software on the vehicle's controller.

Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear and no [[parking pawl]] may be present the modes &quot;P&quot; and &quot;N&quot; will still be provided on the selector. In this case the motor is disabled in &quot;N&quot; and an electrically actuated [[hand brake]] provides the &quot;P&quot; mode.

In some cars the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in &quot;D&quot;, similar to a traditional automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |title=Ford Focus BEV - Road test |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the foot is lifted from the accelerator of an [[internal combustion engine|ICE]], [[engine braking]] causes the car to slow. An EV would coast under these conditions, and applying mild regenerative braking instead provides a more familiar response. Selecting the L mode will increase this effect for sustained downhill driving, analogous to selecting a lower gear.

==Cabin heating and cooling==
Electric vehicles generate very little waste heat and resistance electric heat may have to be used to heat the interior of the vehicle if heat generated from battery charging/discharging can not be used to heat the interior.

While heating can be simply provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible [[heat pump]] (this is currently implemented in the hybrid [[Toyota Prius]]). [[Positive Temperature Coefficient]] (PTC) junction cooling&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |country-code=US |patent-number=5889260 |title=Electrical PTC heating device |publication-date=30 March 1999 |inventor1-last=Golan|inventor1-first=Gad |inventor2-last=Galperin|inventor2-first=Yuly }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also attractive for its simplicity&amp;nbsp;— this kind of system is used for example in the [[Tesla Roadster]].

Some electric cars, for example the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]], use an auxiliary heating system (for example [[gasoline]]-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice &quot;green&quot; and &quot;Zero emissions&quot; credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with [[solar power]], most simply and effectively by inducting outside air to avoid extreme heat buildup when the vehicle is closed and parked in the sunlight (such cooling mechanisms are available as [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] kits for conventional vehicles). Two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |title=2010 Options and Packages |work=Toyota Prius |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Batteries==
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Prototypes of 75 watt-hour/kilogram [[lithium-ion polymer battery]]. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 130 W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles.]]
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}

Finding the economic balance of range against performance, [[energy density]], and accumulator type versus cost challenges every EV manufacturer.

While most current highway-speed electric vehicle designs focus on [[lithium ion battery|lithium-ion]] and other lithium-based variants a variety of alternative batteries can also be used. Lithium based batteries are often chosen for their high power and energy density but have a limited shelf-life and cycle lifetime which can significantly increase the running costs of the vehicle. Variants such as [[Lithium iron phosphate]] and [[Lithium-titanate battery|Lithium-titanate]] attempt to solve the durability issues with traditional lithium-ion batteries.

Other battery technologies include:
*[[Lead acid batteries]] are still the most used form of power for most of the electric vehicles used today. The initial construction costs are significantly lower than for other battery types, and while power output to weight is poorer than other designs, range and power can be easily added by increasing the number of batteries.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Clifford, CEO of ZENN Motors, in Discovery Channel's Green Wheels episode 1&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nickel-cadmium battery|NiCd]] - Largely superseded by NiMH
*[[nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]]
*[[Nickel iron battery]] - Known for its comparatively long lifetime and low power density

Several battery technologies are also in development such as:
*[[Zinc-air battery]]
*[[Molten salt battery]]
*[[Zinc-bromine flow battery|Zinc-bromine flow batteries]] or [[Vanadium redox battery|Vanadium redox batteries]] can be refilled, instead of recharged, saving time. The depleted electrolyte can be recharged at the point of exchange, or taken away to a remote station.

===Travel range before recharging===
The range of an electric car depends on the number and type of batteries used. The weight and type of vehicle, and the performance demands of the driver, also have an impact just as they do on the range of [[traditional vehicle]]s. The range of an [[electric vehicle conversion]] depends on the battery type:

===Replacing===
[[File:Renault Fluence Z.E. – Frontansicht, 25. Februar 2012, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb||The [[Renault Fluence Z.E.]] is the first electric car within the [[Better Place]] network. Deliveries began in Israel in January 2012.&lt;ref name=RFZE01/&gt;&lt;ref name=RFZE02/&gt;]]
An alternative to quick recharging is to exchange the drained or nearly drained batteries (or [[Battery exchange station#Battery swapping|battery range extender module]]s) with fully charged batteries, similar to how [[stagecoach]] horses were changed at [[coaching inn]]s. Batteries could be [[leasing|leased]] or [[renting|rented]] instead of bought, and then maintenance deferred to the leasing or rental company, and ensures availability.

===Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering===
{{Main|Vehicle-to-grid}}
{{See also|Economy 7|load balancing (electrical power)}}

A [[Smart grid]] allows BEVs to provide power to the grid, specifically:

*During [[peak load]] periods, when the cost of electricity can be very high. These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. Here the batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.
*During [[Power outage|blackout]]s, as an emergency backup supply.

===Lifespan===
Battery life should be considered when calculating the extended cost of ownership, as all batteries eventually wear out and must be replaced. The rate at which they expire depends on the type of battery technology and how they are used&amp;nbsp;— many types of batteries are damaged by depleting them beyond a certain level.  Lithium-ion batteries degrade faster when stored at higher temperatures.

===Future===
The future of battery electric vehicles depends primarily upon the cost and availability of [[Rechargeable battery|batteries]] with high specific energy, power density, and long life, as all other aspects such as motors, motor controllers, and chargers are fairly mature and cost-competitive with internal combustion engine components. Diarmuid O'Connell, VP of Business Development at Tesla Motors, estimates that by the year 2020 30% of the cars driving on the road will be battery electric or plug-in hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;O'CONNELL, VP TESLA MOTORS, DIARMUID, DAN NEIL, and Dan Rather, hosts. &quot;Electric Cars.&quot; DAN RATHER REPORTS GLOBAL CORRESPONDENT .

====Other methods of energy storage====
Experimental [[electric double-layer capacitor|supercapacitor]]s and [[flywheel energy storage]] devices offer comparable storage capacity, faster charging, and lower volatility. They have the potential to overtake batteries as the preferred rechargeable storage for EVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1996/aug/reinventingthewh842

====Solar cars====
{{Main|Solar taxi|Solar vehicle}}
Solar cars are electric cars that derive most or all of their electricity from built in solar panels. After the 2005 [[World Solar Challenge]] established that solar race cars could exceed highway speeds, the specifications were changed to provide for vehicles that with little modification could be used for transportation.

==Charging==
[[File:Eletroposto6.jpg|thumb|Charging station at [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. This station is run by [[Petrobras]] and uses [[solar energy]].]]
{{Main|charging station}}
Batteries in BEVs must be periodically recharged (see also Replacing, above).

Unlike vehicles powered by fossil fuels, BEVs are most commonly and conveniently charged from the [[power grid]]  overnight at home, without the inconvenience of having to go to a filling station. Charging can also be done using a street or shop charging station.

The electricity on the grid is in turn generated from a variety of sources; such as [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and others. Power sources such as roof top [[photovoltaic]] solar cell panels, [[micro hydro]] or [[wind power|wind]] may also be used and are promoted because of concerns regarding [[global warming]].

===US Charging Standards===
Around 1998 the [[California Air Resources Board]] classified levels of charging power that have been codified in title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, the U.S. 1999 [[National Electrical Code]] section 625 and [[SAE International]] standards.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Three standards were developed, termed Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 charging.

.* or potentially 208V x 37A, out of the strict specification but within circuit breaker and connector/cable power limits. Alternatively, this voltage would impose a lower power rating of 6.7&amp;nbsp;kW at 32A.

More recently the term &quot;Level 3&quot; has also been used by the SAE J1772 Standard Committee for a possible future higher-power AC fast charging standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visforvoltage.org/book/9471 |title=Electric vehicle charging standards |author=David Herron |date=2010-07-30|publisher=visforvoltage.org |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To distinguish from Level 3 DC fast charging, this would-be standard is written as &quot;Level 3 AC&quot;.
SAE has not yet approved standards for either AC or DC Level 3 charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/fast-vehicle-charging-goes-many-names-49817.html|title=Fast Vehicle Charging Goes by Many Names |first=John |last=Gartner |date=2010-08-03 |publisher=PluginCars.com |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2012|06}}, some electric cars provide charging options that do not fit within the older California &quot;Level 1, 2, and 3 charging&quot; standard, with its top charging rate of 40&amp;nbsp;Amps.  For example, the Tesla Roadster may be charged at a rate up to 70&amp;nbsp;Amps (16.8&amp;nbsp;kW) with a wall-mounted charger.&lt;ref name=tm20120610/&gt;

For comparison in Europe the IEC 61851-1 charging modes are used to classify charging equipment. The provisions of [[IEC 62196#Charging modes|IEC 62196 charging modes]] for conductive charging of electric vehicles include Mode 1 (max. 16A / max. 250V a.c. or 480V three-phase), Mode 2 (max. 32A / max. 250V a.c. or 480V three-phase), Mode 3 (max. 63A (70A U.S.) / max. 690V a.c. or three-phase) and Mode 4 (max. 400A / max. 600V d.c.).&lt;ref name=&quot;table1&quot;&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62196-1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf &quot;IEC61851 Part 1: Charging of electric vehicles up to 250 A a.c. and 400 A d.c.&quot;], Table 1 &quot;Modes and permissible connections specified in 61851-1, First Edition 2003-04, IEC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connectors===
Most electric cars have used [[conductive coupling]] to supply electricity for recharging after the [[California Air Resources Board]] settled on the [[SAE J1772]]-2001 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/charger/uid.pdf |title=Rulemaking:  2001-06-26 Updated and Informative Digest ZEV Infrastructure and Standardization |date=2002-05-13 |work=title 13, California Code of Regulations |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2010-05-23|quote=Standardization of Charging Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ARB Amends ZEV Rule: Standardizes Chargers &amp; Addresses Automaker Mergers |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr062801.htm |publisher=California Air Resources Board |date=2001-06-28 |accessdate=2010-05-23| quote=the ARB approved the staff proposal to select the conductive charging system used by Ford, Honda and several other manufacturers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association|ACEA]] has decided to use the Type 2 connector from the range of [[IEC 62196#Plug types|IEC_62196 plug types]] for conductive charging of electric vehicles in the European Union as the Type 1 connector (SAE J1772-2009) does not provide for three-phase charging.&lt;ref name=&quot;acea2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf &quot;ACEA position and recommendations for the standardization of the charging of electrically chargeable vehicles&quot;], ACEA Brussels, 14 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is [[Inductive charging#Electric vehicles|inductive charging]] using a non-conducting &quot;paddle&quot; inserted into a slot in the car. [[Delco Electronics]] developed the [[Magne Charge]] inductive charging system around 1998 for the [[General Motors EV1]] and it was also used for the [[Chevrolet S-10 EV]] and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]] vehicles.

===Regenerative braking===
{{Main|Regenerative braking}}
Using [[regenerative braking]], a feature which is present on many [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, approximately 20% of the energy usually lost in the brakes is recovered to recharge the batteries.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;

===Charging time===
[[File:Smart ED charging WAS 2011 1123.jpg|thumb|[[Smart ED]] charging from a Level 2 station]]
More electrical power to the car reduces charging time.  Power is limited by the capacity of the [[Electrical grid|grid]] connection, and, for level 1 and 2 charging, by the power rating of the car's on-board charger. A normal [[household]] [[Electrical outlet|outlet]] is between 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW (in the US, Canada, Japan, and other countries with 110 [[volt]] supply) to 3&amp;nbsp;kW (in countries with 230V supply).
The main connection to a house may sustain 10, 15 or even 20&amp;nbsp;kW in addition to &quot;normal&quot; domestic loads - though it would be unwise to use all the apparent capability - and special wiring can be installed to use this.
As examples of on-board chargers, the [[Nissan Leaf]] at launch has a 3.3&amp;nbsp;kW charger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gas2.org/2010/05/27/nissan-leaf-will-include-fast-charge-capability-and-emergency-charging-cable-at-launch/ |title=Nissan LEAF Will Include Fast Charge Capability and Emergency Charging Cable at Launch |author=Nick Chambers |date=2010-05-27 |publisher=gas2.org |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Tesla Roadster]] can accept up to 16.8&amp;nbsp;kW (240V at 70A) from the ''High Power Wall Connector''.&lt;ref name=tm20120610&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/charging/high-power-wall-connector |title=Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions  |publisher=Tesla Motors |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These power numbers are small compared to the effective power delivery rate of an average [[Filling station|petrol pump]], about 5,000&amp;nbsp;kW.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
Even if the electrical supply power can be increased, most batteries do not accept charge at greater than their [[Battery charger#Charge rate|charge rate]] (&quot;1''C''&quot;), because high charge rates have an adverse effect on the discharge capacities of batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://batteryuniversity.com/partone-5A.htm |publisher=BatteryUniversity.com (sponsored bv Cadex Electronics) |title=The high-power lithium-ion |first=Isidor|last=Buchmann |month=November | year=2006|accessdate=2009-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these power limitations, plugging in to even the least-powerful conventional home outlet provides more than 15 [[kilowatt-hour]]s of energy overnight, sufficient to propel most electric cars more than {{convert|70|km|0}} (see [[#Energy efficiency|Energy efficiency]] above).

====Faster charging====
Some types of batteries such as [[Lithium-titanate battery|Lithium-titanate]], [[LiFePO4]] and even certain [[NiMH]] variants can be charged almost to their full capacity in 10–20 minutes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}  Fast charging requires very high currents often derived from a three-phase power supply. Careful charge management is required to prevent damage to the batteries through overcharging.

Most people do not usually require fast recharging because they have enough time, six to eight hours (depending on discharge level) during the work day or overnight at home to recharge. BEV drivers frequently prefer recharging at home, avoiding the inconvenience of visiting a public charging station.

In Europe, the electricity supply is generally 240 Volts, and a domestic current is generally supplied at 13A. This means that power is supplied to electric vehicles at around 3.1&amp;nbsp;kW and takes most available electric cars around 8 hours to fully charge.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Hobbyists, conversions, and racing==
[[File:Eliica.jpg|thumb|[[Eliica]] prototype]]
[[File:URE05e.jpg|thumb|right| The full electric [[Formula Student]] car of the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]]]
Hobbyists often build their own EVs by [[Electric vehicle conversion|converting]] existing production cars to run solely on electricity. There is a [[cottage industry]] supporting the conversion and construction of BEVs by hobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Franz|first=Paul|title=Turning Old Gas Guzzlers into Electric Vehicles|url=http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,990054967001_2077261,00.html|publisher=TIME|accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities such as the [[University of California, Irvine]] even build their own custom electric or hybrid-electric cars from scratch.

Short-range battery electric vehicles can offer the hobbyist comfort, utility, and quickness, sacrificing only range. Short-range EVs may be built using high-performance lead–acid batteries, using about half the mass needed for a {{convert|100|to|130|km|-1|abbr=on}} range. The result is a vehicle with about a {{convert|50|km|-1|abbr=on}} range, which, when designed with appropriate weight distribution (40/60 front to rear), does not require [[power steering]], offers exceptional acceleration in the lower end of its operating range, and is freeway capable and legal. But their EVs are expensive due to the higher cost for these higher-performance batteries. By including a [[manual transmission]], short-range EVs can obtain both better performance and greater efficiency than the single-speed EVs developed by major manufacturers. Unlike the converted golf carts used for [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, short-range EVs may be operated on typical suburban throughways (where 60–80&amp;nbsp;km/h / 35-50&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits are typical) and can keep up with traffic typical on such roads and the short &quot;slow-lane&quot; on-and-off segments of freeways common in suburban areas.

Faced with chronic fuel shortage on the [[Gaza Strip]], Palestinian electrical engineer Waseem Othman al-Khozendar invented in 2008 a way to convert his car to run on 32 electric batteries. According to al-Khozendar, the batteries can be charged with {{USD|2}} worth of electricity to drive from {{convert|180|to|240|km|abbr=on}}. After a 7-hour charge, the car should also be able to run up to a speed of {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1209358045722&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout |title=Gaza Cars From Cooking Oil to Batteries |first=Motasem|last=Dalloul |accessdate=2009-04-27 |date=29 May 2008 |publisher=IslamOnline}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infolive.tv/en/infolive.tv-22806-israelnews-gaza-engineers-offer-alternative-gaza-fuel-crisis |title=Gaza Engineers Offer Alternative To Gaza Fuel Crisis |date=21 August 2008 |editor-last=Stephanov|editor-first=Rostik |accessdate=2009-04-27 |publisher=infolive.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Professor Hiroshi Shimizu from Faculty of Environmental Information of the [[Keio University]] created an electric limousine: the [[Eliica]] (Electric Lithium-Ion Car) has eight wheels with electric 55&amp;nbsp;kW hub motors (8WD) with an output of 470&amp;nbsp;kW and zero emissions, a top speed of {{convert|370|km/h|abbr=on}}, and a maximum range of {{convert|320|km|abbr=on}} provided by [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eliica.com |title=Video at eliica.com |publisher=Eliica|language=Japanese and English mixed }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current models cost approximately {{USD|300,000}}, about one third of which is the cost of the batteries.

In 2008, several Chinese manufacturers began marketing [[lithium iron phosphate battery|lithium iron phosphate ({{chem|LiFePO|4}}) batteries]] directly to hobbyists and vehicle conversion shops. These batteries offered much better power-to-weight ratios allowing vehicle conversions to typically achieve {{convert|75|to|150|mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} per charge. Prices gradually declined to approximately {{USD|350}} per kW·h by mid 2009. As the {{chem|LiFePO|4}} cells feature life ratings of 3,000 cycles, compared to typical lead acid battery ratings of 300 cycles, the life expectancy of {{chem|LiFePO|4}} cells is around 10&amp;nbsp;years. This has led to a resurgence in the number of vehicles converted by individuals. {{chem|LiFePO|4}} cells do require more expensive battery management and charging systems than lead acid batteries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
