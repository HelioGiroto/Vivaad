&quot;'''Console wars'''&quot;, also known as &quot;'''System wars'''&quot; is a term used to refer to periods of intense competition for market share between [[video game console]] manufacturers. The winners of these &quot;wars&quot; may be debated based on different standards: market penetration and financial success, or the fierce loyalty and numbers of the fans of the system's games. The term itself does not strictly denote a clear winner in each case, though. The outcome of a console war may however determine whether or not a manufacturer remains a part of the video games industry.

Due to different manufacturers releasing consoles at different times, the wars described below are not exact definitions and do not necessarily have firm beginning and ending dates. Also, these wars had different years and combatants on different continents, since traditionally the four main markets—Europe, Japan, Australia and North America—have been treated as separate entities, with machines and games released at different times or even completely different games being released. This situation is not as apparent as it was in the past, but remains in some respects, particularly with regards to Japan when compared to the other three markets.

In the mid-1980s, [[home computer]]s from various manufacturers were used primarily for gaming purposes by consumers worldwide (in the absence of comparable consoles following the [[Video game crash of 1983|video game crash]]) and are included here as well.

==Home computer wars==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}
Although these wars are grouped under one category here, there were many different minor wars between [[Home computer]] brands that ran from the mid 80s until the mid 90s. All of the computers involved had many upgraded versions released over their lifetimes, which usually included increased RAM and improved CPUs, but rarely a reduction in size due to their integrated keyboards. These wars mainly took place in the [[United Kingdom]], which during the late 80s was the centre of the world computer game industry, having been unaffected by the crash that took place in Japan and the US. This period is also renowned for being the time of the 'bedroom programmer', and many companies formed by such people have lasted until the current day.

===ZX Spectrum vs. Commodore 64===
In the UK, the Atari vs. Intellivision war never reached the major scope and impact that it did in North America.  Instead, the [[ZX Spectrum|Spectrum]] vs. [[Commodore 64|Commodore]] wars of the mid 1980s were the true originator of the console wars. This was due to the start of single format computer game magazines and the far greater entry into mainstream youth culture of these computers than the previous consoles. The Commodore 64 was generally far more technically advanced than the Spectrum, but it usually sold for triple the price

===Spectrum &amp; C64 vs. Acorn(BBC): Games Vs Education===
A parallel micro war raged in the UK, between the perceived games oriented Spectrum &amp; C64 micros with the educationally marketed and more expensive Acorn (BBC micro) offering. On unit sales the more competitively priced Spectrum and Commodore won, and Acorn lost - though Acorn's tie in with the BBC's &quot;[[The Computer Programme]]&quot; and the associated &quot;Government Computer Literacy&quot; and &quot;Computer for schools&quot; programs ensured steady sales post the bursting of the home micro bubble. A fair proportion of the 1.5m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computeractive.co.uk/pcw/news/1926214/how-bbc-micro-helped-conquer-world |title=PCW: 18-Apr-2008, Clive Akass 'How the BBC Micro helped conquer the world' |publisher=Computeractive.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 8-bit BBC micros were still in regular use in UK schools well into the 90’s.

This fight for market dominance was portrayed in the BBC 4 drama [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00n5b92 Micro Men].

===Amiga vs. Atari ST===
The [[Amiga]] vs. [[Atari ST]] wars took place in the late 1980s. In Britain and France where ST was relatively stronger compared to other areas the war lasted well into the early 1990s. Eventually Amiga clearly outsold ST in Britain. The Amiga had the better graphics and sound, and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive. The ST was cheaper and had built-in [[MIDI]] ports. Many early games were developed for the ST and simply ported to the Amiga, using the same code and graphics but remaking the music and sound.

==8-bit era==
{{Main|History of video game consoles (third generation)}}
In what is known as the &quot;8-bit era&quot;, the Nintendo Entertainment System ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]) came out on top in [[North America]] and [[Japan]] (where it was known as the ''Nintendo Famicom''), partially due to its earlier release, but mostly because Nintendo banned developers from releasing their games on other systems if their games were released on the NES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=GaZZwa | title=History of Videogames (part 2) | publisher=Gaming World | url=http://www.gamingw.net/articles/74 | accessdate=2005-01-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040302033704/http://www.gamingw.net/articles/74|archivedate=March 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This put a damper on third party support for the [[Sega Master System|Master System]] and the rest of Nintendo's competition. In [[Europe]] and [[Brazil]], however, the Master System sold much better than the NES in those territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p3.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA: World War|page=3|publisher=IGN|author=Travis Fahs|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia had similar success with the Master System in its early days, though when the NES was released there by [[Mattel]], Master System sales started to slow down.

Nintendo of Japan continued to repair Famicom systems until October 31, 2007, attributing the decision to discontinue support to an increasing shortage of the necessary parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0710/16/news102.html |title=初代「ファミコン」など公式修理サポート終了 |accessdate=2008-01-20 |author= |date=2007-10-16 |work=ITmedia News |publisher=ITmedia |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |title=Nintendo of Japan dropping Hardware support for the Famicom |accessdate=2008-01-20 |author=RyanDG |date=2007-10-16 |work= |publisher=Arcade Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nintendo's classic Famicom faces end of road |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |format=Reprint |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=2007-10-31 |accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First handheld war==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
In the [[Handheld game console|handheld]] wars, [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy]] came out well on top and far outlived the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Atari Lynx]], becoming one of the most successful consoles of all time. The Game Boy's victory is generally attributed to its greater battery life, cheaper price tag, smaller size, and wider third party support over the Sega Game Gear and Atari Lynx, despite the Game Gear and Lynx's having color screens.  However, Nintendo continued to research into improving the screen and first released the [[Game Boy Pocket]], with a true black-and-white screen.  Later, Nintendo created the [[Game Boy Color]], with near-total [[backward compatibility]].

The Game Boy had many [[porting|port]]s of games from popular Nintendo franchises. It was also launched with the extraordinarily popular puzzle game ''[[Tetris]]'' as a pack-in.

Many other companies attempted to get in on the handheld market and they could also be added into this category.  These included the [[Neo Geo Pocket]] and the [[WonderSwan]] (though the latter was in Japan only).

==16-bit era==
{{Main|History of video game consoles (fourth generation)}}
The &quot;16-bit era&quot; is mostly known for the rivalry between the [[Mega Drive]] (known as the ''Sega Genesis'' in North America due to trademark reasons) and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (often abbreviated to SNES or Super NES; known as the ''Super Famicom'' in Japan). The Mega Drive/Genesis came out about two and a half years earlier than the SNES; however, it did not perform well at retail until the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', which drove sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent_pp424_431&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

After three holiday seasons of coming in second to Sega in the American 16-bit console market, Nintendo had the biggest game of the year. Sega still outperformed Nintendo in overall holiday sales, but 500,000 copies of Donkey Kong Country that Nintendo sent out in its initial shipment were mostly sold in pre order, and the rest sold out in less than one week. Donkey Kong Country paved the way for Nintendo to win the waning years of the 16-bit generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

Majesco released the Genesis 3 at $50, Nintendo matched its price with their new model of the Super NES. Majesco then dropped the price of the Genesis 3 to US $40 and again to US $30, with Nintendo matching them dollar-for-dollar every step of the way. Software prices for both systems remained stagnant, ranging anywhere from US $10 to US $25 per title. By this time 16-bit sales only accounted for 10% of the total U.S. console market, but it was a brisk and fiercely fought share. Majesco would wind up selling between 1 and 2 million Genesis 3 consoles, along with 10 million or so Genesis cartridges for fiscal year 1998. In comparison, Nintendo would only sell 1 million SNES consoles and 6 million SNES carts.&lt;ref name=Beginning&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sega-16.com/feature_page.php?id=61&amp;title=Genesis:%20A%20New%20Beginning |title=Genesis: A New Beginning|work=[http://www.sega-16.com/ Sega-16] |accessdate=2012-02-11 |last=Pettus|first=Sam |date=2004-07-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100114185644/http://sega-16.com/feature_page.php?id=61&amp;title=Genesis:%20A%20New%20Beginning|archivedate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 study of NPD sales data, the Sega Genesis was able to maintain its lead over the Super NES in the American 16-bit console market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netinst.org/Clements_Ohashi.pdf |title=Indirect Network Effects and the Product Cycle: Video Games in the U.S., 1994-2002 |publisher=[http://www.netinst.org/ NET Institute] |accessdate=2011-09-21 |author=Matthew T.

In early 1991, Sega revealed the [[Sega Mega-CD]] add-on, and announced its release in Japan in late 1991 and in North America (as the Sega-CD) in 1992. While this add-on did contain a faster CPU, more memory and some enhanced graphics capabilities over the Mega Drive/Genesis itself, the main focus of the device was to expand the size of games; cartridges of the day typically contained 8-16 [[megabit]]s of data, while a CD-ROM would hold 640 [[megabyte]]s (5120 megabits). While it became known for several games, including ''[[Sonic CD]]'' and ''[[Night Trap]]'', the expansion only sold 6 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;failure&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111822/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time/ |title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time |author=Blake Snow |date=2007-07-30 |publisher=[[GamePro]] |accessdate=2008-05-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080905175406/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111822/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time/|archivedate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At June 1994's [[Consumer Electronics Show]], Sega showed off the [[Sega 32X|32X]] as the &quot;poor man's entry into 'next generation' games.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

Although this add-on contained two 32-bit CPU chips and a 3D graphics processor, it failed to attract either developers or consumers as the superior Saturn had already been announced for release the next year. Originally released at [[US$]]159, Sega dropped the price to $99 in only a few months and ultimately cleared the remaining inventory at $19.95;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent_493_496&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

Also, [[NEC]] and Hudson Software entered the market with their [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine/Turbografx-16]], another 16-bit system. Hudson, attempting to reach the same level of popularity as the Super Famicom/SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis, designed their own mascot to stand beside [[Mario]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], named [[Bonk the Caveman]]. While NEC did not have as big an impact in the market as Nintendo or Sega, they still sold more copies than expected for an all-new hardware system. The PC Engine further weakened Sega's position in Japan, with the Mega Drive remaining in third place in Japan behind the Super Famicom and PC Engine throughout the 16-bit era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

==32/64-bit era==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
{{Main|History of video game consoles (fifth generation)}}
In the &quot;32-bit era,&quot; the [[Sega Saturn]] was released first and despite success in Japanese markets, it ultimately lacked in sufficient third party support. Sega's decision to use dual processors has been roundly criticized, and some believe the second [[Central processing unit|CPU]] was added as a knee-jerk reaction to the [[PlayStation]]'s specifications. It has been said that only Sega's first-party developers were ever able to utilize the second CPU effectively. The Sega Saturn was the more difficult console to program for with some titles being dropped during the development process ([[Sega Technical Institute|STI]]'s [[Sonic X-treme]] for example), and therefore the 3-D graphics on its third party games often lacked the luster of the PlayStation or [[Nintendo 64]] (N64), a severe disadvantage at the dawn of 3-D games on home consoles.

Sega was also hurt by the plan to have a surprise four month early US launch of their console.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sega Jumps Gun&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The 25 Dumbest Moments in Gaming: #4 Sega Jumps the Gun, Gets Shot | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index21.shtml | accessdate = 2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] failed for several reasons. One of the major reasons being there were few software titles ready. The Sega Saturn was also US$100 more expensive than the PlayStation at its launch, and only available at four retailers.

Sony took an early advantage by initiating an expensive ad campaign and appealing to an older demographic who had grown up playing video games. The PlayStation was positioned as a necessity alongside the TV and VCR. The securing of this demographic is widely credited as the key to the system's success. Sega and particularly Nintendo's offerings were characterized as appealing more to children (both companies, for instance, featured mascots that appeared in [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s). With Sony's greater hardware sales came greater third party support; ultimately the PlayStation won the era virtually unopposed. Sony carried this momentum over into the release of the [[PlayStation 2]]. The Saturn was discontinued in 1998, as Sega again tried to gain a head start over Sony with the [[Dreamcast]].

Although this era is known as the &quot;32-bit era,&quot; the 64-bit Nintendo 64 was released later than the other two consoles with which it was originally meant to compete directly. By the time of its release, Sony had already established their dominance and the Saturn was struggling to keep momentum. Its use of [[ROM cartridge|cartridge media]] rather than [[compact disc]]s alienated developers and publishers due to the space limits and the relatively high cost involved (compare US$3.50 for an N64 cartridge to 35¢ for a PS1 disc), though the Nintendo 64 had much faster load times because of its cartridge media. Despite this, Nintendo managed to carve out a profitable niche in this era selling over 30 million consoles.

==Sixth generation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
{{Main|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}}
[[Sega]]’s [[Dreamcast]], the first sixth-generation console, debuted in Japan on November 27, 1998. As the first console to feature a built-in modem, the [[Dreamcast]] offered players a new console gaming experience; users were able to play games with one another via the Internet. The [[Dreamcast]] was the sole sixth-generation console for over a year, until [[Sony]] released the [[PlayStation 2]]. In early 2001, however, [[Sega]] announced its discontinuation of the [[Dreamcast]]; it adjusted its company strategy to abandon the console industry and focus on third-party development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sega Scraps the Dreamcast|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1145936.stm|accessdate=2011-10-10|date= 2001-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the [[Dreamcast]] left the market as the sixth-generation competition began to increase.

On March 4, 2000, [[Sony]] released the [[PlayStation 2]] in Japan. The console featured a 294.912&amp;nbsp;MHz processor—an improvement over the [[Dreamcast]]’s 200&amp;nbsp;MHz processor—and promoted [[backward compatibility]] with [[PlayStation]] games. Unlike previous consoles, the [[PlayStation 2]] could play [[DVDs]], creating additional value for consumers interested in purchasing both a DVD player and gaming console. Within two days of the [[PlayStation 2]]’s release, [[Sony]] set a new record by selling 1 million consoles.&lt;ref name=&quot;vghistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serialkiller.org/articles/videogames_history/videogames_history.pdf |title=The History of Video Games |author= Leonard Herman, Jer Horwitz, Steve Kent, Skyler Miller. |publisher=Gamespot.com |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial supply did not meet the demand; there was a shortage even among those who preordered, which led to inflated reselling and reported thefts.&lt;ref name=&quot;vghistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serialkiller.org/articles/videogames_history/videogames_history.pdf |title=The History of Video Games |author= Leonard Herman, Jer Horwitz, Steve Kent, Skyler Miller. |publisher=Gamespot.com |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[PlayStation 2]] did not originally focus on Internet connectivity, [[Sony]] developed an external adapter that enabled online gaming for select titles after the [[Xbox]]’s release.

[[Nintendo]] released the [[GameCube]] in Japan on September 14, 2001. Unlike previous [[Nintendo]] consoles, which used game cartridges, the [[GameCube]] used optical discs similar to [[MiniDVD]]s. The size of the discs, however, restricted users from playing regular [[DVDs]] and [[CDs]] on the console. With an introductory price of $199, the [[GameCube]] cost approximately $100 less than the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox]]—a selling point for price-conscious consumers. The console offered signature family-friendly games, such as ''[[Luigi’s Mansion]]'', in addition to third-party titles, including the more mature games ''[[Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''.

On November 15, 2001, [[Microsoft]] entered the console industry by releasing the [[Xbox]] in North America. The [[Xbox]] featured internal storage capacity, allowing users to save games and download content directly to the console. Like the [[PlayStation 2]], the [[Xbox]] also played [[DVDs]]; however, it required an external add-on. The release of [[Xbox Live]], a subscription-based online gaming service, allowed users to play compatible titles online. Within two months of [[Xbox Live]]’s release, 250,000 users had subscribed, exceeding the company’s projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/381/381618p1.html|title= Xbox Live Subscriptions Double Expectations |accessdate=2011-10-10 |author=Coleman, Stephen |date=2003-01-07 |publisher= IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the sixth generation expanded gaming consoles into a broader entertainment experience, whether through online gaming or the ability to play [[DVDs]]. As seventh-generation consoles overtook the market, [[Nintendo]] and [[Microsoft]] discontinued the [[GameCube]] and [[Xbox]]. [[Sony]], on the other hand, continued to produce the [[PlayStation 2]] after the [[PlayStation 3]]’s release in 2006. In 2009, [[Sony]] announced that [[PlayStation 2]] production would continue until demand decreases.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamertell.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamertell.com/technologytell/article/ps2-turns-nine-sony-says-systems-life-cycle-will-continue/ |title=PS2 Turns Nine, Sony Says System’s &quot;Life Cycle Will Continue&quot; |author=PJ Hruschak |publisher=Gamertell.com |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, sustained [[PlayStation 2]] purchases continue to increase the console’s lead in sales.

==Seventh generation==
{{Main|History of video game consoles (seventh generation)}}

===Home systems===
All three consoles have had major shortages both at their launches and directly afterwards, with the Xbox 360's continuing for months after release and Wii's {{As of|2008|1|alt=still}} continuing after two holiday seasons; the PlayStation 3 saw high demand for its first week of release, but it did not continue, being in stock at most major retailers shortly after release.

====Home Entertainment====
The seventh generation is best known for major consoles branching out into other types of media rather than solely focusing on games. All three consoles offer basic abilities such as photo-viewing, listening to music and browsing the web, as well as the ability to connect to external memory such as [[USB flash drive]]s and [[SD card]]s. The Xbox 360 originally boasted a higher quality DVD player and music player, and over the years has released other features such as an external [[HD DVD|HD-DVD drive]] (now a dead standard), [[Zune]] downloadable content, [[Netflix]] streaming and [[Last.fm]] internet radio. PlayStation 3, on the other hand, has [[Blu-ray]], [[Netflix]] streaming,and [[Qriocity]] music.

This new generation for the first time has all of the major consoles focusing on online integration. All three have their own connection services: Wii's [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Xbox Live]], and [[PlayStation Network]]. Competition has branched now from simply offering the best games to the best online content; smaller games can now be purchased and downloaded from online stores within the consoles, and extra applications such as Netflix streaming and [[Facebook]] connectivity are heavily supported. Almost all games sold in retail have online support, including online multiplayer and [[downloadable content]] for bug patches and new features, potentially increasing replay value in certain games for even years.

Another notable feature in current-gen gaming is the use of avatar characters. Nintendo first introduced [[Mii]]s with the Wii console, caricatures of players that could be created and used in flagship titles such as [[Wii Sports]]; however they lack the ability to customize that Xbox's [[avatar (Xbox 360)|avatars]] have, as clothes and accessories can be purchased online or unlocked in games played. PlayStation 3, instead of an in-game character, offers [[PlayStation Home]], a social simulator where avatars can talk and explore, and customize their homes based on games played.

====Backwards compatibility====
Initially only the Wii was completely [[backward compatible]] (with the exception of the [[Game Boy Player]]) with its previous counterpart, the [[Nintendo GameCube]], while the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 only offered partial support. The Wii also offers the [[Virtual Console]] service, which provides the ability to emulate various older gaming platforms (NES, SNES, N64, Arcade, Commodore 64, NEOGEO, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System and PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16); each game can be purchased on the [[Wii Shop Channel]] and saved to the console's internal memory or an SD card. A revised version of the Wii known as the Wii Family Edition was released in North America in October 2011 and in Europe in November 2011, which, unlike previous versions, lacks GameCube backwards compatibility, controller ports and memory card slots. The Wii Family Edition has not been released in Japan (as of August 2012).

Original models of the PlayStation 3 contained some hardware from the PlayStation 2 (the [[Emotion Engine]] CPU and [[Graphics Synthesizer]] GPU) in order to facilitate backwards compatibility, while original PlayStation software was [[Video game console emulator|emulated]] in software. However, complete backwards compatibility was not achieved until the release of the firmware update that first came with ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction]]''. When the PlayStation 3 was released in PAL regions however, the Emotion Engine chip was removed to reduce costs and instead partial software emulation was used. This lowered the level of backwards compatibility with PS2 software, although PS1 software was unaffected. This restriction also applies to early 80&amp;nbsp;GB NTSC models (released before August 2008). With the release of the 40&amp;nbsp;GB PS3 model in late 2007, the Graphics Synthesizer was also removed from the system, thus also removing compatibility with PlayStation 2 software. No new model since has contained this hardware and thus PS2 software remains incompatible on all but the earliest consoles. However, in October 2011, Sony began releasing PlayStation 2 software via their [[PlayStation Store]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shacknews.com/article/70424/ps2-classics-coming-to-psn-in-only-on-playstation-promotion&lt;/ref&gt; These titles will function on any PlayStation 3 console as they have been [[Porting|ported]] to the platform, rather than simply being [[digital distribution|digitally-distributed]] copies of the original software.

The Xbox 360 uses software emulation for backwards compatibility via game-specific [[Patch (computing)|patches]] automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website.&lt;ref name=&quot;360BackCompat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100820121434/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backwardcompatibilitygameslist.htm |title=Xbox.com &amp;#124; Xbox 360 - Original Xbox Games on Xbox 360 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various games have not received such a patch and thus remain incompatible to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;360BackCompat&quot;/&gt; Some original Xbox titles are available for download via Xbox live, obviating the need for an original Xbox disc.

===Second handheld war===
{{Outdated|date=August 2012}}
Although Nintendo and Sony originally denied competing with each other with their handheld products, it was widely believed that a new handheld war had begun with the releases of the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) in late 2004 and early 2005, respectively (the [[Nintendo DS Lite]], a smaller and sleeker version of the Nintendo DS, was released in late 2006). As of the 2006 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] press conference, however, Nintendo attacked Sony's handheld console, announcing that the Nintendo DS had been outselling the PSP. This could be taken as recognition of a new handheld war.

The Nintendo DS's power is comparable to that of [[Nintendo 64]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} It is notable in its use of two screens, one of them being a touch screen. It also sports a microphone input. It showed considerable early success, particularly in branching out from the usual core demographic of video game players due to the intuitiveness of the touch screen control system. The DS is the less expensive of the two systems, and has longer battery life. The DS is backwards compatible with [[Game Boy Advance]] (GBA) games, but not with games for prior [[Game Boy]] systems. The GBA slot is also used for accessories, such the add-on included with ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour]]''.

Sony's PSP is more powerful than the Nintendo DS, with graphical power roughly in between the original [[PlayStation]] and the [[PlayStation 2]]. It is advertised as a portable multimedia system, as well as a handheld console (much in the same way as the PS2). Numerous movies have been released on the PSP's [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] format, and the system can play video and audio from the [[Memory Stick|Memory Stick PRO DUO]] port. The PSP also supports a large relatively high-resolution display, an analog nub, and standard controller buttons.
