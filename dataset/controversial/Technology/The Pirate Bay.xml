'''The Pirate Bay''' (commonly abbreviated '''TPB''') is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[file-sharing]] website founded in 2003 that hosts [[Magnet URI scheme|magnet links]] and that bills itself as &quot;The world's most resilient [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] site&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20110723055008/http://thepiratebay.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (as of 2012, &quot;The galaxy's most resilient ...&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;ATL12&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Pirate Bay: 'The Next Step in Copying Will Be Made From Digital Form Into Physical Form' |last=Garber |first=Megan |date=24 January 2012 |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/the-pirate-bay-the-next-step-in-copying-will-be-made-from-digital-form-into-physical-form/251894/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/652YwvZO4 |archivedate=28 January 2012 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pirate Bay is currently ranked as the 77th most visited website in the world and 17th in Sweden, according to [[Alexa Internet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alexa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/thepiratebay.se |title= Thepiratebay.se Site Info | publisher= [[Alexa Internet]] |accessdate=27 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pirate Bay has over five million registered users and as of May 2012 hosts over four million torrents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freakbits.com/the-pirate-bay-welcomes-its-4-millionth-user-1209 |title=The Pirate Bay Welcomes Its 4 Millionth User|publisher=FreakBits |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the Pirate Bay is &quot;one of the world's largest facilitators of illegal downloading&quot; and &quot;the most visible member of a burgeoning international [[anti-copyright]] or pro-piracy movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-webscout29apr29,0,1261622.story?coll=la-home-entertainment |title=The Internet sure loves its outlaws&amp;nbsp;– Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date= 29 April 2007|accessdate=28 September 2008 | first=David | last=Sarno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Pirate Bay was established in November 2003 by the Swedish [[anti-copyright]] organization [[Piratbyrån]] (The Piracy Bureau); it has been run as a separate organization since October 2004. The Pirate Bay was first run by [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] and [[Fredrik Neij]], who are known by their nicknames &quot;anakata&quot; and &quot;TiAMO&quot;, respectively. They have both been accused of &quot;assisting in making copyrighted content available&quot; by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. On 31 May 2006, the website's servers in [[Stockholm]] were raided and taken away by Swedish police, leading to three days of [[downtime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;still&quot; /&gt; The Pirate Bay has been involved in a number of lawsuits, both as plaintiff and as defendant. On 17 April 2009, [[Peter Sunde]], [[Fredrik Neij]], [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] and [[Carl Lundström]] were found guilty of [[Accessory (legal term)|assistance]] to [[copyright infringement]] and sentenced to one year in prison and payment of a fine of 30 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (app. 4,200,000 [[United States dollar|USD]]; 2,800,000 [[Pound sterling|GBP]]; or 3,100,000 [[Euro|EUR]]), after a [[The Pirate Bay trial|trial]] of nine days. The defendants have appealed against the verdict and the judge was accused of bias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-trial-the-verdict-090417/ The Pirate Bay Trial: The Official Verdict – Guilty]. [[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]]. Retrieved 17 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2010, a Swedish appeals court upheld the verdict, decreasing the original prison terms but increasing the fine to 46 million SEK.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppealVerdict&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hgV9yJkx_IcxxnMJEAZQkoA4ESwg?docId=CNG.221f09c221a1979e755e0b0622ce97cd.c01|title=Prison terms of Pirate Bay executives' shortened|publisher=AFP|date=26 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May 2010, due to an injunction against their bandwidth provider, the site was taken offline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Injunction&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/196501/german_injunction_knocks_the_pirate_bay_offline_temporarily.html|title=German Injunction Knocks The Pirate Bay Offline Temporarily&amp;nbsp;– PCWorld|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the website was later restored with a message making fun of the injunction on their front page. On 23 June 2010, the group Piratbyrån disbanded due to the death of [[Ibi Kopimi Botani]], a prominent member and co-founder of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoneForGood&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bays-founding-group-piratbyran-disbands-100623/|title=The Pirate Bay&amp;nbsp;– Disbands|publisher=[[TorrentFreak.com|Torrent Freak]]|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pirate Bay was hosted for several years by [[PRQ]], a Sweden-based company, owned by creators of TPB Gottfrid Svartholm and Fredrik Neij.&lt;ref&gt;Häyhtiö, Tapio. ''Net working/Networking'', Tampere University Press, p. 344, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; PRQ is said to provide &quot;highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services to its customers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Goodin, Dan. [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/21/wikileaks_bulletproof_hosting/ Wikileaks judge gets Pirate Bay treatment] ''The Register'', 21 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serious Tubes Networks]] is currently providing network connectivity to The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref name=torrentfreak-comcast&gt;{{cite news |date=12 May 2011 |author=Ernesto Van Der Sar |title=Comcast Offers Help to The Pirate Bay, Problems Fixed |publisher=[[TorrentFreak]] |url=http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-offers-help-to-the-pirate-bay-110512/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2012, The Pirate Bay added the new category ''Physibles''. These are 3D files described as &quot;data objects that are able (and feasible) to become physical&quot; using a [[3D printer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328506.400-pirate-filesharing-goes-3d.html Pirate file-sharing goes 3D ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, as part of [[Google]]'s newly inaugurated &quot;Transparency Report&quot;, the company reported over 6,000 formal requests to remove Pirate Bay links from the [[Google Search]] index; those requests covered over 80,500 URLs, with the five copyright holders having the most requests consisting of: Froytal Services LLC, [[Bang Bros]], Takedown Piracy LLC, [[Amateur Teen Kingdom]], and [[IFPI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/domains/thepiratebay.org/ | title= Targeted Domain: thepiratebay.org | publisher= Google| work=  Transparency Report | accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 3 September 2012, Cambodian police arrested a co-founder of The Pirate Bay, 27 year old fugitive [[Gottfrid Svartholm|Gottfrid Svartholm Warg]].

==Technical details==
Initially, The Pirate Bay's four [[Linux]] [[Server (computing)|servers]] ran a custom [[web server]] called Hypercube. An old version is open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3903397/hypercube_tracker_by_anakata |title=hypercube tracker by anakata |author=[http://thepiratebay.org/user/JooiZe/ JooiZe]|date=21 November 2007|work=Browse Torrents |publisher=thepiratebay.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- torrent still live--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=| url=http://junki.es/hypercube-dist.tar.bz2 |title=Hypercube-dist.tar.bz2 |format=BZ2 archive| date=15 November 2008 |publisher=Junki.es |accessdate=12 July 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2005, The Pirate Bay updated its website in an effort to reduce [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] usage, which was reported to be at 2 [[HTTP]] requests per [[millisecond]] on each of the four [[web server]]s,&lt;ref name=stay&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70358|title=The Pirate Bay: Here to Stay?|date=13 March 2006 |first=Ann |last=Harrison |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|accessdate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to create a more user friendly interface for the [[front-end]] of the website. The website now runs [[Lighttpd]] and [[PHP]] on its dynamic front ends, [[MySQL]] at the database back end, [[Sphinx (search engine)|Sphinx]] on the two search systems, [[memcached]] for caching SQL queries and PHP-sessions and [[Varnish cache|Varnish]] in front of Lighttpd for caching static content. {{As of|September 2008}}, The Pirate Bay consisted of 31 dedicated servers including nine dynamic web fronts, a database, two search engines, and eight [[BitTorrent tracker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.thepiratebay.org/ |title=Technical specifications |publisher=The Pirate Bay |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2007, The Pirate Bay finished the move from Hypercube to [[Opentracker]] as its BitTorrent tracking software, also enabling the use of the [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] tracker protocol for which Hypercube lacked support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-switches-to-opentracker-071208/|title=The Pirate Bay Now Running on Opentracker |publisher=[[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]]|date=8 December 2007|author=&quot;Ernesto&quot; }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed UDP [[multicast]] to be used to synchronize the multiple servers with each other much faster than before.&lt;ref&gt;Roettgers, Janko (15 July 2009) [http://www.salon.com/technology/the_gigaom_network/online_video/2009/07/14/post_pirate_bay_a_federated_tracker_network_emerges/index.html &quot;Post-Pirate Bay, a Federated Tracker Network Emerges&quot;], [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Opentracker is free software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/ &quot;opentracker&amp;nbsp;– An open and free bittorrent tracker&quot;].

In June 2008, The Pirate Bay announced that their servers would support [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] encryption (accessible via https://thepiratebay.se)&lt;!-- make explicit, once.--&gt; in response to Sweden's new wiretapping law.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlyckSSL&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slyck.com/story1691_SSL_Encrpytion_Coming_to_The_Pirate_Bay|title=SSL Encryption Coming to The Pirate Bay|last=Mennecke|first=Thomas|date=22 June 2008|publisher=[[Slyck News]]|accessdate=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuarSSL&quot;&gt;Schofield, Jack (23 June 2008).

On 19 January 2009, The Pirate Bay launched [[IPv6]] support for their tracker system, using an IPv6-only version of [[Opentracker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/146|title=IPv6 support|author=bkp|work=Blog|publisher=The Pirate Bay|date=19 January 2009|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2009, The Pirate Bay shut off its tracker service permanently, stating that centralized trackers are no longer needed since [[distributed hash table]]s (DHT), [[peer exchange]] (PEX), and [[Magnet URI scheme|magnet links]] allow peers to find each other and content in a decentralized way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slyck.com/story1880_The_Pirate_Bay_Trackers_Go_Offline_Forever| title=The Pirate Bay Trackers Go Offline Forever| date=17 November 2009| author=Mennecke, Thomas |publisher=[[Slyck.com]] |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/23310/20091117/ |title=Scrapping tracker may negate Pirate Bay fines |author=Landes, David |publisher=[[The Local]] |work=thelocal.se |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 2012, The Pirate Bay announced in a [[Facebook]] post that after 29 February the site would no longer offer [[torrent file]]s, and would instead offer only [[Magnet URI scheme|magnet links]]. The site commented: &quot;Not having torrents will be a bit cheaper for us but it will also make it harder for our common enemies to stop us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ThePirateBayWarMachine/posts/214032295361069|title=As we've said... |work=The Pirate Bay on Facebook|publisher=[[Facebook]] |date=20 February 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site added that torrents being shared by fewer than ten people will retain their torrent files, to ensure compatibility with older software that may not support magnet links.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-dumps-torrents-120228/ The Pirate Bay, Now Without Torrents] ''Torrentfreak'', 28 February 2012. Retrieved 2 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website setup==
The Pirate Bay allows users to search for [[Magnet URI scheme|Magnet links]].  These are used to reference resources available for download via peer-to-peer networks which, when opened in a [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent client]], begin downloading the desired content.
(Originally,&lt;ref name=&quot;VergeMagLinks&quot;&gt;Keene, Jamie (13 January 2012). [http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/13/2703921/pirate-bay-torrent-file-magnet-links &quot;The Pirate Bay set to kill torrent files, keep its service running with magnet links&quot;]. The Verge.&lt;/ref&gt; the Pirate Bay allowed users to download [[torrent file|BitTorrent files (torrents)]], small files that contain [[metadata]] necessary to download the data files from other users).
The torrents are organized into categories: &quot;Audio&quot;, &quot;Video&quot;, &quot;Applications&quot;, &quot;Games&quot;, &quot;Porn&quot; and &quot;Other&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/browse|title=Browse torrents|publisher=thepiratebay.org|accessdate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the &quot;Porn&quot; category is only visible to registered and logged-in users who select the &quot;show pornographic torrents&quot; option in their settings page. However it is currently not necessary with a workaround, allowing unregistered users to search for the content, but not browse through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/browse|title=Browse torrents|publisher=thepiratebay.org|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registration requires an email address and is free; registered users may upload their own torrents and comment on torrents.

The website features a browse function that enables users to see what is available in broad categories like Audio, Video, and Games, as well as sub-categories like Audio books, High-res Movies, and Comics. The contents of a category can be sorted by file name, the number of seeds or leechers, the date posted, etc.

According to [[Piratbyrån]], The Pirate Bay is a long-running project of [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/101 |title=All your bus are belong to us!|author=&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;kopiermich|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the front page of The Pirate Bay features a drawing of a [[pirate]] ship with the logo of the 1980s anti-copyright infringement campaign, ''[[Home Taping Is Killing Music]]'', on its sails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marie |last=Lechner |date=7 December 2007 |title=La K7 bande encore |url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101117124-la-k7-bande-encore |work=[[Libération]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
===Early financing===
In April 2007, a rumor was confirmed on the Swedish talk show ''Bert'' that The Pirate Bay had received financial support from right-wing entrepreneur [[Carl Lundström]]. This caused some furor since Lundström, an heir to the [[Wasabröd]] fortune, is known for financing several far-right political parties and movements like [[Sverigedemokraterna]] and [[Bevara Sverige Svenskt]] (''Keep Sweden Swedish''). During the talk show, [[Piratbyrån]] spokesman Tobias Andersson acknowledged that &quot;without Lundström's support, Pirate Bay would not have been able to start&quot; and stated that most of the money went towards acquiring servers and bandwidth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regrightwing&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=28 September 2008|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/07/pirate_bay_accepted_right_wing_money/|title=The Pirate Bay admits links with right-wing benefactor |publisher=The Register|date=7 May 2007|author=Jibbenga, Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Konrad |last=Lischka |date=4 May 2007 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,480972,00.html |title=Piratenseite im Zwielicht: Rechtspopulist finanziert Internet-Tauschbörse |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |accessdate=28 September 2008}} ([http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fnetzwelt%2Fweb%2F0%2C1518%2C480972%2C00.html English tr.])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donations===
From 2004 until 2006, TPB had a &quot;Donate&quot; link to a donations page which listed several payment methods, stated that funds supported only the tracker, and offered time-limited benefits to donors such as no advertisements and &quot;VIP&quot; status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donations|publisher=The Pirate Bay|url=http://thepiratebay.org/donate.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041009174905/http://thepiratebay.org/donate.php|archivedate=9 October 2004|accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|title=Donations|publisher=The Pirate Bay|url=http://thepiratebay.org/donate.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060702224038/http://thepiratebay.org/donate.php|archivedate=2 July 2006|accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the link was removed from the home page,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/|title=The Pirate Bay (main page)|publisher=The Pirate Bay|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060820204614/http://thepiratebay.org/|archivedate=2006-08-20|accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the donations page only recommended donating to &quot;to your local pro-piracy group&quot; for a time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/donate.php|title=Donations|publisher=The Pirate Bay|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060806112626/http://thepiratebay.org/donate.php |archivedate=2006-08-06|accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it redirected to the site's main page.

In 2006, Petter Nilsson, a candidate on the Swedish political reality show ''Toppkandidaterna'' (''The Top Candidates''), donated 35,000 [[Swedish Krona|SEK]] (US$4,925.83) to The Pirate Bay, which they used to buy new servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/25 |title=The First State Financed Tracker |author=&quot;tbz&quot;|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org |date=5 May 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100123051531/http://thepiratebay.org/blog/25|archivedate=2010-01-23|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Advertising===
Since 2006, the website has received financing through advertisements on result pages.

As of 2008, the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) claims that the website is extremely profitable, and that The Pirate Bay is more engaged in making profit than supporting people's rights.&lt;ref name=arsfabricated&gt;{{cite news |date=1 February 2008 |first=Ryan |last=Paul|accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/02/pirate-bay-big-revenue-claims-fabricated-by-prosecutors.ars|title=Pirate Bay: big revenue claims fabricated by prosecutors |publisher=Ars Technica }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website has insisted that these allegations are not true, stating, &quot;It's not free to operate a Web Site on this scale&quot;, and, &quot;If we were making lots of money I, [[Gottfrid Svartholm|Svartholm]], wouldn't be working late at the office tonight, I'd be sitting on a beach somewhere, working on my tan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Daly, Steven|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2007/03/piratebay200703?currentPage=4 |title=Pirates of the Multiplex|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|month= March | year= 2007|accessdate=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to claims of annual revenue exceeding US$3 million made by the IFPI, the site's spokesman Peter Sunde argues that the website's high bandwidth, power, and hardware costs eliminate the potential for profit. The Pirate Bay, he says, may ultimately be operating at a loss.&lt;ref name=arsfabricated /&gt; In the 2009 trial, the defense estimated the site's yearly expenses to be 800,000 SEK (US$110,000).&lt;ref name=kuprijanko /&gt;

==Incidents==

===Raid===
{{Main|The Pirate Bay raid}}

On 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place as ordered by judge Tomas Norström, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations. Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's [[Internet service provider]], [[PRQ]]. The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay. Three people{{spaced ndash}}[[Gottfrid Svartholm]], Mikael Viborg, and [[Fredrik Neij]]{{spaced ndash}}were held by the police for questioning, but were released later that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=1 October 2008|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/08/71543?currentPage=all|title=Secrets of The Pirate Bay |work=Wired|date=16 August 2006|author=Norton, Quinn }}&lt;/ref&gt; All servers in the room were seized, including those running the website of [[Piratbyrån]], an independent organization fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities. Equipment such as hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=1 June 2006|date=1 June 2006|url=http://thepiratebay.org/|title= Homepage|publisher=thepiratebay.org|quote=The police officers were allowed access to the racks where the Pirate Bay servers and other servers are hosted. All servers in the racks were clearly marked as to which sites run on each. The police took down all servers in the racks, including the non-commercial site Piratbyrån}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) wrote in a press release: &quot;Since filing a criminal complaint in Sweden in November 2004, the film industry has worked vigorously with Swedish and U.S. government officials in Sweden to shut this illegal website down.&quot; MPAA CEO [[Dan Glickman]] also stated, &quot;Intellectual property theft is a problem for film industries all over the world and we are glad that the local government in Sweden has helped stop The Pirate Bay from continuing to enable rampant copyright theft on the Internet.&quot; The MPAA press release set forth its justification for the raid and claimed that there were three arrests; however, the individuals were not actually arrested, only held for questioning. The release also reprinted John G. Malcolm's allegation that The Pirate Bay was making money from the distribution of copyrighted material, a criticism denied by the Pirate Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Swedish authorities sink Pirate Bay|url=http://www.mpaa.org/press_releases/2006_05_31.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Motion Picture Association of America]]|date=31 May 2006| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ludmVPre |archivedate=10 December 2009| accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the raid, The Pirate Bay displayed a message that confirmed that the Swedish police had executed search warrants for breach of copyright law or assisting such a breach. The closure message initially caused some confusion because on 1 April 2005, [[April Fool's Day]], The Pirate Bay had posted a similar message as a [[prank]], stating that they were unavailable due to a raid by the Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau and [[IFPI]]. Piratbyrån set up a temporary news [[blog]] to inform the public about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://piratbyran.blogspot.com/ |title=Piratbyrån&amp;nbsp;– temporär nyhetsförmedling |publisher=Piratbyran.blogspot.com |date= 1 May 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2008 |language=Swedish}} ([http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//piratbyran.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_archive.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8 English tr.])&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2006, The Pirate Bay was available once again, with their logo depicting a pirate ship firing cannon balls at the [[Hollywood sign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/tech/piratebay.html|title=The Pirate Bay |publisher=CBC|date=9 June 2006|author=Bowman, John |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purchases===
In January 2007, when the micronation of [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] was put up for &quot;sale&quot;, the ACFI and '''The Pirate Bay''' tried to buy it. The Sealand government however did not want to be involved with The Pirate Bay, as it was their opinion that file sharing represented &quot;theft of proprietary rights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Stroumboulopoulos |date=16 January 2007 |title= Prince of Sealand |url=http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/videos.html?id=741185888 |work=[[The Hour (Canadian TV series)|The Hour]] |publisher=[[CBC Television]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Yam |date=22 January 2007 |title=Sealand Prince Says No to PirateBay.org |url= http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=5800 |work=[[DailyTech]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new plan was formed to buy an island instead, but this too was never implemented, despite the website having raised US$25,000 (€15,000) in donations for this cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=29 September 2008| url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/12/pirate_bay_buys_island/|title=The Pirate Bay plans to buy Sealand |work=The Register|date=12 January 2007|author=Libbenga, Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] news [[blog]], [[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]], reported on 12 October 2007 that the Internet domain ifpi.com, which previously belonged to the [[IFPI|International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]], an anti-piracy organisation, had been acquired by The Pirate Bay. When asked about how they got hold of the domain, Sunde told TorrentFreak, &quot;It's not a hack, someone just gave us the domain name. We have no idea how they got it, but it's ours and we're keeping it.&quot; The website was renamed &quot;The International Federation of Pirates Interests.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://torrentfreak.com/ifpi-now-owned-by-the-piratebay-071012/ |title=Anti-Piracy Organisation Domain IFPI.com Now Owned by The Pirate Bay |publisher=[[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]] |date=12 July 2007 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the IFPI filed a complaint with the [[World Intellectual Property Organisation]] shortly thereafter, which subsequently ordered The Pirate Bay to return the domain name to the IFPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mennecke | first = Thomas | title = The Pirate Bay Loses IFPI.com Domain | publisher = Slyck | date = 30 November 2007 | url = http://www.slyck.com/story1623_The_Pirate_Bay_Loses_IFPIcom_Domain | accessdate =8 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopsy photos===
In September 2008, the Swedish media reported that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the [[Christine Schürrer|Arboga case]] had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=29 September 2008| url= http://www.thelocal.se/14168/20080905/|title=Arboga autopsy photos on The Pirate Bay |work=The Local|date=5 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/censur.php|title=Censur|publisher=thepiratebay.org|language=Swedish|accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program ''Debatt'' on the public broadcaster [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]. Sunde had agreed to participate on the condition that the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=96231&amp;a=1245304&amp;lid=puff_1245314&amp;lpos=lasmer|title=Debatt ber Pirate Bay om ursäkt |publisher=SVT|language=Swedish|date=12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/129|title=No more media relations|author=signing out&amp;nbsp;– bkp|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org|date=12 September 2008 |accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;I don't think it's our job to judge if something is ethical or unethical or what other people want to put out on the internet&quot;, said The Pirate Bay's spokesperson Peter Sunde to TV4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 September 2008 |title=Förundersökning om Arbogamorden sprids på The Pirate Bay |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/forundersokning-om-arbogamorden-sprids-pa-the-pirate-bay-1.552454 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, a large number of internal emails were leaked from anti-piracy company [[MediaDefender]] by an anonymous hacker.

The Swedish online business newspaper [[E24 Näringsliv]] reported on 15 February 2008 that the [[United Kingdom|UK]] based anti-piracy firm [[Web Sheriff]] intended to file lawsuits in the United States and Sweden against The Pirate Bay on behalf of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], the [[Village People]], [[Van Morrison]], and the estate of [[Chet Baker]]. Lars Sandberg, Web Sheriff's local counsel in Sweden, told E24 that Web Sheriff had not yet determined whether to sue the individuals or the companies associated with the website.

In an official letter to the Swedish Minister of Justice, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) requested assistance from the Swedish government to prevent video clips from the [[Beijing Olympics]] from being distributed via The Pirate Bay. The IOC claimed there were more than one&amp;nbsp;million downloads of footage from the Olympics&amp;nbsp;– mostly of the opening ceremony. The Pirate Bay, however, did not take anything down, and temporarily renamed the website to The Beijing Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/08/irate-bay-renam|title=Pirate Bay Renamed Beijing Bay After Olympics Tracking |work=Wired|date=18 August 2008|author=Kravets, David }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 2009, several record companies again sued Neij, Svartholm, Sunde and also The Pirate Bay's main [[internet service provider]] Black Internet. They required enforcement for ending The Pirate Bay's accessory to copyright infringement that had not stopped despite the court order in April, and in the complaint listed several pages of works being shared with the help of the site.

On 28 October 2009, the Stockholm District Court ordered a [[temporary injunction]] on Neij and Svartholm with a penalty of 500,000 SEK each, forbidding them from participating in the operation of The Pirate Bay's website or trackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Landes |date=17 November 2009 |title=Scrapping tracker may negate Pirate Bay fines |url=http://www.thelocal.se/23310/20091117/ |publisher=[[The Local]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/Diverse/AppData/Isidor/files/1646/7220.pdf Ruling in case number T 7540-09 and T 11712-09.](PDF). {{sv icon}} Stockholm district court. 28 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, The Pirate Bay was attacked by a group of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/68 |title=User data stolen but not unsecured |author=bkp|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They copied the user database, which included over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million users. The Pirate Bay reassured its users that the data was of no value and that passwords and e-mails were [[encrypted]] and [[Hash function|hashed]]. Some blogs stated that a group known as the AUH (Arga Unga Hackare, Swedish for &quot;Angry Young Hackers&quot;) were suspected of executing the attack, however the AUH stated on the ''Computer Sweden'' newspaper that they were not involved and would take revenge on those responsible for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://powerofthought.wordpress.com/2007/05/11/the-pirate-bay-infiltrated/ |title=The Pirate Bay Infiltrated &quot; Power of Thought |publisher=Powerofthought.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.107659/ |title=&quot;AUH inte bakom hacket&quot; – Computer Sweden |publisher=International Data Group |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2009, the website of The Pirate Bay had [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber]] [[IPv4]] connectivity issues.

In August, The Pirate Bay relaunched the BitTorrent website [[Suprnova.org]] to perform the same functions as The Pirate Bay, with different torrent trackers, but the site languished; the domain was returned to its original owner in August 2010, and it now redirects to Torrentfreak.tv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/03/pirate_bay_suprnova/|title=Pirate Bay to resurrect Suprnova.org |author=Williams, Chris |work=The Register |date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-says-goodbye-to-suprnova-100804/ The Pirate Bay Says Goodbye to Suprnova].

==Blocking==
The Pirate Bay website has been [[Internet censorship|blocked]] by many governments, despite the relative ease by which such [[Internet censorship circumvention|censorship can be circumvented]] in most countries:

===Belgium===
After the founders of The Pirate Bay lost their 2009 trial, the Belgian Anti-Piracy Foundation (BAF) began arguing for two [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s{{spaced ndash}}Belgacom and Telenet{{spaced ndash}}to block subscriber access to the site.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nurpa.be/files/20111004_BAF-Belgacom-Telenet-DNS-blocking.pdf|title=Antwerp Appeals Court Ruling: BAF vs Belgacom and Telenet - DNS Blocking (in Dutch, citing the original ruling it overturns)| publisher= nurpa.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; After year-long negotiations broke down, the result was legal action. In July 2010, the Antwerp Commercial Court ruled that neither ISP would have to block The Pirate Bay and went on to describe the notion of wholesale site blocking as &quot;disproportionate&quot;. The ISPs said that it was not their position to decide which sites can and can not be accessed by their users. BAF accused them of providing a safe-haven to The Pirate Bay and filed an appeal.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling/&gt; 

In October 2011, The Antwerp Court of Appeal overruled the decision of the Commercial Court and ordered [[Belgacom]] and [[Telenet]] to initiate DNS blockades of 11 domains connected to The Pirate Bay within 14 days or face fines.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling/&gt; A Pirate Bay spokesperson said that this measure would only have the opposite effect, as there are many ways to circumvent it, commenting: &quot;This will just give us more traffic, as always. Thanks for the free advertising.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://activepolitic.com:82/News/2011-10-04a/Belgian_ISPs_Ordered_To_Block_The_Pirate_Bay.html| title=Belgian ISPs Ordered To Block The Pirate Bay|publisher=activepolitic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court order listed domain names to block, which all included &quot;www.&quot; The equivalent URLs without &quot;www.&quot; were also blocked by ISPs who wished to comply with the &quot;spirit of the law&quot;, although the court order did not specify this.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/10/08/2327227/belgian-court-order-may-be-too-specific-to-actually-block-pirate-bay-domain|title=Belgian Court Order May Be Too Specific To Actually Block Pirate Bay Domain|publisher=slashdot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://activepolitic.com:82/News/2011-10-08/Belgium_May_Not_be_Blocking_The_Pirate_Bay.html| title=Belgium May Not be Blocking The Pirate Bay|publisher=activepolitic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; NURPA, a nonprofit Belgian advocacy group which promotes and protects digital rights, freedom of expression, privacy and civil liberties, condemned the decision, saying: &quot;The decision of the Antwerp Court of Appeal in the case against Belgacom BAF / Telenet sets a dangerous precedent for blocking of content by Internet service providers in Belgium. It is incompatible with the doctrine of proportionality advocated by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&quot;&lt;ref name=NurpaReaction&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nurpa.be/actualites/2011/10/BAF-belgacom-telenet-blocage-dns|title=BAF contre Telenet / Belgacom, les opérateurs devront bloquer The Pirate Bay (in french)| publisher=nurpa.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2011, The Pirate Bay registered the domain name depiraatbaai.be and baiedespirates.be, allowing Belgian users to access the site again, without using alternative [[Domain Name System|DNS]] providers.&lt;ref&gt;dns.be search for depiraatbaai.be&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
On 5 February 2008, the district court of Frederiksberg, Copenhagen ruled that one of Denmark's largest ISPs, [[Tele2|DMT2-Tele2]], was assisting its customers in copyright infringement by allowing the use of The Pirate Bay, and that they were to block access to the site.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of 5 February 2008 from Bailiff's Court of Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, Denmark.

===Finland===
On 26 October 2011, the district court of Helsinki ruled that [[Elisa Oyj]], one of the major internet service providers in Finland, must cease to provide copyrighted material from The Pirate Bay website by 18 November 2011 with the threat of a 100 000 € fine. On 9 January 2012, Elisa enabled [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and [[IP address]] based ban to thepiratebay.org. Elisa has filed a complaint on the district court ruling.

===Germany===
On 13 May 2010, the Hamburg District Court ordered an injunction against CB3Rob Ltd &amp; Co KG (Cyberbunker) and its operator, Mr. Sven Olaf Kamphuis, restraining them from connecting The Pirate Bay site to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cyberbunker prohibited from providing Internet access to the Pirate Bay|url=http://www.mpaa.org/resources/68638b79-4e58-4ea5-9d22-533ea318a5ab.pdf| format=PDF|publisher=[[Motion Picture Association]]|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injunction application was brought by the [[Motion Picture Association]]'s member companies.

===Greece===
In Greece, from 15 February 2010 until late March 2010, Land [[Internet Service Provider]] [[Tellas]]/[[WIND Hellas]] blocked the site,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adslgr.com/forum/showpost.php?p=3325943&amp;postcount=14 Answer: Loading The Pirate Bay] ADSL Greece Forum. 16 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as a side effect of blocking applied in Italy, since apparently traffic is routed via the sister network [[Wind (Italy)|Wind Italy]] servers. Unlike in Italy, in Greece it is not required by law for ISPs to restrict access to The Pirate Bay.
Tellas/WIND Hellas managed to circumvent the problem as of 19 March 2010 so that access through the ISP is granted to their users, as well as to the rest of Greek internet users. Nevertheless, sometimes Tellas users still can't load the whole page or can't load the page at all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===India===
The Pirate Bay was blocked starting 4 May 2012, in [[India]] under orders of the Indian [[Department of Telecom]] without any stated reasons or prior warnings. The block was enforced by a number of ISPs, including [[Airtel]], [[Reliance Communications]], [[Tikona Digital Networks]], [[Aircel]], [[MTNL]], [[BSNL]] and [[Vodafone]]. Other ISPs however, did not enforce the block, such as [[You Broadband]] and [[Hathway]]. The ban was lifted after a few days. As of 19 May 2012, the Site was still blocked with the error message &quot;This website/URL has been blocked until further notice either pursuant to Court orders or on the Directions issued by the Department of Telecommunications&quot;. On 22 June 2012, the [[Madras High Court]] overturned the decision, and ruled that only specific web addresses - [[Uniform resource locator|URL]]s - carrying the pirated content should be blocked and not the entire website. The decision restored access in India to video and file-sharing sites, including The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18551471 | title= India unblocks The Pirate Bay and other sharing sites| date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Video sharing website Vimeo.com blocked in India|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/video-sharing-website-vimeo-dot-com-blocked-in-india/20120503.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012|publisher=Rediff News|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Reliance Communications Blocks The Pirate Bay &amp; Vimeo|url=http://www.medianama.com/2012/05/223-reliance-communications-blocks-the-pirate-bay-vimeo/|accessdate=4 May 2012|publisher=Medianama|date=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In January 2009, Irish ISP [[Eircom]], Ireland's largest internet provider, was taken to court by the four large music labels [[EMI]], [[Sony]], [[Universal Music Group]] and [[Warner Music Group]] in order to have the ISP monitor its customers and spot illegal file sharing.&lt;ref name=eircomblock&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/160114/irish_isp_we_wont_block_the_pirate_bay.html|title= Irish ISP: We Won't Block The Pirate Bay|accessdate=3 March 2009 |first=Jeremy |last=Kirk |date= 24 February 2009 |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight court days, the parties reached a settlement to introduce a [[graduated response]] policy to disconnect customers involved in copyright infringing activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Collins |date=29 January 2009 |title=Internet users face shutdown over illegal music downloads |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0129/1232923373331.html |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] continues to negotiate with other ISPs for a similar agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ciara |last=O'Brien |date=18 April 2009 |title=Pirate Bay may be dented but its ship sails on for more battle |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0418/1224244974327.html |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 2009, Eircom however declared that access to The Pirate Bay would soon be blocked altogether,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=NEWS-qqqs=news-qqqid=39782-qqqx=1.asp|title=Music-swapping sites to be blocked by internet providers |accessdate=3 March 2009 |author=Weckler, Adrian |date= 22 February 2009|work= |publisher= The Sunday Business Post Online|archivedate=9 March 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090309010318/http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=NEWS-qqqs=news-qqqid=39782-qqqx=1.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; but retracted that on 24 February 2009, stating that they would not block without a court order.&lt;ref name=eircomblock /&gt; Eircom reversed themselves again on 20 August 2009, announcing that they would block the website starting in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/ireland/eircom-to-block-pirate-bay-access-423241.html |title=Eircom to block Pirate Bay access |date=20 August 2009 |work=IrishExaminer.com |publisher=Examiner Publications, Thomas Crosbie Holdings Ltd. |location=Cork}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 August 2009 |title=Eircom to block Pirate Bay access from next month. |url=http://news.eircom.net/breakingnews/16288287/?view=Standard |publisher= Eircom.net&amp;nbsp;– Breaking News }}{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 September 2009 Eircom blocked access to The Pirate Bay, though it is still accessible via proxy servers, and still accessible in Ireland to subscribers of other ISP companies.

===Italy===
In mid 2008, following the criminal charges raised in Sweden, the Italian Federation against Musical Piracy in [[Milan]] requested action in Italy. The deputy public prosecutor pursued the complaint in the [[Bergamo]] Court for Preliminary Investigations, which on 1 August 2008 decreed to block access from Italian ISPs to all Pirate Bay addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Willan |first=Philip |date=16 August 2008 |title=Judge Blocks Access to Pirate Bay |url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/149904/judge_blocks_access_to_pirate_bay.html |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |publisher=IDG |accessdate=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=42855&amp;idstr=20 |title=Ordinanza 1 agosto 2008.

===Malaysia===
In June 2011, the [[Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission]] ordered the blocking of The Pirate Bay along with several other file-hosting websites via a letter, dated 30 May, to all Malaysian ISPs for violating Section 41 of the Copyright Act 1987, which deals with [[Copyright infringement of audio-visual works|pirated content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/11/nation/8879884&amp;sec=nation |title=No more free downloads as MCMC blocks 10 file sharing sites |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=11 June 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
On 21 July 2005, the Amsterdam district court held a [[preliminary injunction]] hearing against the persons thought responsible for The Pirate Bay. The hearing followed a subpoena from the Dutch record industry trade association [[BREIN]], who had an urgent complaint of intermediary copyright infringement. The defendants did not attend the hearing and hadn't arranged representation, so on 30 July 2009 the court entered an [[in absentia]] [[default judgment]] against them, accepting the complainants demands. It ruled that Neij, Kolmisoppi and Warg are &quot;to stop and keep stopped the infringements on copyright and related rights of Stichting Brein (foundation Brain) in the Netherlands&quot; within 9 August 2009, or face daily penalties of EUR 30,000, up to a maximum total of EUR 3,000,000.

On 2 October 2009, The Pirate Bay's hosting services moved to [[Ukraine]] and their traffic was routed through The Netherlands, but [[BREIN]] contacted the ISP NForce and service was stopped.

On 11 January 2012, two Netherlands [[Internet service provider]]s ([[Ziggo]] and [[XS4ALL]]) were ordered by a court in [[The Hague]] to disable lookups of The Pirate Bay's domain names and to block access to The Pirate Bay's IP addresses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallstreetjournal.de/article/SB10001424052970204124204577154661851866568.html?mod=fox_australian Dutch Court Orders Block on Pirate Bay] ''Wall Street Journal'', 11 January 2012.

===Norway===
[[Asker and Bærum District Court]] rejected demands from the recording artists' copyright organisation [[TONO]] against Norway's largest internet provider, [[Telenor]], to have The Pirate Bay blocked. In a court ruling on 6 November 2009 the court stated that in today's society it would be unnatural to demand of a private company that it should make judgments on whether a website complied with the law, since making such judgments is considered the responsibility of the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Holwerda, Thom |title= Judge: Norwegian ISP Does Not Have to Block The Pirate Bay |url= http://www.osnews.com/story/22456/Judge_Norwegian_ISP_Does_Not_Have_to_Block_The_Pirate_Bay |work= [[OSNews]] |date= 7 November 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Jørgenrud, Marius |title= Telenor slipper å sperre Pirate Bay |url= http://www.digi.no/827920/telenor-slipper-aa-sperre-pirate-bay |work= [[Digi.no]] |location= Oslo, Norway |date= 6 November 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In May 2010, The Pirate Bay's Swedish Internet service provider [[#Black Internet|lost an appeal]] against an order to stop providing service to the site. Although the service provider had already complied with an earlier order in August 2009 and The Pirate Bay was thereafter hosted elsewhere, in June 2010 the ISP chose also to block their customers from accessing The Pirate Bay in its new location. One of the judges in the case later commented that the court's order didn't require the ISP to control their customers' access to the site, but the ISP wanted to avoid any risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;localban&quot; /&gt;

====Facebook====
After The Pirate Bay introduced a feature in March 2009 to easily share links to torrents on the popular [[social networking]] site [[Facebook]], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' found in May that Facebook had started blocking the links. On further inspection, they discovered that all messages containing links to The Pirate Bay in both public and in private messages, regardless of content, were being blocked. [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] lawyers commented that Facebook might be working against the US [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] by intercepting user messages, but Facebook chief privacy officer Chris Kelly said that they have the right to use blocks on links where there is a &quot;demonstrated disregard for intellectual property rights&quot;, following users' agreement on their terms of service. Links to other similar sites have not been blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eliot |last=Van Buskirk |date=30 March 2009 |title=The Pirate Bay Puts Bit Torrent on Facebook |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/03/the-pirate-ba-1/ |work=Epicenter |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Singer |date=6 May 2009 |title=Facebook's E-mail Censorship is Legally Dubious, Experts Say |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/facebooks-e-mail-censorship-is-legally-dubious-experts-say/ |work=Epicenter |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Henning |last=Steier |date=7 May 2009 |title=Facebook spioniert Nutzer aus |url=http://www.20min.ch/digital/webpage/story/31623685 |work=[[20 Minuten]] |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Microsoft====
In March 2012 Microsoft blocked [[Windows Live Messenger]] messages if they contain links to The Pirate Bay. When a user sends an instant message that contains a link to The Pirate Bay, Windows live 
Messenger prompts a warning and claims &quot;Blocked as it was reported unsafe.&quot; &quot;We block instant messages if they contain malicious or spam URLs based on intelligence algorithms, third-party sources, and/or user complaints. Pirate Bay URLs were flagged by one or more of these and were consequently blocked&quot;, Redmond told The Register in an emailed statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/26/microsoft_censors_pirate_bay_im/|title=Microsoft censors Pirate Bay links from IM|publisher=[[The Register]]|date=26 March 2012|accessdate=28 May 2012|first=Iain|last=Thomson|place=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/microsoft-censors-pirate-bay-links-in-windows-live-messenger-120324/|title=Microsoft Censors Pirate Bay Links in Windows Live Messenger|publisher=[[TorrentFreak]]|date=24 March 2012|accessdate=28 May 2012| author =Ernesto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
The Pirate Bay is featured in ''[[Steal This Film]]'' (2006), a documentary series about society and filesharing, produced by [[The League of Noble Peers]] and also in the Danish Documentary ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'', which explores the issues surrounding file [[copyright]]. The Pirate Bay has been a topic on the US-syndicated [[NPR]] radio show ''[[On The Media]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;otm1&quot;&gt;Garfield, Bob (17 April 2009).

==Trial==
{{Main|The Pirate Bay trial}}
The Pirate Bay trial was a joint [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] prosecution in Sweden of four individuals charged for promoting the [[copyright infringement]] of others with The Pirate Bay site.&lt;ref name=kravets&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Kravets |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/01/pirate-bay-futu.html |title=Pirate Bay Future Uncertain After Operators Busted |work=Threat Level |publisher=[[Wired News]] Blogs |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larsson&gt;{{cite web |first=Linus |last=Larsson |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.143146 |title=Charges filed against the Pirate Bay four|work=[[Computer Sweden]]|date=31 January 2008|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal charges were supported by a consortium of [[intellectual rights]] holders led by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry [[IFPI]], who filed individual civil compensation claims against the owners of The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael A. |last=Lindenberger |date=20 February 2009 |title=Internet Pirates Face Walking the Plank in Sweden |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1880981,00.html |work=[[TIME]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish [[prosecutor]]s filed charges on 31 January 2008 against Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm, and Peter Sunde; and [[Carl Lundström]], a Swedish businessman who through his businesses sold services to the site. The prosecutor claimed the four worked together to administer, host, and develop the site and thereby facilitated other people's breach of copyright law. Some 34 cases of copyright infringements were originally listed, of which 21 were related to music files, 9 to movies, and 4 to games.&lt;ref name=larsson /&gt; One case involving music files was later dropped by the copyright holder who made the file available again on The Pirate Bay site. In addition, claims for damages of 117 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (US$13 million, €12.5 million) were filed.&lt;ref name=timescharges&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Harvey |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5754740.ece |title=Half of Pirate Bay charges dropped |publisher=The Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was decided jointly by a judge and three appointed [[lay judge#Sweden|lay judge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Piratnämndeman fick lämna uppdrag |publisher=[[Sydsvenskan]] |date=10 February 2009 |url=http://sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article412141/Piratnamndeman-fick-lamna-uppdrag.html |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unga sympatisörer och äldre nämndemän |publisher=Blekinge Läns Tidning |date=16 February 2009 |url=http://blt.se/nyheter/tt_inrikes/unga-sympatisorer-och-aldre-namndeman(1155188).gm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090219214541/http://blt.se/nyheter/tt_inrikes/unga-sympatisorer-och-aldre-namndeman%281155188%29.gm |archivedate=19 February 2009 |language=Swedish |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedish media, the lead judge was involved in one, and on the board of another, pro-copyright organization, but denied that his involvement constituted a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pirate Bay judge denies 'conflict of interest' |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |first=Rosie |last=Swash|date=23 April 2009 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/apr/23/pirate-bay-judge |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial started on 16 February 2009, in the [[Tingsrätt|district court]] (''[[tingsrätt]]'') of [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The hearings ended on 3 March 2009 and the verdict was announced at 11:00 AM on Friday 17 April 2009: Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl Lundström were all found guilty and sentenced to serve one year in prison and pay a fine of 30 million Swedish krona (app. [[Euro|€]]2.7 million or USD 3.5 million). All of the defendants appealed the verdict.

The appeal trial concluded on 15 October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Jenselius, Michael |title= Pirate Bay-rättegången över&amp;nbsp;– dom i november |url= http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.346725/pirate-bay-rattegangen-over---dom-i-november |work= idg.se |publisher= [[IDG]] |language= Swedish |date= 18 October 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the verdict was announced on 26 November. The appeal court shortened sentences of three of the defendants who appeared in court that day. Neij's sentence was reduced to 10 months, Sunde's to eight, and Lundström's to four. However, the fine was increased from 32 to 46 million kronor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Kobie, Nicole |title= Pirate Bay trio lose appeal against jail sentences |url= http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/363178/pirate-bay-trio-lose-appeal-against-jail-sentences |work= pcpro.co.uk |publisher= [[PCPRO]] |date= 26 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2012, the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] refused to hear an appeal in the case, prompting the site to change its official domain name to thepiratebay.se from thepiratebay.org. The move to a [[.se]] domain was claimed to prevent susceptibility to US laws from taking control of the site.&lt;ref name = &quot;domain&quot; /&gt;

==Relations to other Swedish pirate organizations==
{{Main|Pirate Party|Piratbyrån}}
There are two major pirate organizations in Sweden: the political [[Pirate Party]], which won 7.1% of the Swedish votes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.elections2009-results.eu/en/sweden_en.html |title=European election results 2009 for Sweden|work= elections2009-results.eu|accessdate=13 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two seats in [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-party-gets-second-seat-in-european-parliament-091104/|title=Pirate Party Gets Second Seat in European Parliament|publisher=[[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]]|date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; held by the BitTorrent tracker The Pirate Bay. A third, the [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]] [[Piratbyrån]], disbanded in 2010. Of these three, Piratbyrån and The Pirate Bay shared a common history but became separate. Even though the Pirate Party started hosting The Pirate Bay on 18 May 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/pirate-party-hosting-pirate-bay-in-pro-p2p-political-gesture.ars |title=Pirate Party hosting Pirate Bay in pro-P2P political gesture |publisher=Ars Tehnica |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pirate Party developed on a completely separate though parallel track and is unrelated to the other two.

==Failed acquisition==
On 30 June 2009, Swedish advertising company [[Global Gaming Factory X AB]] announced their intention to buy the site for [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 60 million (approximately $8.5 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) (30m SEK in cash, 30m SEK in [[Global Gaming Factory X AB|GGF]] stock).&lt;ref name=&quot;globalgamingfactory.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thepiratebay.org-blog-164&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/164 |title=TPB might change owner|author=TPB|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pirate Bay founders stated that the profits from the sale would be placed in an [[offshore account]] where it would be used to fund projects pertaining to &quot;freedom of speech, freedom of information, and the openness of the Internet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalgamingfactory.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.globalgamingfactory.com/pressrelease-090630.pdf Acquisitions of The Pirate Bay and new file sharing technology, P2P 2.0](PDF).

Global Gaming Factory's letter of intent expired at the end of September 2009, without the transaction having taken place. This may be due to the company's current financial difficulties. ''PC World'' magazine regarded the deal's future as &quot;doomed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ricknäs, Mikael (28 September 2009).
