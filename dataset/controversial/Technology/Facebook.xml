Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as &quot;People From Work&quot; or &quot;Close Friends&quot;.

Facebook was founded by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] with his college roommates and fellow [[Harvard University]] students [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3#we-can-talk-about-that-after-i-get-all-the-basic-functionality-up-tomorrow-night-1 |title=At Last&amp;nbsp;– The Full Story Of How Facebook Was Founded |work=Business Insider |first=Nicholas |last=Carlson |date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the [[Ivy League]], and [[Stanford University]]. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before opening to high school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over. However, according to a May 2011 ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' survey, there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts and 5 million under 10, violating the site's terms of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.consumerreports.org/electronics/2011/05/five-million-facebook-users-are-10-or-younger.html |title=Five million Facebook users are 10 or younger |work= ConsumerReports.org |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate =May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2009 [[Compete.com]] study ranked Facebook as the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users.&lt;ref name=Kazeniac&gt;{{Cite news |author=Kazeniac, Andy |title=Social Networks: Facebook Takes Over Top Spot, Twitter Climbs |url=http://blog.compete.com/2009/02/09/facebook-myspace-twitter-social-network/ |date=February 9, 2009 |work =Compete Pulse blog |accessdate=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' included the site on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers' birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of [[Lexulous|Scrabulous]] before Facebook?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Geier, Thom |coauthors=Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; ''et al.'' |date=December 11, 2009 |title=THE 100 Greatest Movies, TV Shows, Albums, Books, Characters, Scenes, Episodes, Songs, Dresses, Music Videos, and Trends that entertained us over the 10 Years |work=Entertainment Weekly | location = New York |issue=(1079/1080):74–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criticism of Facebook|Critics]], such as Facebook Detox,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebookdetox.com Facebook Detox]&lt;/ref&gt; state that Facebook has turned into a national obsession in the United States, resulting in vast amounts of time lost and encouraging narcissism.

The name of the service stems from the [[Facebook (directory)|colloquial name for the book]] given to students at the start of the academic year by some university administrations in the United States to help students get to know each other. Facebook allows any users who declare themselves to be at least 13 years old to become registered users of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/parents|title=Information For Parents and Educators|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Facebook|Timeline of Facebook}}
Mark Zuckerberg wrote Facemash, the predecessor to Facebook, on October 28, 2003, while attending [[Harvard University|Harvard]] as a sophomore. According to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', the site was comparable to [[Hot or Not]], and &quot;used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357292 |title=Hundreds Register for New Facebook Website |first=Alan J. |last=Tabak |date=February 9, 2004 |newspaper=The Harvard Crimson |location =Cambridge, MA |accessdate=November 7, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050403215543/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357292 |archivedate=April 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MarkZuckerberg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mark Zuckerberg]] co-created Facebook in his [[Harvard University|Harvard]] dorm room.]]

To accomplish this, Zuckerberg [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]] into the protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied the houses' private dormitory [[ID card|ID]] images. Harvard at that time did not have a student &quot;[[Facebook (directory)|facebook]]&quot; (a directory with photos and basic information), though individual houses had been issuing their own paper facebooks since the mid-1980s. Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |author=Locke, Laura |url= http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1644040,00.html |title= The Future of Facebook |newspaper =Time |location =New York |date= July 17, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fastcompany.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author= McGirt, Ellen |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/open_features-hacker-dropout-ceo.html |title= Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg: Hacker.

The site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating [[copyright]]s, and violating individual privacy, and faced expulsion. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;facemash survives&quot;&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=350143 |title= Facemash Creator Survives Ad Board |work=The Harvard Crimson |location =Cambridge, MA |date=November 19, 2003 |author=Kaplan, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an [[art history]] final, by uploading 500 [[History of Rome|Augustan]] images to a website, with one image per page along with a comment section.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastcompany.com&quot;/&gt; He opened the site up to his classmates, and people started sharing their notes.

The following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website in January 2004. He was inspired, he said, by an editorial in ''The Harvard Crimson'' about the Facemash incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman, Claire&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |title=The Battle for Facebook | newspaper=Rolling Stone | location = New York |date=June 28, 2008 |author=Hoffman, Claire |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080703220456/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |archivedate = July 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched &quot;Thefacebook&quot;, originally located at thefacebook.com.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepticism&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118539991204578084.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Judge Expresses Skepticism About Facebook Lawsuit |work=The Wall Street Journal | location = New York |date=July 25, 2007 |author=Seward, Zachary M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]], accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]], while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&lt;ref name=&quot;zuckerberghacked&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first= Nicolas |last=Carlson |title= In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |date=March 5, 2010 |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |work=Business Insider |accessdate =March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three complained to the ''Harvard Crimson'', and the newspaper began an investigation. The three later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling.&lt;ref name=nytb&gt;{{Cite news |work=New York Times blog |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/judge-ends-facebooks-feud-with-connectu/index.html |date=June 28, 2008| title=Judge Ends Facebook's Feud With ConnectU |author=Stone, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership was initially restricted to students of [[Harvard College]], and within the first month, more than half the undergraduate population at Harvard was registered on the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 7, 2008 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia |title= A brief history of Facebook |work=The Guardian  |location= London |date=July 25, 2007 |author=Phillips, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eduardo Saverin (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer), [[Andrew McCollum]] (graphic artist), and Chris Hughes soon joined Zuckerberg to help promote the website. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to Stanford, [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and Yale.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{Cite press release |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?timeline |title= Company Timeline |publisher=Facebook |date= January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon opened to the other [[Ivy League]] schools, [[Boston University]], [[New York University]], [[MIT]], and gradually most universities in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 13, 2008 |url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/09/11/facebook-opens-up-cx_rr_0911facebook.html |title=Open Facebook |work=Forbes |location =New York |date= September 11, 2006 |author=Rosmarin, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/2.5541/1.600318 |title= Online network created by Harvard students flourishes |work =[[The Tufts Daily]] |first = Lananh |last= Nguyen |date= April 12, 2004 |location= Medford, MA |accessdate=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in mid-2004, and the entrepreneur [[Sean Parker]], who had been informally advising Zuckerberg, became the company's president.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_260505&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author=Rosen, Ellen | title = Student's Start-Up Draws Attention and $13&amp;nbsp;Million | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/26sbiz.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=thefacebook+parker&amp;st=nyt | newspaper=The New York Times | date = May 26, 2005 | accessdate =May 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004, Facebook moved its base of operations to [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt; It received its first investment later that month from [[PayPal]] co-founder [[Peter Thiel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beware&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/general/beware-facebook/2008/01/18/1200620184398.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Why you should beware of Facebook |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company dropped ''The'' from its name after purchasing the [[domain name]] facebook.com in 2005 for $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 13, 2008|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/01/facebook_domain_dispute/| title=Facebook wins Manx battle for face-book.com |work =The Register | location = London |date=October 1, 2007|author=Williams, Chris }}|&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook launched a high-school version in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Facebook is the go-to Web site for students looking to hook up |work=[[Dayton Daily News]] |location = Ohio |date=August 3, 2006 |author=Dempsey, Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, high-school networks required an invitation to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=May 13, 2011 |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080602081817/http://www.forbes.com/security/2007/01/25/myspace-security-identity-tech-security-cx_ll_0124myspaceage.html|title=Why MySpace Doesn't Card |work=Forbes |location =New York |date=January 25, 2007 |author=Lerer, Lisa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook later expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including [[Apple Inc.]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2006/tc20060912_682123.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_technology |title=Facebook: Opening the Doors Wider |work=BusinessWeek |location = New York |date=September 12, 2006 |author=Lacy, Sarah }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook was then opened on September 26, 2006, to everyone of age 13 and older with a valid [[email address]].&lt;ref name=&quot;welcome&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Carolyn |last=Abram |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2210227130 |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |publisher=The Facebook Blog |title=Welcome to Facebook, everyone | date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 5, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/terms.php |title=Terms of Use |publisher=Facebook |date=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240&amp;nbsp;million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPR1&quot;&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/oct07/10-24FacebookPR.mspx |title=Facebook and Microsoft Expand Strategic Alliance |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international ads on Facebook.&lt;ref name=&quot;BW-6Aug08&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_33/b4096000952343.htm?chan=rss_topEmailedStories_ssi_5 |title=Facebook Stock For Sale |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |work=BusinessWeek | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in [[Dublin]], Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=59042 |title=Facebook to Establish International Headquarters in Dublin, Ireland |publisher=Facebook |date=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Facebook said that it had turned cash-flow positive for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2009/09/16/tech-facebook-300-million-users.html |title=Facebook 'cash flow positive,' signs 300M users |work=CBC News | location = Toronto |date= September 16, 2009 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, based on [[SecondMarket]] Inc., an exchange for shares of privately held companies, Facebook's value was $41&amp;nbsp;billion (slightly surpassing [[eBay]]'s) and it became the third largest U.S. Web company after [[Google]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Facebook Becomes Third Biggest US Web Company | url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/technology/facebook-becomes-third-biggest-us-web-company/406751 | newspaper=The Jakarta Globe | date = November 15, 2010 | first = Brian | last = Womack }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 it was reported that Facebook removes approximately 20,000 profiles from the site every day for various infractions, including spam, inappropriate content and underage use, as part of its efforts to boost cyber security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Facebook deletes 20,000 underage profiles daily |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/facebook-deletes-20000-underage-profiles-daily/146972-11.html| date = March 24, 2011 | accessdate=March 24, 2011 | work=IBN Live | agency=Press Trust of India | location = Noida, Uttar Pradesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, Facebook announced plans to move to its new headquarters, the former [[Sun Microsystems]] campus in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;parr_ben_facebooks_new_offices_feb_2011&quot;&gt;Parr, Ben (February 7, 2011).

Release of statistics by [[DoubleClick]] showed that Facebook reached one trillion pageviews in the month of June 2011, making it the most visited website in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Titlow|first=John Paul|title=Facebook Hits 1 Trillion Pageviews|url=https://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_hits_1_trillion_pageviews.php|accessdate=November 17, 2011|newspaper=ReadWriteWeb|date=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should, however, be noted that Google and some of its selected websites are not counted in the DoubleClick rankings.

According to the Nielsen Media Research study, released in December 2011, Facebook is the second most accessed website in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fernandes, Rossi |date=December 31, 2011 |url=http://tech2.in.com/news/web-services/facebook-second-most-accessed-site-behind-google-in-the-us/268862 |title=Facebook second most accessed sit behind Google in the US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, an online mobile store which sells applications that connect to Facebook. The store will be available to [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and mobile web users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 10, 2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18017379 |title=Facebook app store launches amid mobile revenue worries | site=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook, Inc. [[Facebook IPO|held an initial public offering]] on May 17, 2012, negotiating a share price of $38 apiece, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-facebook-pricing-20120518,0,3426310.story |title=Stakes are high on Facebook's first day of trading |author=Andrew Tangel and Walter Hamilton |date=17 May 2012 |work=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2012, Facebook added a [[gay marriage]] icon to its timeline feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/02/facebook-gay-marriage-timeline-icons-couples_n_1643183.html Facebook Adds Gay Marriage Timeline Icons For Same-Sex Couples] retrieved 4 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23rd, 2012 Facebook released the much anticipated update to its iOS app, version 5.0. The app, which did not receive positive sentiments from its users, was rebuilt from the ground up; the app no longer uses page views which made it slow in the past but now utilizes code that uses native elements of iOS.&lt;ref&gt; Brian, Matt.

===User profile===
Users can create profiles with photos, lists of personal interests, contact information, and other personal information. Users can communicate with friends and other users through private or public messages and a chat feature. They can also create and join interest groups and &quot;like pages&quot; (called &quot;fan pages&quot; until April 19, 2010), some of which are maintained by organizations as a means of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 7, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/sitetour/profile.php |title=Edit Your Profile |publisher=Facebook |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227212605/http://www.facebook.com/sitetour/profile.php{{broken link|date=October 2012}} &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has been prompted to add a &quot;[[third gender]]&quot;, &quot;other&quot;, or &quot;[[intersex]]&quot; tab in the gender option which contains only male and female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/facebook-warned-over-third-gender-option300312] retrieved 4 July, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook refused and said that individuals can &quot;opt out of showing their sex on their profile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-doesnt-add-third-sex-gay-activist-disables-account/11167 Facebook doesn't add third sex, gay activist disables account] retrieved 4 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 Pew Internet and American Life study identified that between 20–30% of Facebook users are &quot;power users&quot; who frequently link, poke, post and tag themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/media-society/facebook-engagement-patterns/ |title = Why Most Facebook Users Get More Than They Give |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy settings===
To allay concerns about privacy, Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url=http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search |title=Search Privacy |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is free to users, and generates revenue from advertising, such as [[Web banner|banner ads]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tc&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |title=Facebook goes corporate |work=[[ZDNet]] News |date=April 28, 2006 |author=Barton, Zoe |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080526001748/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |archivedate = May 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choose Your Privacy Settings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy |title=Choose Your Privacy Settings |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with Myspace===
The media often compares Facebook to [[MySpace]], but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 8, 2008 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/technology/25social.html |title=Facebook Expands Into MySpace's Territory |work=The New York Times |author=Stone, Brad |date=May 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=September 10, 2010 |url=http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101024033731/http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |archivedate=2010-10-24 |title=Facebook Connect fully integrated into Mobility Today |publisher=Mobility Today Fitness |date=May 7, 2009 |author=Ciccone, David }}&lt;/ref&gt; MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), while Facebook allows only [[plain text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134635-c,categories/article.html |title=Is Facebook the New MySpace? |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |location =San Francisco |date=July 24, 2007| author=Sullivan, Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the [[Facebook features#Wall|Wall]], a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see;&lt;ref name=&quot;off&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Der |first=Kevin |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=3532972130 |title=Facebook is off-the-wall |accessdate=July 30, 2007|publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Super Poke|Pokes]], which allows users to send a virtual &quot;poke&quot; to each other (a notification then tells a user that they have been poked);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 9, 2008|url= http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=210552142308915&amp;ref_query=pok|title=Inbox, Messages and Pokes |publisher=Facebook }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]], where users can upload albums and photos;&lt;ref name=&quot;gifts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2406207130|accessdate=March 5, 2008|title=The Facebook Gifts|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Facebook features#Status updates|Status]], which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,22822400-5014108,00.html |title=Facebook is ... reconsidering the word &quot;is&quot; |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |work=news.com.au Technology blog |first=Andrew |last=Ramadge |date=November 26, 2007 |location =Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only.&lt;ref name=&quot;off&quot; /&gt;

===News Feed===
On September 6, 2006, a [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] was announced, which appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130 |title=Facebook Gets a Facelift|accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Sanghvi |first=Ruchi |date=September 6, 2006 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.colnect.com/2010/03/facebook-celebrate-your-birthday-every.html |title=Facebook: Celebrate Your Birthday Every Day |publisher=Colnect blog |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url= http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2006/tc20060908_536553.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |title=Facebook Learns from Its Fumble |work=BusinessWeek |location =New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Lacy, Sarah |authorlink= Sarah Lacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/ebusiness/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192700574 |title=Facebook Founder Apologizes In Privacy Flap; Users Given More Control |work=[[InformationWeek]] | location = New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Gonsalves, Antone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7669123 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110515155132/http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |archivedate=2011-05-15 |title=US Patent No. 7669123 |accessdate=March 9, 2010|publisher=Social Media|date=March 1, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/26/facebook.patent/index.html |title= Facebook's news-feed patent could mean lawsuits |work=CNN |date= February 26, 2010 |accessdate =July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]] application, where users can upload albums and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/ |title=Facebook Launches Facebook Platform; They are the Anti-MySpace |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=May 24, 2007 |author=Arrington, Michael |authorlink=Michael Arrington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other [[image hosting service]]s such as [[Photobucket]] and [[Flickr]], which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60&amp;nbsp;photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200&amp;nbsp;photos per album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=87157517130 |title=Share More Memories with Larger Photo Albums |accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=7363 |title=Upload: 60 or 200 photos in the same album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=4947 |title=How can I add more than 60 photos to an album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2003726&amp;l=5f3c8&amp;id=1352160452 |title=Example of album from a regular user with a 200-photo limit |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user's friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to &quot;[[tag (metadata)|tag]]&quot;, or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user's friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that they have been tagged, and provides them a link to see the photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 15, 2008|url=http://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=7|title=Photos |publisher=Facebook }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 7 June 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to its users. It will help the users in finding games and other applications with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/news/internet/Facebook-to-launch-App-Center/articleshow/13920641.cms | title=Facebook to launch App Center| date=8 June 2012 | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the launch of the App Center, Facebook has seen 150M monthly users with 2.4 times the installation of apps. &lt;ref&gt; Lunden, Ingrid.

===Facebook Notes===
Facebook Notes was introduced on August 22, 2006, a blogging feature that allowed tags and embeddable images. Users were later able to import blogs from [[Xanga]], [[LiveJournal]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]], and other blogging services.&lt;ref name=&quot;welcome&quot; /&gt; During the week of April 7, 2008, Facebook released a [[Comet (programming)|Comet]]-based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 2, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=14218138919&amp;id=9445547199&amp;index=0|title=Facebook Chat |publisher=Facebook|date=May 14, 2008|author=Eugene }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[instant messaging]] application called &quot;Chat&quot; to several networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Announcement: Facebook Launches Facebook Chat | publisher=Facebook | date = April 6, 2008 | url = http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=27681 | accessdate =April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows users to communicate with friends and is similar in functionality to desktop-based [[instant messengers]].

Facebook launched [[Facebook features#Gifts|Gifts]] on February 8, 2007, which allows users to send virtual gifts to their friends that appear on the recipient's profile. Gifts cost $1.00 each to purchase, and a personalized message can be attached to each gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 15, 2008|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2234372130 |title=Give gifts on Facebook! |publisher=Facebook }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 15, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=16|title=Gifts |publisher=Facebook }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2007, Facebook launched [[Facebook features#Marketplace|Marketplace]], which lets users post free classified ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 15, 2008|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2383962130 |title=The Marketplace Is Open.. |publisher=The Facebook Blog |author=Morgenstern, Jared |date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketplace has been compared to [[Craigslist]] by [[CNET]], which points out that the major difference between the two is that listings posted by a user on Marketplace are seen only by users in the same network as that user, whereas listings posted on Craigslist can be seen by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 15, 2008 |url= http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9718779-7.html |title=Hands-on with Facebook Marketplace |work=CNET |date=May 13, 2007 |author=McCarthy, Caroline }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced &quot;Facebook Beta&quot;, a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a &quot;cleaner&quot; look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C4006938800025748D0064C292.html?ref=technology |title= Facebook Facelift Targets Aging Users and New Competitors |work= The New York Times |author=Havenstein, Heather |date= July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially giving users a choice to switch, Facebook began migrating all users to the new version starting in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.new.facebook.com/blog.php?post=30074837130 |title=Moving to the new Facebook |publisher=The Facebook Blog |accessdate=September 12, 2008 |author=Slee, Mark |date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2008, it was announced that Facebook was testing a simpler signup process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/11/facebook-testing-even-simpler-sign-up-closing-the-gap-with-myspace-in-the-us/ |title= Facebook Testing Even Simpler Sign Up; Closing The Gap With MySpace In The U.S |work= [[TechCrunch]] |date= December 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook Username===
On June 13, 2009, Facebook introduced a &quot;Usernames&quot; feature, whereby pages can be linked with simpler [[URL]]s such as &lt;code&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/facebook http://www.facebook.com/facebook]&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728 http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url= http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=90316352130 |title=Coming Soon: Facebook Usernames |author=DiPersia, Blaise |date=June 9, 2009 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new [[smartphone]]s offer access to Facebook services through either their Web browsers or applications. An official Facebook application is available for the operating systems [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[webOS]]. [[Nokia]] and [[Research In Motion]] both provide Facebook applications for their own mobile devices. More than 425 million active users access Facebook through mobile devices across 200 mobile operators in 60 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;friendingfacebook2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-has-over-425-million-mobile-users/8384 | work=[[ZDNet]] | title=Facebook has over 425 million mobile users | date=February 1, 2012 | accessdate=February 4, 2012 | author=Protalinski, Emil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook Messages===
On November 15, 2010, Facebook announced a new &quot;Facebook Messages&quot; service. In a media event that day, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, &quot;It's true that people will be able to have an @facebook.com email addresses, but it's not email&quot;. The launch of such a feature had been anticipated for some time before the announcement, with some calling it a &quot;Gmail killer&quot;. The system, to be available to all of the website's users, combines text messaging, [[instant messaging]], emails, and regular messages, and will include privacy settings similar to those of other Facebook services. Codenamed &quot;Project Titan&quot;, Facebook Messages took 15 months to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/15/facebook-mail-gmail-killer-email |location= London |work=The Guardian  |first1=Adam |last1=Gabbatt |first2=Charles |last2=Arthur |title=Facebook mail: it might kill Gmail, but 'it's not email' |date= November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_16619072 |title=Facebook adds 'social inbox' – with E-mail |work= San Jose Mercury News |date= November 16, 2010 |location =California |accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Facebook began to use the [[HCalendar|hCalendar microformat]] to mark up events, and the [[HCard|hCard microformat]] for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protalinski&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-adds-hcalendar-and-hcard-microformats-to-events/266 |title=Facebook adds hCalendar and hCard microformats to Events |last=Protalinski |first=Emil |date=February 18, 2011 |work=ZDNet blog |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice Calls===
Since April 2011 Facebook users have had the ability to make live voice calls via Facebook Chat, allowing users to chat with others from all over the world. This feature, which is provided free through T-Mobile's new Bobsled service, lets the user add voice to the current Facebook Chat as well as leave voice messages on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Swartz |first=Jon |title= Facebook hops aboard T-Mobile's Bobsled Service |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2011/04/facebook-hops-aboard-t-mobiles-voip-service/1 |work=USA Today |location =Washington DC |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |date=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Calling===
On July 6, 2011, Facebook launched its video calling services using Skype as its technology partner. It allows one to one calling using a Skype Rest API.

===Facebook Subscribe===
On September 14, 2011, Facebook launched a Subscribe button. The feature allows for users to follow public updates, and these are the people most often broadcasting their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meghan Peters|url=http://mashable.com/2011/09/15/facebook-subscribe-users/ |title=Facebook Subscribe Button: What It Means for Each Type of User |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were major modifications that the site released on September 22, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Getting A Major Facelift This Thursday!!|url=http://billymoses.com/2011/09/21/facebook-getting-a-major-facelift/#more-10524|publisher=Billy Moses|accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported by [[TechCrunch]] on February 15, 2012, Facebook is introducing ‘Verified Account’ concept like that of Twitter &amp; [[Google+]]. Though as of March 3, 2012, verified accounts don’t get any badges or denotations, but such accounts will get more priority in ‘Subscription Suggestions’ of Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 3, 2012|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/15/facebook-verified-accounts-alternate-names/|title= Facebook Launches Verified Accounts and Pseudonyms|work=TechCrunch Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2012, Facebook officially launched ''Messenger for Windows'', which gives users of [[Windows 7]] access to some Facebook services without using a [[web browser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/technology/SocialMedia-Updates/Facebook-Messenger-for-Windows-launched/SP-Article1-821699.aspx |title=Facebook Messenger for Windows launched |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===
According to [[comScore]], an internet [[marketing research]] company, Facebook collects as much data from its visitors as Google and Microsoft, but considerably less than [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Story, Louise|title=To Aim Ads, Web Is Keeping Closer Eye on You|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/10/technology/10privacy.html|work=The New York Times|date=March 10, 2008|accessdate=March 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users' [[privacy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Revealed: Which social networks pose the biggest risk?|url=http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2010/02/01/revealed-social-networks-pose-biggest-risk/|publisher=[[Sophos]]|last=Cluley|first=Graham|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Criticism of Facebook#Privacy concerns|privacy concerns]] remain. On November 6, 2007, Facebook launched [[Facebook Beacon]], which was an ultimately failed attempt to advertise to friends of users using the knowledge of what purchases friends made. As of March 2012, Facebook's usage of its user data is under close scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sengupta, Somini|title=Risk and Riches in User Data for Facebook|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/technology/for-facebook-risk-and-riches-in-user-data.html?ref=facebookinc|work=The New York Times|date=February 26, 2012|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====FTC settlement====
On November 29, 2011, Facebook agreed to settle US [[Federal Trade Commission]] charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 29, 2011|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/11/privacysettlement.shtm|title=Facebook Settles FTC Charges That It Deceived Consumers By Failing To Keep Privacy Promises|work=[[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]]|date=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical aspects===
Facebook is built in [[PHP]] which is compiled with [[HipHop for PHP]], a source code transformer built by Facebook engineers that turns PHP into [[C++]]. The deployment of HipHop reportedly reduced average CPU consumption on Facebook servers by 50%.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: a behind-the-scenes look at Facebook release engineering|url=http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering.ars/1|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&amp;nbsp;GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes approximately 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process is zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica&quot; /&gt;

On March 2010, Judge Richard Seeborg issued an order approving the class settlement in ''[[Lane v. Facebook, Inc.]]'', the class action lawsuit arising out of Facebook's Beacon program.

In 2010, Facebook won the [[Crunchie]] &quot;Best Overall Startup Or Product&quot; for the third year in a row&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kincaid |first=Jason |url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/08/crunchies-winner/ |title=Facebook Takes Best Overall For The Hat Trick |work=Techcrunch |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was recognized as one of the &quot;Hottest [[Silicon Valley]] Companies&quot; by Lead411.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lead411.com/silicon-valley-companies.html |title=Lead411 launches &quot;Hottest Silicon Valley Companies&quot; awards |publisher=Lead411.com |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a July 2010 survey performed by the [[American Customer Satisfaction Index]], Facebook received a score of 64 out of 100, placing it in the bottom 5% of all private-sector companies in terms of customer satisfaction, alongside industries such as the [[IRS e-file]] system, airlines, and [[cable companies]].

In December 2008, the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]] ruled that Facebook is a valid [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to serve court notices to defendants.

By 2005, the use of Facebook had already become so ubiquitous that the generic verb &quot;facebooking&quot; had come into use to describe the process of browsing others' profiles or updating one's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Facebooking, the rage on college campuses |author=McDonald, Soraya Nadia |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=July 4, 2005 |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20050704&amp;slug=btfacebook04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Collins English Dictionary]] declared &quot;Facebook&quot; as its new Word of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nicole, Kristen |url= http://mashable.com/2007/12/21/facebook-noun-verb-collins-english-dictionary/ |title=I Can So &quot;Facebook&quot; You Now (and be gramatically correct) |work= Mashable |date=December 21, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, the [[New Oxford American Dictionary]] declared its word of the year to be the verb &quot;[[unfriend]]&quot;, defined as &quot;To remove someone as a '[[Friend (Facebook)|friend]]' on a [[social networking]] site such as Facebook.

Writers for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' found in 2010 that Facebook apps were transmitting identifying information to &quot;dozens of advertising and Internet tracking companies&quot;. The apps used an [[HTTP referrer]] which exposed the user's identity and sometimes their friends'. Facebook said, &quot;We have taken immediate action to disable all applications that violate our terms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Steel, Emily; Fowler, Geoffrey A. |title=Facebook in Privacy Breach |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304772804575558484075236968.html |date=October 18, 2010 |work=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York |accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision is based on several cases of overcrowding by people not originally invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptjornal.com/201107041737/mundo/alemanha-festas-convocadas-pelo-facebook-sao-ameaca-a-ordem-publica.html |title=Alemanha: Festas convocadas pelo Facebook são &quot;ameaça à ordem pública&quot; |publisher=Ptjornal.com |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destakjornal.com.br/readContent.aspx?id=10,101638 |title=Alemanha pode proibir festas combinadas pelo Facebook |publisher=Destakjornal.com.br |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, 1,600 &quot;guests&quot; attended the 16th birthday party for a Hamburg girl who accidentally posted the invitation for the event as public. After reports of overcrowding, more than a hundred police were deployed for crowd control. A policeman was injured and eleven participants were arrested for assault, property damage and resistance to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20069457-504083.html |title=Facebook blunder invites 15,000 to teen's 16th birthday party; 100 cops show up, too – Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |date=June 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another unexpectedly overcrowded event, 41 young people were arrested and at least 16 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mtv.uol.com.br/memo/alemanha-pretende-acabar-com-eventos-via-facebook |title=Alemanha pretende acabar com eventos via Facebook |publisher=Mtv.uol.com.br |language=Portuguese |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, it was reported that 43% of British office workers were blocked from accessing Facebook at work, due to concerns including reduced productivity and the potential for [[industrial espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/136685/dont_ban_facebook_at_work_researchers_advise.html | title=Don't Ban Facebook at Work, Researchers Advise | publisher=PC World | date=Sep 3, 2007 | accessdate=September 04, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study in the online journal ''First Monday'', &quot;Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,&quot; examines how parents consistently enable children as young as 10 years old to sign up for accounts, directly violating Facebook's policy banning young visitors. This policy technically allows Facebook to avoid conflicts with the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), requiring that minors aged 13 or younger gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. Of the more than 1,000 households surveyed for the study, more than three-quarters (76%) of parents reported that their child joined Facebook when she was younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study notes that, in response to widespread reports of underage users, a Facebook executive has said that &quot;Facebook removes 20,000 people a day, people who are underage.&quot; The study's authors also note, &quot;Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join.&quot; The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is a site recommendation (not a condition of site use), or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, and not 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/education/parents-children-facebook-privacy-age/ |title = Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, several Facebook users reported that their accounts were hacked and their profile pictures were replaced with pornographic images. For more than a week, users' news feeds were spammed with pornographic, violent and sexual contents. It has been reported that more than 200,000 accounts in [[Bangalore]], India were hacked. Facebook has denied the claims, citing that &quot;safety of the users was on the top of their priority list&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Bangalore/article2635228.ece?homepage=true | location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu  | first=Deepa | last=Kurup | title=Facebook feeds spammed globally | date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anuradha Shetty |url=http://tech2.in.com/news/all/facebook-denies-hack-in-india-assures-safety/258592 |title=Facebook denies hack in India, assures safety |publisher=Tech2.in.com |date=November 18, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social impact===

Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. With its availability on many mobile devices, Facebook allows users to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It can also unite people with common interests and/or beliefs through groups and other pages, and has been known to reunite lost family members and friends because of the widespread reach of its network. One such reunion was between John Watson and the daughter he had been seeking for 20 years. They met after Watson found her Facebook profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7739245 |title=Father finds daughter on Facebook after 20 years apart |work=WABC |location=New York |date=October 23, 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another father-daughter reunion was between Tony Macnauton and Frances Simpson, who had not seen each other for nearly 48 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3570509&amp;= |title=Facebook reunites father, daughter after 48 years |work=MSN India |location=Delhi |date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that Facebook is beneficial to one's social life because they can continuously stay in contact with their friends and relatives, while others say that it can cause increased antisocial tendencies because people are not directly communicating with each other. Some studies have named Facebook as a source of problems in relationships. Several news stories have suggested that using Facebook can lead to higher instances of divorce and [[infidelity]], but the claims have been questioned by other commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334482/The-marriage-killer-One-American-divorces-involve-Facebook.html |title=The marriage killer: One in five American divorces now involve Facebook |work=Daily Mail  |location = London |date=December 2, 2010|author=Gardner, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/57742,news-comment,technology,facebook-causes-one-in-five-divorces-says-law-firm |title=Facebook causes one in five divorces, says law firm |work=[[The First Post]] |location=London |date=December 22, 2009|author=Harwood, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political impact===
[[File:Abc facebook debate saint anselm.JPG|left|thumb|The stage at the Facebook&amp;nbsp;– [[Saint Anselm College]] debates in 2008.]]
Facebook's role in the American political process was demonstrated in January 2008, shortly before the [[New Hampshire primary]], when Facebook teamed up with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Saint Anselm College]] to allow users to give live feedback about the &quot;back to back&quot; January 5 Republican and Democratic debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Politics/story?id=3899006&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News Joins Forces With Facebook |work = ABC News |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first =Doug | last = Minor |url=http://blogs.saintanselmcollege.net/2007/11/29/abcdebates/ |title=Saint Anselm to Host ABC Debates Jan.&amp;nbsp;5 |publisher= Saint Anselm College blog |date=November 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first =Tahman | last = Bradley |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/abc_wmur_and_facebook_debates/index.html |title=Republicans Lead off ABC News, WMUR-TV and Facebook Back-To-Back Debates in New Hampshire |publisher=ABC News | work = Political Radar (blog) |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Gibson]] moderated both debates, held at the Dana Center for the Humanities at Saint Anselm College.

ABCNews.com reported in 2012 that the Facebook fanbases of political candidates have relevance for the election campaign, including:
* Allows politicians and campaign organizers to understand the interests and demographics of their Facebook fanbases, as with [[Wisdom (application)|Wisdom for Facebook]], to better target their voters.
* Provides a means for voters to keep up-to-date on candidates' activities, such as connecting to the candidates' Facebook Fan Pages.

In February 2008, a Facebook group called &quot;One Million Voices Against FARC&quot; organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of Colombians marched in protest against the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]], better known as the FARC (from the group's Spanish name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2008/0204/p04s02-woam.html |title=Facebook used to target Colombia's FARC with global rally |work=Christian Science Monitor | location = Boston |date=February 4, 2008 |author=Brodzinsky, Sibylla }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, one of North Korea's official government websites and the official news agency of the country, [[Uriminzokkiri]], joined Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Laura | last = Roberts | title = North Korea joins Facebook | date = August 21, 2010 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7957222/North-Korea-joins-Facebook.html | work= The Daily Telegraph | accessdate =August 22, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 there was a controversial ruling by French government to uphold a 1992 decree which stipulates that commercial enterprises should not be promoted on news programs. President Nicolas Sarkozy's colleagues have agreed that it will enforce a law so that the word &quot;Facebook&quot; will not be allowed to be spoken on the television or on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Oliver Pickup |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1394558/French-ban-words-Twitter-Facebook-used-TV-radio.html |title=French ban the words 'Twitter' and 'Facebook' from being used on TV and radio |work=Daily Mail  |date= June 6, 2011|accessdate=October 29, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
