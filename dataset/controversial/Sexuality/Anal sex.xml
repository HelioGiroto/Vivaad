anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide [[vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]], so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if [[personal lubricant|lubricant]] is not used.

In a male receiving partner, being [[sexual penetration|penetrated]] can produce a pleasurable sensation due to the inserted penis rubbing or brushing against the [[prostate]] (also known as the &quot;male G-Spot&quot;, &quot;P-Spot&quot; or &quot;A-Spot&quot;) through the anal wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Male hot spot&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talksexwithsue.com/aspot.php The A-Spot], Talk Sex with Sue Johansen, 2005.

===Male to female===
[[File:Anal Intercourse Artwork.jpg|thumb|1892 [[lithograph]] by [[Édouard-Henri Avril|Paul Avril]] depicting male-to-female anal sex]]
Some men may enjoy being the insertive partner in anal sex because the anal sphincter is usually tighter than a vagina, which can yield greater tactile pleasure for the man via his penis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taormino&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding&quot;/&gt; The attitude of women towards being the receptive partner in this practice is diverse: while some consider it painful or uncomfortable, others find it pleasurable and some even prefer it to [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taormino&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=EciU_y1JroMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Essential%20Concepts%20for%20Healthy%20Living%20By%20Sandra%20Alters&amp;hl=iw&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Essential Concepts for Healthy Living] By Sandra Alters, Wendy Schiff; p144&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the clitoris or anus, the vaginal walls &quot;contain relatively few nerve endings, making intense sexual stimulation, pleasure, and orgasm from vaginal-only penetration unlikely&quot; and &quot;it's generally only the lower third of the vagina that has enough nerve endings to feel any stimulation at all from a penis, finger, toy, or other penetrative object&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Can't feel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm a woman who cannot feel pleasurable sensations during intercourse|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=October 8, 2004 (Last Updated/Reviewed on October 17, 2008)|accessdate=November 19, 2011|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/im-woman-who-cannot-feel-pleasurable-sensations-during-intercourse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal intercourse may, however, promote a satisfying feeling of fullness or closeness with a sexual partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;No stimulation &quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=No stimulation from intercourse|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=September 30, 1994 (Last Updated/Reviewed on May 13, 2011)|accessdate=November 27, 2011|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/no-stimulation-intercourse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of heterosexual anal sex – (8/2010 (n=214)) – female participants stated that stimulation to multiple erogenous zones simultaneously (the clitoris, the G-Spot, the anus, or other erogenous zones) enabled them to enjoy anal intercourse with much less discomfort compared to anal penetration by itself. When accompanied by one or more of the other stimuli, women were able to orgasm and those who did reported that an orgasm during anal sex is more of a full-body experience than an orgasm from clitoral stimulation alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeCitore&quot;/&gt;

Anal sex is held to carry a very low risk of unwanted [[human pregnancy|pregnancy]] when not accompanied with vaginal intercourse, as anal intercourse cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening in the process; in some populations, this activity is frequently used as a means of [[contraception]], often in the absence of a condom.&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS ''Prevalence of Unprotected Anal Sex among Teens Requires New Education Strategies&quot;[http://www.sexedlibrary.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&amp;featureid=1036&amp;pageid=682&amp;parentid=478] Accessed Jan. 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female virginity====
Male-to-female anal sex may be viewed as a way of preserving female [[virginity]] because it is non-procreative and does not penetrate the [[hymen]]. Among sexually active heterosexuals, the concept of &quot;[[technical virgin]]ity&quot;, which includes anal sex, [[oral sex]] and [[mutual masturbation]], is conceived as resting solely on penile-vaginal penetration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intimate&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Bryan Strong, Christine DeVault, Theodore F.

====Prevalence====
In 1992, a study conducted by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] found that only 26% of men 18 to 59 and 20% of women 18 to 59 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex; a similar 2005 survey (also conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) found a rising incidence of anal sex relations in the American heterosexual population. The survey showed that 40% of men and 35% of women between 25 and 44 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Mosher, PhD; Anjani Chandra, PhD; and Jo Jones, PhD, [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad362.pdf Sexual Behavior and Selected Health Measures: Men and Women 15–44 Years of Age], U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH &amp; HUMAN SERVICES, Division of Vital Statistics, September 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of overall numbers of survey respondents, seven times as many women as gay men said that they engaged in anal intercourse, with this figure reflecting the larger heterosexual population size.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne-Christine d'Adesky]], ''Expanding Microbicide Research'' in amfAR Global Link – Treatment Insider; May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by Dr. [[Debby Herbenick]] and other researchers, although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/ National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB).] Findings from the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, Center for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University. ''[[Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'', Vol. 7, Supplement 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, this survey provides the most up to date data about anal sex at the population level.

In a 2007 report entitled ''Prevalence and Correlates of Heterosexual Anal and Oral Sex in Adolescents and Adults in the United States'', published in the Journal of Infectious Disease, a national survey of Family Growth found that 34% men and 30% women reported ever participating in heterosexual anal sex. The percentage of participants reporting heterosexual anal sex was significantly higher among 20- to 24-year-olds and peaked among 30- to 34-year-olds.&lt;ref name=&quot;EroticFlow&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eroticflow.com |title=Erotic Flow |publisher=Erotic Flow |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18190267 | doi=10.1086/522867 | volume=196 | issue=12 | title=Prevalence and correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex in adolescents and adults in the United States | year=2007 | month=December | journal=J. Infect. Dis. | pages=1852–9 | author=Leichliter JS, Chandra A, Liddon N, Fenton KA, Aral SO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey in, 2008, focused on a much younger demographic of teenagers and young adults, aged 15–21. It found that 16% of 1350 surveyed had had this type of sex in the previous 3 months, with condoms being used 29% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/18245402/detail.html#- |title=Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the subject matter, the survey hypothesized the prevalence was probably underestimated.&lt;!-- A direct quote would be preferable here --&gt;

In 2009, Kimberly R. McBride published a clinical report in ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]]'' which stated that changing norms may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex behaviors and suggests that there is a role for the ''exotic'' in the sexual repertoires of some heterosexuals&quot; &quot;[F]or a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex...&quot;. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.&lt;ref name=&quot;EroticFlow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heterosexualanal2010&quot;&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; McBride and Janssen found that the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;EroticFlow&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heterosexualanal2010&quot; /&gt;

Figures for prevalence can vary amongst different demographics, regions, and nationalities. A 2001 French survey of five hundred female respondents concluded that a total of 29% had engaged in this practice, with one third of these confirming to have enjoyed the experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Les pratiques sexuelles des Françaises |publisher=TNS/Sofres |url=http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/030701_sexualite_r.htm |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |language=French| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070429151130/http://www.tns-sofres.com/etudes/pol/030701_sexualite_r.htm| archivedate = April 29, 2007}}Survey carried out by TNS/Sofres in a representative sample of 500 women from 18 to 65 years of age, in April and May, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in a 1999 South Korean survey of 586 women, 3.5% of respondents reported having had this type of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.komci.org/GSResult.php?RID=0074KJA/1999.17.3.177&amp;DT=6 |title=한국여성의 성형태에 대한 연구 (Sexual Behavior of Korean Women) |journal=Daehan Namseong Gwahak Hoeji |volume=17 |year=1999 |pages=177–185 |last=Yi |first=Ung-hoe |last2=Sin |first2=Jong-seong |last3=Choe |first3=Hyeong-gi |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures for the prevalence of sexual behavior can also fluctuate over time. Edward O. Laumann's 1992 survey, reported in ''The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States'', found that about 20% of heterosexuals had engaged in male-to-female anal sex. [[Sexology|Sex researcher]] [[Alfred Kinsey]], working in the 1940s, had found that number to be closer to 40% at the time. More recently, a researcher from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 2005 put the number of heterosexuals who have engaged in this practice at between 30% and 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy sex is all in the talk |publisher=The Georgia Straight |date=May 5, 2005 |url=http://www.straight.com/article/healthy-sex-is-all-in-the-talk |accessdate=June 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070629140924/http://www.straight.com/article/healthy-sex-is-all-in-the-talk| archivedate= June 29, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Columbia University]]'s health website [[Go Ask Alice!]]: &quot;Studies indicate that about 25 percent of heterosexual couples have had anal sex at least once, and 10 percent regularly have anal penetration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Not all&quot;/&gt;

===Female to male (pegging)===
[[File:Wiki-pegging.png|thumb|A woman wearing a strap-on dildo about to engage in anal sex with a man.]]

'''Pegging''' is a sexual practice in which a woman penetrates a man's anus with a [[strap-on dildo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730 Savage Love Female-to-Male strap-on sex naming contest], origin of the word Pegging, retrieved May 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Advice columnist [[Dan Savage]] wrote that he believes all men should try pegging at least once, as it may introduce them to a new enjoyable sexual activity and illuminate them to the receiver's perspective in sex.&lt;ref name=sl&gt;These three links chronicle how the term ''pegging'' came into usage.

The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), with information published in the
''[[British Medical Journal]]'' (BMJ), states that, &quot;There are little published data on how many heterosexual men would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship&quot;, but that, &quot;Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin Bell&quot;/&gt;

====Prevalence====
The prevalence of anal sex among homosexual couples in the West has varied over time. Magnus Hirschfeld, in his 1914 work, ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', reported the rate of anal sex among homosexual men surveyed to be 8%, the least favored of all the practices documented.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Percy and John Lauritsen, Review in ''The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'', November–December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, some scholars state that oral sex and mutual masturbation are more common than anal stimulation among gay men in long-term relationships,&lt;ref name=&quot;Not all&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson and Johnson&quot;/&gt; and that, in general, anal intercourse is more popular among homosexual male couples than among heterosexual couples, but that &quot;it ranks behind oral sex and mutual masturbation&quot; among both sexual orientations in prevalence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiten&quot;/&gt;

By the 1950s in the United Kingdom, it was thought that about fifteen percent of male homosexuals had anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;H. Montgomery Hyde, The Love That Dared not Speak its Name; pp.6–7&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}} More recent studies, ''The Gay Urban Men's Study'' (P.I. Stall, UCSF) and the ''Young Men's Study'' (YMS, PI Osmond/Catania, UCSF), indicate that 50% of the surveyed men who have sex with men engage in anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;The Gay Urban Men's Study (P.I. Stall, UCSF)&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}&lt;ref&gt;Young Men's Study (YMS, PI Osmond/Catania, UCSF)&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}} The 1994 Laumann study suggests that 80% of gay men practice it and 20% never engage in it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Laumann, E., Gagnon, J.H., Michael, R.T., and Michaels, S.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press (Also reported in the companion volume, Michael et al, Sex in America: A Definitive Survey, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), with information published in the
''[[British Medical Journal]]'' (BMJ), states that two thirds of gay men have anal sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin Bell&quot;/&gt; Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have anal sex at one time or another in their lives, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Underwood&quot;/&gt; A survey in ''[[The Advocate]]'' in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Underwood&quot;/&gt; A survey conducted from 1994 to 1997 in San Francisco by the [[Stop AIDS Project]] indicated that over the course of the study, among men who have sex with men, the proportion engaging in anal sex increased from 57.6% to 61.2%.&lt;ref name = &quot;cdc.gov-Rectal&quot;&gt;Center for Disease Control, ''Increases in Unsafe Sex and Rectal Gonorrhea Among Men Who Have Sex With Men – San Francisco, California, 1994–1997''[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/00056314.htm].

====Pain====
Pain during receptive anal sex is formally known as anodyspareunia.&lt;ref name=Heidelbaugh/&gt; One study found that about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue, and concluded that the perception of anal sex as painful is just as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based.&lt;ref name=Ritter_Terndrup&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0sHWnt9WmRsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Handbook+of+affirmative+psychotherapy+with+lesbians+and+gay+men&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I4JVTd38KoK8sAPGt9HSBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Handbook of affirmative psychotherapy with lesbians and gay men] By Kathleen Ritter, Anthony I.

There is less research on anal sexual activity among [[women who have sex with women]] compared to couples of other sexual orientations, but stimulating the anus for sexual pleasure is stated to be a part of many lesbians' sex lives; the anus can be rimmed – the tongue moved around its edge – stroked or [[Fingering (sexual act)|penetrated with the fingers]] or a [[dildo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loulan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author =JoAnn Loulan|title =Lesbian sex|isbn = 0-933216-13-0, 9780933216136|publisher=The University of California|year=1984, Digitized Oct 31, 2008|pages=309 pages|accessdate=February 3, 2011|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=a+part+of+many+lesbians%27+sex+lives%3B+the+anus+can+be+rimmed+%E2%80%94+the+tongue+moved+around+its+edge+&amp;btnG=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are lesbians who like anal sex and others &quot;who cannot bear the thought of it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harding&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kat Harding|title=The Lesbian Kama Sutra|isbn = 0-312-33585-7, 9780312335854|publisher=Macmillan|year=2006 |pages=144 pages|accessdate=February 3, 2011|url=http://books.google.com/?id=m5RkdiYYMBMC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Lesbians+and+anal+sex#v=onepage&amp;q=Lesbians%20and%20anal%20sex&amp;f=false
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques and [[lesbian sexual practices]] they used in their last ten sexual encounters, 100% reported kissing, sucking on breasts, and manual stimulation of the clitoris; more than 90% reported French kissing, oral sex, and fingers inserted into the vagina; and 80% reported [[tribadism]]. Lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

Women lack that Giggity-spot called the prostate, so anal-loving [lesbians] know much more how anal sex feels as a woman than gay men ever could&quot;, he stated. &quot;Most importantly though, women respond better to women.

==Health risks==
Anal sex can expose participants to two principal dangers: infections due to the high number of infectious [[microorganisms]] not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and the rectum due to their fragility. Increased experimentation with anal sex by people without sound knowledge about risks and what safety measures do and don't work may be linked to an increase in sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref&gt;

carries an elevated risk of passing on sexually transmitted diseases because the anal sphincter is delicate, easily-torn tissue; a tear can provide an entry for pathogens. The high concentration of [[white blood cell]]s around the rectum, together with the risk of tearing and the rectum's function to absorb fluid, places those who engage in unprotected anal sex at high risk of [[sexually transmitted infection]]. Use of [[condom]]s, ample lubrication to reduce the risk of tearing,&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyuw.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=lubrication/&gt; and other [[safer sex]] practices reduce the risk. However, a condom can break or come off during anal sex, so both sex partners must remain watchful during sex and there is still some risk if one or both partners carries a sexually-transmissible infection.&lt;ref&gt;Westheimer, Ruth K. “Sex for Dummies”, Pages 157 in ''Chapter 9: Changing Positions: Variations on a Theme'' For Dummies (2006) ISBN 978-0-470-04523-7 page 432&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of the disease has jumped 160% in men and 78% in women in the last thirty years, according to a 2004 American study. The increase is attributed to changing trends in sexual behavior (such as a history of multiple sex partners, fifteen or more, or receptive anal sex) and smoking. If a current smoker, there is a fourfold increase in risk, though independent of other behavioral risk factors, such as sexual activity. Receptive anal sex increases the incidence sevenfold.&lt;ref name=www.fhcrc.org/&gt; Among the female control group studied, 21.5 percent had reported practicing anal sex, a significant increase from a previous case-control study by [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] Janet Daling (PhD, member of [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|Fred Hutchinson's Public Health Sciences Division]]) and her colleagues, published in 1987, in which 11 percent of female controls had reported ever having anal sex. This and other studies also indicate that gay or bisexual sex among men is on the rise, which may account for the increase in anal cancer.&lt;ref name=www.fhcrc.org/&gt; &quot;The sharpest increase was among African American men, whose incidence of anal cancer has more than doubled in the past three decades. Black men also had a lower survival rate from the disease.&quot; The study reported that the five-year survival rate for black men with early stage disease was 62 percent as compared to 79 percent for white men with localized cancer. However, the survey also reported that black men were more likely than white men to report having had intercourse with another male in the last year. Regarding all the increases, whether or not sexual practices have changed, Daling, concluded, &quot;[I]t also could be that people are just more likely to discuss their sexual behavior these days&quot;.&lt;ref name=www.fhcrc.org/&gt;

A 1993 study published in the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' found that fourteen out of a sample of forty men receiving anal intercourse experienced episodes of frequent anal incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/content/abstract/86/3/144 Effect of anoreceptive intercourse on anorectal function]

[[File:Suzuki Harunobu Shunga.jpg|thumb|[[Suzuki Harunobu]], A [[shunga]] print depicting an older and a younger man]]
Historically, a number of cultures have recorded the practice of anal intercourse between men.

===Ancient and non-Western cultures===
The term &quot;[[Greek love]]&quot; has long been used to refer to the practice, and in modern times, &quot;doing it the Greek way&quot; is sometimes used as slang for anal sex. However, homosexual anal sex was far from a universally accepted practice in [[Ancient Greece]]. It was the target of jokes in surviving comedies; [[Aristophanes]] mockingly alludes to the practice, claiming that &quot;Most citizens are europroktoi (wide-arsed) now&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Eleven-Comediesx46527.html The Eleven Comedies] Aristophanes et al., Part 7 out of 8, retrieved&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pedagogic pederasty]] was an essential element in the education of male youths, these relationships, at least in Athens and Sparta, were expected to steer clear of penetrative sex of any kind. There are very few works of pottery or other art that display anal sex between older men and boys, let alone with adult men. Most such works depict fondling or [[intercrural sex]], which was not condemned for violating and feminizing the boys. Other sources make it clear that the practice was criticized as shameful,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]], &quot;Zeus and Shame&quot; (Perry 109, Chambry 118, Gibbs 528), in ''Fables''&lt;/ref&gt; and seen as a form of [[hubris]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, &quot;Sexuality, Violence, and the Athenian Law of ''Hubris&quot;'' ''Greece and Rome;'' V.38.2 pp171-188&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}
[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n1.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] males on the [[Warren Cup]], British Museum]]

In later [[Greek literature#Roman Age|Roman-era Greek poetry]], anal sex became a common topos, represented as taking place with &quot;eligible&quot; youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing children into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him. Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced heterosexual anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Miller, &quot;The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual?&quot; ''Novum Testamentum'' '''37''' 1 (1995): 9. &quot;Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptability of anal sex thus varied with the time-period and the location, as Ancient Greece spanned a long time and stretched over three continents and two major seas.

For a male citizen to take the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or unchastity). Free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus''. In fact the Romans thought of anal sex as something specifically &quot;Greek&quot;, although Roman men often availed themselves of their own slaves or others in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Quignard, Pascal (1996) ''Le Sexe et l'effroi''&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}

In Japan, records (including detailed [[shunga]]) show that at least some men in relationships with other men did engage in penetrative anal intercourse.
[[File:Larcomuseumanalsex.jpg|thumb|Man and woman having anal sex. Ceramic, [[Moche]] Culture. 300&amp;nbsp;C.E. [[Larco Museum]] Collection]]

Evidence suggestive of widespread heterosexual anal intercourse in a pre-modern culture can be found in the erotic vases, or stirrup-spout pots, made by the [[Moche]] people of Peru; in a survey&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafael Larco Hoyle]] and Dr. Francisco Guerra, quoted in Tannahill, Reay (1992) ''Sex in History'', p. 297-298&lt;/ref&gt; of a collection of these pots, it was found that 31 percent of them depicted heterosexual anal intercourse, more by far than any other sex act. Moche pottery of this type belonged to the world of the dead, which was believed to be a reversal of life. Thus the reverse of common practices was often portrayed. The [[Larco Museum]] houses an erotic gallery in which this pottery is showcased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museolarco.org/iep_er.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century anthropologist [[Richard Francis Burton]] theorized that there is a geographical [[Sotadic zone]] wherein penetrative intercourse between men is particularly prevalent and accepted; moreover he was one of the first writers to advance the premise that such an orientation is biologically determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;burton1885&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/burton-te.html |first=Sir Richard Francis |last=Burton |work=&quot;Terminal Essay&quot;, from his translation of The Arabian Nights |title=Section D: Pederasty |year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western cultures===
In many Western countries, anal sex has generally been [[taboo]] since the [[Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good in Bed Guide to Anal Pleasuring |publisher=Good in Bed Guides |first=Debby |last=Herbenick |isbn=978-0-9843221-6-9 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Christian heresy|heretical]] movements were sometimes attacked by accusations that their members practised anal sex among themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} At that time the mainstream Christian clergy was not celibate, but the highest orders of some heretical sects were, leading to rumours that their celibacy was a sign of their attraction to members of the same sex.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The term ''[[buggery]]'' originated in [[medieval]] Europe as an insult used to describe the rumoured same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in [[Bulgaria]], where its followers were called ''[[bogomil]]s''{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}; when they spread out of the country they were called ''buggres'' (from the [[ethnonym]] ''Bulgars'').{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Another term for the practice, more archaic, is &quot;pedicate&quot; from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''pedicare'', with the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I have derived the word pedicate from the Latin paedicare or pedicare, meaning &quot;to penetrate anally&quot;. in &quot;The Warren Cup: homoerotic love and symposial rhetoric in silver&quot;, Note 6;''The Art Bulletin'', March, 1999 by John Pollini [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_1_81/ai_54517307/pg_30]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance poet [[Pietro Aretino]] advocated the practice in his ''Sonetti Lussuriosi'' (Lust Sonnets).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daileader |first=Celia R. |title=Back Door Sex: Renaissance Gynosodomy, Aretino, and the Exotic |journal=English Literary History |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=303–334 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |date=Summer 2002 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/elh/v069/69.2daileader.pdf |accessdate=April 30, 2007|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070516105828/http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/elh/v069/69.2daileader.pdf| archivedate= May 16, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While men who engaged in homosexual relationships were generally suspected of engaging in anal sex, many such individuals did not. Among these, in recent times, have been [[André Gide]], who found it repulsive;&lt;ref&gt;Love's Litany By Kevin Kopelson p.62&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}} and [[Noël Coward]], who had a horror of disease, and asserted when young that &quot;I'd never do anything – well the disgusting thing they do – because I know I could get something wrong with me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hoare, ''Noel Coward: A Biography'' p.18&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}

====Judaism====
The [[Mishneh Torah]], a text considered authoritative by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] sects,&lt;ref&gt;Isidore Twersky, ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980). passim, and especially Chapter VII, &quot;Epilogue&quot;, pp. 515–538.&lt;/ref&gt; states “since a man’s wife is permitted to him, he may act with her in any manner whatsoever. He may have intercourse with her whenever he so desires and kiss any organ of her body he wishes, and he may have intercourse with her naturally or unnaturally [traditionally, this refers to anal and oral sex], provided that he does not expend semen to no purpose. Nevertheless, it is an attribute of piety that a man should not act in this matter with levity and that he should sanctify himself at the time of intercourse.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mishneh Torah |first=Moshe |last=Maimonides |page=Laws Concerning Forbidden Relations 21:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
In Christian countries,{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} anal sex is sometimes referred to euphemistically as the ''peccatum contra naturam'' (the sin against nature, after [[Thomas Aquinas]]) or ''Sodomitica luxuria'' (sodomitical lusts, in one of Charlemagne's ordinances), or ''peccatum illud horribile, inter christianos non nominandum'' (that horrible sin that among Christians is not to be named).

====Islam====
{{Main|Islamic views on anal sex}}
''Liwat'', or the sin of Lot's people, is officially prohibited by most Islamic sects. There are parts of the Qur'an which talk about smiting on [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are [[hadith]] and Islamic laws which prohibit it. Same sex male practitioners of anal relations are called ''luti'' or ''lutiyin'' in plural and are seen as criminals in the same way that a thief is a criminal, meaning that they are giving in to a universal temptation.

====Buddhism====
{{Further|Sexuality and Buddhism|LGBT topics and Buddhism}}
The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics is the [[The Five Precepts|Five Precepts]].  These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal  undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Precepts is &quot;To refrain from committing [[sexual misconduct]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=HIGG&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  However, &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Kāmesu micchācāra'' literally &quot;sense gratifications arising from the 5 senses&quot;&quot;) is subject  to interpretation relative to the social norms of the followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4ui.com/eart/199eart1.htm |title=Sexual Misconduct – The third Precept |first=Jeffrey |last=Po|work=4ui.com |accessdate=March 22, 2010|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In  fact, Buddhism, in its fundamental form, does not define what is right  and what is wrong in absolute terms for [[Laity|lay followers]]. Therefore the interpretation of  what kinds of sexual activity are acceptable for a [[layman]] is not a religious matter as far  as Buddhism is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;GLBT in World Religions, Sermon by Rev. Gabriele Parks, along with Phil Manos and Bill Weber.[http://www.tpuuf.org/2008/08/03/glbt-in-world-religions/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] teaches that all craving, including sexual craving, is a hindrance  to [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. Buddhist [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s of most traditions are expected to refrain from all sexual activity and take [[vows of celibacy]]; lay people, however, are not expected to refrain from any specific form of sexual activity, and there is no concept of sinfulness attached to sex.
