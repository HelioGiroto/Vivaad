'''BDSM''' or ''('''B'''ondage, '''D'''iscipline, '''S'''adism, '''M'''asochism)'' is a preference and sometimes form of personal relationship centering around activities that are erotic but may not be sexual, and which may include the consensual use of restraint, intense sensory stimulation, and fantasy power [[sexual roleplaying|role play]]. Practitioners of BDSM vary hugely in their perception of what activities are integral to BDSM, and some borderline activities (light bondage, hot wax, blindfolds) may be practiced by people identifying as &quot;vanilla&quot; (i.e., not into BDSM) – so inclusion in the community is usually dependent on self-proclaimed identification with the community. Although there are many people who identify as being into BDSM who don't share the experience with anyone besides play- or sexual partners, &quot;BDSM&quot; is also used to denote a subculture of people interested in BDSM who may socialize together, educate each other, and throw &quot;play parties&quot; at which BDSM activities are welcome. Local public BDSM communities often have strong ties with distant BDSM communities, with popular educators traveling widely; large events attracting attendees from wide areas (and occasionally internationally); popular speakers, authors, or players gaining relative celebratory status; and websites attracting over a million members.

[[File:BDSM acronym.svg|thumb|The BDSM acronym]]
The term BDSM was coined as a condensed acronym in the 1990s to combine communities and practices that had a significant amount of crossover – [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[Discipline (BDSM)|discipline]] (B&amp;D or B/D), [[dominance and submission]] (D&amp;S or D/s), and [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochism or sadism and masochism]] (S&amp;M or S/M). BDSM is currently frequently used as a catch-all phrase to includes a wide range of activities, forms of [[interpersonal relationship]]s, and distinct [[subculture]]s which may or may not fit well into the original three intended categories. With an ethos of &quot;your kink is OK!&quot; many BDSM communities welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, extreme [[body mod]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay|animal players]], latex or rubber aficionados, and others.

Although it's increasingly common{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} for couples – particularly younger couples – to have &quot;power neutral&quot; relationships and/or play styles, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants' taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of informed consent of both the partners becomes essential. Typically participants who are active – applying the activity – are known as [[Top (BDSM)|tops]], those who exercise control over others are commonly known as [[Dominant (BDSM)|dominants]], and those who inflict pain are known as sadists. These are often the same person, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Similarly, those participants who are recipients of the activities are typically known as [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottoms]], those who are controlled by their partners as submissives, and those who receive pain as masochists; again, these are frequently the same person and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Individuals who alternate between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles – whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship – are known as [[Switch (BDSM)|switches]], though the term is occasionally seen as derogatory or unnuanced and is rejected by many who might simplistically fit the definition. Precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate, reflection, and discussion within the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&amp;D, S&amp;M, D&amp;S, &quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot; mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995,`1997|accessdate=2008-01-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==

BDSM has become an umbrella term for certain kinds of erotic behavior between consenting adults, but there is little that unites all its disparate [[subculture]]s.

Terminology for roles varies widely within the various BDSM subcultures. [[Top (BDSM)|Top]] and [[Top (BDSM)|Dominant]] are widely recognized for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically active or controlling participants. [[Bottom (BDSM)|Bottom]] and [[Bottom (BDSM)|Submissive]] are widely recognized terms for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically receptive or controlled participants. The interaction between Tops and Bottoms—where physical and/or mental control of the Bottom is surrendered to the Top—is sometime known as [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]], whether in the context of an encounter or a relationship.

BDSM actions can often take place during a specific period of time agreed to by both parties, referred to as &quot;play&quot;, &quot;a [[Scene (BDSM)|scene]]&quot; or &quot;a session&quot;. Participants usually derive pleasure from this even though many of the practices—such as inflicting pain or [[humiliation]] or being restrained—would be unpleasant under normal circumstances. [[Sexual intercourse]]—be it [[Oral sex|oral]], [[Anal Sex|anal]] or [[Vaginal sex|vaginal]]—may occur within a session; but it is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Miller, Molly Devon, William A. Granzig : ''Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism.'', page 55, Mystic Rose Books 1995, ISBN 978-0-9645960-0-9&lt;/ref&gt; Such explicit sexual interaction is seen only rarely in public play spaces, and it is sometimes specifically banned by the rules of a party or playspace.

The fundamental principles for the exercise of BDSM require that it should be performed with the informed consent of all involved parties. Since the 1980s, many practitioners and organizations have adopted the motto (originally from the statement of purpose of GMSMA – a gay SM activist organization) &quot;Safe, sane and consensual&quot;, commonly abbreviated as &quot;SSC,&quot; which means that everything is based on safe activities, that all participants be of sufficiently sound/sane mind to consent, and that all participants do consent.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 64, Publisher: Daedalus Publishing Company 2006, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9&lt;/ref&gt; It is mutual consent which makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between BDSM and such crimes as sexual assault or [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html|title = VICSS / Difference between Abuse and Power Exchange by the NLA, Dutch SM Media Information Center and Powerrotics|accessdate = 2007-12-10| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071216091307/http://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html| archivedate= 16 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behavior that differs from &quot;SSC&quot; and described as &quot;Risk Aware Consensual Kink&quot; (RACK), indicating a preference of a style in which the ''individual'' responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly, with each participant being responsible for his or her own well-being. Advocates of RACK argue that SSC can hamper discussion of risk because no activity is truly &quot;safe,&quot; and that discussion of even low-risk possibilities is necessary for truly informed consent. Further, they argue that setting a discrete line between &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;not-safe&quot; activities ideologically denies consenting adults the right to evaluate risks vs rewards for themselves (and that some adults will be drawn to certain activities regardless of the risk), and that BDSM play – particularly higher-risk play or edgeplay – should be treated with the same regard as extreme sports; with both respect and the demand that practitioners educate themselves and practice to decrease risk. RACK may be seen as focusing primarily upon awareness and informed consent, rather than accepted safe practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.withinreality.com/rackssc.html|title = Rack vs. SSC|accessdate = 2006-11-13|year = 2003|work = Within Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Informed consent#Sex|Consent]] is the most important criterion here. The consent and compliance for a sadomasochistic situation can be granted only by people who are able to judge the potential results. For their consent, they must have relevant information (extent to which the scene will go, potential risks, if a safeword will be used, what that is, and so on.) at hand and the necessary mental capacity to judge. The resulting consent and understanding is occasionally summarized in a written &quot;[[Contract (BDSM)|contract]]&quot;; an agreement of what can and cannot take place.&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book, Greenery Press (CA) 2002, ISBN 978-1-890159-36-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, BDSM play is usually structured such that it is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent during a scene;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 72, Greenery Press (CA) 2002, ISBN 978-1-890159-36-8&lt;/ref&gt; for example, by using a [[safeword]] that was agreed on in advance.&lt;ref name=sm101&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Jay Wiseman |last=Wiseman |first=Jay |title=SM 101: A Realistic Introduction |publisher=Greenery Press |location=California |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-9639763-8-3 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 71, Greenery Press (CA) 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the agreed safeword (or occasionally a &quot;safe symbol&quot; such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell) is seen by some as an explicit withdrawal of consent. Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law,&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt; since the bottom has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions which follow the use of the safeword (see [[BDSM#Legal status|Legal status]]). For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning (&quot;this is getting too intense&quot;) rather than explicit withdrawal of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all. In some scenes it may be impossible for consent to be withdrawn in the middle of a scene – or the bottom may have the ability to revoke consent for a relationship as a whole, but not for a particular scene. This is sometimes the case for &quot;punishment scenes&quot; between master/slave couples or for some extreme or edgeplay scenes which may include abductions, rape play, or interrogation. This scene dynamic may be referred to as &quot;consensual nonconsent.&quot;

===Safety===
{{See also|Negotiation (BDSM)|Risk-aware consensual kink}}
Aside from the general advice related to [[safe sex]], BDSM sessions often require a wider array of safety precautions than [[vanilla sex]] (sexual behavior without BDSM elements).&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt;

In theory, to ensure consent related to BDSM activity, pre-play [[Negotiation (BDSM)|negotiations]] are commonplace, especially among partners who do not know each other very well. In practice, pick-up scenes at clubs or parties may sometimes be low in negotiation (much as pick-up sex from singles bars may not involve much negotiation or disclosure). Ideally, these negotiations concern the interests and fantasies of each partner and establish a framework.&lt;ref&gt;David Stein: ''S/M's Copernican Revolution:From a Closed World to the Infinite Universe'' and ''Safe Sane Consensual: The Evolution of a Shibboleth'' available at [http://www.lthredge.com/ds/history.htm s/m-leather history] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of discussion is a typical &quot;unique selling proposition&quot; of BDSM sessions and quite commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, pages 80–94, Daedalus Publishing Company 1996, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[safeword]]s are often arranged to provide for an immediate stop of any activity if any participant should so desire.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cameron, Don Kulick: Language and Sexuality, Page 24, Cambridge University Press 2003, ISBN 978-0-521-00969-0&lt;/ref&gt; Safewords are, by definition, not commonly used words during any kind of play. Words such as &quot;no&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, and &quot;don't&quot;, are often not appropriate as a safeword if the roleplaying aspect includes the illusion of non-consent. A safeword ought to be something both parties can remember and call to mind or recognize when things are either not going as planned or have crossed a threshold one cannot handle. The most common used form of safewords are &quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, and &quot;red&quot;. &quot;Red&quot; meaning to stop and there would be no further play. &quot;Yellow&quot; being, &quot;This is getting too intense&quot;. &quot;Green&quot; meaning that everything is okay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  At most clubs and group-organized BDSM parties and events, [[Dungeon Monitor|Dungeon monitor]]s provide a safety net for the people playing there, ensuring that house rules are followed and safe words respected.

BDSM participants need to understand practical safety aspects.  For instance, they must recognize that parts of the body can be damaged, such as nerves and blood vessels by [[contusion]], or skin that can be scarred. Using [[Crop (implement)|crops]], [[whip]]s, or [[Cat of nine tails|floggers]], the top's fine motor skills and anatomical knowledge can make the difference between a satisfying session for the bottom, and a highly unpleasant experience that may even entail severe physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph W. Bean: Flogging, Greenery Press (CA), 2000, ISBN 978-1-890159-27-6&lt;/ref&gt; The very broad range of different [[Sex toy|BDSM &quot;toys&quot;]] and physical and psychological control techniques often requires a far-reaching knowledge of details related to the requirements of the individual session, such as [[anatomy]], [[physics]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Rinella: The Toybag Guide Series, Greenery Press (CA), e.g. The Toybag Guide to Hot Wax and Temperature Play, ISBN 978-1-890159-57-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann, ''Das Lexikon des Sadomasochismus. Der Inside-Führer zur dunklen Erotik: Praktiken und Instrumente, Personen und Institutionen, Literatur und Film, Politik und Philosophie.'', Page 42, Schwarzkopf &amp; Schwarzkopf 2000, ISBN 978-3-89602-290-5 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Miller, Molly Devon, William A. Granzig : ''Screw the Nipples, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism.'', PP. 95, Mystic Rose Books 1995, ISBN 978-0-9645960-0-9&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these risks, BDSM activities usually result in far less severe injuries than sports like boxing and football, and BDSM practitioners do not visit emergency rooms more often than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Iantaffi|Gupta|2007|pp=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is necessary to be able to identify each person's psychological [[wikt:Squick|squicks]] or ''&quot;freakouts&quot;'' in advance in order to avoid them. Such losses of emotional balance due to sensory or emotional overload are a fairly commonly discussed issue. It is important to follow their reactions [[Empathy|empathetically]] and continue or stop accordingly.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 111&lt;/ref&gt; For some players, sparking &quot;freakouts&quot; or deliberately using triggers may be a desired outcome.

== Aspects ==
The initialism BDSM includes psychological and physiological facets:

* Bondage &amp; Discipline (''B&amp;D'')
* Dominance &amp; Submission (''D&amp;S'')
* Sadism &amp; Masochism (or Sadomasochism) (''S&amp;M'')
* Types of Play

This model for differentiating among these three aspects of BDSM is increasingly used in literature today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terms&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, it is only an attempt at phenomenological differentiation. Individual tastes and preferences in the area of sexuality may overlap among these areas, which are discussed separately here.

=== Bondage and discipline ===
{{Main|Bondage (sexual)|Discipline (BDSM)|l1=Bondage|l2=Discipline}}
[[File:Tapegag (Bondage) 2 girls in rubber-leather.jpg|thumb|right|Two women tapegagged and cuffed to iron bars]]
Bondage and Discipline are two aspects of BDSM that do not seem to relate to one another because of the type of the activities involved, but they have conceptual similarities, and that is why they appear jointly. Contrary to the other two types, B/D does not define the Tops and Bottoms itself, and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;&gt;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix, 2010, Lulu.com, ISBN 978-0-557-64184-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Bondage&quot; describes the practice of Physical restraining. Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias T. J. Grimme: ''Das Bondage-Handbuch. Anleitung zum erotischen Fesseln''. Charon-Verlag, Hamburg 1999, ISBN 978-3-931406-16-5. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; While bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of BDSM, it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated from the rest of this field.&lt;ref&gt;Lee &quot;Bridgett&quot;Harrington: Shibari You Can Use: Japanese Rope Bondage and Erotic Macramé, Mystic Productions 2007, ISBN 978-0-615-14490-0.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies among BDSM practitioners in the US have shown that about half of all men find the idea of bondage to be erotic; many women do as well. Strictly speaking, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains to a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|St. Andrews cross]] or [[spreader bar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jay |last=Wiseman |title=Jay Wiseman's Erotic Bondage Handbook |publisher=Greenery Press |location=CA |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-890159-13-9 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Discipline&quot; describes the Psychological restraining, with the use of rules and punishment to control overt behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt; Punishment can be pain caused physically (such as caning), humiliation caused psychologically (such as a public flagellation) or loss of freedom caused physically (for example, chaining the Bottom to the foot of a bed). Another aspect is the structured training of the Bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism: How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 71. Daedalus Publishing Company, 1996, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominance and submission ===
{{Main|Dominance and submission (BDSM)}}
&quot;Dominance and submission&quot; (also known as '''D&amp;s''', '''Ds''' or '''D/s''') is a set of behaviors, customs and rituals relating to the giving and accepting of control of one individual over another in an erotic or lifestyle context. It explores the more mental aspect of BDSM. This is also the case in many relationships not considering themselves as sadomasochistic; it is considered to be a part of BDSM if it is practiced purposefully. The range of its individual characteristics is thereby wide.&lt;ref name=BBC20050922 &gt;{{cite news |title=Face to face: Dominatrix and submissive |date=22 September 2005 |newspaper=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4271098.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bent forward strappado.jpg|thumb|right|[[Strappado bondage|Strappado]] with rope and a [[spreader bar]]. This practice has a distinct effect of immobilization and pain.]]

Examples of mentally oriented practices are ''education games'', during which the dominant requires certain forms of behavior from the submissive. Special forms include erotic roleplay like [[ageplay]], in which a difference in age, either real or enacted, formulates the background; or [[Human animal roleplay|petplay]]. Concerted deployed sexual rejection exercised on the partner can be an aspect of ''Dominance and Submission'' as well. The most established and probably most cliché set form of dominance and submission is ''Dominance and slavery''. These can be administered for the short duration of a session among otherwise-emancipated partners, but also can be integrated into everyday life indefinitely. In a few relationships, it leads as far as total submission of one partner in the truest sense of the phrase ''total power exchange''. Compensating elements of the total dominance and submission are care and devotion complementing one another, thus facilitating stable relationships. The consensual submission of the submissive is sometimes demonstrated to others by symbols indicating his/her belonging to the dominant, such as [[Collar (BDSM)|wearing a collar]], special [[tattoo]]s, [[Body piercing|piercings]], a very short haircut or a bald head.

Often, &quot;[[Contract (BDSM)|slave contracts]]&quot; are set out in writing to record the formal consent of the parties to the power exchange, stating their common vision of the relationship dynamic. The purpose of this kind of agreement is primarily to encourage discussion and negotiation in advance, and then to document that understanding for the benefit of all parties. Such documents have not been recognized as being legally binding, nor are they intended to be. These agreements are binding in the sense that the parties have the expectation that the negotiated rules will be followed. Often other friends and community members may witness the signing of such a document in a ceremony, and so parties violating their agreement can result in loss of face, respect or status with their friends in the community.

In general as compared to conventional relationships, BDSM participants go to great lengths to negotiate the important aspects of their relationships in advance, and to take great care in learning about and following safe practices.

=== Sadomasochism ===
[[File:spank2.jpg|thumb|[[Erotic spanking]] on a male Bottom.]]

{{Main|Sadomasochism}}

The term ''sadomasochism'' is derived from the words ''sadism'' and ''masochism'' (see [[BDSM#Etymology|Etymology]]). In the context of consensual erotic activities, sadism and masochism are not strictly accurate terms; there is a significant difference from the medical or psychological usage of both terms. Sadomasochism refers to the aspects of BDSM surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain. Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting [[pain]], degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being hurt, humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario. Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM – for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised – and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties. Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures). 

Discipline often incorporates sadomasochistic aspects, though some sadomasochists distance themselves from D/s practices such as punishment. Sadomasochism is practiced in isolation relatively rarely, though some masochists report biting, pinching, or even stun-gunning themselves as a prelude to, or as part of, masturbation.

In D/S the Dominant is the Top and the submissive is the Bottom.  In S/M the Sadist is usually the Top and the Masochist the Bottom, but these roles are frequently more complicated or jumbled (as in the case of Dominant Masochists who may arrange for their submissive to carry out s/m activities on them). As in B/D the declaration of the Top/Bottom may be required,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt; though Sadomasochists may also play without any Power Exchange at all, with both partners equally in control of the play.

On a physical level BDSM is commonly misconceived to be &quot;all about pain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Iantaffi|Gupta|2007|pp=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often though BDSM practitioners are primarily concerned with power, humiliation, and pleasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker13&quot;/&gt; Of the three categories of BDSM only sadomasochism specifically requires pain, but this is typically a vehicle for feelings of humiliation, dominance, etc. The aspects of D/S and B/D may not include physical suffering at all, but include the sensations inherited by different emotions of the mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker13&quot;/&gt; Dominance &amp; Submission of power is an entirely different experience, and is not always psychologically associated with physical pain. Many BDSM activities might not involve any kind of pain or humiliation, but just the exchange of Powers (Power Exchange).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;barker13&quot;/&gt; During the activities, the practitioners may feel [[endorphin]]s comparable to the so-called &quot;runner's high&quot; or to the afterglow of [[orgasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Jeff (1988).

Some use the term &quot;body stress&quot; to describe this physiological sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Fries, DS (2002). Opioid Analgesics. In Williams DA, Lemke TL. Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry (5th ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. ISBN 978-0-683-30737-5&lt;/ref&gt; This experience of [[algolagnia]] is important, but is not the only motivation for many BDSM practitioners. The philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] defines this sensation of pleasure derived from pain by the word ''sublime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=On Taste: On the Sublime and Beautiful; Reflections on the French Revolution; A Letter to a Noble Lord; with Introduction, Notes and Illustrations |first=Edmund |last=Burke |publisher=P. F. Collier &amp; son |year=1909 |postscript= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide array of BDSM practitioners who take part in sessions for which they do not receive any personal gratification. They enter such situations solely with the intention to allow their partners to fulfill their own needs and/or [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]]. They do this in exchange of money for the session activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;

In some BDSM sessions, the Top exposes the Bottom to a wide range of sensual impressions, for example: pinching, biting, scratching with fingernails, [[spanking]] or the use of various objects such as [[Crop (implement)|crops]], [[whip]]s, liquid [[wax]], [[Ice cube|icecubes]], [[Wartenberg wheel]]s, [[erotic electrostimulation]] or others.&lt;ref&gt;William Brame, Gloria Brame: Different Loving: The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission (Paperback), Villard, 1996, ISBN 978-0-679-76956-9&lt;/ref&gt; Fixation by [[handcuff]]s, [[rope]]s or [[chain]]s may be used as well. The repertoire of possible &quot;toys&quot; is limited only by the imagination of both partners. To some extent, everyday items like [[Clothespin|clothes-pins]], [[wooden spoon]]s or [[plastic wrap]] are used as pervertables.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Varrin: The Art Of Sensual Female Dominance: A Guide for Women, Citadel, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8065-2089-6&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly considered that a pleasurable BDSM experience during a session is very strongly dependent upon the top's competence and experience and the bottom's physical and mental state at the time of the session. Trust and [[sexual arousal]] help the partners enter a shared mindset.&lt;ref&gt;John Warren, PhD: The Loving Dominant, Greenery Press (CA), 2nd Rev Ed, ISBN 978-1-890159-20-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Daedalus Publishing Company 1996, ISBN 978-1-881943-12-9&lt;/ref&gt; Some BDSM practitioners compare related sensations with musical compositions and representation, in which single sensual impressions are the musical notes of the situation. From this point of view, different sensuous impressions are combined to create a total experience leaving a lasting impression.

== Relationships ==

=== Roles ===

==== Top and bottom ====
[[File:Collar 01.JPG|thumb|A typical slave collar with ring for possible attachment of a leash. Such or comparable models are sometimes used by bottoms as a symbol of ownership to their tops.]]
{{Main|Top (BDSM)|Bottom (BDSM)}}

In a BDSM relationship the partner who has the active role in a session or in the entire relationship is described as the &quot;top,&quot; a role that often involves inflicting pain, degradation or subjugation. The partner referred to as the &quot;bottom&quot; submits voluntarily to the actions of the top.

Although the top is usually also the dominant partner and the bottom the submissive partner, it is not inevitably so. In some cases the top (known in this case as a [[service top]]) follows instructions from the bottom according to the bottom's desires and in a way the bottom expressly requires. If the bondage/discipline aspect of BDSM involves a top actively performing a skill while a bottom willingly submits, then the dominance/submission aspect here is reversed from what is typically expected.

In contrast, a '''dominant top''' controls their '''submissive bottom''' partner, sometimes by using physical or psychological techniques, although consent is always established first. This power relationship is so common, &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;submissive&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably in the BDSM community.

A similar distinction also may apply to bottoms. At one end of the spectrum are those who are indifferent to, or even reject physical stimulation. At the other end of the spectrum are bottoms who enjoy discipline and [[erotic humiliation]] but are not willing to be subordinate to the person who applies it. The bottom is frequently the partner who specifies the basic conditions of the session and gives instructions, directly or indirectly, in the negotiation, while the top often respects this guidance. Other bottoms often called &quot;brats&quot; try to incur punishment from their tops by provoking them or &quot;misbehaving.&quot; Nevertheless a small, very puristic &quot;school&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.submissiveguide.com/2009/01/5-ways-to-recognize-topping-from-the-bottom/ 5 Ways to Recognize Topping from the Bottom]&lt;/ref&gt; exists within the BDSM community, which regards such &quot;topping from the bottom&quot; as rude or even incompatible with the standards of BDSM relations.

==== Switch ====
{{Main|Switch (BDSM)}}
BDSM practitioners may also &quot;switch,&quot; meaning they play either or both roles. He or she may practice this with one or more specific partners. The many reasons for switching are often very subjective and sometimes situational. A switch may simply enjoy both top and bottom roles or may be experimenting. Sometimes a relationship with a partner of the same primary preference (for example, two tops) requires switching to fulfill various BDSM needs within that relationship. Some change roles but do not regard themselves as switches as they do so irregularly or under specific circumstances only.

=== Types of relationships ===

==== Play ====
[[File:Sling.jpg|thumb|A typical BDSM &quot;sling&quot; .]]

BDSM practitioners sometimes regard the practice of BDSM in their sex life as [[sexual roleplaying|role playing]] and so often use the terms &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Playing&quot; to describe activities where they're in their perspective roles. Play of this sort for a specified period of time is often called a &quot;Session&quot;, and the contents and the circumstances of play are often referred to as the &quot;Scene&quot;. It is also common in personal relationships to use the term &quot;Kink Play&quot; for BDSM activities, or more specific terms for the type of activity. The relationships can be of varied types.

==== Long term ====
Early writings on BDSM both by the academic and BDSM community spoke little of long-term relationships with some in the Gay Leather community suggesting short-term play relationships to be the only feasible relationship models, and recommending people to get married and &quot;play&quot; with BDSM outside of marriage. In recent times though writers of BDSM and sites for BDSM have been more focused on long-term relationships.

A 2003 study, the first to look at these relationships, fully demonstrated that &quot;quality long-term functioning relationships&quot; exist among practitioners of BDSM, with either sex being the top or bottom (homosexual couples were not looked at).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents in the study expressed their BDSM orientation to be built into who they are, but considered exploring their BDSM interests an ongoing task, and showed flexibility and adaptability in order to match their interests with their partners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;perfect match&quot; where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare, and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The BDSM activities that the couples partook in varied in sexual to nonsexual significance for the partners who reported doing certain BDSM activities for &quot;couple bonding, stress release, and spiritual quests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most reported issue amongst respondents was not finding enough time to be in role with most adopting a 24/7 lifestyle wherein both partners maintain their dominant or submissive role throughout the day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the respondents it was typically the bottoms who wanted to play harder, and be more restricted into their roles when there was a difference in desire to play in the relationship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study, Bert Cutler, speculated that tops may be less often in the mood to play due to the increased demand for responsibility on their part: being aware of the safety of the situation and prepared to remove the bottom from a dangerous scenario, being conscious of the desires and limits of the bottom, and so on.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The author of the study stressed that successful long-term BDSM relationships came after &quot;early and thorough disclosure&quot; from both parties of their BDSM interests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Many of those engaged in long-term BDSM relationships learned their skills from larger BDSM organizations and communities&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a lot of discussion by the respondents on the amount of control the top possessed in the relationships with almost non-existent discussion of the top &quot;being better, or smarter, or of more value&quot; than the bottom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Couples were generally of the same mind of whether or not they were in 24/7 relationship, but noted that in such cases the bottom is not locked up 24/7, but that their role in the context of the relationship was always present, even when the top is doing non-dominant activities such as household chores: cleaning, taking out the trash, and so on., or the bottom being in a more dominant position.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In its conclusion the study states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The respondents valued themselves, their partners, and their relationships.  All couples expressed considerable good will toward their partners.  The power exchange between the cohorts appears to be serving purposes beyond any sexual satisfaction, including experiencing a sense of being taken care of and bonding with a partner.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The study further goes on to list three aspects that made the successful relationships work: early disclosure of interests and continued transparency, a commitment to personal growth, and the use of the dominant/submissive roles as a tool to maintain the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his closing remarks the author of the study theorizes that due to the serious potential for harm that couples in BDSM relationships develop increased communication that may be higher than in mainstream relationships&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Professional services ====
A professional [[dominatrix]] or [[professional dominant]], often referred to within the culture as a &quot;pro-domme&quot;, offers services encompassing the range of bondage, discipline, and dominance in exchange for money. Such professional services might not include sexual intercourse, and may and may not include masturbation or ejaculation of semen by other means. In many cases, the gratification or climax of the client does not include direct orgasm, and is dealt respectively. It is common among dominatrices to separate themselves from prostitutes, though there are plenty of prostitutes who also work as professional dominatrices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;

The term &quot;Dominatrix&quot; is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. A non-professional dominant woman is more commonly referred to simply as a &quot;Domme&quot;, &quot;Dominant&quot;, or &quot;Femdom&quot;. There are also services provided by professional female submissives (&quot;pro-subs&quot;). A professional submissive consents to her client's dominant behavior within negotiated limits, and often works within a professional [[dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]]. Although far more rare [[professional submissive]]s do exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professionalsubmissives.com/ Directory of Professional Submssives]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the people who work as subs normally have tendencies towards such activities, especially when sadomasochism is involved.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Males also work as professional &quot;Tops&quot; in BDSM, and are called &quot;Masters&quot; or &quot;Doms&quot;. However it is much more rare to find a male in this profession. (It should also be noted that a male &quot;pro-dom&quot; typically only works with male clientele)&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt;

==BDSM Scene==

In BDSM, a '''scene''' is the stage or setting where BDSM activity takes place, as well as the activity itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xeromag.com/fvbdglossary.html The Kinky Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.domsub.info/glossary.shtml Dom Sub Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.7dvt.com/2010kink-101 Lauren Ober&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mistresssky.com/terms.html Mistress Sky terms&lt;/ref&gt; The physical place where a BDSM activity takes place is usually called a [[Dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]], though some prefer less dramatic terms, including &quot;playspace,&quot; or &quot;club.&quot;. A BDSM activity can, but need not, involve [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[sexual roleplay]]. A characteristic of many [[BDSM relationship]]s is the [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] from the [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] to the [[dominance and submission|dominant]] partner, and [[Bondage (sexual)#Bondage in BDSM|bondage]] features prominently in BDSM scenes and [[sexual roleplay]].

The term is also used in the BDSM community to refer to the BDSM community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|ref = harv|last = Aggrawal|first = Anil|year = 2008|title = Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;dq|publisher  = CRC Press|isbn = 978-1-4200-4308-2|accessdate = 5 July 2010}} P.147-148, 154, 172, 174&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

A scene can take place in private between two or more people, and can involve a domestic arrangement, such as [[servitude (BDSM)|servitude]] or a casual or committed lifestyle [[Master/slave (BDSM)|master/slave relationship]]. BDSM elements may involve settings of [[Master/slave (BDSM)#Slave training|slave training]] or punishment for breaches of instructions.

A scene can also take place in a club, where the [[Play (BDSM)|play]] can be viewed by others. When a scene takes place in a public setting, it may be because the participants enjoy being watched by others, or because of the [[bondage equipment|equipment]] available, or because having third parties present adds safety for play partners who have only recently met.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novad.org/Primer/Definitions.html Novad Primer Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

===BDSM etiquette===
A scene takes place within the general conventions and [[etiquette]] of BDSM, such as requirements for mutual [[Consent (BDSM)|consent]] and agreement as to the [[Limits (BDSM)|limits]] of any BDSM activity. This agreement can be incorporated into a [[Contract (BDSM)|formal contract]]. In addition, most clubs have additional rules which regulate how onlookers may interact with the actual participants in a scene.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nybondageclub.com/gay-male-bdsm-leather-slave-discipline-scene.html NY Bondage Club guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subculture ==
{{See also|BDSM in culture and media}}
[[File:S&amp;M Dungeon 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Spanking with a [[paddle (spanking)|paddle]] in a BDSM dungeon in New York City.]]

Today the BDSM culture exists in most western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidebdsm.com/Club-&amp;amp-Munch-Directory |title=Worldwide Club and Munch Directory|accessdate=2007-12-11|work=worldwidebdsm.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071227032451/http://www.worldwidebdsm.com/Club-&amp;amp-Munch-Directory| archivedate= 27 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This offers BDSM practitioners the opportunity to discuss BDSM relevant topics and problems with like-minded people. This culture is often viewed as a [[subculture]], mainly because BDSM is often still regarded as &quot;unusual&quot; by some of the public. Many people hide their leaning from society since they are afraid of the incomprehension and of social exclusion. It is commonly known in the BDSM culture that there are practitioners living on all continents, but there is no documented evidence for many countries (due to restrictive laws and censorship motivated by politics or religion) except their presence in online BDSM communities and dating sites.

This scene appears particularly on the Internet, in publications, and in meetings such as SM parties, gatherings called [[Munch (BDSM)|munches]], and erotic fairs. The annual [[Folsom Street Fair]] is the world's largest BDSM event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folsomstreetfair.org/|title=Folsom Street Fair|accessdate=2007-12-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071215163221/http://folsomstreetfair.org/| archivedate= 15 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in the gay leather movement. There are also conventions like [[National Leather Association International|Living in Leather]], [[TESfest]], Shibaricon, Spankfest, and [[Black Rose (BDSM organization)|Black Rose]]. North American cities that have large BDSM communities include New York City, Washington D.C., [[Baltimore]], [[Atlanta]], [[Seattle]], [[Denver]], Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, [[Houston]], [[Philadelphia]], San Francisco, [[San Diego]], [[Dallas]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Vancouver]]. European cities with large BDSM communities include London, Paris, Berlin, [[Amsterdam]], Munich, [[Cologne]], Hamburg, Moscow and Rome.

=== Symbols ===
The official symbol of the BDSM community is a derivation of the [[triskele]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}. The Triskele is the basic shape of the Emblem, with three &quot;arms&quot; curving out from the center and merging with an encompassing circle. The Triskele is an ancient shape that has had many uses and many meanings in many cultures. 

The true BDSM symbol must meet the following three criteria{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}:
1) The rims and spokes are of a color indicating metal. 
2) The rims and spokes are of uniform width with the arms rotating clockwise.
3) The inner fields are black.
4) The holes in the fields are truly holes and not dots.

More information about the symbol can be found at [http://emblemproject.sagcs.net/ The Emblem Project] 

[[File:Leather, Latex, and BDSM pride.svg|thumb|The [[Leather Pride flag]], a symbol of the BDSM and Fetish subculture.]]
[[File:BDSM logo.svg|thumb|[[Triskelion]]-type BDSM emblem.]]
BDSM and fetish items and styles have been spread widely in western societies' everyday life by different factors, such as [[avant-garde]] fashion, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[goth subculture]], and science fiction TV series,&lt;ref&gt;Fuentes Rodríguez, César: ''Mundo Gótico''. (Quarentena Ediciones, 2007, ISBN 978-84-933891-6-1)&lt;/ref&gt; and are often not consciously connected with their BDSM roots by many people. While it was mainly confined to the [[Punk subculture|Punk]] and BDSM subcultures in the 1990s, it has since spread into wider parts of western societies.

The ''[[Leather Pride flag]]'' is a symbol for the Leather subculture and also widely used within BDSM. In continental Europe the ''[[Ring of O]]'' is widespread among BDSM practitioners{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}. The [[Triskele|Triskelion]] is common in English-speaking communities{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}.

[[File:BDSM-rights-flag-Tanos.svg|120px|alt=BDSM Rights Flag colour]]
[[File:BDSM Rights Flag Black and White.svg|100px|alt=BDSM Rights Flag Black and White]]

The BDSM Rights Flag intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission, or Sadism and Masochism (&quot;BDSM&quot;) deserve the same human rights as everyone else, and should not be discriminated against for pursuing BDSM with consenting adults.

The flag is inspired by the Leather Pride Flag and BDSM Emblem, but is specifically intended to represent the concept of BDSM Rights and to be without the other symbols' restrictions against commercial use. It's designed to be recognisable by people familiar with either the Leather Pride Flag or BDSM Triskelion (or Triskele) as &quot;something to do with BDSM&quot;; and to be distinctive whether reproduced in full colour, or in black and white (or another pair of colours.)&lt;ref name=&quot;bdsmrights&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= BDSMrights.com |url=http://www.bdsmrights.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prejudices ===
[[File:CSD 2006 Cologne BDSM 07.jpg|thumb|upright|''Exhibition'' of a male sub in [[Zentai]] and chains at the [[Cologne Gay Pride]] festival, 2006.]]
Understanding of BDSM culture and practices remains intertwined with [[prejudice]]s, [[cliché]]s and [[stereotype]]s. Misunderstandings may arise from general lack of knowledge concerning sexuality and sexual practices as well as misconceptions on how one's personal life and public persona can vary greatly. For example, it is sometimes assumed that a submissive would prefer to experience pain and degradation in their everyday life, or conversely, that they would prefer to have exactly the opposite. There is no clear correlation between the position in everyday life and BDSM preferences. A further misunderstanding is that all members of BDSM communities want only to be hurt or to inflict physical, psychological and mental pain, which diminishes and disparages the emotional and spiritual relationships that develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bccla.org/othercontent/06BDSM.pdf |title=BCCLA Position Paper Sexuality and Civil Rights |accessdate=2007-12-10 |work=Cases involving prejudices against BDSM practitioners |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another misconception is the idea of women generally being the dominant party in BDSM relationships. Quite often the picture of BDSM is reduced to the idea of crude corporal punishment, neglecting the broad spectrum of behaviors within the culture. Along with the whip-swinging dominatrix, the sadomasochist in full leather regalia is another common cliché. While overlaps between different kinds of [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]] can exist, there is no inevitable connection between BDSM and fetishism (for example: latex, PVC or leather). The frequent occurrence of such clothing can be partly explained by its function as a quasi-formalized dress code.

Since the term BDSM covers a broad range of human behavior, the arising spectrum of individual interests and personalities is large and extremely diverse. Due to the lack of information in the total population and the reluctance with many to [[coming out|come out]] about matters of an extremely personal nature leads to situations in which actions and statements of individual BDSM practitioners are accredited to the community at large just as the larger [[LGBT]] community has been characterized by [[drag queen]]s and other minority communities similarly mischaracterized.

At least in the western, industrialized countries and Japan, since the 1980s sadomasochists have begun to form information exchange and support groups to counter discriminatory images. This has happened independently in the United States and in several European countries. With the advent of the web, international cooperation has started to develop—for example ''[[Datenschlag]]'' is a joint effort of sadomasochists in the three major [[German-speaking]] countries, and the mailing list ''Schlagworte'' uses the model of a [[news agency]] to connect six countries. Some credit highly publicized events like [[Operation Spanner]] and the International leather contests with fostering international cooperation and collaboration.

=== Coming out ===
{{Main|Coming out}}
[[File:BDSM Company on Taiwan Pride 2005.jpg|thumb|BDSM Activists at Taiwan [[gay pride|Pride]] 2005, [[Taipei]]]]
[[File:Ponygirl folsom2005.jpg|thumb|Carriage drawn by a Pony-Girl, ''[[Petplay]]'' at the ''Folsom Parade'' 2005.]]

Some people who feel attracted by the situations usually compiled under the term BDSM reach a point where they decide to come out of the closet, though many sadomasochists keep themselves [[closet(ed)|closeted]]. Even so, depending upon a survey's participants, about 5 to 25 percent of the US-American population show affinity to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Janus, Samuel S. / Janus, Cynthia L., 1994 ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', Wiley, New York, ISBN 978-0-471-01614-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot;&gt;Elliott, Leland / Brantley, Cynthia, ''Sex on Campus'', 1997, Random House, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Other than a few artists, practically no celebrities are publicly known as sadomasochists.

Public knowledge of one's BDSM lifestyle can have devastating vocational and social effects ([[Persona non grata]]) for sadomasochists. The reason for this is seen by some authors as primarily a lack of public educational advertising, exacerbated by overly lurid and sensationalized media coverage.

Within feminist circles the discussion has been split roughly into two camps: some who see BDSM as an aspect or reflection of oppression (for example, [[Alice Schwarzer]]) and, on the other side, pro-BDSM feminists, often grouped under the banner of [[sex-positive feminism]] (see [[Samois]]); both of them can be traced back to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Schwarzer: &quot;Weiblicher Masochismus ist Kollaboration!&quot; from EMMA Heft 2, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminists have criticized BDSM for eroticizing power and violence, and for reinforcing [[misogyny]]. They argue that women who engage in BDSM are making a choice that is ultimately bad for women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Schwarzer, Emma Heft 2, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist defenders of BDSM argue that consensual BDSM activities are enjoyed by many women and validate the sexual inclinations of these women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/sister/BDSM.html BDSM and Feminism: An Insider's View by Tammy Jo Eckhart] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that feminists should not attack other woman's sexual desires as being &quot;anti-feminist&quot;, and point out that there is no connection between consensual kinky activities and sex crimes. The main point of feminism is giving an individual woman free choices in her life; that includes her sexual desire. While some radical feminists suggest connections between consensual BDSM [[Scene (BDSM)|scenes]] and non-consensual rape and [[sexual assault]], sex-positive feminists may tend to find this insulting to women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayle Rubin]]: ''Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality''. In Carole S. Vance (Ed.), ''Pleasure and Danger: exploring female sexuality'', pp. 267–319. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, Boston 1984.

It is often mentioned that in BDSM, roles are not fixed to [[gender]], but personal preferences. Several studies on the correlation of BDSM pornography and the violence against women recapitulate that there is no correlation. Japan is a useful example: a country which has the lowest rate of sexual crimes of all industrialized nations while being well known for its comprehensive BDSM and bondage pornography (see [[Pornography in Japan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|coauthors=Uchiyama; Ayako|title=Pornography, Rape and Sex Crimes in Japan|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_rape_jp.html|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–22|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(98)00035-1|authorlink=Milton Diamond|pmid=10086287|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a lateral survey came to the conclusion that between 1964 and 1984, despite the increase in amount and availability of sadomasochistic pornography in the US, Germany, Denmark and Sweden there is no correlation with the national number of rapes to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Berl Kutchinsky]], ''Pornography and Rape: Theory and Practice?'' in: International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, Vol. 14, 1991, P. 47–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Spanner]] in the UK proves that BDSM practitioners still run the risk of being [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] as criminals. In 2003, the media coverage of [[Jack McGeorge]] showed that simply participating and working in BDSM support groups poses risks to one's job, even in countries where no law restricts it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Pleasure, Pain, and Saddam Hussein |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2074821/ |periodical=[[Slate.com]] |first=Timothy Noah |date=3 December 2002 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |postscript= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081123071440/http://www.slate.com/id/2074821/| archivedate= 23 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here a clear difference can be seen to the situation of homosexuals.{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public.

In the stages of &quot;self awareness&quot;, he or she realizes their desires related to BDSM scenarios and/or decides to be open for such. Some authors call this ''internal coming-out''. Two separate surveys on this topic independently came to the conclusion that 58 percent and 67 percent of the sample respectively, had realized their disposition before their 19th birthday. Other surveys on this topic show comparable results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Spengler|Spengler, Andreas]]: ''Sadomasochisten und ihre Subkulturen'', Campus Verlag, 1979, Frankfurt am Main / New York (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/umfrage/dpb1_ergebnisse.html [[Datenschlag]] survey (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; Independent of age, coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis, sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of suicide. While homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades, sadomasochistic support networks are just starting to develop in most countries. In German speaking countries they are only moderately more developed.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Daschek und Axel Konrad: ''Empirische Untersuchung über den Zusammenhang zwischen ausgewählten Faktoren und inklinierendem sexuellem Sadomasochismus'', online [http://www.schlagabtausch-hd.de/sm-studie.php sm-study] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The internet is the prime contact point for support groups today, allowing for local and international networking. In the US [[Kink Aware Professionals]] (KAP) a privately funded, non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsfreedom.org/kap/index.php?option=com_keyword&amp;id=270 ncsfreedom.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In the US and the UK, the [[Woodhull Freedom Foundation &amp; Federation]], [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]] (NCSF) and [[Sexual Freedom Coalition]] (SFC) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists. The German Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus e.V. is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations. In 1996 the website and mailing list [[Datenschlag]] went online in German and English providing the largest [[bibliography]], as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to BDSM.

=== Parties and clubs ===
[[File:Andreaskreuz mit Model Monique.jpg|thumb|A female on a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|St. Andrew's cross]].]]

BDSM parties are events on which BDSM practitioners and other similarly interested people meet in order to communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to &quot;play&quot; in an erotic atmosphere. The parties show similarities with ones in the [[dark culture]], being based on a more or less strictly enforced [[Dresscode (BDSM)|dress code]]; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and secondary sexual characteristic. The requirement for such dress codes differ. While some events have none, others have a policy in order to create a more coherent atmosphere and to prevent voyeurs from taking part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/smpabes.html datenschlag.org] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

At these parties, BDSM can be publicly performed on a stage, or more privately in separate &quot;[[Dungeon (BDSM)|dungeons]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: ''The New Topping Book''. Page 163&lt;/ref&gt; A reason for the relatively fast spread of this kind of event is the opportunity to use a wide range of &quot;playing equipment&quot;, which in most apartments or houses is unavailable. Slings, St. Andrews crosses (or similar restraining constructs), spanking benches, and punishing supports or cages are often made available. The problem of noise disturbance is also lessened at these events, while in the home setting many BDSM activities can be limited by this factor. In addition, such parties offer both [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] a forum to indulge their inclinations without social opprobrium. Sexual intercourse is taboo within most public BDSM play spaces or not often seen in others, because it is not the emphasis of this kind of play. In order to ensure the maximum safety and comfort for the participants certain standards of behavior have evolved, these include aspects of [[courtesy]], [[privacy]], respect and [[safeword]]s among others.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt; Today BDSM parties are taking place in most of the larger cities in the western world.

In some cities there are specialized BDSM clubs with a more or less structured program schedule, in which theme parties alternate with topic-free &quot;play evenings&quot;, similar to the business concepts of more conventional [[nightclub]]s. Social control of these parties and/or in the clubs is far higher than in a normal discothèque. Consensuality in the public BDSM sessions is strictly monitored and enforced. Apart from commercial events there are also privately organized or only moderately profit-oriented parties, which are organized by BDSM groups and individuals. [[Minor (law)|Minors]] are not allowed at parties or clubs, even though intercourse and drinking are usually not found in these parties.

The percentage of women is significantly higher than that of most behavior patterns formally considered to be [[paraphilia]]s. Estimation on the overall percentage of BDSM related sexual behavior in the general population range from 5 to 25 percent, depending on the scientific objectives.

A non-representative survey on the sexual behavior of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had a response rate of about 8–9%. It results showed 15% of openly homosexual males, 21% of openly lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies.&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot; /&gt; In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences varied about 6%. Within the group of openly female bisexuals and lesbians the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of the outed female lesbians and bisexuals and 8% of the male heterosexuals articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behavior was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women.&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot; /&gt; Even if this study were not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.&lt;ref&gt;Brokmann, Angela: ''Macht und Erotik'', 1996, Sexologisches Institut e.

In a representative study published in 1999 by the German Institut für rationale Psychologie, about two thirds of the interviewed women stated a desire to be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time. 69% admitted to fantasies dealing with sexual submissiveness, 42% stated interest in explicit BDSM techniques, 25% in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann, ''Lexikon der Tabubrüche'', Schwarzkopf&amp;Schwarzkopf, 2003, ISBN 978-3-89602-517-3 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; A 1976 study in the general US population suggests three percent have had positive experiences with Bondage or master-slave role playing.

[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#bdsm kinseyinstitute.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements of BDSM have been popularized through increased media coverage since the middle 1990s. Thus both black leather clothing, sexual jewellery such as chains and dominance role play appear increasingly outside of BDSM contexts.

[[File:Ring der o.jpg|thumb|The [[Ring of O]] as a finger ring.]]
According to a 2005 survey of 317,000 people in 41 countries, about 20% of the surveyed people have at least once used masks, blindfolds or other bondage utilities, and 5% explicitly connected themselves with BDSM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durex&quot;&gt;Durex Global Sex Survey 2005, P.15 Online [http://www.durex.com/cm/gss2005results.asp Durex Global Sex Survey 2005] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, 19% mentioned spanking as one of their practices and 22% confirmed the use of blindfolds and/or handcuffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durex&quot;/&gt; Some BDSM accessories, like the ''Ring of O'', have been integrated into the jewelry collections of internationally well known designers like [[Calvin Klein]].

=== Psychological categorization ===
In the past, many activities and fantasies related to BDSM were generally attributed to [[Sadism and masochism as medical terms|sadism or masochism]] and were regarded by [[psychiatrist]]s as an illness. Following the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-10) ''sadomasochism'' is categorized a &quot;Disorder of sexual preference&quot; ([[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders#.28F60–F69.29 Disorders of adult personality and behaviour|F65.5]]) and described as follows: ''&quot;A preference for sexual activity which involves the infliction of pain or humiliation, or bondage. If the subject prefers to be the recipient of such stimulation this is called masochism; if the provider, sadism. Often an individual obtains sexual excitement from both sadistic and masochistic activities.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;ICD-10 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) in 1994 new criteria of diagnosis were available describing BDSM clearly not as disorders of sexual preferences. They are no longer regarded as illnesses in and of themselves. The DSM-IV asserts that ''&quot;The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors&quot;'' must ''&quot;cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;'' in order for sexual [[Sadomasochism|sadism or masochism]] to be considered a disorder. In an [[Journal of Sex Education and Therapy|AASECT article]] providing guidelines for therapists working with BDSM clients, sexologists [[Charles Allen Moser]] and [[Peggy Kleinplatz]] highlight that distress can occur in BDSM patients due to stigma and discrimination surrounding BDSM, and that in these circumstances the role of the therapist is to ''&quot;validate the distress rather than to &quot;cure&quot; the BDSM desires.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[[Peggy Kleinplatz|Kleinplatz, Peggy]], and [[Charles Allen Moser|Charles Moser]]. &quot;Toward Clinical Guidelines for Working with BDSM Clients.&quot; Contemporary Sexuality 38.6 (2004): 1–4. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. 2 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DSM-IVs' latest edition (DSM-IV-TR) further requires that the activity must be the sole means of sexual gratification for a period of six (6) months, and either cause &quot;clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot; or involve a violation of &quot;[[Consent (criminal)|consent]]&quot; to be diagnosed as a paraphilia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/159/7/1249 Letter to the Editor of The American Journal of Psychiatry: Change in Criterion for Paraphilias in DSM-IV-TR.] Russell B. Hilliard, Robert L. Spitzer. 2002. Retrieved 23 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlays of sexual preference disorders and the practice of BDSM practices can occur, however.

In Europe, an organization called [[ReviseF65]] has worked towards this purpose in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiersøl O, Skeid S |title=The ICD diagnoses of fetishism and sadomasochism |journal=Journal of homosexuality |volume=50 |issue=2–3 |pages=243–62 |year=2006 |pmid=16803767 |doi=10.1300/J082v50n02_12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Denmark became the first [[European Union]] country to have completely removed sadomasochism from its national classification of diseases. This was followed by Sweden in 2009, Norway in 2010 and Finland 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revisef65.org/Sweden.html|title=Fetish and SM diagnoses deleted in Sweden|publisher=ReviseF65|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revisef65.org/friskmelding_eng.html|title=SM and fetish off the Norwegian sick list|publisher=[[ReviseF65]]|date=6 February 2010|accessdate=4 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100206222549/http://www.revisef65.org/friskmelding_eng.html| archivedate= 6 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revisef65.org/finland_eng.html|title=Finland joins Nordic sexual reform|publisher=[[ReviseF65]]|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent surveys on the spread of BDSM fantasies and practices show strong variations in the range of their results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fakten&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Nackte Fakten – Statistik für Zahlenfetischisten |language=German |accessdate=2008-11-09 |url=http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/statistik.html |postscript= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081208192334/http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/statistik.html| archivedate= 8 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it can be stated that the vast majority of the researchers assume 5 to 25 percent of the population showing sexual behavior related to joyfully experienced pain or dominance and submission. The population with related fantasies is considered even higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fakten&quot;/&gt;

There are only a few studies researching the psychological aspects of BDSM using modern scientific standards. A pivotal survey on the subject was published by US-American psychotherapist [[Charles Allen Moser|Charles Moser]] in 1988 in the ''Journal of Social Work and Human Sexuality''.&lt;ref name=&quot;moser&quot; /&gt; His conclusion was that while there is a general lack of data on the psychological problems of BDSM practitioners, some fundamental results are obvious. He emphasizes that there is no evidence for the theory that BDSM has common symptoms or ''any'' common psychopathology; Clinical literature, though does not give a consistent picture of BDSM practitioners. Moser emphasizes that there is no evidence at all supporting the theory of BDSM practitioners having any special psychiatric problems or even problems based solely on their preferences.

Moser's results were supported by data presented to the 2007 [[World Congress of Sexology]] by Juliet Richters, Richard De Visser, Andrew Grulich, and [[Christopher Rissel]]. The researchers found that BDSM practitioners were no more likely to have experienced sexual assault than the control group, and were not more likely to feel unhappy or anxious. The BDSM males reported higher levels of psychological well-being than the controls. It was concluded that &quot;BDSM is simply a sexual interest attractive to a minority, not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with normal sex.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richters, Juliet; Visser, Richard De; Grulich, Andrew; and [[Christopher Rissel|Rissel, Chris]] (2008). &quot;Selected Abstracts of Presentations During the World Congress of Sexology, 2007: Demographic and Psychosocial Features of Participants in BDSM Sex: Data From a National Survey&quot;, ''Journal of Sex Research'', 45(2), pp. 90–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems do sometimes occur in the area of self classification by the person concerned. During the phase of the &quot;coming-out&quot;, self questioning related to one's own &quot;normality&quot; is quite common. According to Moser, the discovery of BDSM preferences ''can'' result in fear of the current non-BDSM relationship's destruction. This, combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life, leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome. At the same time, the denial of BDSM preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one's own &quot;vanilla&quot;-lifestyle, feeding the apprehension of finding no partner. Moser states that BDSM practitioners having problems finding BDSM partners would probably have problems in finding a non-BDSM partner as well. The wish to remove BDSM preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases. Finally, the scientist states that BDSM practitioners seldom commit violent crimes. From his point of view, crimes of BDSM practitioners usually have no connection with the BDSM components existing in their life. Moser's study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence, which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates, adoption possibilities, custody or other social rights or privileges. The Swiss psychoanalyst Fritz Morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book, ''Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion'' (1988). He states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior, but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards the own preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Morgenthaler: ''Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion'', Analytic, April 1988, ISBN 978-0-88163-060-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 psychoanalyst [[Theodor Reik]] reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work ''Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Reik: ''Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft'', Fischer ,1983, ISBN 978-3-596-26768-2 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spirituality ==
For many people, BDSM practices can lead to profound transcendental experiences, reminiscent of shamanic ordeals.  Additionally, many have turned to various spiritual traditions to guide them ethically, or have sought to reconcile their BDSM desires with their chosen religious or spiritual tradition.  BDSM spirituality groups have formed within local groups and on the Internet; there have also been BDSM support groups for members of particular religions, such as Defenders (a subgroup of the Roman Catholic [[DignityUSA]]), People of Leather Among You (connected with the [[Metropolitan Community Church]]), Black Leather Wings (for [[Neopagans]]) and Leather &amp; Grace (for [[Unitarian Universalists]]).

=== Origins ===

[[File:Sm2.jpg|thumb|Copper engraving, about 1780.]]
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (8).jpg|thumb|Flagellation scene, illustration to [[Fanny Hill]] by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]].]]

The historical origins of BDSM are obscure. During the ninth century BC, [[Flagellation#Association with religion|ritual flagellations]] were performed in [[Artemis Orthia]], one of the most important religious areas of ancient [[Sparta]], where the [[Cult of Orthia]], a pre[[Olympic Gods|olympic]] religion, was practiced. Here ritual flagellation called ''diamastigosis'' took place on a regular basis. One of the oldest graphical proofs of sadomasochistic activities is found in an [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] burial site in [[Tarquinia]]. Inside the [[Tomba della Fustigazione]] (''Tomb of Flogging''), in the latter sixth century B.C., two men are portrayed flagellating a woman with a cane and a hand during an erotic situation.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Moretti/Leonard von Matt: Etruskische Malerei in Tarquinia. Cologne 1974, Page 90, figs. 762-63, ISBN 978-3-7701-0541-0&lt;/ref&gt; Another reference related to flagellation is to be found in the sixth book of the ''Satires'' of the ancient Roman Poet [[Juvenal]] (1st–2nd century A.D.),&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]]: [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/juvenal-satvi.html Satires 6, Lines 474–511]&lt;/ref&gt; further reference can be found in [[Petronius]]'s ''[[Satyricon]]'' where a delinquent is whipped for sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/petronius.html Petronius: Satyricon] (lat.)&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotal narratives related to humans who have had themselves voluntary bound, flagellated or whipped as a substitute for sex or as part of foreplay reach back to the third and fourth century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of India describes four different kinds of hitting during lovemaking, the allowed regions of the human body to target and different kinds of joyful &quot;cries of pain&quot; practiced by bottoms. The collection of historic texts related to sensuous experiences explicitly emphasizes that [[impact play]], biting and pinching during sexual activities should only be performed consensually since only some women consider such behavior to be joyful. From this perspective the Kama Sutra can be considered as one of the first written resources dealing with sadomasochistic activities and safety rules. Further texts with sadomasochistic connotation appear worldwide during the following centuries on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;Kamasutra by Mallanaga Vatsyayana, translated by Wendy Doniger, Oxford University Press 2003, ISBN 978-0-19-283982-4 Book II: Chapters 4,5,7,8, Pages 45–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped, as a prelude to or substitute for sex, during the 14th century. The medieval phenomenon of [[courtly love]] in all of its slavish devotion and ambivalence has been suggested by some writers to be a precursor of BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;Denis de Rougemont (1956), Love in the Western World: Describing the ideal of chast love influenced by the [[Cathar]] doctrines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann: ''In Leder gebunden. Der Sadomasochismus in der Weltliteratur'', Page 11, Ubooks 2007, ISBN 978-3-86608-078-2 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim that BDSM as a distinct form of sexual behavior originated at the beginning of the 18th century when Western civilization began medically and legally categorizing sexual behavior (see [[BDSM#Etymology|Etymology]]). There are reports of brothels specializing in flagellation as early as 1769, and John Cleland's novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'', published in 1749, mentions a flagellation scene.&lt;ref&gt;John Cleland: Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, Penguin Classics, (7 January 1986), ISBN 978-0-14-043249-7 Page 180 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources give a broader definition, citing BDSM-like behavior in earlier times and other cultures, such as the medieval flagellates and the physical [[ordeal ritual]]s of some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/ordeals1.html European medieval ordeals]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the names of the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]] are attached to the terms sadism and masochism respectively, the scenes described in Sade's works do not meet modern BDSM standards of informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;cp: Marquis de Sade: The 120 Days of Sodom, Pbl. ReadHowYouWant, (1 December 2006), ISBN 978-1-4250-3448-1, pages 407–409 &quot;'You'll have no further use for these,' he muttered, casting each article into a large grate. 'No further need for this mantelet, this dress, these stockings, this bodice, no,' said he when all had been consumed, 'all you'll need now is a coffin.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; BDSM is solely based on consensual activities, and based on its system and laws, the concepts presented by Marquis de Sade are not agreed upon the BDSM culture, even though they are sadistic in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010&quot;/&gt; BDSM ideas and imagery have existed on the fringes of Western culture throughout the twentieth century. Robert Bienvenu attributes the origins of modern BDSM to three sources, which he names as &quot;European Fetish&quot; (from 1928), &quot;American Fetish&quot; (from 1934), and &quot;Gay Leather&quot; (from 1950).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanfetish.net/sexresearch.us/Dissertation.html Robert Bienvenu: Doctoral Dissertation – The Development of Sadomasochism as a Cultural Style in the Twentieth-Century United States] {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source are the [[sexual game]]s played in [[brothel]]s, which go back into the 19th century if not earlier. [[Irving Klaw]], during the 1950s and 1960s, produced some of the first commercial film and photography with a BDSM theme (most notably with [[Bettie Page]]) and published comics by the now-iconic bondage artists [[John Willie]] and [[Eric Stanton]].

Stanton's model Bettie Page became at the same time one of the first successful models in the area of fetish photography and one of the most famous [[pin-up girl]]s of American mainstream culture. Italian author and designer [[Guido Crepax]] was deeply influenced by him, coining the style and development of European adult comics in the second half of the twentieth century. The artists [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] are the most prominent examples of the increasing use of BDSM-related motives in modern photography and the public discussions still resulting from this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20021112205909/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ University of Central England in Birmingham]: Attempted Confiscation of Mapplethorn book by Officials in 1997 for being obscene.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leather movement ===
{{Main|Leather subculture}}
[[File:Leather Contingent Pride 2004.jpg|thumb|Start of the Leather contingent at the 2004 San Francisco [[gay pride]] [[pride parade|parade]].]]
Much of the BDSM ethos can be traced back to the gay male [[leather subculture|leather culture]], which formalized itself out of the group of men who were soldiers returning home after World War II (1939–1945).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bienvenu, ''The Development of Sadomasochism as a Cultural Style in the Twentieth-Century United States'', 2003, Doctoral Dissertation, Online as PDF on [http://www.americanfetish.net/ Sadomasochism as a Cultural Style]&lt;/ref&gt; This subculture is epitomized by the ''Leatherman's Handbook'' by [[Larry Townsend]], published in 1972, which describes in detail the practices and culture of gay male sadomasochists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Larry ''The Leatherman's Handbook'' 1972 Olympia Press, seventh edition 2004 available from L.T. Publications P.O. Box 302, Beverly Hills, California 90213-0302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;compare [[Patrick Califia]] (Edit.), Robin Sweeney (Edit.): ''The Second Coming: A Leatherdyke Reader.'' Alyson Pubns, 1996, ISBN 978-1-55583-281-0&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, however, the publication of ''[[Coming to Power]]'' by lesbian-feminist group [[Samois]] led to a greater knowledge and acceptance of BDSM in the lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayle Rubin]]: ''Samois'', Leather Times, 21:3–7., 2004, available from: [http://www.leatherarchives.org/resources/issue21.pdf leatherarchives.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
They got into conflict with fundamentalist part of the feminist movement which considered BDSM to be the base of misogyny and violent porn.

Today the Leather Movement is generally seen as a part of the BDSM-culture instead of as a development deriving from gay subculture, even if a huge part of the BDSM-subculture was gay in the past. In the 1990s the so-called [[New Guard leather|New Guard]] [[leather subculture]] evolved. This new orientation started to integrate psychological aspects into their play.

===Internet===
In the late-eighties, the Internet provided a way of finding people with specialized interests around the world as well as on a local level, and communicating with them anonymously.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/alternate-lifestyles-what-they-had-to-do-with-msn-chat.html Roy D'Silva, Published 17 September 2007: Alternate Lifestyles: What they had to do with MSN-chat]&lt;/ref&gt; This brought about an explosion of interest and knowledge of BDSM, particularly on the [[usenet]] group [[alt.sex.bondage]]. When that group became too cluttered with [[spamming|spam]], the focus moved to [http://groups.google.com/groups?q=soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm].

In addition to traditional sex shops, which sell sex paraphernalia, there has also been an explosive growth of online [[adult toy]] companies that specialize in leather/latex gear and BDSM toys. Once a very [[niche market]], there are now very few [[sex toy]] companies that do not offer some sort of BDSM or [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] gear in their catalog. Kinky elements seem to have worked their way into &quot;[[Vanilla sex|vanilla]]&quot; markets. The former niche expanded to an important pillar of the business with adult accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birch|first=Dr Robert W.|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/drbirchsextoys.htm|title=Adult Sex Toys|publisher=Leather Roses|accessdate=2008-01-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080223075418/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/drbirchsextoys.htm| archivedate= 23 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today practically all suppliers of sex toys do offer items which originally found usage in the BDSM subculture. Padded handcuffs, latex and leather garments, as well as more exotic items like soft whips for fondling and TENS for erotic electro stimulation can be found in catalog aiming on classical vanilla target groups, indicating that former boundaries increasingly seem to shift.

During the last years the Internet also provides a central platform for networking among individuals who are interested in the subject. Besides countless private and commercial choices there is an increasing number of local networks and support groups emerging. These groups often offer comprehensive background and health related information for people who have been unwillingly outed as well as contact lists with information on [[psychologist]]s, physicians and lawyers who are familiar with BDSM related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/generalbdsm.htm#toys|title=Implements/Toys|publisher=Leather Roses|accessdate=2008-01-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080129080540/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/generalbdsm.htm#breathcontrol| archivedate= 29 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
[[File:Sade (van Loo).png|thumb|''Portrait of [[Marquis de Sade]]'' by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo (1761)]]

The terms &quot;Sadism&quot; and &quot;Masochism&quot; are derived from the names of the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], based on the content of the authors' works. In 1843 the Hungarian physician Heinrich Kaan published ''Psychopathia sexualis'' (&quot;Psychopathy of Sex&quot;), a writing in which he converts the sin conceptions of Christianity into medical diagnoses. With his work the originally theological terms &quot;perversion&quot;, &quot;aberration&quot; and &quot;deviation&quot; became part of the scientific terminology for the first time.{{Dubious|date=January 2011}} The German psychiatrist [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Richard von Krafft Ebing]] introduced the terms &quot;Sadism&quot; and &quot;Masochism&quot; to the medical community in his work ''Neue Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der Psychopathia sexualis'' (&quot;New research in the area of Psychopathy of Sex&quot;) in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Details describing the development of the theoretical construct &quot;Perversion&quot; by Krafft-Ebing and his relation to this terms, see Andrea Beckmann, ''Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture'', 8(2) (2001) 66–95 online at [http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is2/beckmann.html Deconstructing Myths]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 [[Sigmund Freud]] described &quot;Sadism&quot; and &quot;Masochism&quot; in his ''Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie'' (&quot;Three papers on Sexual theory&quot;) as diseases developing from an incorrect development of the child psyche and laid the groundwork for the scientific perspective on the subject in the following decades. This led to the first time use of the compound term ''Sado-Masochism'' (German &quot;Sado-Masochismus&quot;) by the Viennese Psychoanalytic [[Isidor Isaak Sadger]] in its work ''Über den sado-masochistischen Komplex'' (&quot;Regarding the sadomasochistic complex&quot;) in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Isidor Isaak Sadger: ''Über den sado-masochistischen Komplex.'' in: Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen, Bd. 5, 1913, S. 157–232 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past BDSM activists turned repeatedly against these conceptual models, originally deriving from singular historical figures and implying a clear [[Psychopathology|pathological]] connotation. They argued that there is no common sense in attributing a phenomenon as complex as BDSM to two individual humans, as well one might speak of &quot;[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardism]]&quot; instead of Homosexuality. The BDSM scene tried to distinguish themselves with the expression &quot;B&amp;D&quot; for bondage and discipline from the sometimes pejorative connotations of the term &quot;S&amp;M&quot;. The abbreviation BDSM itself was probably coined in the early 1990s in the subculture connected with the [[Usenet]] newsgroup [[alt.sex.bondage]]. The earliest posting with the term which is now preserved in Google Groups dates from June 1991. Later the dominance and submission dimension was integrated into the connotation of BDSM, creating the compound initialism common today.

== Legal status ==
{{Main|BDSM and the law}}
[[File:Fettered Hands on Model.png|thumb|right|[[Bondage cuffs]]]]
[[File:Gags bit 01.JPG|thumb|A bit [[Gag (BDSM)|gag]] used in BDSM made of leather, steel and wood]]

The legal status of BDSM is entirely dependent on the legal structure of individual countries.  Each individual country makes its own determination to whether the practice of BDSM has any criminal relevance or legal consequences. Criminalization of consensually implemented BDSM practices is usually not with explicit reference to BDSM itself (i.e., spanking an adult who specifically requests another to do such action to the requesting person), but results from the fact that such behavior could be considered a breach of personal rights, which in principle constitutes a criminal offense though some jurisdictions especially in the United States do specifically list such acts as flagellation (spanking) between consenting adults as &quot;assault&quot; regardless of consent between such consenting parties.

In Germany, Netherlands, Japan and Scandinavia such behavior is legal in principle. In Austria the legal status is unclear, while in Switzerland certain BDSM practices can be considered criminal. Spectacular incidents like the US-American scandal of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'' and the British [[Operation Spanner]] demonstrate the degree to which difficult grey areas can pose a problem for the individuals and authorities involved. For these reasons it is important for practitioners of BDSM to learn the legal status concerning BDSM activities in the country they reside in.

=== Germany ===
The practice of BDSM is not generally penalized in Germany if it is conducted with the mutual consent of the partners involved. To fulfill the charge of coercion the use of violence, or the threat of a &quot;severe mistreatment&quot; must involve an endangerment to life and limb. In cases where the continued application of the treatment could be ended through the use of a [[safeword]], neither coercion nor sexual coercion may be charged. Similar principles apply for charges of sexual abuse of people incapable of resistance. In such cases taking advantage of a person's inability to resist in order to perform sexual acts on that person would be clearly punishable. The potential use of the safeword is considered to be sufficient possibility for resistance since this would lead to the cessation of the act, so a true inability to resist is not considered to be in effect.

According to §194 the charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement. According to §228 of the German criminal code a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases where the act can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given. On 26 May 2004 the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to §228.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the Bundesgerichtshof, 26 May 2004, 2 StR 505/03, which may be found at: BGHSt 49, 166 ([http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;Datum=2004-5&amp;Seite=0&amp;client=12&amp;nr=29672&amp;pos=19&amp;anz=244&amp;Blank=1.pdf bundesgerichtshof.de])&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, this ruling makes the question of indecency dependent on the degree to which the bodily injury might be likely to impair the health of the receiving party. According to the BGH, the line of [[indecency]] is definitively crossed when &quot;under an objectively prescient consideration of all relevant circumstances the party granting consent could be brought into concrete danger of death by the act of bodily injury.&quot; In its ruling the court overturned a verdict by the Provincial Court of Kassel, according to which a man who had accidentally strangled his partner to death had been sentenced to probation for negligent manslaughter. The court had rejected a conviction on charges of bodily injury leading to death on the grounds that the victim had, in its opinion, consented to the act.

Following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases, the Appeals Court of [[Hamm]] ruled in February 2006 that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful child-raising.&lt;ref&gt;Appeals Court of Hamm in its judgement of 1 February 2006, case number 10 UF 147/04, available online at the [http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php# Portal of the North Rhine-Westfalian Ministry of Justice] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
British law does not recognize the possibility of consenting to bodily injury. Such acts are illegal, even between consenting adults, and these laws are enforced ([[R v Brown]] being the leading case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp|title=Spanner Trust submission to the Home Office Review Board on Sexual Offences|publisher=The Spanner Trust|accessdate=2008-01-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071214235525/http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp| archivedate= 14 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly consensual activities in the UK may not constitute &quot;assault occasioning actual or grievous bodily harm&quot; in law. The [[Spanner Trust]] states that this is defined as activities which have caused injury &quot;of a lasting nature&quot; but that only a slight duration or injury might be considered &quot;lasting&quot; in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Spanner Case|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/spannerhistory.asp|publisher=[[Spanner Trust]]|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision contrasts with the later case of [[R v Wilson]] in which conviction for non-sexual consensual branding within a marriage was overturned, the appeal court ruling that R v Brown was not an authority in all cases of consensual injury and criticizing the decision to prosecute.&lt;ref&gt;R v Wilson (1996). Text of ruling online at: {{cite web|title=R v Wilson (1996) 2 Cr App Rep 241|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/criminal-law/cases/consent-Wilson.php|publisher=LawTeacher.com|accessdate=2011-02-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101228001313/http://www.lawteacher.net/criminal-law/cases/consent-Wilson.php| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Operation Spanner the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in January 1999 in [[Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom]] that no violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] the individuals live in, as it is the State's responsibility to balance the concerns of [[public health]] and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. In the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill 2007, the British Government cited the Spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts, as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of ''&quot;[[extreme pornography]]&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons: ''[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/en/07130x-n.htm#index_link_206 Criminal Justice And Immigration Bill]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The United States Federal law does not list a specific criminal determination for consentual BDSM acts.  Many BDSM practitioners cite the legal decision of &quot;People v. Jovanovic, 95 N.Y.2d 846 (2000), or the “Cybersex Torture Case” which was the first U.S. appellate decision to hold (in effect) one does not commit assault if victim consents.  However, many individual states do criminalize specific BDSM actions within their state borders.  Some states specifically address the idea of &quot;consent to BDSM acts&quot; within their assault laws such as the state of New Jersey which states &quot;simple assault&quot; to be defined as &quot;a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle ''entered into by mutual consent'', in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm New Jersey NJ Criminal Offenses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  BDSM activities including flagellation (spanking) specifically ''without paying for such action'' (i.e., prostitution) between consenting adults are specifically addressed as illegal in certain individual states.

=== Italy ===
In Italian law BDSM is right on the border between crime and legality, and everything lies in the interpretation of the legal code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing &quot;injury&quot; to another person is to be punished. In this context though &quot;injury&quot; is legally defined as &quot;anything causing a condition of illness&quot;, and &quot;illness&quot; is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is &quot;any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism&quot; (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is &quot;a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy&quot;. This could make it somewhat risky to play with someone as later the &quot;victim&quot; may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner. Also any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayzad.com/ Ayzad], ''BDSM – Guida per esploratori dell'erotismo estremo'', Castelvecchi, 2004 ISBN 978-88-7615-025-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria ===
§90 of the criminal code declares bodily injury (§§ 83, 84) or the endangerment of physical security (§89) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the &quot;victim&quot; has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities. Case law from the Austrian Supreme Court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities, thus it is only punishable when a &quot;serious injury&quot; (a damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than 24 days) or the death of the &quot;victim&quot; results. A ''light injury'' is generally considered ''permissible'' when the &quot;victim&quot; has consented to it. In cases of threats to bodily well-being the standard depends on the probability that an injury will actually occur. If serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out, then even the threat itself is considered punishable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
&lt;!--
Zum konkreten Fall der Körperverletzung durch Handlungen im BDSM-Bereich gibt es allerdings keine gefestigte Rechtsprechung. Es kann durchaus sein, dass der Oberste Gerichtshof im BDSM-Bereich auch leichte Körperverletzung als sittenwidrig und somit als strafbar ansieht. Ob eine Handlung gegen die guten Sitten verstößt, hängt in Österreich nämlich davon ab, ob einem vorbildlichen Menschen die Sorge um die Gesundheit des „Opfers“ wichtiger wäre als die Rücksicht auf dessen Wünsche. Es besteht also keine Rechtssicherheit.--&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The age of consent in Switzerland is 16 years which also applies for BDSM play. Minors (i.e. those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years. Certain practices however require granting consent for light injuries with only those over 18 permitted to give consent. On 1 April 2002 Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened to make ownership of ''&quot;objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content&quot;'' a punishable offense. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochism since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfills this criterion. Critics also object to the wording of the law which puts sado-masochists in the same category as [[pedophilia|pedophiles]] and [[pederasty|pederasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/dachs/dachs2000_2004.html5. datenschlag.org(Oktober 2001)] (German) {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ig-bdsm.ch/index.php?pid=24 Interessengemeinschaft BDSM Schweiz] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nordic countries ===
In September 2010 a Swedish court acquitted a 32 year old man of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16 year old woman (the [[age of consent]] in Sweden is 15).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/29302/20100928 Man freed in landmark S&amp;M case]&lt;/ref&gt; Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revisef65.org/loven.html SM og loven] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution. This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.

== BDSM and culture ==
{{main|Sadism and masochism in fiction}}

=== Theatre ===
Although it would be possible to establish certain elements related to BDSM in classical theater, not until the emergence of contemporary theatre could you see such topics as the main theme in the performing arts. Exemplifying this are two works: one Austrian, one German, in which BDSM is not only incorporated, but integral to the storyline of the play.

'''Worauf sich Körper kaprizieren''', Austria. Peter Kern directs and writes the script for this comedy which is a present day adaption of Jean Genet's 1950 film, A chant d'amour. A marriage in which the wife (film veteran '''Miriam Goldschmidt''') submits her husband ('''Heinrich Herkie''') and the butler ('''Günter Bubbnik''') to her sadistic treatment, until two new characters take their places.&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Standard]], edición del 03.09.2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ach, Hilde''' (Oh, Hilda), Germany. A play by Anna Schwemmer that premiered in Berlin. A young Hilde becomes pregnant, and after being abandoned by her boyfriend she decides to become a professional dominatrix to earn money. The play carefully crafts a playful and frivolous picture of the field of professional dominatrices.&lt;ref&gt;[[BILD]]-Zeitung, Berlín, 15 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
:''With film, the human being reaches the fullness of their status as voyeur. The film almost needs not mention it, an indivisible part of the human condition since the beginning of the century and millennium.''&lt;ref&gt;Revista Cinefagia, noviembre 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from films that are part of the commercial pornography circuit, cinema has been treated since its inception with in depth BDSM relationships, from 1909 to the present decade. The current decade in particular has an abundance of examples: ''[[Sade (film)|Sade]]'', ''[[Quills]]'', ''[[The Piano Teacher (film)|The Piano Teacher]]'', ''[[Beyond Vanilla]]'', ''[[Secretary (film)|Secretary]]'', ''[[Wir leben]]'', ''[[Bitter Moon]]'', among others.

Naturally, there are thousands of movies that touch on or contain accents of BDSM or generic sadomasocism, or contain scenes of BDSM scenarios: ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', ''[[Emmanuelle (film)|Emmanuelle]]'', ''[[Personal Services]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', not to mention many others, but these are not seen as part of the filmography of BDSM.

=== Literature ===
{{See also|List of BDSM authors}}
Although examples of literature catering to BDSM and fetishistic taste was created in earlier periods, BDSM literature as it exists today cannot be found much earlier than World War II.

A central work in BDSM literature is undoubtedly the [[Story of O]] (1954) by [[Anne Desclos]] (under the pseudonym [[Pauline Réage]]) in addition to: ''9 ½ weeks''(1978) by '''Elizabeth McNeill''', ''Dezemberkind''(2003, 2004) by '''Leander Sukov''', works by '''Mitchell Joyce''', The Third Secret of Fatima (2010), A Breed Apart (2010), and the Master Slave  Encyclopaedia (2011), some works of the writer '''Anne Rice''' (''Exit to Eden'', ''The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty'' (1983), ''Beauty's Punishment'' (1984) and ''Beauty's Release'' (1985)), ''Jeanne de Berg'' (''L'Image''(1956) dedicated to [[Pauline Réage]]), and the novel ''Topping from Below''(1999) by '''Laura Reese'''. More recently, the novels of '''Marthe Blau''': ''Submission'' and ''Between Your Hands''(2005). Works from the GOR series by [[John Norman]], and naturally all the works of [[Patrick Califia]], [[Gloria Brame]], the group Samois and many of the writer [[Georges Bataille]] (Histoire de l'oeil-Story of the Eye, &quot;Madame Edwarda, 1937), as well as Bob ''Flanagan: Slave Sonnets'' (1986), ''Fuck Journal'' (1987), ''A Taste of Honey'' (1990). A common part of many of the poems of [[Pablo Neruda]] is a reflection on feelings and sensations arising from the relations of EPE or erotic exchange of power.

====A new subgenre: BDSM romance====
{{Original research|date=September 2012}}
In 2011, the erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' was published by [[E.L. James]]. ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' is the first book in a trilogy that focuses on the relationship between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, in which Grey is the dominant and Steele is an internally conflicted submissive. It topped the Best Sellers list in the United States and across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17332129 BBC News - EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey tops New York Times list&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the success of ''Fifty Shades of Grey'', Anne Rice decided in July of 2012 to re-release her 1980s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; trilogy, which was written under the pseudonym A.N. Roquelaure.  The trilogy was an underground success in the 1980s and has experienced a resurgence in popularity due to the broadening acceptance of BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/in-race-toward-the-erotic-reviving-an-old-trilogy/ NYTimes Media Decoder Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
{{See also|List of BDSM artists|List of BDSM photographers}}
As in the case of literature a list of BDSM art should not include works of the early history depicting sadomasochism, flogging, fetishism, and so on., but should start when the integrative aspects of BDSM become visible. In this sense figures such as those from Venus de Kostienki, Russia (3000&amp;nbsp;BC) or engraved on the tomb and the sarcophagus of the Egyptian aristocrat Bastret (1376&amp;nbsp;BC) are not considered BDSM art(as depicting BDSM was not their primary purpose).
For art which is undeniably BDSM art, it follows that the artist has spent most or part of their work dealing with BDSM, so an image of flogging by an artist who does many BDSM works is probably depicting BDSM, while the same image done by a historic maritime artist depicting life aboard a British vessel would probably not be considered BDSM art(although context, and the work itself would usually ultimately determine what the subject matter is discussing). Examples include:

* In photography: '''Eric Kroll''' and '''Irving Klaw''' (with Bettie Page, the first bondage model), and Japanese photographer [[Araki Nobuyoshi]], whose works are exhibited in several major art museums, galleries and private collections, such as the Baroness Marion Lambert, the world's largest holder of contemporary photographic art.
