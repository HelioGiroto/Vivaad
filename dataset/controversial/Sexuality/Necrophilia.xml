      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18299">'''Necrophilia''', also called '''thanatophilia''' or '''necrolagnia''', is the [[sexual attraction]] to [[Cadaver|corpses]]. It is classified as a [[paraphilia]] by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. The word is derived from the Greek words: ''[[wikt:νεκρός|νεκρός]]'' (''nekros''; &quot;dead&quot;) and ''[[wikt:φιλία|φιλία]]'' (''philia''; &quot;love&quot;). The term was coined by the Belgian alienist [[Joseph Guislain]], who first used it in a lecture in 1850.{{fact|date=August 2012}}

Rosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed information from 34 cases of necrophilia describing the individuals' motivations for their behaviors: these individuals reported the desire to possess an unresisting and unrejecting partner (68%), reunions with a romantic partner (21%), sexual attraction to corpses (15%), comfort or overcoming feelings of isolation (15%), or seeking self-esteem by expressing power over a homicide victim (12%).&lt;ref name=&quot;rosman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosman | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Resnick | first2 = P. J. | year = 1989 | title = Sexual attraction to corpses: A psychiatric review of necrophilia | url = | journal = Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 153–163 | pmid = 2667656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---WHAT are the demographics? Are all male or female? When and where are the stats being sampled from? Does it represent the worldwide view?---&gt;

==History==
Singular accounts of necrophilia in history are sporadic, though written records suggest the practice was present within [[Ancient Egypt]]. 
[[Herodotus]] writes in [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']] that, to discourage intercourse with a corpse, ancient [[Egypt]]ians left deceased beautiful women to decay for &quot;three or four days&quot; before giving them to the [[embalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ([[circa|c.]] 440 BC). ''The Histories'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/1hofh10.txt Book II], 89:
:&quot;The wives of men of rank when they die are not given at once to be embalmed, nor such women as are very beautiful or of greater regard than others, but on the third or fourth day after their death (and not before) they are delivered to the embalmers. They do so about this matter in order that the embalmers may not abuse their women, for they say that one of them was taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman lately dead, and his fellow-craftsman gave information.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brill | first1 = Abraham A. | year = 1941 | title = Necrophilia | url = | journal = Journal of Criminal Psychopathology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 433–443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;klaf&quot;/&gt;

In some societies the practice was enacted owing to a belief that the soul of an unmarried woman would not find peace; among the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] of [[Myanmar]], versions of a marriage ceremony were held to lay a dead virgin to rest, which would involve intercourse with the corpse. Similar practices existed in some pre-modern [[Central Europe]]an societies when a woman who was engaged to be married died before the wedding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Religious aspect==
Acts of necrophilia are reportedly displayed on [[Moche]] artifacts of [[Peru]]. It was reportedly used as a method to communicate with the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090121013531/http://living.oneindia.in/kamasutra/spheres-of-life/2008/necrophilia-corpse-attraction-treatment1.html |title=The Dead Corpse Can Fantasize Physical Pleasure (Web Archive) |author=Swarag |work=OneIndia |publisher=Greynium Information Technologies Pvt.

==Classification==
A ten-tier classification of necrophilia exists:&lt;ref name=&quot;aggrawal_classification&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aggrawal, Anil. |title=A new classification of necrophilia |journal=J Forensic Leg Med |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=316–20 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19573840 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.12.023 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B8CY1-4VGDNXT-2&amp;_user=5081486&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=5&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%2340101%232009%23999839993%231262082%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=40101&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=22&amp;_acct=C000047720&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=5081486&amp;md5=d9a87333539d30346df1d65ec7a68121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In 1958, Klaf and Brown&lt;ref name=&quot;klaf&quot;&gt;Klaf, Franklin S., and Brown, William (1958). &quot;Necrophilia: Brief Review and Case Report,&quot; ''[[The Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'', 29(143), 645-652. &quot;Inhibited forms of necrophilia and necrophilic fantasies may occur more commonly then is generally realized.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; commented that, although rarely described, necrophilic [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] may occur more often than is generally supposed.

Rosman and Resnick&lt;ref name=&quot;rosman&quot; /&gt; (1989) theorized that either of the following situations could be antecedents to necrophilia (pp.&amp;nbsp;161):
#The necrophile develops poor [[self-esteem]], perhaps due in part to a significant loss;
#:(a) He/she is very fearful of rejection by women/men and he/she desires a sexual partner who is incapable of rejecting him/her; and/or
#:(b) He/she is fearful of the dead, and transforms his/her fear &amp;mdash; by means of [[reaction formation]] &amp;mdash; into a desire.
#He/she develops an exciting fantasy of sex with a corpse, sometimes after exposure to a corpse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors also reported that, of their sample of 'necrophiliacs,':
*68% were motivated by a desire for an unresisting and unrejecting partner;
*21% by a want for reunion with a lost partner;
*15% by sexual attraction to dead people;
*15% by a desire for comfort or to overcome feelings of isolation; and
*11% by a desire to remedy low self-esteem by expressing power over a corpse (pp.&amp;nbsp;159).

At the end of their own report, Rosman and Resnick wrote that their study should only be used like a spring-board for further, more in depth, research.

Minor modern researches conducted in [[England]] have shown that some necrophiles tend to choose a dead mate after failing to create romantic attachments with the living {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}.

===In animals===
{{see also|Animal sexual behaviour#Necrophilia}}
Necrophilia is known to occur in animals, with a number of confirmed observations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 2: Electric Boogaloo&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/improbable/story/0,,1437560,00.html | title = Randy rock doves join party with the dead | accessdate = 2007-06-17 | work = [[The Guardian]] | location=London | date=2005-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kees Moeliker]] allegedly made one of these observations while he was sitting in his office at the [[Natuurmuseum Rotterdam]], when he heard the distinctive thud of a bird hitting the glass facade of the building. Upon inspection, he discovered a drake (male) [[mallard]] lying dead outside the building. Next to the downed bird there was a second drake mallard standing close by. As Moeliker observed the couple, the living drake pecked at the corpse of the dead one for a few minutes  then mounted the corpse and began copulating with it. The act of necrophilia lasted for about 75 minutes, in which time, according to Moeliker, the living drake took two short breaks before resuming with copulating behavior. Moeliker surmised that at the time of the collision with the window the two mallards were engaged in a common pattern in [[duck]] behavior called &quot;attempted [[rape]] flight&quot;. &quot;When one died the other one just went for it and didn't get any negative feedback &amp;mdash; well, didn't get any feedback,&quot; according to Moeliker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mallard Duck&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=C.W. Moeliker| title=The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)| journal=Deinsea - Annual of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam| year=2001| volume=8| pages=243–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MallardDuck&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,9865,1432991,00.html | title = Necrophilia among ducks ruffles research feathers|accessdate = 2007-06-17|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|author=Donald MacLeod | location=London | date=2005-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first recorded case of necrophilia in the [[mallard duck]].

The film ''The Cane Toads: an Unnatural History'' shows a male toad copulating with a female toad that has been run over by a car. It goes on to do this for eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 1989 S. Lewis, Cane Toads: an Unnatural History, Doubleday, New York (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a [[praying mantis]], necrophilia could be said to be part of their methods of [[reproduction]]. The larger female will sometimes decapitate or even eat her mate during copulation. However, this only happens in 5-31% of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Entomology/courses/en507/papers_1999/feldman.htm|title=The Praying Mantis|accessdate = 2007-06-17|author=Dan Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short paper known as &quot;Sexual Habits of the Adélie Penguin&quot;, [[George Murray Levick]] described mating with dead females in the [[Cape Adare]] [[rookery]], the largest group of [[Adélie Penguin|Adélie penguins]], in 1911 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKie|first=Robin|title='Sexual depravity' of penguins that Antarctic scientist dared not reveal|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/09/sex-depravity-penguins-scott-antarctic|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 June 2012}} The publication is: {{Cite doi|10.1017/S0032247412000216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is nowadays ascribed to lack of experience of young penguins.&lt;ref name=&quot;GD2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/09/sex-depravity-penguins-scott-antarctic |title='Sexual depravity' of penguins that Antarctic scientist dared not reveal |newspaper=Guardian.co.uk |date=9 June 2012 |first=Robin |last=McKie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
===New Zealand===
Under Section 150 of the New Zealand [[Crimes Act 1961]], it is an offence for there to be &quot;misconduct in respect to human remains.&quot; Subsection (b) elaborates that this applies if someone &quot;improperly or indecently interferes with or offers indignity to any dead human body or human remains, whether buried or not.&quot; This statute is therefore applicable to sex with corpses and carries a potential two year prison sentence. In 2009, the first, and thus far, only, such case of necrophilia since its criminalisation occurred when [[Christchurch]] [[murder]]er Jason Somerville confessed to the murder of his wife and another woman, and posthumous sexual contact with their buried human remains &lt;ref&gt;Butterworths Crimes Act 1961: Wellington: Butterworths: 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Section 297 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) entitled &quot;Trespassing on burial places, etc&quot;, states as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;ipc&quot;&gt;[http://mynation.net/ipc.htm#_Toc496765169 THE INDIAN PENAL CODE (IPC)- Dowry Law Misuse(IPC 498A) By Indian Women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever, with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person, or of insulting the religion of any person, or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby,
commits any trespass in any place of worship or on any place of sculpture, or any place set apart from the performance of [[funeral rites]] or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for the performance of funeral ceremonies,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although sex with corpses is not explicitly stated in IPC, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted under the above section in the Indian Penal Code.

===South Africa===
Section 14 of the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]] prohibits the commission of a sexual act with a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act 32 of 2007], s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Until codified by the act it was a [[common law offence]].

===United Kingdom ===
Sexual penetration with a corpse was made illegal under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. This is defined as depictions of &quot;sexual interference with a human corpse&quot; as well as actual scenes (see also [[extreme pornography]]). As of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]], it is also illegal to possess explicit and realistic depictions of sexual interference with a human corpse, electronic or otherwise.

===United States===
As of May 2006, there is no federal legislation specifically barring sex with a corpse.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Multiple states have their own laws:
