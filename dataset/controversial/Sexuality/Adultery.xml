{{Family law}}
'''Adultery''' (also called '''philandery''', [[anglicised]] from Latin ''adulterium'') is sexual intercourse between a married person and someone other than the spouse. Religious and legal interpretations of what constitutes adultery vary widely.

The term adultery has an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] origin, though the concept predates Judaism and is found in many other societies. The definition and consequences vary between religions, cultures, and legal [[jurisdiction]]s, but the concept is similar in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, &quot;Adultery&quot; |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, adultery has been considered to be a serious offense by many cultures. Even in jurisdictions where adultery is not itself a criminal offense, it may still have legal consequences, particularly in [[divorce]] cases. For example, where there is fault-based [[family law]], it almost always constitutes [[grounds for divorce]]; depending on jurisdiction, it may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], the [[child custody|custody]] of children, the denial of [[alimony]], etc. Moreover, adultery can affect the [[social status]] of those involved, and result in social [[ostracize|ostracism]] in some parts of the world.

In countries where adultery is illegal, the punishments range from [[fines]] to the [[death penalty]]. In the 21st century, criminal laws against adultery have become very controversial, with international organizations calling for their abolition, especially in the light of several high profile [[stoning]] cases that have recently occurred in certain countries. Opponents of these laws cite the fact that adultery laws are a major contributor to discrimination and [[violence against women]], as they are enforced selectively mostly against women; that they prevent women from reporting [[rape]] and [[sexual violence]]; and that they maintain social norms which justify violent crimes committed against women by husbands, families and communities. The head of the U.N. expert body charged with identifying ways to eliminate laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory to them in terms of implementation or impact, Kamala Chandrakiran, has stated that: ''&quot;Adultery must not be classified as a criminal offence at all&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/10/adultery-laws-unfairly-target-women-u-n-says/&lt;/ref&gt; A joint statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice states that: ''&quot;Adultery as a criminal offence violates women’s human rights&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672&amp;LangID=E&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The application of the term to the act appears to arise from the idea that &quot;criminal intercourse with a married woman ... tended to adulterate the issue [children] of an innocent husband ... and to expose him to support and provide for another man's [children]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Evans v. Murff'', 135 F. Supp. 907, 911 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the &quot;purity&quot; of the children of a marriage is corrupted, and the inheritance is altered. The law often uses the word &quot;adulterate[d]&quot; to describe contamination of food and the like.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', [[U.S. Code]], Title 21, Chapter 1: Adulterated or Misbranded Foods or Drugs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three recent studies in the United States, using nationally representative samples, have found that about 10–15% of women and 20–25% of men admitted to having engaged in [[extramarital sex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements,1994&quot;&gt;Clements, M. (1994, August 7). Sex in America today: A new national survey reveals how our attitudes are changing.

==Definitions==
In the traditional English [[common law]], adultery was a [[felony]]. Although the legal definition of &quot;adultery&quot; differs in nearly every legal system, the common theme is [[Human sexual behavior|sexual relations]] outside of marriage, in one form or another.

For example, [[New York]] defines an adulterer as a person who &quot;engages in [[sexual intercourse]] with another person at a time when he has a living spouse, or the other person has a living spouse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[North Carolina]] defines adultery as occurring when any man and woman &quot;lewdly and lasciviously associate, bed, and cohabit together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[common-law]] countries, adultery was also known as &quot;[[criminal conversation]]&quot;. This became the name of the civil [[tort]] arising from adultery, being based upon compensation for the other spouse's injury.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', 4th ed. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal conversation was usually referred to by lawyers as &quot;crim. con.&quot;, and was abolished in [[England]] in 1857, and the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1976. Another tort, [[alienation of affection]], arises when one spouse deserts the other for a third person.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', 4th ed. 1957, citing ''Young v. Young'', 236 Ala. 627, 184 So. 187. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This act was also known as desertion, which was often a crime as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of jurisdictions still allow suits for criminal conversation and/or alienation of affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carolinafamilylaw.com/criminal_conversation.html |title=Criminal Conversation: North Carolina Laws and Defense |publisher=Haas McNeil &amp; Associates, P.A. |accessdate=2010-07-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080604043419/http://www.carolinafamilylaw.com/criminal_conversation.html |archivedate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its abuse, at least one jurisdiction (Nevada) has abolished the tort of alienation of affection and has made it a misdemeanor crime to file such a lawsuit.

A marriage in which both spouses agree ahead of time to accept sexual relations by either partner with others is sometimes referred to as an [[open marriage]] or the [[swinging]] lifestyle.  Both are a form of [[non-monogamy]], and the spouses would not view the sexual relations as adultery, although it could still be considered a crime in some legal jurisdictions.

In Canada, though the written definition in the [[Divorce Act]] refers to extramarital relations with someone of the opposite sex, a [[British Columbia]] judge used the [[Civil Marriage Act]] in a 2005 case to grant a woman a divorce from her husband who had cheated on her with another man, which the judge felt was equal reasoning to dissolve the union.

A 2005 scientific review of international published studies of paternal discrepancy found a range in incidence from 0.8% to 30% (median 3.7%), suggesting that the widely quoted figure of 10% of non-paternal events is an overestimate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Non-paternity event]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greco-Roman world===
In the Greco-Roman world there were stringent laws against adultery, but these applied to sexual intercourse with a married woman. In the early [[Roman Law]] the ''jus tori'' belonged to the husband. It was therefore not a crime against the wife for a husband to have sex with a slave or an unmarried woman.&lt;ref&gt;Dig., XLVIII, ad leg. Jul.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well known that the Roman husband often took advantage of his legal immunity. Thus we are told by the historian [[Spartianus]] that [[Verus (senator)|Verus]], the imperial colleague of [[Marcus Aurelius]], did not hesitate to declare to his reproaching wife: &quot;Uxor enim dignitatis nomen est, non voluptatis.&quot; ('''Wife' connotes rank, not sexual pleasure'', or more literally &quot;Wife is the name of dignity, not bliss&quot;) (Verus, V).

Later in Roman history, as William E.H. Lecky has shown, the idea that the husband owed a fidelity similar to that demanded of the wife must have gained ground, at least in theory. Lecky gathers from the [[legal maxim]] of [[Ulpian]]: &quot;It seems most unfair for a man to require from a wife the chastity he does not himself practice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Justin., Digest, XLVIII, 5–13; Lecky, History of European Morals, II, 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lending of wives practiced among some people was, as [[Plutarch]] tells us, encouraged also by [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], though from a motive other than that which actuated the practice (Plutarch, Lycurgus, XXIX). The recognized license of the Greek husband may be seen in the following passage of the Oration against Neaera, the author of which is uncertain, though it has been attributed to [[Demosthenes]]:

:''We keep mistresses for our pleasures, concubines for constant attendance, and wives to bear us legitimate children and to be our faithful housekeepers. Yet, because of the wrong done to the husband only, the Athenian lawgiver Solon allowed any man to kill an adulterer whom he had taken in the act.'' (Plutarch, Solon)

The Roman [[Lex Julian]], ''Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis'' (17 BC), punished adultery with banishment &lt;ref name=&quot;UNRV History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/government/julianmarriage.php |title=The Julian marriage laws |publisher=Unrv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two guilty parties were sent to different islands (&quot;dummodo in ''diversas'' insulas relegentur&quot;), and part of their property was confiscated.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNRV History&quot; /&gt; Fathers were permitted to kill daughters and their partners in adultery. Husbands could kill the partners under certain circumstances and were required to divorce adulterous wives.

===Abrahamic religions===
{{POV|date=June 2008}}

====Biblical sources====
{{Main|Thou shalt not commit adultery}}
The [[Hebrew Bible]] (the [[Tanakh]] or [[Old Testament]]) prohibits adultery in the sixth of the [[Ten Commandments]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|20:14|NIV}}). Adultery in traditional Judaism applies equally to both parties, but it only applied in situations where the woman is married.

The Old Testament prescribes [[capital punishment]] for adultery between a man and married woman, though not for adultery between a woman and a married man.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Leviticus#Chapter 20|Lev. 20:10]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the Bible prescribes [[stoning]] not only for female [[Extramarital sex|''extra''marital sex]], but also for female [[Premarital sex|''pre''marital sex]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, … and say, / I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid. / … But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: / Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die. ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Deuteronomy#Chapter 22|Deut. 22:13-21]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bible even prescribes the same for engaged women who don't scream while being [[rape]]d, under the premise that their lack of screaming indicates willingness.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; / Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city. ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Deuteronomy#Chapter 22|Deut. 22:23-24]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Christianity====
{{see also|Christian views on marriage|Christian views on divorce|Pauline privilege}}
Adultery is considered by Christians to be immoral and a [[sin]], based primarily on passages like {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9–10|NIV}}. Although {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:11|NIV}} does say that &quot;and that is what some of you were. But you were washed&quot;, it still acknowledges adultery to be immoral and a sin. The [[Ten Commandments|sixth commandment]] (seventh in some traditions) (&quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot;) is also a basis, but see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

Jesus taught that indulgence in adulterous thoughts could be just as harmful to the soul as actual adultery, and it is clear that both carry the same weight of guilt:

:''But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.'' ({{bibleverse||Matthew|5:28|NIV}})

and he also says:

:But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.({{bibleverse||Matthew|5:32|NIV}})

Some churches have interpreted adultery to include all sexual relationships outside of marriage, regardless of the marital status of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?locale=0&amp;sourceId=54a0f73c28d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD |title=Ten Commandments |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100625002245/http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?locale=0&amp;sourceId=54a0f73c28d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD| archivedate= 25 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rabbinic Judaism====
Adultery in traditional Judaism applies equally to both parties, but depends on the marital status of the woman (Lev. 20:10). Though the [[Torah]] prescribes the death penalty for adultery, the legal procedural requirements were very exacting and required the testimony of two eye-witnesses of good character for conviction. The defendant also must have been warned immediately before performing the act.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonidies, Book of the Commandments, Prohibition 392 and the note at the end of Prohibition 347, Hebrew translation and notes by Rabbi Joseph Kapach, Mossad Harav Kook, Jerusalem 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  A death sentence could be issued only during the period when the Holy Temple stood, and only so long as the Supreme Torah Court convened in its chamber within the Temple complex.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides Mishneh Torah: Laws of Sanhedrin 14:11&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, therefore, no death penalty applies.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli: Tractate Ketuvoth 30a,b&lt;/ref&gt;

At the civil level, however, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (halakha) forbids a man to continue living with an adulterous wife, and he is obliged to divorce her. Also, an adulteress is not permitted to marry the adulterer, but, to avoid any doubt as to her status as being free to marry another or that of her children, many authorities say he must give her a divorce as if they were married.&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Way in Love &amp;amp; Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper &amp;amp; Row, San Francisco,1980&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Judaism, the [[Seven laws of Noah]] apply to all of humankind; these laws prohibit adultery with another man's wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishneh Torah]], Judges, Laws of Kings and Wars, Chapter 7 (Shabse Frankel edition, Jerusalem - B'nai B'rak, 5762 (c.2008, copyright 1998))&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Main|Zina (Arabic)}}

Zina (زنا) is an Arabic term for illegal intercourse; premarital or extramarital. Various conditions and punishments have been attributed to adultery.

Under [[Sharia|Muslim law]], [[extramarital sex|adultery in general]] is [[sexual intercourse]] by a person (whether man or woman) with someone to whom they are not married. Adultery is a violation of the marital contract and one of the major sins condemned by Allah in the [[Qur'an]]:

Qur'anic verses prohibiting adultery include:

: &quot;Do not go near to adultery. Surely it is a shameful deed and evil, opening roads (to other evils).&quot;{{Cite quran|17|32}}

: &quot;Say, 'Verily, my Lord has prohibited the shameful deeds, be it open or secret, sins and trespasses against the truth and reason.&quot;'{{Cite quran|7|33}}

Punishments are reserved to the legal authorities and false accusations are to be punished severely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-quran.info/#&amp;&amp;sura=24&amp;trans=no-einar_berg&amp;show=both,quran-uthmani&amp;format=rows&amp;ver=1.00 Online Qur'an Project Chapter 24].&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from slander and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and if they saw it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus no one can get convicted of adultery unless they both themselves agree and give their confession under oath four times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asmasociety.org/perspectives/article_8.html |title=American Muslims need to speak out against violations of Islamic Shariah law |publisher=www.asmasociety.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The punishment prescribed by the Qur'an is [[flogging]] 100 times in public for those found guilty&lt;ref&gt;Quran (24:2)&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the prophet Muhammad, an unmarried person who commits adultery or fornication is punished by flogging 100 times; a married person, however, receives the heavier punishment of stoning to death if she commits adultery.&lt;ref&gt;Hadith Muslim 17:4192. Also, see the following: Bukhari 6:60:79, Bukhari 83:37, Muslim 17:4196, Muslim 17:4206, Muslim 17:4209, Ibn Ishaq 970.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] found relatively widespread popular support for [[stoning]] as a punishment for adultery among Muslims in Egypt (82% of respondents in favor of the punishment), Jordan (70% in favor), Indonesia (42% in favor), Pakistan (82% favor) and Nigeria (56% in favor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah Retrieved 2011-06-02]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other historical practices===
In Native American cultures, severe penalties could be imposed on an adulterous wife by her husband. In many instances she was made to endure a bodily mutilation which would, in the mind of the aggrieved husband, prevent her from ever being a temptation to other men again.&lt;ref&gt;Schoolcraft, ''Historical and Statistical Information Respecting the History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States'', I, 236; V, 683, 684, 686.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Bancroft, ''The Native Races of the Pacific States of North America'', I, 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Laws of Manu]] of ancient India, for example, said: &quot;though destitute of virtue or seeking pleasure elsewhere, or devoid of good qualities, yet a husband must be constantly worshiped as a god by a faithful wife&quot;; on the other, hand, &quot;if a wife, proud of the greatness of her relatives or [her own] excellence, violates the duty which she owes to her lord, the king shall cause her to be devoured by dogs in a place frequented by many.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Laws of Manu, V, 154; VIII, 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and its successor states, it has been [[high treason]] to engage in adultery with the King's wife, his eldest son's wife and his eldest unmarried daughter. The jurist Sir William Blackstone writes that &quot;the plain intention of this law is to guard the Blood Royal from any suspicion of bastardy, whereby the succession to the Crown might be rendered dubious.&quot; Adultery was a serious issue when it came to succession to the crown. [[Philip IV of France]] had all three of his daughters-in-law imprisoned, two ([[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] and [[Blanche of Burgundy]]) on the grounds of adultery and the third ([[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]) for being aware of their adulterous behaviour. The two brothers accused of being lovers of the king's daughters-in-law were executed immediately after being arrested. The wife of Philip IV's eldest son bore a daughter, the future [[Joan II of Navarre]], whose paternity and succession rights were disputed all her life.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Asia====
In some East Asian [[jurisdiction|countries]] or regions, including [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title={{zh icon}} Criminal Code of the Republic of China ([[:zh:中華民國刑法|中華民國刑法]]), Article 239 (第二百三十九條) |url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0000001&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=239 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; adultery continues to be a crime. In the [[Philippines]], adultery (defined as consensual sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man who is not her husband) and a related act of concubinage (a man cohabiting with a woman who is not his wife), are considered crimes under the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]]. Adultery is not a crime in mainland China, but constitutes grounds for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China ([[s:zh:中华人民共和国婚姻法 (2001年)|中华人民共和国婚姻法]]), Article 32 (第三十二条) |url=http://www.nwccw.gov.cn/?action-viewnews-itemid-140641-page-2 |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pakistan, adultery is a crime under the [[Hudood Ordinance]]. The Ordinance sets a maximum penalty of [[capital punishment|death]], although only [[imprisonment]] and [[corporal punishment]] have ever actually been imposed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The Ordinance has been particularly controversial because it requires a woman making an accusation of [[rape]] to provide extremely strong evidence to avoid being charged with adultery herself. A conviction for rape is only possible with evidence from no fewer than four witnesses. In recent years high-profile rape cases in Pakistan have given the Ordinance more exposure than similar laws in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2005/07/13/nat2.htm Hudood laws open to change in Pakistan], July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Similar laws exist in some other Muslim countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]].

In Indian law, adultery is defined as sex between a man and a woman without the consent of the woman's husband. The man is prosecutable and can be sentenced for up to five years (even if he himself was unmarried) whereas the married woman cannot be jailed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-03/india/30471373_1_adultery-law-consent-or-connivance-offence &quot;Adultery law biased against men, says Supreme Court&quot;]''The Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt; Men have called the law [[gender discrimination]] in that women cannot be prosecuted for adultery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/aug/12adultery.htm 'Adultery law must apply equally to men and women'&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Commission of Women has criticized the British era law of being anti-feminist as it treats women as the property of their husbands and has consequentially recommended deletion of the law or reducing it to a civil offense. The Government is yet to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/26/stories/2006122603270900.htm &quot;NCW rejects proposal to punish women for adultery&quot;] ''The Hindu''&lt;/ref&gt; Extramarital sex without the consent of one's partner can be a valid grounds for monetary penalty on government employees, as ruled by the Central Administrative Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/CAT_penalises_cop_living_with_lover/articleshow/2786991.cms &quot;CAT penalises cop living with lover-Delhi-Cities&quot;] ''The Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southwest Asia, adultery has attracted severe [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], including [[death penalty]]. In some places, such as [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil Sears |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1200864/Saudi-princess-facing-death-penalty-adultery-given-secret-UK-asylum.html |title=Saudi princess facing death penalty over adultery given secret UK asylum &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-07-20 |accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the method of punishment for adultery is [[stoning]] to death. Proving adultery under Muslim law can be a very difficult task as it requires the accuser to produce four eye witnesses to the act of sexual intercourse, each of whom should have a good reputation for truthfulness and honesty. The criminal standards do not apply in the application of social and family consequences of adultery, where the standards of proof are not as exacting.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

====Europe====
European countries have decriminalized adultery. Adultery is not a crime in European countries.

====United States====
In the United States, laws vary from state to state. In those states where adultery is still on the statute books (although rarely prosecuted), penalties vary from [[life sentence]] ([[Michigan]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070206173058/http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070115/COL04/701150333 Adultery could mean life, court finds&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at web.archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt; to a $10 fine ([[Maryland]]) to a Class B misdemeanor ([[New York]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Penal Law Section 255.17 |url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a Class I felony ([[Wisconsin]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/Stat0944.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the state of South Carolina, the criminal fine for adultery is a fine no greater than $500 and/or imprisonment for no more than one year [South Carolina code 16-15-60], yet the divorce laws codified at South Carolina Code Section 20-3-60(A) deny alimony to the adulterous spouse, which in some cases can cost the adulterous spouse millions of dollars in future income.&lt;ref&gt;South Carolina Code of Laws, Sections 16 and 20, http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c015.php and http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t20c003.php&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the [[U.S. Military]], adultery is a potential [[court-martial]] offense.&lt;ref name=&quot;usmilitary.about.com&quot;/&gt; The enforceability of adultery laws in the United States is unclear following [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions since 1965 relating to privacy and sexual intimacy of consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., [[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, occasional prosecutions do occur.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Turley]], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62581-2004Sep4.html Of Lust and the Law], ''The Washington Post'', September 5, 2004, p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of adultery laws====
=====Political arguments=====
Laws against adultery have been blamed invasive and incompatible with principles of [[limited government]]. Much of the criticism comes from [[libertarianism]], the consensus among whose adherents is that government must not intrude into daily personal lives and that such disputes are to be settled privately rather than [[Prosecution|prosecuted]] and [[Sanctions (law)|penalized]] by [[public entities]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Opponents of adultery laws regard them as painfully archaic, believing they represent sanctions reminiscent of nineteenth-century novels. They further object to the legislation of morality, especially a morality so steeped in religious doctrine. Support for the preservation of the adultery laws comes from religious groups and from political parties who feel quite independent of morality, that the government has reason to concern itself with the consensual sexual activity of its citizens … The crucial question is: when, if ever, is the government justified to interfere in consensual bedroom affairs?&lt;ref&gt;Weissler, Benjamin. &quot;[http://yulr.org/government-and-the-bedroom/ Government and the Bedroom].&quot; July 13, 2012. ''Yale Undergraduate Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Historical context=====
Historically, in most cultures, laws against adultery were enacted only to prevent women—and not men—from having sexual relations with anyone other than their spouses, whose [[property]] they were deemed. Among many cultures the [[punishment|penalty]] was—and to this day still is, as noted [[Adultery#Violence|below]]—[[capital punishment]]. At the same time, men were free to maintain sexual relations with any women provided that the women didn't already have husbands or &quot;owners.&quot; Indeed, [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the [[Bible]], is synonymous with ''owner''. This arrangement has been deplored by many modern intellectuals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Laws against adultery are based upon the idea that woman is a chattel, so that to make love to a married woman is to deprive the husband of her services. It is the frankest and most crass statement of a slave-situation. To us, every woman … has …  an absolute right to travel in her own orbit. There is no reason why she should not be the ideal [[Wiktionary:hausfrau|hausfrau]], if that chance to be her will. But society has no right to insist upon that standard. It was, for practical reasons, almost necessary to set up such taboos in small communities, savage tribes, where the wife was nothing but a general servant, where the safety of the people depended upon a high birth-rate. But to-day woman is economically independent, becomes more so every year. The result is that she instantly asserts her right to have as many or as few men or babies as she wants or can get; and she defies the world to interfere with her. More power to her!&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|surname=Crowley|given=Aleister|authorlink=Aleister Crowley|year=1996|title=The Law is for All|place=Tempe, AZ|publisher=New Falcon Publications|chapter = 1:41, The New Comment|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1561840904/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other consequences===
For various reasons, most couples who marry do so with the expectation of [[Wiktionary:fidelity|fidelity]]. Adultery is often seen as a breach of trust and of the commitment that had been made during the act of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, &quot;Adultery&quot; |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2011-05-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110427092349/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery| archivedate= 27 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adultery can be emotionally traumatic for both spouses and often results in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About.com Divorce Support, &quot;Why Does Infidelity Often Lead to Divorce?&quot; |url=http://divorcesupport.about.com/b/2011/05/12/why-does-infidelity-often-lead-to-divorce.htm|publisher=About.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a new work, ''The New Rules'' by Dr Catherine Hakim, a French sociologist and author, she argues that a “sour and rigid English view” of [[Wiktionary:infidelity|infidelity]] is condemning millions of people to live frustrated “celibate” lives with their spouses. She argues that there is such a thing as a “successful affair” in which both parties are happier but no one gets hurt: “Sex is no more a moral issue than eating a good meal,” she writes. “The fact that we eat most meals at home with spouses and partners does not preclude eating out in restaurants to sample different cuisines and ambiences, with friends or colleagues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/9485796/Puritan-view-of-adultery-turns-Brits-into-caged-animals-says-academic.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery may lead to ostracization from certain religious or social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=www.catholicculture.org, &quot;Women as Guardians of Purity&quot; |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=6017|publisher= catholicculture.org |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery can also lead to feelings of guilt and jealousy in the person with whom the affair is being committed. In some cases, this &quot;third person&quot; may encourage divorce (either openly or subtly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= www.beatingjealousy.com, &quot;Signs of a Cheating Husband&quot; |url=http:// http://www.beatingjealousy.com/blog/?p=21|publisher= beatingjealousy.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cheating spouse has hinted at divorce in order to continue the affair, the third person may feel deceived if that does not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= http://www.essortment.com, &quot;Are You the Other Woman in an Affair&quot; |url=http://www.essortment.com/other-woman-affair-36524.html|publisher= essortment.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= http://www.truthaboutdeception.com, &quot;Getting Over an Affair as the Other Woman&quot; |url=http://www.truthaboutdeception.com/community-features/ask-an-expert/questions-by-topic/infidelity/577-getting-over-an-affair-as-the-other-woman.html|publisher= truthaboutdeception.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may simply withdraw with ongoing feelings of guilt, carry on an obsession with their lover, may choose to reveal the affair, or in rare cases commit violence or other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=www.trutv.com, &quot;Amy Fisher&quot; |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html|publisher= trutv.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since adultery can lead to divorce, it may have long-term consequences for children in the family. Children of divorcees are twice as likely to have problems as adults with mental illness, substance abuse, and failed relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=nasponline.org, &quot;Divorce: A Parents’ Guide for Supporting Children&quot; |url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/parenting/divorce_ho.aspx|publisher= nasponline.org |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If adultery leads to divorce, it also carries higher financial burdens.&lt;ref name=&quot;divorcehq.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=divorcehq.com, &quot;Comparison of the Average Cost of Divorce Fees&quot; |url=http://www.divorcehq.com/articles/comparisonfees.shtml|publisher= divorcehq.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, living expenses and taxes are generally cheaper for married couples than for divorced couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=attorneys.com, &quot;The Hidden Costs of Divorce&quot; |url=http://www.attorneys.com/legal_center/articles/divorce/s/c/the_hidden_costs_of_divorce:_don't_overlook_these_expenses/|publisher= attorneys.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal fees can add up into the tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;divorcehq.com&quot;/&gt;  Divorced spouses may not qualify for benefits such as health insurance, which must then be paid out-of-pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=divorcehq.com, &quot;Divorce and COBRA&quot; |url=http://www.divorcehq.com/articles/divorce_cobra.shtml|publisher= divorcehq.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any sexual contact, adultery may result in sexually-transmitted diseases. Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=family.jrank.org, &quot;Birth Control – Contraceptive Methods, Sociocultural and Historical Aspects&quot; |url=http://family.jrank.org/pages/163/Birth-Control.html|publisher= jrank.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cheating spouse is very likely to transmit any infection to their unwitting spouse. This is a form of physical victimization that extends beyond the emotional and social consequences often associated with [[Wiktionary:infidelity|infidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=biermandermatology.com, &quot;Legal Aspects&quot; |url=http://biermandermatology.com/bierman_004.htm|publisher= biermandermatology.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adultery is still illegal in some jurisdictions, such as Wisconsin, where it is a felony.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence==
[[File:Adulteri.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Inca]] woman and man to be stoned for adultery, by [[Huamán Poma]]]]
Historically, female adultery often resulted in extreme violence, including [[murder]] (of the woman, her lover, or both, committed by her husband). Today [[domestic violence]] is outlawed in the [[Western World]], but this is not the case in many [[developing countries]].

===Honor killings===
{{Main|Honor killing}}
[[Honor killings]] are often connected to accusations of adultery. Honor killings continue to be legal in parts of the world.

According to the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (2002) concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women (E/CN.4/2002/83):

:The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[Guatemala]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Peru]], [[Syria]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unhchr&quot;/&gt;

Part of article 340 of the Penal Code of [[Jordan]] states that &quot;he who discovers his wife or one of his female relatives committing adultery and kills, wounds, or injures one of them, is exempted from any penalty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GP&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Altstein,Howard;Simon, Rita James|title=Global perspectives on social issues: marriage and divorce|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|location=Lexington, Mass|year=2003|page=11|isbn=0-7391-0588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Syria]], Article 548 states, &quot;He who catches his wife or one of his ascendants, descendants or sister committing adultery (''[[flagrante delicto]]'') or illegitimate sexual acts with another and he killed or injured one or both of them benefits from an exemption of penalty.&quot;

According to the UN in 2002:

:&quot;The report of the [[Special Rapporteur]] ... concerning cultural practices in the family that are violent towards women (E/CN.4/2002/83), indicated that honour killings had been reported in [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Syria|Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Turkey]], [[Yemen]], and other Mediterranean and Persian Gulf countries, and that they had also taken place in western countries such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, within migrant communities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unhchr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/985168F508EE799FC1256C52002AE5A9/$File/N0246790.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu-Ghanem women speak out against serial 'honor killings'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/829440.html|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=2007-02-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070225090106/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/829440.html| archivedate= 25 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoning===
{{Main|Stoning}}
[[Stoning]], or lapidation, refers to a form of [[capital punishment]] whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies, or (in ancient Judaism) the condemned person is pushed from a platform set high enough above a stone floor that the fall would probably result in instantaneous death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jlaw.com/Briefs/capital2.html|title = Examining Halcha, Jewish issues and secular law|last = Rapps|first = Dennis|coauthors = Weinberg, Lewin|date = December 1999|work = Jewish Law:Legal briefs|publisher = Ira Kasdan|accessdate=2009-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091105092848/http://www.jlaw.com/Briefs/capital2.html| archivedate= 5 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning continues to be practiced today, in parts of the world. Recently, several people have been sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali, and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-467588/Iranian-wife-faces-death-stoning-adultery.html |title=Iranian wife faces death by stoning for adultery |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Seamark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8366197.stm |title=Somali woman stoned for adultery |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Tait and Noushin Hoseiny |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/21/iran.humanrights |title=Eight women and a man face stoning in Iran for adultery |work= The Guardian |date= 2008-07-21|accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479752,00.html &quot;Two Men Stoned to Death for Adultery in Iran&quot;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10983494 | work=BBC News | title=Taliban 'kill adulterous Afghan couple' | date=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2011/01/27/woman-stoned-to-death-in-north-afghanistan.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/31/sudanese-woman-stoning-death-adultery | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Smith | title=Sudanese woman sentenced to stoning death over adultery claims | date=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/02/world/africa/mali-couple-stoned/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/18/couple-sentenced-pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;
