Outside Japan, &quot;lolicon&quot; is in less common usage and usually refers to the genre.

The phrase is a reference to [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s book ''[[Lolita]]'', in which a middle-aged man becomes sexually obsessed with a twelve-year-old girl. It was first used in Japan in the 1970s and quickly became used to describe erotic [[dojinshi]] (amateur comics) portrayals of young girls. 

Laws have been enacted in various countries, including in Japan, which regulate explicit content featuring children or childlike characters. Parent and citizens groups in Japan have organized to work toward stronger controls and stricter laws governing lolicon manga and other similar media. Critics say that the lolicon genre contributes to actual [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse of children]], while others say that there is no evidence for this claim. Studies of lolicon fans state that lolicon fans are attracted to an aesthetic of cuteness rather than the age of the characters,&lt;ref name=Akagi/&gt; and that collecting lolicon represents a disconnect from society.&lt;ref name=Ito/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shigematsu 138&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goode/&gt;

== Definition ==
Generally, lolicon manga and anime portray sexual attraction to younger girls or to girls with youthful characteristics. Three kinds of sexual attraction to young people have been identified in adults: [[pedophilia]], preference for prepubescent girls or boys; [[hebephilia]], preference for early pubescent girls or boys (generally 11–14 years old); and [[ephebophilia]], preference for mid-to-late adolescents (generally 15–19 years old).&lt;ref&gt;Bering, Jesse (July 1, 2009) Pedophiles, Hebephiles and Ephebophiles, Oh My: Erotic Age Orientation; Why most &quot;pedophiles&quot; aren't really pedophiles, technically speaking. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pedophiles-erotic-age-orientation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;springerlink.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|quote=[The term 'hebephilia'] has not come into widespread use, even among professionals who work with sex offenders. One can only speculate why not. It may have been confused with the term ephebophile, which denotes men who prefer adolescents around 15–19 years of age (Krafft-Ebing &amp; Moll, 1924). Few would want to label erotic interest in late- or even mid-adolescents as a psychopathology, so the term hebephilia may have been ignored along with ephebophilia...|last=Blanchard |first=R. |last2=Lykins |first2=A.

Strictly speaking, ''Lolita complex'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] refers to the [[paraphilia]] itself, but the abbreviation ''lolicon'' can also refer to an individual who has the paraphilia.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWD&quot;/&gt; Lolicon is a widespread {{Dubious|What is the &quot;description&quot; section supposed to be for?|date=March 2011}} phenomenon in Japan, where it is a frequent subject of scholarly articles and criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultmanga&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsella|first=Sharon|title=Adult Manga|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2000|pages={{Page needed|date=March 2011}}|isbn=0-8248-2318-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many general bookstores and newsstands openly offer illustrated lolicon material, but there has also been police action against lolicon manga.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultmanga&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[kawaii]]'' (cute) and ''[[ero kawaii]]'' (erotic-cute) style is extremely popular in Japan, where it is present in many of the manga/anime styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;darker side&quot;&gt;&quot;The Darker Side of Cuteness,&quot; ''The Economist'', May 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The school-age girl in a school uniform is also an erotic symbol in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamland japan&quot;/&gt; [[Burusera]] shops cater to men with lolicon complexes by selling unwashed panties, men can make dates with teenagers through ''[[terekura]]'' (telephone clubs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breaking the mould |first=Ben |last=Hills |author2=Kanamori, Mayu |url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=nstore&amp;kw=%22Breaking+The+Mould%22&amp;pb=smh&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=news951006_0036_7782 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=6 October 1995 |page=Spectrum, p.9 |accessdate=13 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some schoolgirls moonlight as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56844390.html|title=Teen prostitutes sell favors after school in Tokyo|author=Willis Witter|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=April 6, 1997|accessdate=January 13, 2008|format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon Kinsella observed an increase in unsubstantiated accounts of [[enjo kosai|schoolgirl prostitution]] in the media in the late 1990s, and speculated that these unproven reports developed in counterpoint to the increased reporting on [[comfort women]].

==Genre characteristics and meaning outside Japan==
Lolicon manga are usually short stories, published as ''[[dōjinshi]]'' (fan works) or in magazines specializing in the genre such as ''[[Lemon People]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith 2011&quot;/&gt; ''[[Manga Burikko]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;kieta&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Shinpo |editor1-first=Nobunaga |editor1-link=:ja:新保信長 |title=消えたマンガ雑誌 |trans_title=Vanished Manga Magazines |date=February 14, 2000 |publisher=[[Media Factory]] |location=[[Tokyo]], Japan |language=Japanese |isbn=4-8401-0006-3 |pages=30–37 |trans_chapter=It all started with erotica  |chapter=すべてはエロから始まった}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bouissou&quot;&gt;Bouissou, Jean-Marie.

Akira Akagi believes that during the 1980s, the lolicon genre changed from being tales of a young girl having sex with an older man to being about &quot;girl-ness&quot; and &quot;cuteness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith 2011&quot;/&gt; Akagi identifies subgenres within ''lolicon'' of [[sadomasochism]], &quot;groping objects&quot; ([[tentacle sex|tentacles]] and robots replacing the role of the [[penis]]), &quot;[[mecha]] fetishes&quot; (a combination of a machine, usually a weapon, and a girl), parodies of mainstream anime and manga, and &quot;simply indecent or perverted stuff&quot;. Additionally, lolicon can include themes of [[lesbianism in pornography|lesbianism]] and [[masturbation]].&lt;ref name=Akagi&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shigematsu|first=Setsu|title=Themes and Issues in Asian Cartooning:  Cute, Cheap, Mad and Sexy|year=1999|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-779-6|pages=129–130|editor=Lent, J.A.|location=Bowling Green, OH|chapter=Dimensions of Desire: Sex, Fantasy and Fetish in Japanese Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is disagreement if this definition also applies to childlike characters who are not clearly prepubescent and if it applies to material lacking explicit [[sexual content]].&lt;ref name=&quot;comic relief&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=amrgloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=Teatrino&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2010-06-14 | title=Shelf Life: Teatrino for Two | accessdate=March 14, 2011 | author=Finnegan, Eric | date=June 14, 2010 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin===
The phrase is a reference to [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s book ''[[Lolita]]'', in which a middle-age man becomes sexually obsessed with a twelve-year-old girl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella305&quot;&gt;Kinsella, 305.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Lolita complex&quot; was first used in the early 1970s with the translation of [[Russell Trainer]]'s ''The Lolita Complex'' and may have entered Japanese [[nomenclature]] at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otaku&quot;/&gt; Shinji Wada used the word in his {{Nihongo|''Stumbling upon a Cabbage Field''|キャベツ畑でつまずいて|Kyabetsu-batake de Tsumazuite|}}, an ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' manga parody in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;KyabetsuBatake&quot;&gt;[[Shinji Wada]], &quot;Kyabetsu-batake de Tsumazuite&quot; in ''[[Bessatsu Margaret]]'', June, 1974, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; The shortening of the term to &quot;lolicon&quot; came later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otaku&quot;/&gt; Early lolicon idols were Clarisse from ''[[Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979) and the shōjo heroine [[Minky Momo]], (1982) as female characters in ''[[shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' series at that point were largely mothers or older-sister characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otaku&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lam, Fan-Yi. 2010. Comic market: How the world's biggest amateur comic fair shaped Japanese dōjinshi culture. [[Mechademia: An Annual Forum for Anime, Manga, and the Fan Arts]], Volume 5, pp. 236, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Clarisse was depicted as 16, older than most &quot;lolicon&quot; images today, she inspired &quot;fairytale-esque&quot; or &quot;girly&quot; fanworks. Galbraith asserts that Minky Momo was an attempt to court lolicon fans.  This is denied by [[Satō Toshihiko]], who planned the original Minky Momo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith 2011&quot;&gt;Galbraith, Patrick W. (2011) [http://www.imageandnarrative.be/index.php/imagenarrative/article/viewFile/127/98 Lolicon: The Reality of ‘Virtual Child Pornography’ in Japan] Image &amp; Narrative '''12''' 1 83-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s - 2000s===
The lolicon manga genre began in the 1980s with [[Hideo Azuma]]'s works, such as {{Nihongo|''The Machine Which Came from the Sea''|海から来た機械|Umi kara Kita Kikai|}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1979, Azuma had previously published the first &quot;blatantly lolicon&quot; manga in his own self-published ''dōjinishi'' magazine ''Cybele''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Otaku&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReviewOfLoliconDojinshi&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} Maruta Hara and Kazuo Shimizu, {{Nihongo|&quot;The Lolicon Dōjinshi Reviews&quot;|ロリコン同人誌レビュー|Rorikon Dōjinshi Rebyū}}[http://web.archive.org/web/20061109193822/http://azicon1.at.infoseek.co.jp/1980S.htm] in ''Apple Pie'', March, 1982, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Azuma's works became popular among schoolboy readers because most of the pornographic manga up until then had featured mature women influenced by ''[[gekiga]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Other ''dōjinshi'' magazines began featuring &quot;underage or barely pubescent virgins&quot; in erotic contexts and by the late 1980s this &quot;fantasy genre&quot; had spread to some mass market magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;sixty years&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gravett|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Gravett|title=[[Manga: Sixty Years of Japanese Comics]]|year=2004|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-391-0|page=136|location=[[London]], [[England]]|chapter=Personal Agendas}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederik L. Schodt]] and Dinah Zank both suggest that Japanese laws prohibiting the depiction of pubic hair may have encouraged the spread of &quot;erotic manga with a rorikon flavor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamland japan&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|authorlink=Frederik L.

Frederik L. Schodt has suggested that one reason lolicon manga is popular with some fans is because the female characters portrayed are &quot;younger, slightly softer, [and] rarely possessing an in-your-face aggressive feminism&quot; which is often found in female characters in American comics.&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamland japan2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|authorlink=Frederik L.

Public attention was brought to bear on lolicon when [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]] kidnapped and murdered four girls between the ages of 4 and 7 in 1988 and 1989, committing acts of [[necrophilia]] with their corpses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/nn20060118a2.html &quot;Serial killer Miyazaki must hang: Supreme Court&quot;], ''The Japan Times''. 01/18/2006. Retrieved July 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was found to be a &quot;withdrawn and obsessive&quot; [[otaku]] and in particular he enjoyed lolicon.

==Controversy==
{{See also|Legal status of cartoon pornography depicting minors}}
The legal status of lolicon manga and anime that portray children involved erotically with adults has changed with time and is currently under intensive debate in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultmanga&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, Ken. ''The Subcultures Reader'', 2nd ed. Oxon: Routledge, 2005. p. 547. ISBN 0-415-34415-8&lt;/ref&gt;  A Japanese non-profit organization called CASPAR has claimed that lolicon and other anime magazines and games encourage [[sex crime]]s.&lt;ref name=AnimeNewsNetwork/&gt; According to Galbraith, Yasushi Takatsuki has noted that sexual abuse of minors in Japan has declined since the 1960s and 70s, which &quot;roughly coincides with the increasing presence of fictional lolicon&quot;. Galbraith feels that this is not an argument that lolicon &quot;compensates for or relieves real desires&quot;, but instead that lolicon imagery does not &quot;reflect the desires&quot; of readers, or inspire them to commit crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith 2011&quot;/&gt; It has been suggested that restricting sexual expression in drawings or animated games and videos might actually increase the rate of sexual crime by eliminating a harmless outlet for desires that could motivate crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Internet Association Japan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iajapan.org/hotline/center/20060531public.html|title=｢ホットライン運用ガイドライン案｣等に対する意見の募集結果について|publisher=Internet Association Japan|date=May 31, 2006|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}

Cultural critic [[Hiroki Azuma]] said that very few readers of lolicon manga commit crimes.  He states that in the otaku culture, lolicon is the &quot;most convenient [form of rebellion]&quot; against society.  Azuma says that some otaku feel so &quot;excluded from society&quot; that they &quot;feel as if they are the sort of 'no good' person who should be attracted to little girls&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;comic relief&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20040427zg.html|title=Does comic relief hurt kids?|author=Tony McNicol|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=April 27, 2004|accessdate=January 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Goode describes the accumulation of lolicon materials as being &quot;a medium through which disaffected men may choose to express their sense of [[anomie]] and disconnection with society&quot;.  When questioning the relationship of lolicon to &quot;finding children in real life sexually attractive&quot;, Goode presents the argument of a lolicon fan &quot;that even if I could be classified as a kind of anime lolicon, it'd NEVER translate into [[real life|RL]] pedophilia.  This is predicated on the belief that the anime lolis I like DO NOT EXIST in RL.&quot;&lt;ref name=Goode&gt;{{cite book|last=Goode|first=Sarah D.|title=Understanding and addressing adult sexual attraction to children: a study of paedophiles in contemporary society|year=2009|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=978-0-415-44625-9|pages=29|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pKcQY5fUfFAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=lolicon#v=onepage&amp;q=lolicon&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 March 2011|chapter=Paedophiles online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Setsu Shigematsu believes that lolicon manga should not be equated to photographic or [[Pornographic film|adult video]] lolicon materials which involve real children; instead she argues that lolicon represents an artificial sexuality, turning away from &quot;three dimensional reality&quot; and redirecting sexual energies towards &quot;two dimensional figures of desire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shigematsu 138&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shigematsu|first=Setsu|title=Themes and Issues in Asian Cartooning:  Cute, Cheap, Mad and Sexy|year=1999|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-779-6|page=138|editor=Lent, J.A.|location=Bowling Green, OH|chapter=Dimensions of Desire: Sex, Fantasy and Fetish in Japanese Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akira Akagi writes that in lolicon manga, the girl represents cuteness, and that it is not her age which makes her attractive,&lt;ref name=Akagi/&gt; and furthermore, that lolicon fans project themselves onto lolicon characters, identifying themselves with the girl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galbraith 2011&quot;/&gt;

Lolicon manga has been and is marketed to both boys and men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shigematsu 129&quot;/&gt; Sharon Kinsella wrote that lolicon manga was a late-1980s outgrowth of girls' manga,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella305&quot; /&gt; which included ''[[yaoi]]'' and parodies of boys' and adult manga.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella, 304.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred as more men attended amateur manga conventions and as new boys' amateur manga genres appeared at [[Comiket]]. Kinsella distinguished between the attitudes toward gender of amateur lolicon manga and that of male fans of girls' manga.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella305&quot; /&gt; While parody manga created by women ridicule male stereotypes and appeal to both male and female fans, lolicon manga &quot;usually features a girl heroine with large eyes and a body that is both voluptuous and child-like, scantily clad in an outfit that approximates a cross between a 1970s bikini and a space-age suit of armour&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella305&quot; /&gt; This latter feature expresses both fear of and desire for young women, who have become increasingly powerful in Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, 82. Kinsella, 306.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2011}} Kinsella noted dominant British and American genres and imports of animation video in the 1990s derived from lolicon manga, suggesting women, and therefore also men, in all of these countries have gone through similar social and cultural experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella, 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ito characterises otaku as having more affection towards the anime and manga world than for a realistic world, saying that to the otaku, the two-dimensional world portrayed becomes &quot;more real&quot;. Ito views the preference for young girls as sex objects in manga and anime to be due to a change in Japanese society in the 1970s and 1980s. Ito says that at that time, boys felt that girls were &quot;surpassing them in terms of willpower and action&quot;. However, as the boys believed girls to be the weaker sex, the boys began focussing on young girls &quot;who were 'easy to control'&quot;. Additionally, the young girls of lolicon exist in the media, which Ito points out is a place where one can control things however they want.&lt;ref name=Ito&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ito | first1 = K. | year = 1992 | title = Cultural Change and Gender Identity Trends in the 1970s and 1980s | journal = International Journal of Japanese Sociology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 79–98 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6781.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical responses to lolicon manga and anime ==
Responding to the portrayal of Clarisse from ''Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro'', Hayao Miyazaki criticized the lolicon artists and fans who idolize her in what he considers a demeaning manner. He differentiates his female [[protagonist]]s, labeling those the aforementioned idolize, according to ''The Otaku Encyclopedia'', &quot;as pets&quot;.&lt;ref name=Otaku/&gt; Later, he would go on to say, {{quote|&quot;It's difficult. [My female protagonists] immediately become the subjects of rorikon gokko (play toy for Lolita Complex males). In a sense, if we want to depict someone who is affirmative to us, we have no choice but to make them as lovely as possible. But now, there are too many people who shamelessly depict [such protagonists] as if they just want [such girls] as pets, and things are escalating more and more.&quot;|Hayao Miyazaki|1988 interview with ''[[Animage]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Animage Interview: Miyazaki&quot;/&gt;}}He expressed concern as to what this might mean for &quot;[[human rights]] for women.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Animage Interview: Miyazaki&quot;&gt;[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/heroines.html#s3original source: ''Animage'', vol. 125, November 1988].
