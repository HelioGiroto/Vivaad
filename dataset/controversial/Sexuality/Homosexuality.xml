'''Homosexuality''' is [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[sexual attraction]] or [[Human sexual activity|behavior]] between members of the same [[sex]] or [[gender]]. As an [[sexual orientation|orientation]], homosexuality refers to &quot;an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual, affectionate, or romantic attractions&quot; primarily or exclusively to people of the same sex; &quot;it also refers to an individual's sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviors expressing them, and membership in a [[LGBT community|community of others]] who share them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;apahelp&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Sexual Orientation, Homosexuality, and Bisexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amici&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf Page 30 |title=Case No. S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of California, In re Marriage Cases Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4365(...) - APA California Amicus Brief&amp;nbsp;— As Filed |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation, along with [[bisexuality]] and [[heterosexuality]], within the [[heterosexual-homosexual continuum]] (with [[asexuality]] sometimes considered a fourth).

The most common terms for homosexual people are ''[[lesbian]]'' for females and ''[[gay]]'' for males, though ''gay'' is also used to refer generally to both homosexual males and females. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian—and the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences—are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;levay&quot;&gt;[[Simon LeVay|LeVay, Simon]] (1996).

One widely reported early estimate was 10% (e.g., Marmor, 1980; Voeller, 1990). Some recent data provided support for this estimate (Bagley and Tremblay, 1998), but most recent large national samples suggest that the prevalence of male homosexuality in modern western societies, including the United States, is lower than this early estimate (e.g., 1–2% in Billy et al., 1993; 2–3% in Laumann et al., 1994; 6% in Sell et al., 1995; 1–3% in Wellings et al., 1994). It is of note, however, that homosexuality is defined in different ways in these studies. For example, some use same-sex behavior and not same-sex attraction as the operational definition of homosexuality (e.g., Billy et al., 1993); many sex researchers (e.g., Bailey et al., 2000; Bogaert, 2003; Money, 1988; Zucker and Bradley, 1995) now emphasize attraction over overt behavior in conceptualizing sexual orientation.&quot; (p. 33) Also: &quot;...the prevalence of male homosexuality (in particular, same-sex attraction) varies over time and across societies (and hence is a &quot;moving target&quot;) in part because of two effects: (1) variations in fertility rate or family size; and (2) the fraternal birth order effect. Thus, even if accurately measured in one country at one time, the rate of male homosexuality is subject to change and is not generalizable over time or across societies.&quot; (p. 33)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fay1989&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fay RE, Turner CF, Klassen AD, Gagnon JH |title=Prevalence and patterns of same-gender sexual contact among men |journal=Science |volume=243 |issue=4889 |pages=338–48 |year=1989 |month=January |pmid=2911744 |doi=10.1126/science.2911744|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Johnson1992&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Johnson AM, Wadsworth J, Wellings K, Bradshaw S, Field J |title=Sexual lifestyles and HIV risk |journal=Nature |volume=360 |issue=6403 |pages=410–2 |year=1992 |month=December |pmid=1448163 |doi=10.1038/360410a0|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Laumann1994&gt;Laumann, E.

The word homosexual is a Greek and Latin hybrid with the first element derived from Greek ὁμός homos, 'same' (not related to the Latin homo, 'man', as in Homo sapiens), thus connoting sexual acts and affections between members of the same sex, including lesbianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Dictionary of True Etymologies|last=Room |first=Adrian |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0710203403 |page=84 |pages= |accessdate=October 5, 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Student's Dictionary of Psychology|last=Statt |first=David A. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Psychology Press |location= |isbn=978-1841693422 |page=93 |pages= |accessdate=October 5, 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krafft-Ebing's book was so popular among both layman and doctors that the terms &quot;heterosexual&quot; and &quot;homosexual&quot; became the most widely accepted terms for sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/krafft_ebing_r.html Krafft-Ebing, Richard von (1840-1902)]. ''[[glbtq.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=psexualis&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kino.com/psychopathia/history.html |title=Psychopathia Sexualis |accessdate=2007-09-07 |periodical=Kino.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the current use of the term has its roots in the broader 19th-century tradition of personality taxonomy.
 
Many modern [[style guide]]s in the U.S. recommend against using ''homosexual'' as a noun, instead using ''gay man'' or ''lesbian''.&lt;ref name=glaad&gt;[http://www.glaad.org/referenceguide Media Reference Guide] (citing AP, NY Times, [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] style guides), [[GLAAD]]. Retrieved 2007-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some recommend completely avoiding usage of ''homosexual'' as it has a negative, clinical history and because the word only refers to one's sexual behavior (as opposed to romantic feelings) and thus it has a negative [[connotation]].&lt;ref name=glaad/&gt; ''Gay'' and ''lesbian'' are the most common alternatives. The first letters are frequently combined to create the [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] LGBT (sometimes written as GLBT), in which ''B'' and ''T'' refer to [[bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people.

Although early writers also used the adjective ''homosexual'' to refer to any single-sex context (such as an all-girls school), today the term is used exclusively in reference to sexual attraction, activity, and orientation. The term ''[[homosocial]]'' is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual. There is also a word referring to same-sex love, ''[[homophilia]]''.

Some synonyms for same-sex attraction or sexual activity include ''[[men who have sex with men]]'' or ''MSM'' (used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual activity) and ''[[homoeroticism|homoerotic]]'' (referring to works of art).&lt;ref name=UNAIDS&gt;{{cite web|title= UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men|publisher= UNAIDS|url= http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Younger|first=John G.|title=Sex in the ancient world from A to Z|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-415-24252-5|pages=38|edition=1st published.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pejorative]] terms in English include ''[[queer]]'', ''[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]'', ''[[fairy]]'', ''poof'', and ''homo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2000|isbn=0-618-70172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Spears | first = Richard A. | title = Fag | work = Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions | date=2007 | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faggot | accessdate = 4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dalzell|2008|p=1104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=terms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/ |title=Dictionary of Sexual Terms|publisher=Sex-lexis.com |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1990s, some of these have been [[reclaimed word|reclaimed]] as positive words by gay men and lesbians, as in the usage of [[queer studies]], [[queer theory]], and even the popular American television program ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Marvin J.|title=Queer Things from Old Closets: Libraries Gay and Lesbian Studies - Queer Theory|url=http://rbm.acrl.org/content/rbml/8/1/19.full.pdf|publisher=[[Association of College and Research Libraries]]|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''{{linktext|homo}}'' occurs in many other languages without the pejorative connotations it has in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=eds|first=Marc Wolinsky|title=Gays and the military : Joseph Steffan versus the United States|year=1993|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691033072|pages=49-55|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kM8WgQQghwIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=Gays+military+homo+derogatory+epithet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GKgHK00BxL&amp;sig=MpmlY0QZHaF2ebPZ3o-phV1IMmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xxFuULTrGqP20gH5x4EY&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Gays%20military%20homo%20derogatory%20epithet&amp;f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[ethnic slur]]s and [[racial slur]]s, however, the misuse of these terms can still be highly offensive; the range of acceptable use depends on the context and speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=eds|first=Marc Wolinsky ...|title=Gays and the military: Joseph Steffan versus the United States|year=1993|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691033072|pages=40-48|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kM8WgQQghwIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=Gays+military+homo+derogatory+epithet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GKgHK00BxL&amp;sig=MpmlY0QZHaF2ebPZ3o-phV1IMmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xxFuULTrGqP20gH5x4EY&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Gays%20military%20homo%20derogatory%20epithet&amp;f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''gay'', a word originally embraced by homosexual men and women as a positive, affirmative term (as in [[gay liberation]] and [[gay rights]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|title=Homosexualities|year=2000|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=9780226551944|pages=394|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HCikDlcEHw8C&amp;pg=PA394&amp;lpg=PA394&amp;dq=word+%27gay%27+was+preferred+to+previous+designations+such+as+homosexual+or+homophile&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jUaSybVBYX&amp;sig=B4ryZ9to-KUxd0qSFYV4OLFMQXE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qBBuUIClOMjn0gHavoCgBg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=word%20%27gay%27%20was%20preferred%20to%20previous%20designations%20such%20as%20homosexual%20or%20homophile&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; has come into widespread [[Gay#Generalized pejorative use|pejorative use]] among young people.&lt;ref name=bbcgay&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7289390.stm|title=How 'gay' became children's insult of choice|accessdate=4 October 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|author=Denise Winterman|date=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Main|LGBT history|Timeline of LGBT history}}
Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death.

In a detailed compilation of [[historical]] and [[ethnographic]] materials of [[Pre-industrial society|Preindustrial Cultures]], &quot;strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept. Of 70 [[Ethnography|ethnographies]], 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adolescence and puberty By John Bancroft, June Machover Reinisch, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]]. The condemnation of [[anal sex]] between males, however, predates Christian belief. It was frequent in ancient Greece; &quot;unnatural&quot; can be traced back to [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;... sow illegitimate and bastard seed in courtesans, or sterile seed in males in defiance of nature.&quot; Plato in THE LAWS (Book VIII p.841 edition of Stephanus) or p.340, edition of Penguin Books, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historical figures, including [[Socrates]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Roman Homosexuality By Craig Arthur Williams, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; have had terms such as ''gay'' or ''[[bisexual]]'' applied to them; some scholars, such as [[Michel Foucault]], have regarded this as risking the [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] introduction of a contemporary [[social construction|construction]] of sexuality foreign to their times,&lt;ref name=foucault&gt;{{harv|Foucault|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others challenge this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hubbard Thomas K | year = | title = Review of David M. Halperin, ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality.'' | url = | journal = [[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]] | date=2003-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding homosexuality nature and historic expression there are two seemingly opposite positions. These are represented by a ''constructionist'' and an ''essentialist'' approach. In general [[Social constructionism]] considers that there are &quot;social constructions&quot; resulting from the many characteristics of a particular social group, and not from some essential nature of the individual self. On the other hand [[Essentialism|Essentialists]] defend the existence of real essences that define the individual’s expressions, and social learned aspects are only secondary. [[David M. Halperin]] devotes a chapter:''Homosexuality: a cultural construct'' of his work ''One Hundred Years of Homosexuality'' to this subject.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Halperin, ''One Hundred Years of Homosexuality'', Rouledge, 1990, ISBN 978-0-415-90097-3&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the essentialism applied to sexual categories means that the terms like &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;straight&quot; refer to culturally not modifiable, essentially personal traits. On the contrary, Constructionists mean that these terms are the names of social processes. Halperin leans towards this last position, as he considers that sexuality, including homosexuality, has been expressed in essentially different ways in different historic societies, as it is in present day ones. He, nevertheless, cites Esteven Epstein &lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Esteven, ''Gay Politics, Ethnic Identity: The Limits of Social Constructionism'', Socialist Review, 1987 nos. 93/94 = 17.3-4:9-54&lt;/ref&gt; that compares the controversy between essentialists and constructionists to the general [[Nature versus Nurture]] debate. As one of the  main representatives of essentialists he cites [[John Boswell]], and [[Michel Foucault]] as a prominent constructionist.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Queer theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gay'' generally refers to male homosexuality, but may be used in a broader sense to refer to all [[LGBT]] people. In the context of sexuality, ''lesbian'' refers only to female homosexuality. The word &quot;lesbian&quot; is derived from the name of the Greek island [[Lesbos]], where the poet [[Sappho]] wrote largely about her emotional relationships with young women.&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Johnson, Terry Ryan: ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman society and literature: a sourcebook'' p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lesbian |title=Lesbian &amp;#124; Define Lesbian at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Though often ignored or suppressed by European explorers and colonialists, homosexual expression in native Africa was also present and took a variety of forms. Anthropologists [[Stephen O. Murray|Stephen Murray]] and [[Will Roscoe]] reported that women in [[Lesotho]] engaged in socially sanctioned &quot;long term, erotic relationships&quot; called ''motsoalle.''&lt;ref name=murrayroscoe&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boy Wives and Female Husbands: Studies of African Homosexualities |last=Murray |first=Stephen (ed.) |authorlink=Stephen O. Murray |coauthors=[[Will Roscoe|Roscoe, Will]] (ed.) |year=1998 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-23829-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] also recorded that male [[Azande]] warriors in the northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] routinely took on young male lovers between the ages of twelve and twenty, who helped with household tasks and participated in [[intercrural sex]] with their older husbands. The practice had died out by the early 20th century, after Europeans had gained control of African countries, but was recounted to Evans-Pritchard by the elders to whom he spoke.&lt;ref name=evanspritchard&gt;[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard, E. E.]] (December, 1970). Sexual Inversion among the Azande. American Anthropologist, New Series, 72(6), 1428–1434.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first record of possible homosexual couple in history is commonly regarded as [[Khnumhotep &amp; Niankhkhnum|Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum]], an Egyptian male couple, who lived around the 2400 BCE. The pair are portrayed in a nose-kissing position, the most intimate pose in Egyptian art, surrounded by what appear to be their heirs.

Among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] prior to European colonization, a common form of same-sex sexuality centered around the figure of the [[Two-Spirit]] individual. Typically this individual was recognized early in life, given a choice by the parents to follow the path and, if the child accepted the role, raised in the appropriate manner, learning the customs of the gender it had chosen. Two-Spirit individuals were commonly [[shamanism|shamans]] and were revered as having powers beyond those of ordinary shamans. Their sexual life was with the ordinary tribe members of the same sex.

Homosexual and transgender individuals were also common among other pre-[[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest]] civilizations in [[Latin America]], such as the [[Aztec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[Quechuas]], [[Moche]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], and the [[Tupinambá]] of Brazil.&lt;ref name=glbtqlatinamerica&gt;{{citation |first=Ben |last=Pablo |year=2004 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/latin_america_colonial.html |title=Latin America: Colonial |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glbtqmex&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Murray |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen O.

[[File:Woman spying on male lovers.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A woman spying on a pair of male lovers. China, [[Qing dynasty]].]]
The Spanish conquerors were horrified to discover sodomy openly practiced among native peoples, and attempted to crush it out by subjecting the ''[[berdache]]s'' (as the Spanish called them) under their rule to severe penalties, including public [[execution]], burning and being torn to pieces by dogs.&lt;ref name=coello&gt;Mártir de Anglería, Pedro.

===East Asia===
In [[East Asia]], same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.

[[Homosexuality in China]], known as the ''passions of the cut peach'' and various other euphemisms has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. Homosexuality was mentioned in many famous works of Chinese literature. The instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period.   [[Confucianism]], being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Opposition to homosexuality in China originates in the medieval [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907), attributed to the rising influence of Christian and Islamic values,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinsch, Bret 1990 p. 77-78&quot;&gt;Hinsch, Bret.  (1990).  ''Passions of the Cut Sleeve''.  University of California Press.  p. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not become fully established until the [[Westernization]] efforts of the late [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kang1&quot;&gt;Kang, Wenqing. ''Obsession: male same-sex relations in China, 1900-1950'', Hong Kong University Press. Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shudo|Homosexuality in Japan]], variously known as [[shudo]] or [[nanshoku]] has been documented for over one thousand years and was an integral part of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic life and the [[samurai]] tradition. This same-sex love culture gave rise to strong traditions of [[Ukiyo-e|painting]] and literature documenting and celebrating such relationships.

Similarly, in [[Thailand]], ''[[Kathoey]]'', or &quot;ladyboys&quot;, have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries, and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers. While ''Kathoey'' may encompass simple [[effeminacy]] or [[transvestite|transvestism]], it most commonly is treated in [[Thai culture]] as a [[third gender]]. They are generally accepted by society, and Thailand has never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality or homosexual behavior.

===South Asia===
The ''[[Manusmṛti|Laws of Manu]]'', the foundational work of Hindu law, mentions a &quot;third sex&quot;, members of which may engage in nontraditional gender expression and homosexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Walter (2001). Hidden in History: Female Homoeroticism and Women of a &quot;Third Nature&quot; in the South Asian Past, Journal of the History of Sexuality 10.1 (2001), p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{Further2|[[Homosexuality in ancient Greece]], [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome]]}}
The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and [[Greek mythology|mythographic materials]]) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

In regard of male homosexuality such documents depict a world in which relationships with women and relationships with youths were the essential foundation of a normal man's love life. [[Same-sex relationship]]s were a social institution variously constructed over time and from one city to another. The formal practice, an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free adult male and a free adolescent, was valued for its [[pedagogic]] benefits and as a means of population control, though occasionally blamed for causing disorder. [[Plato]] praised its benefits in his early writings&lt;ref name=plato1&gt;[[Plato]], Phaedrus in the ''[[Symposium]]''&lt;/ref&gt; but in his late works proposed its prohibition.&lt;ref name=plato2&gt;Plato, Laws, 636D &amp; 835E&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'' (182B-D), Plato equates acceptance of homosexuality with [[democracy]], and its suppression with [[despotism]], saying that homosexuality &quot;is shameful to barbarians because of their despotic governments, just as philosophy and athletics are, since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or physical unions, all of which love is particularly apt to produce&quot;.&lt;ref name=boswell1&gt;{{harv|Boswell|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], in the ''Politics'', dismissed Plato's ideas about abolishing homosexuality (2.4); he explains that barbarians like the [[Celts]] accorded it a special honor (2.6.6), while the [[Cretans]] used it to regulate the population (2.7.5).&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

[[File:Lafond Sappho and Homer.jpg|left|thumb|Female youths are depicted surrounding Sappho in this painting of [[Lafond]] &quot;Sappho sings for Homer&quot;, 1824.]]

Little is known of female homosexuality in antiquity. [[Sappho]], born on the island of [[Lesbos]], was included by later Greeks in the canonical list of [[nine lyric poets]]. The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth ([[Sapphic love|Sapphic]] and Lesbian) came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lesbian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lesbian|title=Lesbian|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sapphic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Sapphic|title=Sapphic|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sappho's poetry centers on passion and love for various personages and both genders. The narrators of many of her poems speak of [[infatuation]]s and [[love]] (sometimes requited, sometimes not) for various females, but descriptions of physical acts [[Lesbianism|between women]] are few and subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Denys Page, ''Sappho and Alcaeus'', Oxford UP, 1959, pp. 142–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NAMA Sappho lisant.jpg|thumb|Sappho reading to her companions on an Attic vase of c. 435 BC.]]

In [[Ancient Rome]] the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, but relationships were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex. All the emperors with the exception of [[Claudius]] took male lovers. The [[Hellenophile]] emperor [[Hadrian]] is renowned for his relationship with [[Antinous]], but the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed a law on August 6, 390, condemning passive males to be burned at the stake. [[Justinian I|Justinian]], towards the end of his reign, expanded the proscription to the active partner as well (in 558), warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the &quot;wrath of God&quot;. Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on [[brothels]] of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] in 518.

During the [[Renaissance]], wealthy cities in northern [[Italy]] — [[Florence]] and [[Venice]] in particular — were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, Michael, (1996), ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', ISBN 0-19-512292-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Guido, (1985), ''The Boundaries of Eros'', ISBN 0-19-503465-1&lt;/ref&gt; But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the [[aegis]] of the [[Officers of the Night]] court, were prosecuting, fining, and imprisoning a good portion of that population. From the second half of the 13th century, death was the punishment for male homosexuality in most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The eclipse of this period of relative artistic and erotic freedom was precipitated by the rise to power of the moralizing monk [[Girolamo Savonarola]]. In northern Europe the artistic discourse on [[sodomy]] was turned against its proponents by artists such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], who in his ''Rape of Ganymede'' no longer depicted [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] as a willing youth, but as a squalling baby attacked by a rapacious bird of prey.

The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as [[Personal relationships of James I of England|King James I]] and the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: &quot;The world is chang'd I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now;...Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov'd Ganimede&quot; (''Mundus Foppensis, or The Fop Display'd'', 1691).

''Love Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson'' was published in 1723 in England and was presumed by some modern scholars to be a novel. The 1749 edition of [[John Cleland]]'s popular novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' includes a homosexual scene, but this was removed in its 1750 edition. Also in 1749, the earliest extended and serious defense of homosexuality in English, ''Ancient and Modern [[Pederasty]] Investigated and Exemplified'', written by [[Thomas Cannon]], was published, but was suppressed almost immediately. It includes the passage, &quot;Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gladfelder, Hal (May 2006) ''In Search of Lost Texts: Thomas Cannon's 'Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplified&quot;'', Institute of Historical Research&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1785 [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote another defense, but this was not published until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Homosexuality (ISSN 0091-8369) Volume: 3 Issue: 4, Volume: 4 Issue: 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Execution]]s for sodomy continued in the [[Netherlands]] until 1803, and in [[England]] until 1835.

Between 1864 and 1880 [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled ''Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love.'' In 1867, he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in [[Munich]] for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;levay&quot; /&gt; ''Sexual Inversion'' by [[Havelock Ellis]], published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as [[stereotype]]s, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement.&lt;ref name=sexualinversion&gt;{{citation |title=Sexual Inversion |first=Havelock |last=Ellis |first2=John Addington |last2=Symonds |year=1975 |publisher=Arno Press |isbn=0-405-07363-1}} (reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; Although medical texts like these (written partly in Latin to obscure the sexual details) were not widely read by the general public, they did lead to the rise of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against [[Paragraph 175|anti-sodomy laws in Germany]], as well as a much more informal, unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers, led by such figures as [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Addington Symonds]]. Beginning in 1894 with ''Homogenic Love'', Socialist activist and poet Edward Carpenter wrote a string of pro-homosexual articles and pamphlets, and &quot;came out&quot; in 1916 in his book ''My Days and Dreams''. In 1900, [[Elisar von Kupffer]] published an anthology of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, ''[[Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur]]''.

Among some [[Middle East]]ern [[Muslim]] cultures, egalitarian or age-structured homosexual practices were widespread and thinly veiled. The prevailing pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were—and are—either gender-structured or age-structured or both. In recent years, egalitarian relationships modeled on the western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare.

Some scholars argue that there are examples of homosexual love in ancient literature, like in the Mesopotamian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] as well as in the Biblical story of [[David and Jonathan]]. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the relationship between the main protagonist [[Gilgamesh]] and the character [[Enkidu]] has been seen by some to be homosexual in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dynes|first=Wayne|title=Homosexuality in the Ancient World|year=1992|publisher=Garland Publishing|isbn=978-0-8153-0546-0|pages=vii-xv|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JrpU6O3VnawC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=homosexuality%20in%20the%20ancient%20world&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Held|first=George F.|title=Parallels between The Gilgamesh Epic and Plato's Symposium|year=183|pages=199–207|editor=Wayne R.

There are a handful of accounts by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid-1800s. Two of these travelers, Rifa'ah al-Tahtawi and Muhammad sl-Saffar, show their surprise that the French sometimes deliberately mis-translated love poetry about a young boy, instead referring to a young female, to maintain their social norms and morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Rouayheb|first=Khaled|title=Before Homosexuality in the Arab-Islamic World, 1500-1800|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-72988-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Persia homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses, and coffee houses. In the early [[Safavids|Safavid]] era (1501–1723), male houses of [[prostitution]] (''amrad khane'') were legally recognized and paid taxes.

Today, governments in the Middle East often ignore, deny the existence of, or criminalize homosexuality. Homosexuality is illegal in almost all Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' |author=Steven Eke |date=28 July 2005 |newspaper=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], during his [[Columbia University#Ahmadinejad speech controversy|2007 speech at Columbia University]], asserted that there were no gay people in Iran.

In many societies of [[Melanesia]], especially in [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture until the middle of the last century. The [[Etoro tribe|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would &quot;inseminate&quot; him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies, however, have become hostile towards same-sex relationships since the introduction of [[Christianity]] by [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[missionaries]].&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientation and behavior===
{{Main|Sexual orientation|Sexual orientation identity}}
The [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and the [[National Association of Social Workers]] identify sexual orientation as &quot;not merely a personal characteristic that can be defined in isolation. Rather, one's sexual orientation defines the universe of persons with whom one is likely to find the satisfying and fulfilling relationships&quot;:&lt;ref name=amici /&gt;
{{quote|Sexual orientation is commonly discussed as a characteristic of the individual, like biological sex, gender identity, or age. This perspective is incomplete because sexual orientation is always defined in relational terms and necessarily involves relationships with other individuals. Sexual acts and romantic attractions are categorized as homosexual or heterosexual according to the biological sex of the individuals involved in them, relative to each other. Indeed, it is by acting—or desiring to act—with another person that individuals express their heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality. This includes actions as simple as holding hands with or kissing another person. Thus, sexual orientation is integrally linked to the intimate personal relationships that human beings form with others to meet their deeply felt needs for love, attachment, and intimacy. In addition to sexual behavior, these bonds encompass nonsexual physical affection between partners, shared goals and values, mutual support, and ongoing commitment.&lt;ref name=amici /&gt;}}

===Coming out of the closet===
{{Main|Coming out}}

&quot;Coming out (of the closet)&quot; is a phrase which refers to one's disclosure of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coming Out: A Journey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Coming Out: A Journey |publisher=Utahpridecenter.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, coming out is described in three phases. The first phase is the phase of &quot;knowing oneself&quot;, and the realization emerges that one is open to same-sex relations. This is often described as an internal coming out. The second phase involves one's decision to come out to others, e.g. family, friends, or colleagues. The third phase more generally involves living openly as an LGBT person.&lt;ref name=hrccontinuum&gt;{{citation |accessdate=2007-05-04 |url=http://dev.hrc.org/issues/3333.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071102101657/http://dev.hrc.org/issues/3333.htm |archivedate=2007-11-02 |periodical=[[Human Rights Campaign]] |title=The [[Coming Out]] Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States today, people often come out during high school or college age. At this age, they may not trust or ask for help from others, especially when their orientation is not accepted in society. Sometimes their own families are not even informed.

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), &quot;the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosario et al.&quot;&gt;Rosario, M., Schrimshaw, E., Hunter, J., &amp; Braun, L.

===Gender identity===
The earliest writers on a homosexual orientation usually understood it to be intrinsically linked to the subject's own sex. For example, it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Minton, H. L. (1986). ''Femininity in men and masculinity in women: American psychiatry and psychology portray homosexuality in the 1930s'', [[Journal of Homosexuality]], 13(1), 1–21.&lt;br /&gt;*Terry, J. (1999). ''An American obsession: Science, medicine, and homosexuality in modern society.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of homosexuality from the mid-19th century to early 20th century, such as [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Carl Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], as well as many gender variant homosexual people themselves. However, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and through the second half of the 20th century, [[gender identity]] came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation.

Transgender and [[cisgender]] people may be attracted to men, women or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations (see [[sexual orientation of transwomen]]). An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or [[androgyny|androgynous]], and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the &quot;gender-conforming heterosexual&quot; and the &quot;gender-nonconforming homosexual&quot; as negative [[stereotype]]s. However, studies by [[J. Michael Bailey]] and K.J. Zucker have found that a majority of gay men and lesbians report being gender-nonconforming during their childhood years.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Michael Bailey|Bailey, J.M.]], Zucker, K.J. (1995), ''Childhood sex-typed behavior and sexual orientation: a conceptual analysis and quantitative review.'' Developmental Psychology 31(1):43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard C.

As a consequence, he reasons, homosexual men are not abnormal, never having been sexually attracted to their mothers anyway.&lt;ref&gt;

===Same-sex relationships===
{{Main|Same-sex relationship}}
[[File:Male homosexuality symbol.svg|120px|thumb|Male homosexuality symbol]]
People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their [[Human sexual activity|behaviors]].&lt;ref name=apahelp /&gt; Many have sexual relationships predominately with people of their own [[gender identity]], though some have sexual relationships with those of the opposite gender, [[bisexual]] relationships, or none at all ([[celibate]]).&lt;ref name=apahelp/&gt; The [[Kinsey scale]] attempts to describe a person's sexual history or episodes of their sexual activity at a given time. It uses a scale from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. It is based on actual sexual behavior surveys. Research indicates that many lesbians and gay men want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=aparesolution&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Marriage - Research Summary|url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/gay-marriage.pdf|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survey data also indicate that between 18% and 28% of gay couples and between 8% and 21% of lesbian couples in the U.S. have lived together ten or more years.&lt;ref name=aparesolution/&gt; Studies have found same-sex and opposite-sex couples to be equivalent to each other in measures of satisfaction and commitment in relationships, that age and gender are more reliable than sexual orientation as a predictor of satisfaction and commitment to a relationship, and that people who are heterosexual or homosexual share comparable expectations and ideals with regard to romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-01/apa-elo011708.php |title=Relationship Satisfaction and Commitment |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duffy&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1300/J082v12n02_01|title=Satisfaction and commitment in homosexual and heterosexual relationships|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1985|first=S.M/|last=Duffy|coauthors=C.E.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of sexual orientation}}

Reliable data as to the size of the gay and lesbian population are of value in informing public policy.&lt;ref name=black&gt;&quot;Demographics of the Gay and Lesbian Population in the United States: Evidence from Available Systematic Data Sources&quot;, Dan Black, Gary Gates, Seth Sanders, Lowell Taylor, Demography, Vol. 37, No. 2 (May, 2000), pp. 139–154 (available on JSTOR).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, demographics would help in calculating the costs and benefits of [[domestic partnership benefits]], of the impact of legalizing [[gay adoption]], and of the impact of the U.S. military's [[Don't Ask Don't Tell]] policy.&lt;ref name=black/&gt; Further, knowledge of the size of the &quot;gay and lesbian population holds promise for helping social scientists understand a wide array of important questions—questions about the general nature of labor market choices, accumulation of human capital, specialization within households, discrimination, and decisions about geographic location.&quot;&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

Measuring the prevalence of homosexuality presents difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;levay&quot;/&gt; Many people, despite having same-sex attractions, may be reluctant to identify themselves as gay or bisexual. The research must measure some characteristic that may or may not be defining of sexual orientation. The number of people with same-sex desires may be larger than the number of people who act on those desires, which in turn may be larger than the number of people who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

In 1948 and 1953, [[Alfred Kinsey]] reported that nearly 46% of the male subjects had &quot;reacted&quot; sexually to persons of both sexes in the course of their adult lives, and 37% had had at least one homosexual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, p. 656&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;more-or-less-2010-10-01&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Harford|first=Tim|title=More or Less examines Office for National Statistics figures on gay, lesbian and bisexual people|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tznbk|publisher=BBC|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey's methodology was criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Psychology==
{{Main|Homosexuality and psychology}}

{{Wikinews|Dr. Joseph Merlino on sexuality, insanity, Freud, fetishes and apathy}}
Psychology was one of the first disciplines to study a homosexual orientation as a discrete phenomenon. The first attempts to classify homosexuality as a disease were made by the fledgling European [[sexologist]] movement in the late 19th century. In 1886 noted sexologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] listed homosexuality along with 200 other case studies of deviant sexual practices in his definitive work, ''Psychopathia Sexualis''. Krafft-Ebing proposed that homosexuality was caused by either &quot;congenital [during birth] inversion&quot; or an &quot;acquired inversion&quot;. In the last two decades of the 19th century, a different view began to predominate in [[medicine|medical]] and [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] circles, judging such behavior as indicative of a type of person with a defined and relatively stable sexual orientation. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, pathological models of homosexuality were standard.

The American Psychological Association, the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and the [[National Association of Social Workers]] state:
{{cquote|In 1952, when the American Psychiatric Association published its first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], homosexuality was included as a disorder. Almost immediately, however, that classification began to be subjected to critical scrutiny in research funded by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]]. That study and subsequent research consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as a disorder or abnormality, rather than a normal and healthy sexual orientation. As results from such research accumulated, professionals in medicine, mental health, and the behavioral and social sciences reached the conclusion that it was inaccurate to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions based on once-prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples comprising patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system.

In recognition of the scientific evidence,&lt;ref name=&gt;Staff report (August 12, 1998). [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187846 Gay Is Okay With APA—Forum Honors Landmark 1973 Events.] ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]''. 1998;280(6):497-499. doi:10.1001/jama.280.6.497.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973, stating that &quot;homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.&quot; After thoroughly reviewing the scientific data, the American Psychological Association adopted the same position in 1975, and urged all mental health professionals &quot;to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientations.&quot; The National Association of Social Workers has adopted a similar policy.

Thus, mental health professionals and researchers have long recognized that being homosexual poses no inherent obstacle to leading a happy, healthy, and productive life, and that the vast majority of gay and lesbian people function well in the full array of social institutions and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=amici /&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;rcp2007&quot;/&gt; The longstanding consensus of research and clinical literature demonstrates that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=response&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment.&lt;ref name=&quot;rcp2007&quot; /&gt; The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-9]] (1977) listed homosexuality as a mental illness; it was removed from the [[ICD-10]], endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly on May 17, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/communicable-diseases/hivaids/news/news/2011/6/stop-discrimination-against-homosexual-men-and-women |title=Stop discrimination against homosexual men and women |publisher=World Health Organisation — Europe |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=50&amp;FileID=546 |title=The decision of the World Health Organisation 15 years ago constitutes a historic date and powerful symbol for members of the LGBT community |publisher=ILGA |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pinknewsstigma&gt;{{citation |title=Homophobic stigma&amp;nbsp;– A community cause |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-1496.html |date=May 17, 2006 |periodical=PinkNews.co.uk |first=Marc |last=Shoffman |accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the DSM-II, the ICD-10 added [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] to the list, which refers to people who want to change their [[gender identity|gender identities]] or sexual orientation because of a psychological or behavioral disorder ({{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}}). The [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]] removed homosexuality from its [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]] in 2001 after five years of study by the association.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/08/health/08PSYC.html Homosexuality Not an Illness, Chinese Say]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] &quot;This unfortunate history demonstrates how marginalisation of a group of people who have a particular personality feature (in this case homosexuality) can lead to harmful medical practice and a basis for discrimination in society.&lt;ref name=&quot;rcp2007&quot; /&gt; There is now a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment. However, the experiences of discrimination in society and possible rejection by friends, families and others, such as employers, means that some LGB people experience a greater than expected prevalence of mental health difficulties and substance misuse problems. Although there have been claims by conservative political groups in the USA that this higher prevalence of mental health difficulties is confirmation that homosexuality is itself a mental disorder, there is no evidence whatever to substantiate such a claim.&quot;&lt;ref name=rcp2008&gt;Royal College of Psychiatrists: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080611014113/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pressparliament/pressreleases2008/pr14.aspx Royal College of Psychiatrists response to comments on Nolan Show regarding homosexuality as a mental disorder]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most lesbian, gay, and bisexual people who seek psychotherapy do so for the same reasons as heterosexual people (stress, relationship difficulties, difficulty adjusting to social or work situations, etc.); their sexual orientation may be of primary, incidental, or no importance to their issues and treatment. Whatever the issue, there is a high risk for anti-gay bias in psychotherapy with lesbian, gay, and bisexual clients.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;Cabaj, R; Stein, T. eds. ''Textbook of Homosexuality and Mental Health'', p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological research in this area has been relevant to counteracting prejudicial (&quot;[[homophobic]]&quot;) attitudes and actions, and to the [[LGBT rights]] movement generally.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;ed. Sandfort, T; et al. Lesbian and Gay Studies: An Introductory, Interdisciplinary Approach. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appropriate application of affirmative psychotherapy is based on the following scientific facts:&lt;ref name=&quot;response&quot;/&gt;
* Same-sex sexual attractions, behavior, and orientations per se are normal and positive variants of human sexuality; in other words, they are not indicators of mental or developmental disorders.
* Homosexuality and bisexuality are stigmatized, and this stigma can have a variety of negative consequences (e.g., [[Minority Stress]]) throughout the life span (D'Augelli &amp; Patterson, 1995; DiPlacido, 1998; Herek &amp; Garnets, 2007; Meyer, 1995, 2003).
* Same-sex sexual attractions and behavior can occur in the context of a variety of sexual orientations and sexual orientation identities (Diamond, 2006; Hoburg et al., 2004; Rust, 1996; Savin-Williams, 2005).
* Gay men, lesbians, and bisexual individuals can live satisfying lives as well as form stable, committed relationships and families that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects (APA, 2005c; Kurdek, 2001, 2003, 2004; Peplau &amp; Fingerhut, 2007).
* There are no empirical studies or peer-reviewed research that support theories attributing same-sex sexual orientation to family dysfunction or trauma (Bell et al., 1981; Bene, 1965; Freund &amp; Blanchard, 1983; Freund &amp; Pinkava, 1961; Hooker, 1969; McCord et al., 1962; D. K. Peters &amp; Cantrell, 1991; Siegelman, 1974, 1981; Townes et al., 1976).

The [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], and [[National Association of Social Workers]] stated in 2006:
{{cquote|Currently, there is no scientific consensus about the specific factors that cause an individual to become heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual—including possible biological, psychological, or social effects of the parents' sexual orientation. However, the available evidence indicates that the vast majority of lesbian and gay adults were raised by heterosexual parents and the vast majority of children raised by lesbian and gay parents eventually grow up to be heterosexual.&lt;ref name=amici /&gt;}}

The [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] stated in 2007:
{{cquote|Despite almost a century of psychoanalytic and psychological speculation, there is no substantive evidence to support the suggestion that the nature of parenting or early childhood experiences play any role in the formation of a person's fundamental heterosexual or homosexual orientation. It would appear that sexual orientation is biological in nature, determined by a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment. Sexual orientation is therefore not a choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;rcp2007&quot;/&gt;}}

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] stated in ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' in 2004:
{{cquote|Sexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. In recent decades, biologically based theories have been favored by experts. Although there continues to be controversy and uncertainty as to the genesis of the variety of human sexual orientations, there is no scientific evidence that abnormal parenting, sexual abuse, or other adverse life events influence sexual orientation. Current knowledge suggests that sexual orientation is usually established during early childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;rcp2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pediatrics2004&quot;&gt;Pediatrics: [http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;113/6/1827 Sexual Orientation and Adolescents], [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Clinical Report.

The American Psychological Association states &quot;there are probably many reasons for a person's sexual orientation and the reasons may be different for different people&quot;, and says most people's sexual orientation is determined at an early age.&lt;ref name=apahelp /&gt; Research into how sexual orientation in males may be determined by genetic or other prenatal factors plays a role in political and social debates about homosexuality, and also raises fears about [[genetic profiling]] and [[prenatal testing]].&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{citation |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2007/aug/12/news/chi-gaygene_bd12aug12 |title=Study of gay brothers may find clues about sexuality |first=Robert |last=Mitchum |periodical=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=August 12, 2007 |accessdate=2007-05-04}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Michael King states: &quot;The conclusion reached by scientists who have investigated the origins and stability of sexual orientation is that it is a human characteristic that is formed early in life, and is resistant to change. Scientific evidence on the origins of homosexuality is considered relevant to theological and social debate because it undermines suggestions that sexual orientation is a choice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=60752 |title=How much is known about the origins of homosexuality? |publisher=Church Times |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Innate bisexuality]]'' (or predisposition to bisexuality) is a term introduced by [[Sigmund Freud]], based on work by his associate [[Wilhelm Fliess]], that expounds that all humans are born bisexual but through psychological development—which includes both external and internal factors—become monosexual, while the bisexuality remains in a [[latency stage|latent]] state.

The authors of a 2008 study stated &quot;there is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower [[reproduction|reproductive success]], is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency&quot;. They hypothesized that &quot;while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them&quot;. Their results suggested that &quot;genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Zietsch et al. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study also suggested a significant increase in [[fecundity]] in the females related to the homosexual people from the maternal line (but not in those related from the paternal one).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=New Evidence of Genetic Factors Influencing Sexual Orientation in Men: Female Fecundity Increase in the Maternal Line |author=Iemmola, Francesca and Camperio Ciani, Andrea|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|publisher=Springer Netherlands|year=2009|volume=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab state in the abstract of their 2010 study, &quot;The fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells, or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge. In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Garcia-Falgueras A, Swaab DF |title=Sexual Hormones and the Brain: An Essential Alliance for Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation |journal=Endocrine Development |volume=17 |issue= |pages=22–35 |year=2010 |pmid=19955753 |doi=10.1159/000262525 |quote=There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lesbian narratives and sexual orientation awareness===
Lesbians often experience their sexuality differently from gay men, and have different understandings about etiology from those derived from studies focused mostly on men. For information specific to female homosexuality, see [[Lesbian]].

In a U.S.-based 1970s mail survey by [[Shere Hite]], lesbians self-reported their reasons for being lesbian. This is the only major piece of research into female sexuality that has looked at how women understand being homosexual since Kinsey in 1953. The research yielded information about women's general understanding of lesbian relationships and their sexual orientation.

Women talked about social conditioning, which made it &quot;almost impossible for me to have a truly healthy sexual relationship with a man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;&gt;Shere Hite, ''The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality'' (N.Y.: Seven Stories Press, 2004 ed. pbk. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1st printing?&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; © 1976, 1981, 2004), pp. 325–328 &amp; 330 (ISBN 1-58322-569-2).&lt;/ref&gt; Another woman stated that because of their conditioning &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;w&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;omen are much more sensitive to other people's needs&quot;, and so &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;ex is better with women physically and emotionally&quot;, stating she preferred the symmetries of power and aesthetic between women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; Some talked about preferring women, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;p&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;ersonally, I like girls better, they are more tender and loving&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; and some went into how they found that emotional relationships with women were more satisfying than those with men, with women making more creative and versatile lovers. One woman reported it was easier for her &quot;to give myself emotionally to a woman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; A woman who had been a lesbian for two years said she found that sexual relationships with women were more pleasurable on both psychological and physical levels than with men; this was &quot;because the women I've had sex with have been my friends first, which was never the case with men. Being friends sets up a trust that I think is essential for satisfying physical intimacy. Relating to another woman physically seems to me like the most natural thing in the world. You've already got a head start on knowing how to give her pleasure. Gentleness seems to be the key, and is the main difference between relating to men and women.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; Women talked about women making better sexual partners and that was a dominant theme: &quot;I find women better lovers; they know what a woman wants and most of all there is an emotional closeness that can never be matched with a man. More tenderness, more consideration and understanding of feelings, etc.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; This was because men were perceived as unliberated &quot;sexually or emotionally or any other way&quot;, and lesbianism was perceived &quot;as an alternative to abstinence&quot; and to men generally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; Men were perceived as usually juvenile, while a relationship with women was described as &quot;more of a communion with self&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; Sex as well as relationships with women were seen as a way of achieving independence from men; &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;ex with a woman means independence from men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; Male sexual performance was another problem, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;t&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;wenty minutes for a man, at least an hour with a woman, usually more&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; as well as attention to the sexual needs of women who themselves &quot;seem to have a more sustained energy level after orgasm, and are more likely to know and do something about it if I'm not satisfied&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; One understanding of the difference was that sex with women &quot;is not an 'exchange' or a 'trade' or services&quot;, and not focused on orgasm, with &quot;more kissing and holding&quot; and &quot;more concern for my pleasure&quot;, which was experienced as liberating. Sex with women was also seen as a political act; &quot;I see lesbianism as putting all my energies (sexual, political social, etc.) into women. Sex is a form of comfort and to have sex indiscriminately with males is to give them comfort.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt;

Hite is more concerned with what respondents say than quantifiable data. She found the two most significant differences between respondents' experience with men and women were the focus on clitoral stimulation, and more emotional involvement and orgasmic responses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hite-Rpt&quot;/&gt; Since Hite carried out her study she has acknowledged that some women may have chosen the political identity of a lesbian. [[Julie Bindel]], a UK journalist, reaffirmed that &quot;political lesbianism continues to make intrinsic sense because it reinforces the idea that sexuality is a choice, and we are not destined to a particular fate because of our chromosomes.&quot; as recently as 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jules&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/30/women-gayrights | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=My sexual revolution | first=Julie | last=Bindel | date=2009-01-30 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual orientation change efforts===
{{Main|Sexual orientation change efforts}}
There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether recent sexual orientation change efforts do work to change a person's sexual orientation. Those efforts have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by lesbian, gay, and bisexual rights organizations and professional and scientific organizations, on the other. The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;apa2009&quot;&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts]&lt;/ref&gt; The American Psychological Association says that &quot;most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;answers&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Some individuals and groups have promoted the idea of homosexuality as symptomatic of developmental defects or spiritual and moral failings and have argued that sexual orientation change efforts, including psychotherapy and religious efforts, could alter homosexual feelings and behaviors. Many of these individuals and groups appeared to be embedded within the larger context of conservative religious political movements that have supported the stigmatization of homosexuality on political or religious grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;apa2009&quot; /&gt;

No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation. These include the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association, National Association of Social Workers in the USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-herek.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sEshQkXj|archivedate=2010-08-25 |title=Expert affidavit of Gregory M.

The American Psychological Association &quot;encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others' sexual orientation and concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/resolution-resp.html Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender and fluidity====
In a 2004 study, the female subjects (both gay and straight women) became sexually aroused when they viewed heterosexual as well as lesbian erotic films. Among the male subjects, however, the straight men were turned on only by erotic films with women, the gay ones by those with men. The study's senior researcher said that women's sexual desire is less rigidly directed toward a particular sex, as compared with men's, and it's more changeable over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Mental===
When it was first described in medical literature, homosexuality was often approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as its root cause. Much literature on mental health and homosexual patients centered on their [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[substance abuse]], and suicide. Although these issues exist among people who are [[non-heterosexual]], discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] (DSM) in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexual people face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;

{{LGBT rights}}
Most nations do not prohibit consensual sex between unrelated persons above the local [[age of consent]]. Some jurisdictions further recognize identical rights, protections, and privileges for the family structures of same-sex couples, including [[same-sex marriage|marriage]]. Some nations mandate that all individuals restrict themselves to heterosexual relationships; that is, in some jurisdictions homosexual activity is illegal. Offenders can face the death penalty in some fundamentalist Muslim areas such as [[Iran]] and parts of [[Nigeria]]. There are, however, often significant differences between official policy and real-world enforcement.
See ''[[Violence against LGBT people]]''.

Although homosexual acts were decriminalized in some parts of the [[Western world]], such as [[Gay rights in Poland|Poland]] in 1932, [[Gay rights in Denmark|Denmark]] in 1933, [[Gay rights in Sweden|Sweden]] in 1944, and the [[Gay rights in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] in 1967, it was not until the mid-1970s that the [[gay community]] first began to achieve limited [[civil rights]] in some [[developed countries]]. On July 2, 2009, homosexuality was decriminalized in India by a High Court ruling.&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{citation |date=July 2009 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Delhi-High-Court-legalizes-homosexuality/articleshow/4726608.cms | work=The Times Of India | first1=Manoj |last1=Mitta |first2=Smriti |last2=Singh |title=India decriminalises gay sex |date=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A turning point was reached in 1973 when the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', thus negating its previous definition of homosexuality as a clinical [[mental disorder]]. In 1977, [[Quebec]] became the first state-level jurisdiction in the world to prohibit [[discrimination]] on the grounds of sexual orientation. During the 1980s and 1990s, most [[developed countries]] enacted laws decriminalizing homosexual behavior and prohibiting discrimination against lesbian and gay people in employment, housing, and services. On the other hand, many countries today in the Middle East and Africa, as well as several countries in Asia, the Caribbean and the South Pacific, outlaw homosexuality. In six countries, homosexual behavior is punishable by [[life imprisonment]]; in ten others, it carries the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref name=ilga&gt;{{citation |last=Ottosson |first=Daniel |title=LGBT world legal wrap up survey |publisher=[[ILGA]] |date=November, 2006 |accessdate=2007-09-21 |url=http://www.ilga.org/statehomophobia/World_legal_wrap_up_survey_November2006.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, many LGBT people in the West, particularly those in major metropolitan areas, have developed a so-called [[Queer culture|gay culture]]. To many,{{Who|date=January 2012}} gay culture is exemplified by the [[gay pride]] movement, with annual parades and displays of rainbow flags. Yet not all LGBT people choose to participate in &quot;queer culture&quot;, and many gay men and women specifically decline to do so. To some{{Who|date=January 2012}} it seems to be a frivolous display, perpetuating gay stereotypes. To some others,{{Who|date=January 2012}} the gay culture represents [[heterophobia]] and is scorned as widening the gulf between gay and non-gay people.

With the outbreak of [[AIDS]] in the early 1980s, many LGBT groups and individuals organized campaigns to promote efforts in AIDS education, prevention, research, patient support, and community outreach, as well as to demand government support for these programs.

The bewildering death toll wrought by the [[AIDS]] epidemic at first seemed to slow the progress of the gay rights movement, but in time it galvanized some parts of the LGBT community into community service and political action, and challenged the heterosexual community to respond compassionately. Major American motion pictures from this period that dramatized the response of individuals and communities to the AIDS crisis include ''[[An Early Frost]]'' (1985), ''[[Longtime Companion]]'' (1990), ''[[And the Band Played On]]'' (1993), ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (1993), and ''[[Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt]]'' (1989).

[[Coming out|Publicly gay politicians]] have attained numerous government posts, even in countries that had [[sodomy law]]s in their recent past. Examples include [[Guido Westerwelle]], Germany's [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]]; [[Peter Mandelson]], a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] cabinet minister and [[Per-Kristian Foss]], formerly [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Minister of Finance]].

LGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations.

===Military service===
[[File:USarmydefineshomosexuality.jpg|thumb|The US Army defines homosexual conduct as &quot;a homosexual act, a statement by a soldier that demonstrates a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts, the solicitation of another to engage in homosexual act or acts, or a homosexual marriage or attempted marriage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gKiQ_wD-H74C&amp;pg=SA3-PA42 |title=The Soldier's Guide: The Complete Guide to U.S. Army Traditions, Training, Duties, and Responsibilities |publisher= |date= 2007-10-01|accessdate=2010-12-21|isbn=978-1-60239-164-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Sexual orientation and military service}}
Policies and attitudes toward gay and lesbian [[military]] personnel vary widely around the world. Some countries allow gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people to serve openly and have granted them the same rights and privileges as their heterosexual counterparts. Many countries neither ban nor support LGB service members. A few countries continue to ban homosexual personnel outright.

Most Western military forces have removed policies excluding sexual minority members. Of the 26 countries that participate militarily in [[NATO]], more than 20 permit openly gay, lesbian and bisexual people to serve. Of the permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], three ([[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[United States]]) do so. The other two generally do not: [[China]] bans gay and lesbian people outright, [[Russia]] excludes all gay and lesbian people during peacetime but allows some gay men to serve in wartime (see below). [[Israel]] is the only country in the Middle East region that allows openly LGB people to serve in the military.

While the question of homosexuality in the military has been highly politicized in the United States, it is not necessarily so in many countries. Generally speaking, sexuality in these cultures is considered a more personal aspect of one's identity than it is in the United States.

According to American Psychological Association empirical evidence fails to show that sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including [[unit cohesion]], morale, recruitment and retention.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/military.aspx Proceedings of the American Psychological Association, Incorporated, for the legislative year 2004. Minutes of the meeting of the Council of Representatives July 28 &amp; 30, 2004, Honolulu, HI. Retrieved November 18, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is irrelevant to task cohesion, the only type of cohesion that critically predicts the team's military readiness and success.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association: [Report of the APA Joint Divisional Task Force on Sexual Orientation &amp; Military Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2010, after U.S. President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] announced that he wanted to put an end to the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, former U.S. general and high ranking [[NATO]] official [[John J. Sheehan|John Sheehan]] blamed homosexuals serving in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] military for the fall of [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica]] to Serb militias in the [[Bosnian War]] fifteen years earlier, stating that homosexuals had weakened the Dutch UN battalion charged with protecting the enclave. In the U.S. Senate, Sheehan said that European countries had tried to &quot;socialize&quot; their armed forces by letting people serve in the army too easily, which according to him, left them weakened. He claimed that his opinion was shared by the leadership of the Dutch armed forces, mentioning the name &quot;Hankman Berman&quot;, most probably referring to the then chief of the Dutch defence staff, [[Henk van den Breemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V7Or0kbqY0 |title=General Sheehan: gays responsible for Srebrenica massacre |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch authorities dismissed Sheehan's statements as &quot;disgraceful&quot; and &quot;total nonsense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2507443.ece/Former_US_general__gays_make_Dutch_military_weak |title=Former US general: ‘gays make Dutch military weak' |publisher=Nrc.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ian Traynor, Europe correspondent |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/19/gay-dutch-soldiers-srebrenica |title=US general: Gay Dutch soldiers caused Srebrenica massacre |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2010-08-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7478738/Gay-Dutch-soldiers-responsible-for-Srebrenica-massacre-says-US-general.html |title=Gay Dutch soldiers responsible for Srebrenica massacre says US general |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2010-08-24 | location=London | first=Our | last=Foreign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.com/en-world/pm-slams-disgraceful-srebrenica-gay-comments/298611 |title=PM slams ´disgraceful´ Srebrenica gay comments |publisher=Javno.com |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8575717.stm |title=Dutch fury at US general's gay theory over Srebrenica |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and sociology==
{{Further2|[[Societal attitudes toward homosexuality]]}}
===Public opinion===
[[File:Societal attitudes towards homosexuality.svg|thumb|right|2007 Pew Global Research Poll: Should homosexuality be accepted in society? Percentage of responders that answered ''accept'':
{{legend|#b90080|81% - 90%}}

Societal acceptance of non-heterosexual orientations such as homosexuality is lowest in [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n countries, and is highest in [[Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[the Americas]]. Western society has become increasingly accepting of homosexuality over the past few decades.

===Relationships===
In 2006, the American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and National Association of Social Workers stated in an [[Amicus curiae|amicus brief]] presented to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of the State of [[California]]: &quot;Gay men and lesbians form stable, committed relationships that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects. The institution of marriage offers social, psychological, and health benefits that are denied to same-sex couples. By denying same-sex couples the right to marry, the state reinforces and perpetuates the stigma historically associated with homosexuality. Homosexuality remains stigmatized, and this stigma has negative consequences. California's prohibition on marriage for same-sex couples reflects and reinforces this stigma&quot;. They concluded: &quot;There is no scientific basis for distinguishing between same-sex couples and heterosexual couples with respect to the legal rights, obligations, benefits, and burdens conferred by civil marriage.&quot;&lt;ref name=amici /&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion and homosexuality}}
Though the relationship between [[religion and homosexuality|homosexuality and religion]] can vary greatly across time and place, within and between different [[religion]]s and [[sect]]s, and regarding different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality, current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions generally view homosexuality negatively. This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, to explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality. Some teach that homosexual orientation itself is sinful,&lt;ref name=OPCtrial&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.upper-register.com/irons_trial/charges.pdf|title=Charge #1 and specifications preferred by the Presbytery of Southern California against The Rev. C. Lee Irons|accessdate=2008-06-27|format=PDF|publisher=Presbytery of Southern California of the [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]]|quote=claiming that homosexuality is an unchosen &quot;condition,&quot; rather than a sin of the heart, [...] contradicts the teaching of Scripture that both the desire and the act are sin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; others state that only the sexual act is a sin&lt;ref&gt;Sex and Society - Volume 3 - Page 824&lt;/ref&gt;, others are completely accepting of gays and [[lesbians]]&lt;ref&gt;The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Religion and Social Justice - Page 543, Michael D. Palmer, Stanley M. Burgess - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;, while some encourage homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft - 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that homosexuality can be overcome through religious faith and practice. On the other hand, voices exist within many of these religions that view homosexuality more positively, and liberal [[religious denomination]]s may bless [[same-sex marriage]]s. Some view same-sex love and sexuality as sacred, and a [[mythology of same-sex love]] can be found around the world. Regardless of their position on homosexuality, many people of faith look to both [[sacred text]]s and [[tradition]] for guidance on this issue.

==Discrimination==
===Gay bullying===
{{main|Gay bullying}}
Gay bullying can be the [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]] against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be  [[lesbian]], [[gay]],  [[bisexual]] or transgender, including persons who are actually [[heterosexual]] or of non-specific or unknown [[sexual orientation]].  In the US, teenage students heard anti-gay slurs such as “homo”, “faggot” and “sissy” about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes, according to a 1998 study by Mental Health America (formerly National Mental Health Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health American, Bullying and Gay Youth|url=http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth|publisher=''Mental Health America'' formerly National Mental Health Association|accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterosexism and homophobia===
{{See|Heterosexism|Homophobia}}
[[File:Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill protest.jpg|thumb|right|Protests in New York City against [[Uganda]]'s [[Anti-Homosexuality Bill]].]]
In many cultures, homosexual people are frequently subject to prejudice and discrimination. A 2011 Dutch study concluded that 49% of Holland's youth and 58% of youth foreign to the country reject homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Half of young Dutch people reject homosexuality|url=http://community.expatica.com/forums/topic/2993/half-of-young-dutch-people-reject-homosexuality|publisher=Expatica/COC|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to other minority groups they can also be subject to [[LGBT stereotypes|stereotyping]]. These attitudes tend to be due to forms of homophobia and heterosexism (negative [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, bias, and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships). Heterosexism can include the presumption that everyone is [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the [[norm (sociology)|norm]] and therefore superior. {{linktext|Homophobia}} is a fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexual people. It manifests in different forms, and a number of different types have been postulated, among which are internalized homophobia, social homophobia, emotional homophobia, rationalized homophobia, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060904125724/http://allies.tamu.edu/Did+You+Know/riddle.htm The Riddle Homophobia Scale, from Allies Committee website, Department of Student Life, Texas A&amp;M University]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar is [[lesbophobia]] (specifically targeting lesbians) and [[biphobia]] (against bisexual people). When such attitudes manifest as crimes they are often called [[hate crimes]] and [[gay bashing]].

Negative stereotypes characterize LGB people as less romantically stable, more [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] and more likely to abuse children, but there is no scientific basis to such assertions. Gay men and lesbians form stable, committed relationships that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential respects.&lt;ref name=amici /&gt; Sexual orientation does not affect the likelihood that people will abuse children.&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;Michael Lamb, Ph.D.: [http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf Affidavit&amp;nbsp;– United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=herekm&gt;Gregory M.

===Violence against gays and lesbians===
{{Main|Violence against LGBT people}}

In the United States, the [[FBI]] reported that 15.6% of hate crimes reported to police in 2004 were based on perceived sexual orientation. Sixty-one percent of these attacks were against gay men.&lt;ref name=fbicrime&gt;{{citation |title=Crime in the United States 2004: Hate Crime |url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/hate_crime/index.html |periodical=[[FBI]] |accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 murder of [[Matthew Shepard]], a gay student, is a notorious such incident in the U.S.
