{{About|the subcultural sexual lifestyle||Swing (disambiguation)}}
{{Close Relationships}}

'''Swinging''' or (rarely) '''partner swapping''' is a [[Non-monogamy|non-monogamous]] behavior, in which singles or partners in a [[committed relationship]] engage in [[sexual activities]] with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;case_for_swingers&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

 |volume=3
 |accessdate=2010-01-24

&lt;/ref&gt; Swinging can take place in a number of contexts, ranging from spontaneous sexual activity at informal gatherings of friends to planned regular social meetings to [[Casual sex|hooking up]] with like-minded people at a [[Sex club|swingers' club]].  It can also involve [[Internet]]-based swinger [[social networking]] services online.

The phenomenon of swinging, or at least its wider discussion and practice, is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, made possible by the invention of the [[contraceptive pill]] and the emergence of treatments for many of the [[sexually transmitted disease]]s that were known at that time. 

The older term '''wife-swapping''', once considered to be equivalent to &quot;swinging,&quot; is criticized today as being [[Androcentrism|androcentric]] where it is presumed that the partners are a married heterosexual couple and that it is the male who is in control of the sexual activities and also that it does not accurately describe the full range of sexual activities in which both singles or couples may take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/wife-swapping|title=wife-swapping|publisher=Sex-Lexis.com|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for swinging==
People may choose a swinging lifestyle for a variety of reasons. Many cite the increased quality, quantity and frequency of sex. Some people engage in swinging to add variety into their otherwise conventional sex lives or due to their curiosity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship. Others regard such activities as merely social and recreational interaction with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://home.netcom.com/~jonnall/babylon/pattys.htm|title=Why Swing?|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It may not be possible to trace a precise history of swinging since the modern concept is so closely related to basic human sexuality and relationships, and they vary significantly across time and cultures.  The term &quot;swinging&quot; would have no counterpart or meaning in many cultures and civilizations in history who did not value monogamous relationships or have religious or social prohibitions against such sexual practices.  It is a historical term that is best understood as fairly modern and Western in its expression.

=== 16th century ===
A formal arrangement was signed by [[John Dee]], his wife Jane, his [[scryer]], [[Edward Kelley]] and Kelley's wife Joanna on 22 April 1587, whereby conjugal relations would be shared between the men and their spouses. This arrangement arose following [[seance]]s which apparently resulted in spirits guiding Dee and Kelley towards this course of action. The arrangement ended badly, and destroyed Dee's working relationship with Kelley.&lt;ref&gt;''The Queen's Conjuror; The life and magic of John Dee'' by Benjamin Woolley, [[Harper Collins]], 2001, ISBN 978-0-8050-6510-7, p292&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th century ===
While it has been claimed that two related messianic Jewish sects of the eighteenth century, the Frankists, followers of [[Jacob Frank]], and the [[DÃ¶nmeh]], followers of [[Shabbetai Zvi]], were alleged to hold an annual springtime 'Lamb Festival,' which consisted of a celebratory dinner that included a ritualized exchange of spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zeek.net/706jay/|title=Why I Study Sabbateanism|last=Michaelson|first=Jay|date=June 2007|publisher=Zeek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gadnassi.com/files/publications/Exploring_the_Pagan_-_Jewish_and_Ottoman_Roots_of_the_Sabbatean-Lamb_Festival.pdf|title=Exploring the Pagan, Jewish and Ottoman Roots of the &quot;Sabbatean Lamb Festival&quot;|last=Nassi|first=Gad|publisher=GadNassi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reports should be considered very cautiously, as they may simply be defamatory propaganda of the time against groups that the ruling elite found heretical, particularly since the groups involved were secretive about their beliefs, aims, and practices.

=== 19th century ===

One of the criticisms of [[communism]] was the allegation that communists practice and propagandize the &quot;community of women&quot;. In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848), [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] suggest that this allegation is an example of hypocrisy and [[psychological projection]] by &quot;[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]&quot; critics of communism, who &quot;not content with having wives and daughters of their [[proletariat|proletarians]] at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm |author=Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels|year= 1848 |title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|chapter= Chapter 2|accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
Online swinging took off in the late 1990s due to the rise of the [[Internet]] and became more prevalent towards the latter half of the decade. 

According to [[Terry Gould]]'s ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers'',&lt;ref&gt;Terry Gould, ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers''. Vintage Canada, November 23, 1999 ISBN 1-55209-482-0&lt;/ref&gt; swinging began among American [[United States Army Air Force|Air Force]] pilots and their wives during World War II. The mortality rate of pilots was high, so, as Gould reports, a close bond arose between pilots that implied that pilot husbands would care for all the wives as their own&amp;mdash;emotionally and sexually&amp;mdash;if the husbands were away or lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libchrist.com/swing/began.html The History and Definitions of Swinging which is Couples Only], Liberated Christians, Inc.; [http://www.homerf.org History of Wife Swapping], homerf.org&lt;/ref&gt; Though the origins of swinging are contested, it is assumed American swinging was practiced in some American military communities in the 1950s. By the time the [[Korean War]] ended, swinging had spread from the military to the [[suburb]]s. The media dubbed the phenomenon '''wife-swapping'''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

== Modern swinging ==
According to 2005 estimates by the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] and others, swingers account for two to four percent of married couples with numbers in excess of 4 million people in [[North America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Health/story?id=2395727&amp;page=1#.UG4e3U3A_Jc|title=The 'Lifestyle' -- Real-Life Wife Swaps|date=18 March 2005|publisher=ABC 20/20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, some experts believe that there are as many as 15 million Americans swinging on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/15/would-you-ever-swing/|title=Would you ever swing?|last=Kerner|first=Ian|date=15 September 2011|publisher=CNN Health|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinging sexual activity can take place in a [[sex club]], also known as a swinger club (not to be confused with a [[strip club]]).  Different clubs offer varied facilities and atmospheres, and often hold &quot;theme&quot; nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, many websites that cater to swinging couples now exist, some boasting hundreds of thousands of members.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Research ==
Research on swinging has been conducted in the [[United States]] since the late 1960s. One 2000 study, based on an Internet questionnaire addressed to visitors of swinger-related sites, found swingers are happier in their relationships than the norm.&lt;ref name=&quot;case_for_swingers&quot; /&gt;

60% said that swinging improved their relationship; 1.7% said swinging made their relationship less happy. Approximately 50% of those who rated their relationship &quot;very happy&quot; before becoming swingers maintained their relationship had become happier. 90% of those with less happy relationships said swinging improved them.

Almost 70% of swingers claimed no problem with jealousy; approximately 25% admitted &quot;I have difficulty controlling jealousy when swinging&quot; as &quot;somewhat true,&quot; while 6% said this was &quot;yes, very much&quot; true. Swingers rate themselves happier (&quot;very happy&quot;: 59% of swingers compared to 32% of non-swingers) and their lives more &quot;exciting&quot; (76% of swingers compared to 54% of non-swingers) than non-swingers, by significantly large margins. There was no significant difference between responses of men and women, although more males (70%) than females completed the survey. This study which only polled self-identified swingers is of limited use to a broader application to the rest of society ([[external validity]]) due to [[self-selection bias|self-selected sampling]]. 

[[John Stossel]] produced an investigative news report into the swinging lifestyle. Stossel reported in 2005 that more than four million people were swingers, according to estimates by the [[Kinsey Institute]] and other researchers. He also cited [[Terry Gould]]'s research, which concluded that &quot;couples swing in order to not cheat on their partners.&quot; When Stossel asked swinging couples whether they worry their spouse will &quot;find they like someone else better,&quot; one male replied, &quot;People in the swinging community swing for a reason. They don't swing to go out and find a new wife;&quot; a woman asserted, &quot;It makes women more confident - that they are the ones in charge.&quot; Stossel interviewed 12 marriage counselors. According to Stossel, &quot;not one of them said don't do it,&quot; though some said &quot;getting sexual thrills outside of marriage can threaten a marriage&quot;. Nevertheless, swingers whom Stossel interviewed claimed &quot;their marriages are stronger because they don't have affairs and they don't lie to each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot; /&gt;

According to economic studies on swinging,&lt;ref&gt;Fabio D'Orlando (2010), &quot;Swinger Ecomomics,&quot; in The Journal of Socio-Economics 39(2), pp. 303-304.&lt;/ref&gt; the information and communications technology revolution, together with improvements in medicine, has been effective in reducing some of the costs of swinging and hence in increasing the number of swingers. And the economic approaches which seem best suited to capture the empirical data are those based on the concept of [[Hedonic treadmill|hedonic adaptation]]. These approaches suggest that it is consistent with maximizing swingersâ strategy to begin from &quot;soft&quot;  swinging and only later engage in &quot;harder&quot; swinging, and that also the search for ever new sexual experiences delays long-period hedonic adaptation and hence increases swingersâ long-period wellbeing. Both these theoretical predictions seem to find confirmation in the empirical data on swinger behaviour.

===Health risks===
Like anyone else, there are some swingers who engage in [[unprotected sex]], a practice known as [[barebacking]]. Some couples can reduce the risk of contracting a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) by exchanging STI test results and [[serosorting]]. Some swingers engage in [[safe sex]] practices and will not engage with others who do not also practice safe sex. Proponents for swinging point to the fact that safe sex is accepted within the community and the risk of sexual disease is the same for them as for the general populationâand that some populations of sexually non-monogamous people have clearly lower rates of STIs than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.aim-med.org/news/2009/10/20/1256052533/|title= Superior Court Quashes CAL-OSHA'S Attempt to Subpoena Confidential AIM Medical Records|accessdate= 2009-10-21|date= 2009-10-20|publisher= AIM Medical}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents are concerned about the risk of pregnancy and STIs such as [[HIV]], arguing that even protected sex is risky given that some STIs may be spread regardless of the use of condoms, such as [[Herpes]] and [[HPV]]. 

A study done in the Netherlands that compared the medical records of self reported swingers to that of the general population found that STI prevalence was highest in young people, homosexual men, and swingers.&lt;ref&gt;http://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2010/06/07/sti.2009.041954.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this study has been criticized as not being representative of swinger populations as a whole: its data was formulated solely on patients receiving treatment at an STI clinic.  In addition, according to the conclusions of the report the STI rates of swingers were in fact nearly identical to those of non-swinging straight couples, and concluded that the safest demographic for STI infection were female prostitutes.  According to the Dutch study, &quot;the combined rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea were just over 10 percent among straight people, 14 percent among gay men, just under 5 percent in female prostitutes, and 10.4 percent among swingers, they found.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/23/us-sex-diseases-swingers-idUSTRE65M6NX20100623 | work=Reuters | title=Disease risk higher for swingers than prostitutes | date=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious and moral objections ===
{{See also|Religion and sexuality}}
Those who object on moral or philosophical grounds to the basic principles of swinging may believe that sexual relations should only occur within a committed relationship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some argue that if sex becomes the main reason for swinging, then the act of sex may become mechanistic and less satisfying than the intimacy experienced by monogamous couples.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
Western societal norms for many people argue that any sex is wrong outside of marriage, even if the spouse is accepting and gives permission.
Those who object on moral or philosophical grounds to the basic principles of swinging often define sexual relations as singularly within the purview of a marriage, or, at least a committed long-term monogamous relationship.

=== Responses to objections ===
Many couples enter swinging while in secure relationships, providing added motivation to avoid excessive health risks. Though some sexual affairs outside relationships may be in &quot;the heat of the moment&quot; without regard to consequences, swingers maintain that sex among swingers is often more frank and deliberative and therefore more honest than unfaithful.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Many swinging clubs in the US and UK do not have alcohol licenses and have a &quot;bring your own beverage&quot; (BYOB) policy. Also, it is not uncommon for experienced swingers to remain sober to preclude any sexual performance problems. This counter-argument suggests that such swingers take a safer approach to sexual health than comparable non-monogamous singles (who ostensibly have impaired judgment from becoming inebriated).

Condoms are often highly encouraged and readily available at many swinging clubs and parties. In addition, many swingers rely on frequent STI testing to ensure their safety.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} A small portion focus on massage and other activities unlikely to transmit STIs;{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  However, most participants acknowledge they are accepting the same risks that any person does who is sexually active outside of a strictly monogamous relationship.  

Although there is a risk of pregnancy, they are the same as monogamous sex and can be minimized.  Solutions include a tubal ligation (female sterilization), vasectomy (male sterilization), or having a group entirely made of menopausal women. Other solutions include using condoms or the pill. Proper use of a condom with an effective birth control method will minimize the risk of pregnancy and transmission of sexually transmitted infections.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Some believe sexual attraction is part of human nature and should be openly enjoyed by a committed or married couple. Some swingers cite divorce data in the US, claiming the lack of quality of sex and spousal infidelity are significant factors in divorce. One study showed 37% of husbands and 29% of wives admit at least one extramarital affair (Reinisch, 1990), and divorce rates for first marriages approached 60%.

As one study asserted:{{Which|date=October 2012}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to King (1996) sexual habituation leads to changes in interaction with partners. At three to seven years into a marriage, it takes increased stimulation to produce the sexual excitation previously obtained by a glance or simple touch. A couple receptive to new and different sexual experiences will begin to explore different avenues of shared sexual fulfillment to continue to grow together. At this stressful point infidelity increases and the divorce rate peaks. Couples who find a way to reconnect physically and emotionally are more likely to make it through this period. Swinging may be one solution â it provides sexual variety, adventure, and the opportunity to live out fantasies as a couple without secrecy and deceit.

Many swingers report that their relationships are strengthened through swinging, and say their sex lives are more intimate and satisfying.  Jealousy can occur, but proponents of swinging assert that jealousy is mainly couples whose relationships were already unstable. The effect on unstable relationships has yet to be determined.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Partner swapping in tribal societies ==
=== Africa ===
Temporary spouse-trading is practiced as an element of ritual initiation into the [[Lemba people|Lemba]] secret society in the [[French Congo]] through &quot;wife exchange:&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Janzen 1982, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;you shall lay with the priestess-wife of your Lemba Father, and he shall lay with your wife too.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; McGaffey 1974, p. 100b (.7.10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; McGaffey 1974, p. 116 (81)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Guinea ===
Among the [[Orya]] of northern [[Irian Jaya]], the agama toÅkat (Indonesian for 'walking-stick') cult &quot;encouraged men to trade wives, i.e., to have sexual relations with each other's wives. This trading of sexual favours ... was only between pairs of families, ... adherents are now very secretive concerning cult activities and teachings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In this 'walking-stick' cult &quot;the walking stick ... ''dute'' is the term men use to refer to the husband of the woman who becomes his sexual partner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Phil,&quot;Of Paradise Lost: Orya myth&quot;. 1998, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, &quot;There have been other similar movements ... near Jayapura. These are popularly called Towel Religion (''agama handuk'') and The Simpson Religion (''agama simpson'').&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1998, p. 39, fn. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Mimika of southern Irian Jaya, temporary spouse-trading is said to have been originated by a woman who had returned from the world of the dead: &quot;The wife says to her husband, '...&amp;nbsp;tonight I will sleep in the house of the headman ..., and ... his wife, will sleep in your house. Because I have been dead ..., tonight I am going to do for the first time what people have been looking forward to (for so long). I am going to institute the papisj, wife exchange.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Zegwaard (transl. from the Dutch by Peter Mason &amp; Ton van Santvoord): ''Amoko''. Crawford House, Belair (SA), 2002. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inuit and Aleut ===
Inuit wife trading has often been reported and commented on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence |last=Hennigh |title=Functions and Limitations of Alaskan Eskimo Wife Trading |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic23-1-24.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary &quot;wife-lending ... was apparently more common among the Aleuts than Eskimos&quot;.
Several motivations for temporary spouse-trading are practiced among the Inuit:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2066/do-eskimo-men-lend-their-wives-to-strangers |title=Do Eskimo men lend their wives to strangers? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=2003-01-21 |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*at the instigation of an aÅekok (shaman), as a magical rite to achieve better weather for hunting-expeditions;
*as a regular feature of the annual &quot;Bladder Festival&quot;;
*for a man visiting without being accompanied his wife, under the promise that he will in the future make his own wife sexually available to his host whenever the host will himself come visiting his erstwhile guest.

Among the [[Inuit]], a very specialized and socially-circumscribed form of wife-sharing was practiced. When hunters were away, they would often stumble into the tribal lands of other tribes, and be subject to death for the offense. But, when they could show a &quot;relationship&quot; by virtue of a man, father or grandfather who had sex with their wife, mother or other female relatives, the wandering hunter was then regarded as family. The Inuit had{{When|date=October 2012}} specific terminology and language describing the complex relationships that emerged from this practice of wife sharing. A man called another man &quot;aipak,&quot; or &quot;other me,&quot; if the man had sex with his wife. Thus, in their conception, this other man sleeping with one's wife was just &quot;another me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ley, David 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ley |first=David |title=Insatiable Wives: Women Who Stray and The Men Who Love Them |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=1-4422-0030-8 |oclc=373474387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South American Indians ===
Among the [[ArawetÃ©]] ([[Asurini]]) in the state of [[ParÃ¡]], [[Brazil]], &quot;spouse-swapping&quot; is practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Batalha Viveiros de Castro (transl. from the Portuguese by Catherine V. Howard) : ''From the Enemy's Point of View''. University of Chicago Press, 1992. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Bari tribe of Venezuela, when a woman becomes pregnant, the women often take other male lovers. These additional lovers then take on the role of secondary or tertiary fathers to the child. If the primary father should die, the other men then have a social obligation to support these children. Research has shown that children with such &quot;extra&quot; fathers have improved life outcomes, in this economically and resource-poor area of the jungle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ley, David 2009&quot;/&gt;
