'''Pornography''' (often abbreviated to &quot;'''porn'''&quot; in informal usage) is the [[WIKT:explicit|explicit]] portrayal of [[Sexual intercourse|sexual]] subject matter. Pornography may use a variety of media, including [[erotic literature|books]], [[pornographic magazine|magazines]], [[postcard]]s, [[photograph|photos]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[animation]], [[sound recording]], [[pornographic film|film]], [[video]], and [[video game]]s. The term applies to the depiction of the act rather than the act itself, and so does not include live exhibitions like [[sex show]]s and [[striptease]]. A ''pornographic [[model (person)|model]]'' poses for still photographs. A ''[[pornographic film actor|pornographic actor]]'' or ''porn star'' performs in [[pornographic film]]s. If dramatic skills are not involved, a performer in porn films may be also be called a ''model''.

Pornography is often distinguished from [[erotica]], which consists in the portrayal of sexuality with high-art aspirations, focusing also on feelings and emotions, while pornography involves the depiction of acts in a sensational manner, with the entire focus on the physical act, so as to arouse quick intense reactions.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web

A distinction is also made between [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] and [[softcore pornography]].  Softcore pornography can generally be described as focusing on nude modeling and suggestive, but not explicit, simulations of sexual intercourse, whereas hardcore pornography explicitly showcases penetrative intercourse. The consumers of porn (particularly hardcore) are assumed to be men, and thus most production targets their presumed tastes.

Pornography has often been subject to [[censorship]] and legal restraints to publication on grounds of [[obscenity]]. Such grounds and even the definition of  pornography have differed in various historical, cultural, and national contexts.&lt;ref&gt;H. Mongomery Hyde (1964) ''A History of Pornography'': 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of social attitudes more tolerant of sexuality and more specific legal definitions of obscenity, an industry for the [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of pornography arose in the latter half of the 20th century. The introduction of [[home video]] and the [[Internet]] saw booms in a worldwide porn industry that generates billions of dollars annually.

In general, [[softcore pornography|softcore]] refers to pornography that does not depict [[sexual penetration|penetration]] (usually, [[genitals]] are not shown on camera),&lt;ref name=Amis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4153718,00.html |title=A rough trade |accessdate=2012-02-29 |author=[[Martin Amis]] |date=2001-03-17 |publisher=[[Guardian.co.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] refers to pornography that explicitly depicts penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/modern/20th-Century-Nudes.html |title=P20th Century Nudes in Art |publisher=The Art History Archive |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography is classified according to the physical characteristics of the participants, fetish, sexual orientation, etc., as well as the types of sexual activity featured. Reality and voyeur pornography, [[animation|animated]] videos, and legally prohibited acts also influence the classification of pornography. The genres of pornography are based on the type of activity featured and the category of participants, such as:
* [[Alt porn]]
* [[Amateur pornography]]
* [[Ethnic pornography]]
* [[Sexual fetishism|Fetish pornography]]
* [[Group sex]]
* [[Reality pornography]]
* [[Sexual orientation|Sexual-orientation]]-based pornography
**[[Straight porn]] (unless otherwise stated this is assumed in this article)
**[[Gay pornography]]
**[[Lesbian pornography]]
**[[Bisexual pornography]]
* [[Softcore pornography]] (including [[glamour photography]] and other salacious images of women or men, termed [[pin-up girl|cheesecake]] or [[beefcake]])

==Economics==
{{Main|Sex industry}}

Revenues of the adult industry in the United States are difficult to determine. In 1970, a Federal study estimated that the total retail value of hardcore pornography in the United States was no more than $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]]. ''Report of The Commission on Obscenity and Pornography'' 1970, [[Washington, D.C.]]: [[United States Government Printing Office|U. S. Government Printing Office]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Forrester Research]] published a report on the online &quot;adult content&quot; industry estimating $750 million to $1 billion in annual revenue. As an unsourced aside, the Forrester study speculated on an industry-wide aggregate figure of $8–10 billion, which was repeated out of context in many news stories,&lt;ref name=&quot;AlternetNaked&quot;&gt;{{cite news

A significant amount of pornographic video is shot in the [[San Fernando Valley]], which has been a pioneering region for producing adult films since the 1970s, and has since become home for various models, actors/actresses, production companies, and other assorted businesses involved in the production and distribution of pornography.

The pornography industry has been considered influential in deciding [[format war]]s in media, including being a factor in the [[VHS]] vs. [[Betamax]] format war (the [[videotape format war]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Macworld&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inquirer&quot;/&gt; and in the [[Blu-ray]] vs. [[HD DVD]] format war (the [[high definition optical disc format war|high-def format war]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Macworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Non-commercial pornography===
As well as the porn industry, there is a large amount of non-commercial pornography. This should be distinguished from commercial pornography falsely marketed as featuring &quot;amateurs&quot;. The [http://www.asstr.org/ Alt Sex Stories Text Repository] focuses on prose stories collected from [[Usenet]].

==Technology==
Mass-distributed pornography is as old as the modern printing press. Almost as soon as photography was invented, it was being used to produce pornographic images. Some claim{{Who|date=October 2007}} that pornography has been a driving force in the development of technologies from the [[printing press]], through [[photography]] (still and motion), to [[Satellite television|satellite TV]], other forms of [[video]], and the [[Internet]]. With the invention of tiny [[camera]]s and wireless equipments [[voyeur pornography]] is gaining ground. [[Mobile camera]]s are used to capture pornographic photos or videos, and forwarded as [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], a practice known as [[sexting]].

===Computer-generated images and manipulations===
Digital manipulation requires the use of source photographs, but some pornography is produced without human actors at all. The idea of completely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] pornography was conceived very early as one of the most obvious areas of application for computer graphics and 3D rendering.

Until the late 1990s, digitally manipulated pornography could not be produced cost-effectively. In the early 2000s, it became a growing segment, as the modelling and animation software matured and the rendering capabilities of computers improved. As of 2004, computer-generated pornography depicting situations involving children and sex with [[fictional character]]s, such as [[Lara Croft]], is already produced on a limited scale. The October 2004 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' featured topless pictures of the title character from the ''[[BloodRayne]]'' video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/25/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ |title=Playboy undressed video game women – Aug. 25, 2004 |accessdate=2006-08-26 |work=CNN |date=2004-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===3D pornography===
Due to the popularity of 3D blockbusters in theaters such as ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon]]'', companies are now looking to shoot pornography movies in 3D. The first case of this occurred in [[Hong Kong]], when a group of filmmakers filmed ''[[3D Sex and Zen: Extreme Ecstasy]]'' released in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100808/wl_asia_afp/hongkongjapanchinafilmpornography_20100808051130 |title=Hong Kong filmmakers shoot 'first' 3D porn film |accessdate=2010-08-08 |work=Yahoo |date=2010-08-08 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100815211905/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100808/wl_asia_afp/hongkongjapanchinafilmpornography_20100808051130 |archivedate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Link went dead on October 2010; archive found on archive.org --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asiansexgazette.com/asg/china/china07news20.htm |title=Hong Kong filmmakers shoot 'first' 3D porn film |accessdate=2010-08-17 |work=Asian Sex Gazette |date=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and distribution by region==
{{Main|Pornography by region}}
The [[Filmmaking|production]] and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of pornography are economic activities of some importance. The exact size of the economy of pornography and the influence that it has in political circles are matters of controversy.

In the United States, the sex film industry is centered in the [[San Fernando Valley]] of [[Los Angeles]]. In Europe, [[Budapest]] is regarded as the industry center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escapeartist.com/efam9/Living_In_Budapest.html “Strange and wonderful” Budapest — Where the living is increasingly pleasant...and still very cheap].

== Legal status ==
{{further|Pornography by region}}
{{Sex and the Law}}
The legal status of pornography varies widely from country to country. Most countries allow at least some form of pornography. In some countries, softcore pornography is considered tame enough to be sold in general stores or to be shown on TV. Hardcore pornography, on the other hand, is usually regulated. The production and sale, and to a slightly lesser degree the possession, of [[child pornography]] is illegal in almost all countries, and some countries have restrictions on pornography depicting violence (see e.g. [[rape pornography]]) or [[animal pornography|pornography depicting sex of a human with an animal]], or both.
[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pornographic entertainment on display in a [[sex shop]] window. There is usually a minimum age to go into pornographic stores.]]
Most countries attempt to restrict minors' access to hardcore materials, limiting availability to [[sex shop]]s, mail-order, and television channels that parents can restrict, among other means. There is usually an age minimum for entrance to pornographic stores, or the materials are displayed partly covered or not displayed at all. More generally, [[disseminating pornography to a minor]] is often illegal. Many of these efforts have been rendered practically irrelevant by widely available [[Internet pornography]]. A [[Child Online Protection Act|failed US law]] would have made these same restrictions apply to the internet.

In the United States, a person receiving unwanted [[direct marketing|commercial mail]] he or she deems pornographic (or otherwise offensive) may obtain a [[Prohibitory Order]], either against all mail from a particular sender, or against all sexually explicit mail, by applying to the [[United States Postal Service]]. There are recurring [[urban legend]]s of [[snuff movie]]s, in which murders are filmed for pornographic purposes. Despite extensive work to ascertain the truth of these rumors, law enforcement officials have been unable to find any such works.

Some people, including pornography producer [[Larry Flynt]] and the writer [[Salman Rushdie]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesRushdie&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article466971.ece |title=Porn is vital to freedom, says Rushdie |accessdate=2007-11-08 |last=Baxter |first=Sarah |coauthors=Brooks, Richard |date=2004-08-08 |work=Times Online |publisher=Times Newspapers |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5TD5Q8UAz |archivedate=2007-11-08 |quote=Pornography exists everywhere, of course, but when it comes into societies in which it’s difficult for young men and women to get together and do what young men and women often like doing, it satisfies a more general need.... While doing so, it sometimes becomes a kind of standard-bearer for freedom, even civilisation. |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that pornography is vital to freedom and that a free and civilized society should be judged by its willingness to accept pornography.

The UK Government has criminalised possession of what it terms &quot;[[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|extreme pornography]]&quot; following the highly publicised [[murder]] of [[Graham Coutts|Jane Longhurst]].

[[Child pornography]] is illegal in most countries, with a person most commonly being a child until the age of 18 (though the age does vary). In those countries, any film or photo with a child subject in a sexual act is considered pornography and illegal.

=== Copyright status ===
Some courts have applied US [[copyright]] protection to pornographic materials.&lt;ref&gt;Goussé, Caroline (2012-02-16). [http://www.ipbrief.net/2012/02/16/4803/ &quot;No Copyright Protection for Pornography: A Daring Response to File-Sharing Litigation&quot;]. Intellectual Property Brief. Retrieved 2012-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masnick, Mike (2011-11-04). [http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111103/18353216627/court-wonders-if-porn-can-even-be-covered-copyright.shtml &quot;Court Wonders If Porn Can Even Be Covered By Copyright&quot;]. Tech Dirt. Retrieved 2012-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first US Copyright law specifically barred obscene materials, the provision was removed in subsequent extensions of copyright. Most pornographic productions are theoretically [[work for hire]] meaning pornographic models do not receive statutory royalties for their performances. Of difficulty is the changing views of what is considered obscene, meaning works could slip into and out of copyright protection based upon the prevailing standards of decency. This was not an issue with the copyright law up until 1972 when copyright protection required registration. When congress changed the law to make copyright protection automatic and for the life of the author, some courts have held it effectively granted copyright protection to pornography because materials once considered obscene might no longer be considered as such. Congress's decision also made ascertaining the copyright status of pornographic materials nearly impossible because of the secrecy conferred to the identity of the models and producers.

The copyright status of pornography in the United States has been challenged as late as February 2012.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;[http://torrentfreak.com/you-cant-copyright-porn-bittorrent-defendant-insists-120206/ You Can’t Copyright Porn, Harassed BitTorrent Defendant Insists]&quot;, ''[[TorrentFreak]]'', 6 February 2012. Retrieved 9 Augusti 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on sexual crime==
{{Main|Social effects of pornography}}
Research concerning the effects of pornography is inconclusive on the issue of crime. Some studies support the contention that the viewing of pornographic material may increase rates of sexual crimes, while others have shown no effects, or a decrease in the rates of such crimes. However, most of these studies focus on various correlations, and [[correlation does not imply causation]].

==Statistics==
More than 70% of male internet users from 18 to 34 visit a pornographic site in a typical month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safefamilies.org/sfStats.php Statistics on Pornography, Sexual Addiction and Online Perpetrators and their Effects on Children, Pastors and Churches]. Safefamilies.org. Retrieved 2011-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:La grande Epidemie de PORNOGRAPHIE.jpg|thumb|A French [[caricature]] on &quot;the great epidemic of pornography.&quot;]]
The word is similar to the modern [[Greek language|Greek]] πορνογραφία (''pornographia''), which derives from the Greek words πόρνη (''pornē,'' &quot;prostitute&quot; and πορνεία - ''pornea,'' &quot;[[prostitution]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=porn&amp;lang=greek List of Greek words starting with πορν- (''porn-'')] on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt;), and γράφειν (''graphein,'' &quot;to write or to record&quot;, derived meaning &quot;illustration&quot;, cf. &quot;[[graphics|graph]]&quot;), and the suffix -ία (''-ia'', meaning &quot;state of&quot;, &quot;property of&quot;, or &quot;place of&quot;), thus meaning &quot;a written description or illustration of prostitutes or prostitution&quot;. No date is known for the first use of the word in Greek.

&quot;Pornographie&quot; was in use in the French language during the 1800s. The word did not enter the English language as the familiar conjunction until 1857&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=pornography&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary].

For example the French [[Impressionism]] masterwork by [[Édouard Manet]] titled [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]] was a nude picture of a French courtesan, literally a &quot;prostitute picture&quot;. It was controversial at the time.

Nineteenth-century legislation eventually outlawed the publication, retail, and trafficking of certain writings and images regarded as pornographic and would order the destruction of shop and warehouse stock meant for sale; however, the private possession of and viewing of (some forms of) pornography was not made an offence until recent times.&lt;ref&gt;H. Montgomery Hyde ''A History of Pornography''. (1969) London, Heinemann: 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

When large-scale excavations of [[Pompeii]] were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the [[erotic art]] of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the [[Roman Empire]]. They did not know what to do with the frank depictions of [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The moveable objects were locked away in the [[Secret Museum, Naples|Secret Museum]] in [[Naples]] and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children, and the working classes.

[[Fanny Hill]] is considered &quot;the first original English [[prose]] pornography, and the first pornography to use the form of the novel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foxon, ''Libertine Literature in England, 1660–1745,'' 1965, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[erotic literature|erotic]] [[novel]] by [[John Cleland]] first published in [[England]] in [[1748 in literature|1748]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagner&quot;&gt;Wagner, &quot;Introduction&quot;, in Cleland, ''Fanny Hill,'' 1985, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane, ''Obscene Profits: The Entrepreneurs of Pornography in the Cyber Age'', 2000, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most prosecuted and banned books in history.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture'', 2001, p. 273, ISBN 0-87972-821-3; Sutherland, ''Offensive Literature: Decensorship in Britain, 1960–1982'', 1983, p. 32, ISBN 0-389-20354-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors were charged with &quot;corrupting the King's subjects.&quot;

The world's first law criminalizing pornography was the United Kingdom [[Obscene Publications Act 1857]] enacted at the urging of the [[Society for Suppression of Vice]]. The Act, which applied to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom and Ireland]], made the sale of obscene material a statutory offence, giving the courts power to seize and destroy offending material. The Act did not apply to [[Scotland]], where the [[common law]] continued to apply; however, the Act did not define &quot;obscene&quot;, leaving this for the courts to determine. Prior to this Act, the publication of obscene material was treated as a [[common law]] misdemeanour&lt;ref&gt;From the precedent set by ''R. v. Curl'' (1729) following the publication of ''[[Venus in the Cloister]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and effectively prosecuting authors and publishers was difficult even in cases where the material was clearly intended as pornography.

The Victorian attitude that pornography was for a select few can be seen in the wording of the [[Hicklin test]] stemming from a court case in 1868 where it asks, &quot;whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences.&quot; Despite the fact of their suppression, depictions of erotic imagery were common throughout history.&lt;ref name=libido7&gt;{{cite web |last=Beck |first=Marianna |title=The Roots of Western Pornography: Victorian Obsessions and Fin-de-Siècle Predilections |publisher=Libido, The Journal of Sex and Sensibility |month=May |year=2003 |url=http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn07.html |accessdate=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pornographic film]] production commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture in 1895. Two of the earliest pioneers were [[Eugène Pirou]] and [[Albert Kirchner]]. Kirchner directed the earliest surviving pornographic film for Pirou under the trade name &quot;Léar&quot;. The 1896 film, ''Le Coucher de la Marie'' showed [[Louise Willy]] performing a [[striptease]]. Pirou's film inspired a genre of risqué French films showing women disrobing and other filmmakers realised profits could be made from such films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |coauthors=Stephen Herbert and Luke McKernan eds. |title=Léar (Albert Kirchner) |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/lear.htm |accessdate=2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |coauthors=Stephen Herbert and Luke McKernan eds. |title=Eugène Pirou |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/pirou.htm |accessdate=2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexually explicit films were soon characterised as obscene and rendered illegal. Those that were made were produced underground by amateurs starting in the 1920s, primarily in France and the United States. Processing the film by commercial means was risky as was their distribution. Distribution was strictly private.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic |work=Time Magazine |publisher=Time inc |date=March 29, 2005 |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1043267,00.html |accessdate=2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pornography in Denmark|Denmark]] was the first country to legalize pornography in 1969, which led to an explosion of commercially produced pornography. It continued to be banned in other countries, and had to be smuggled in, where it was sold &quot;under the counter&quot; or (sometimes) shown in &quot;members only&quot; cinema clubs.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite video |people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors); Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast) |date=2006-03-07 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |medium=DVD |publisher=Koch Vision |location=Port Washington, NY |accessdate=2006-10-21 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-pornography movement==
{{Main|Anti-pornography movement}}
Opposition to pornography comes generally, though not exclusively, from three primary sources: [[law]], [[religion]] and [[feminism]].

===Feminist objections===
{{Main|Feminist views of pornography}}
[[Feminist]] critics of pornography, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]], generally consider it demeaning to women. They argue that the pornographic industry contributes to [[violence against women]], both in the production of pornography (which they charge entails the physical, psychological, or economic coercion of the women who perform in it, and where they argue that the abuse and exploitation of women is rampant) and in its consumption (where they charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]]).&lt;ref name=stanford-shrage&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por &quot;Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography&quot;]. In: ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, Catherine A. (1984) &quot;Not a moral issue&quot;. ''Yale Law and Policy Review'' 2:321-345. Reprinted in: Mackinnon (1989). ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-89645-9 (1st ed), ISBN 0-674-89646-7 (2nd ed). &quot;Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript) |series=[[Think Tank]] |network=PBS |accessdate=2009-09-01 |year=1995 |url=http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Catharine (1987). ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; They charge that pornography presents a severely distorted image of sexual relations, and reinforces sex myths; that it always shows women as readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on men's terms, always responding positively to any advances men make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon |date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious objections===
{{Main|Religious views on pornography}}
Religious organizations have been important in bringing about political action against pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Sherkat and Ellison, 1997, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2580526 &quot;The Cognitive Structure of a Moral Crusade&quot;], ''Social Forces'' 75(3), p. 958.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, religious beliefs affect the formation of political beliefs which concern pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Sherkat and Ellison, 1999, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jmuniz/religion_annurev_sherkat%20and%20ellison%201999.pdf &quot;Recent Developments and Current Controversies in the Sociology of Religion&quot;], ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 25, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
