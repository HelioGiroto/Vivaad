==History==
In the 1600s, Dutch physician [[Regnier de Graaf]] described [[female ejaculation]] and referred to an erogenous zone in the vagina that he himself linked with the male [[prostate]]; this zone was later reported by the German gynecologist [[Ernst Gräfenberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roeckelein2006p256&quot;&gt;

After the G-Spot was demonstrated for their observation, they changed their opinion.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheNakedWoman&quot;/&gt;

An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to 2350 professional women in the United States and Canada with a subsequent 55% return rate. Of these respondents, 40% reported having a fluid release (ejaculation) at the moment of orgasm. Further, 82% of the women who reported the sensitive area (Gräfenberg Spot) also reported ejaculation with their orgasms. A number of variables were associated with this perceived existence of female ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Darling, CA; Davidson, JK; Conway-Welch, C.|year =1990 |title =Female ejaculation: perceived origins, the Grafenberg spot/area, and sexual responsiveness. |journal = Arch Sex Behav  |volume =19 |pages =29–47 |doi =10.1007/BF01541824 |pmid =2327894 |issue =1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female prostate==
{{See also|Skene's gland|Urethral sponge}}

In 2001, the [[International Federation of Associations of Anatomists|Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology]] accepted ''female prostate'' as an accurate term for the [[Skene's gland]], which is believed to be found in the G-Spot area along the walls of the urethra.&lt;ref name=&quot;the-clitoris.com&quot;/&gt; Various researchers have moved away from the name ''Skene's gland'' and are referring to the structures instead as the female prostate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The prostate in men has been unofficially called the male G-Spot because it can also be used as an erogenous zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;about.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/analplay/ht/htprostate.htm |title=How to Find and Stimulate the Prostate – Exploring Anal Play for Men |work= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located where the rectum joins the colon, about 50&amp;nbsp;[[millimeter|mm]] (2&amp;nbsp;in) from the [[anus]], and when aroused it is a walnut-shaped swelling.

Links between G-Spot sensitivity and female ejaculation led to the idea that non-urine female ejaculate may originate from the Skene's gland. Tissue examination showed 15 prostate-specific antigens in the gland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Tepper, Sl; Jagirdar, J; Heath, D; Geller, SA. |year =1984 |title =Homology between the female paraurethral (Skene's) glands and the prostate. |journal =Arch Pathol Lab Med.  |volume =108 |pages =423–425 |pmid =6546868 |issue =5}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a trend of calling the Skene's glands the female prostate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Zaviacic, M; Ablin, RJ. |year =2000 |title =The female prostate and prostate-specific antigen. Immunohistochemical localization, implications for this prostate marker in women, and reasons for using the term &quot;prostate in the human female. |journal =Histol Histopathol  |volume =15 |pages =131–142 |pmid =10668204 |issue =1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it has been argued that the G-Spot is a system of [[gland]]s and [[duct (anatomy)|ducts]] located within the anterior (front) wall of the vagina about one centimeter from the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrooksCole&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Crooks |first=R |coauthors=Baur, K |title=Our Sexuality |publisher= Brooks/Cole |location=California |year=1999 |isbn=0-495-81347-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach has linked the G-Spot with the [[urethral sponge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/sexuality/a/clitoraltruthin.htm|title= &quot;The Clitoral Truth&quot;: An Interview With Author Rebecca Chalker|publisher=About.com: Women's Health|author=Tracee Cornforth|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enzyme [[CGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5|PDE5]] (involved with [[erectile dysfunction]]) has additionally been associated with the G-Spot area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Nicola Jones|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2495|title= Bigger is better when it comes to the G-Spot|date=3 July 2002|journal=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several researchers consider the connection between the Skene's gland and the G-Spot to be weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hines&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;santos&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Santos, F Taboga, S. |year=2003 |title=Female prostate: a review about biological repercussions of this gland in humans and rodents. |journal=Animal Reproduction. |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages= 3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that the Skene's gland does not appear to have receptors for touch stimulation, and that there is no direct evidence for its involvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alzate&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author =Alzate H Hoch Z |year =1986 |title =The &quot;G spot&quot; and &quot;female ejaculation&quot;: a current appraisal. |journal =J Sex Marital Ther. |volume =12 |issue =3 |pages =211–20 |pmid =3531529 |doi=10.1080/00926238608415407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual stimulation and studies==
The location of the G-Spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80&amp;nbsp;mm (2 to 3&amp;nbsp;in) inside the vagina, on the front wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheNakedWoman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Morris, Desmond |title=The Naked Woman: A Study of the Female Body

It is claimed that the best G-Spot stimulation is achieved by using both manual stimulation and sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;sex101&quot;&gt;[http://www.sexinfo101.com/pw_gspot.shtml G spot stimulation] SexInfo 101. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Two primary methods have been used to define and locate the G-Spot as a sensitive area in the vagina:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hines&quot;/&gt;
*self-reported levels of arousal during stimulation
*stimulation of the G-Spot leads to [[female ejaculation]]

Studies using ultrasound have also been used to identify physiological differences between women&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquila&quot;/&gt; and changes to the G-Spot region during sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNreal&quot;/&gt;

===Findings===
====General====
&lt;!--Place studies in chronological order.--&gt;
In a 1981 published case study of one woman, it was reported that stimulation of the [[anterior]] vaginal wall made the area grow by fifty percent and that self-reported levels of arousal/orgasm were &quot;deeper&quot; when the G-Spot was stimulated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Addiego&quot;/&gt; Another study, in 1983, examined eleven women by [[palpate|palpating]] the entire vagina in a clockwise fashion, and reported a specific response to stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall in four of the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Goldberg, DC; Whipple, B; Fishkin, RE; Waxman H; Fink PJ; Wiesberg M. |year =1983 |title =The Grafenberg Spot and female ejaculation: a review of initial hypotheses. |journal =J Sex Marital Ther.  |volume =9 |pages =27–37 |pmid =6686614 |issue =1 |doi=10.1080/00926238308405831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the [[University of L'Aquila]] have found, using ultrasonography, that women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically more likely to have thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquila&quot;/&gt; The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-Spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian |last=Sample |title=The elusive G-Spot really does exist, say researchers |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/feb/21/medicalresearch.sciencenews |publisher =The Guardian |date= 21 February 2008|accessdate=3 September 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French study in late 2009 examined a small number of women with ultrasound as they had intercourse. By examining changes in the vagina, the research team found physiological evidence of the G-Spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNreal&quot;/&gt;

Though the hypothesis has been challenged ([[#Debates|see below]]), there is some research suggesting that G-Spot and [[clitoris|clitoral]] orgasms are of the same origin. [[Masters and Johnson]] were the first to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's [[sexual response cycle]] to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms.

The main researcher of the studies, Australian [[Urology|urologist]] Helen O'Connell, asserts that this interconnected relationship is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-Spot and experience of vaginal orgasms, taking into account the stimulation of the internal parts of the clitoris during vaginal penetration. While using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technology, O'Connell noted a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the &quot;clitoral bulbs&quot; and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina. &quot;The vaginal wall is, in fact, the clitoris,&quot; said O'Connell. &quot;If you lift the skin off the vagina on the side walls, you get the bulbs of the clitoris – triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt; O'Connell, who made the claims in 1998, and her team were already aware that the clitoris is more than just its glans – the &quot;little hill&quot;. They reasoned that it is possible that some women have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others, and therefore whereas the majority of women can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt; 

French researchers Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès reported similar findings to that of O'Connell's. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D [[Medical ultrasonography|sonography]] of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina. On the basis of this research, they argued that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-Spot because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buisson and Foldès 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=2 |last=Buisson|first=Odile|last2=Foldès  |first2=Pierre|title=Sonography of the Clitoris|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=413–417|year=2008 |pmid= |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00699.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buisson and Foldès 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=2 |last=Buisson|first=Odile|last2=Foldès  |first2=Pierre|title=The clitoral complex: a dynamic sonographic study.|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|volume= 6|issue= 5|pages= 1223–31|year=2009 |pmid=19453931|doi |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01231.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2009 published study, the &quot;coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall&quot;. Buisson and Foldès suggested &quot;that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris's root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buisson and Foldès 2009&quot;/&gt;

In 2011, researcher Adam Ostrzenski claimed to have found the first evidence of G-Spot anatomical structures by dissecting a [[cadaver]] in Poland. Between the fifth and sixth layer of the vaginal wall, there were grape-like clusters Ostrzenski believes are [[erectile tissue]] that would function as a G-Spot. The research was published in ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' in 2012. Critics of Ostrzenski's claim note that he provided no evidence that his sample consists of nerve endings, that the structures play a role in arousal, or that they would be in one specific area. Ostrzenski said that part of the reason he did not detail a precise type of tissue and how it works is because the Polish regulations that govern dissection of fresh cadavers prevented him from taking samples for histological testing. He said that he is not suggesting that the G-Spot he reports to have found will be in the same place, or have the same effect, for every woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;la-Ostrzenski&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-g-spot-20120425,0,5021807.story|title=Doctor says he's found the actual G spot|last=Healy|first=Melissa|date=April 25, 2012|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debates====
G-Spot proponents are criticized for giving too much credence to [[anecdotal evidence]], and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive evidence for a precisely located G-Spot involve small participant samples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hines&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author =Hines, T |year =2001 |month =August |title =The G-Spot: A modern gynecologic myth |journal =Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume =185 |issue =2 |pages =359–62 | pmid = 11518892 |doi =10.1067/mob.2001.115995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation have generally shown that there is no single area with a greater density of nerve endings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hines&quot;/&gt; A 2006 study of 110 [[biopsy]] specimens drawn from 21 women concluded with the absence of a vaginal locus with greater nerve density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Pauls, R; Mutema, G; Segal, J; Silva, WA; Kleeman, S; Dryfhout, Ma V; Karram, M.|year =2006 |month =November |title =A prospective study examining the anatomic distribution of nerve density in the human vagina. |journal = J Sex Med |volume =3 |issue =6 |pages =979–87 | pmid = 17100930 |doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00325.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while neither the area of the anterior vaginal wall where the G-Spot is said to be located nor the [[Skene's gland]] appear to possess them, the [[urethral sponge]], which is thought by some to be homologous to the G-Spot, does contain sensitive nerve endings as well as [[erectile tissue]]. It should also be noted that sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10651316&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Babmindra VP, Novozhilova AP, Bragina TA, ''et al.'' |title=The structural bases of the regulation of neuron sensitivity |journal=Neurosci.

In addition to general skepticism among gynecologists, doctors and researchers that the G-Spot exists,&lt;ref name=&quot;time1982&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hines&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilchevsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = Delvin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/healthyliving/gspot.htm|title=The G-Spot|accessdate=5 November 2008 |work=Healthy Living|last = Delvin |first = David|coauthors = Christine Webber|publisher = NetDoctor.co.uk|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a team at [[King's College London]] in late 2009 suggested that its existence is subjective. They acquired the largest sample size of women to date – 1,800 – who are pairs of twins, and found that the twins did not report a similar G-Spot in their questionnaires. The research, headed by Tim Spector, documents a 15-year study of the twins, identical and non-identical. Identical twins share genes, while non-identical pairs share 50% of theirs. According to the researchers, if one identical twin reported having a G-Spot, it was more likely that the other would too, but this pattern did not materialize.&lt;ref name=&quot;YvonneRoberts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article6973971.ece |title=What an anti-climax: G-Spot is a myth - Times Online |work= The Times|author=Lois Rogers |accessdate=January 23, 2012| location=London | date=January 3, 2010|archivedate=May 31, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100531122424/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article6973971.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study co-author Dr. Andrea Burri believes: &quot;It is rather irresponsible to claim the existence of an entity that has never been proven and pressurise women and men too.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC8439000&quot;/&gt; Burri stated that one of the reasons for the research was to remove feelings of &quot;inadequacy or underachievement&quot; for women who feared they lacked a G-Spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;YvonneRoberts&quot;/&gt; Dr. [[Beverly Whipple]] dismissed the findings, commenting that twins have different sexual partners and techniques, and that the study did not properly account for lesbian or bisexual women.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline&quot;/&gt;

Like Burri, Dr. Petra Boynton, a British scientist who has written extensively on the G-Spot debate,&lt;ref name=&quot;drpetra&quot;&gt;[http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/where-have-all-the-g-spots-gone/ Where have all the g spots gone?] - Dr Petra Boynton&lt;/ref&gt; is concerned about the promotion of the G-Spot leading women to feel &quot;dysfunctional&quot; if they do not experience it. &quot;We're all different. Some women will have a certain area within the vagina which will be very sensitive, and some won't{{mdash}}but they won't necessarily be in the area called the G-Spot,&quot; stated Boynton. &quot;If a woman spends all her time worrying about whether she is normal, or has a G-Spot or not, she will focus on just one area, and ignore everything else. It's telling people that there is a single, best way to have sex, which isn't the right thing to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCGspotDetected&quot;/&gt;

The G-Spot having an anatomical relationship with the clitoris has also been challenged. Vincenzo Puppo, who, while agreeing that the clitoris is the locus of female sexual pleasure, disagrees with Helen O'Connell and other researchers' terminological and anatomical descriptions of the clitoris. &quot;Clitoral bulbs is an incorrect term from an embryological and anatomical viewpoint, in fact the bulbs do not develop from the phallus, and they do not belong to the clitoris: 'clitoral bulbs' is not a term used in human anatomy, the correct term is the vestibular bulbs,&quot; stated Puppo. &quot;Gynecologists, sexual medicine experts, and sexologists should spread certainties for all women, not hypotheses or personal opinions, they should use scientific terminology: clitoral/vaginal/uterine orgasm, G/A/C/U spot orgasm, and female ejaculation, are terms that should not be used by sexologists, women, and mass media.&quot; Puppo argues that O'Connell et al. &quot;fail to describe&quot; the anatomy of the distal vagina, the differences between lateral and posterior walls of the vagina, and that there are no exocrine glands in the walls of the vagina. He says of an anatomical relationship between the clitoris and vagina, &quot;the anterior vaginal wall is separated from the posterior urethral wall by the urethrovaginal septum (its thickness is 10–12 mm)&quot; and that the &quot;inner clitoris&quot; does not exist. &quot;The female perineal urethra, which is located in front of the anterior vaginal wall, is about one centimeter in length and the G-Spot is located in the pelvic wall of the urethra, 2-3 cm into the vagina,&quot; Puppo stated. &quot;The male penis cannot come in contact with the venous plexus of [[Georg Ludwig Kobelt|Kobelt]] (situated until the angle of the clitoris) or with the roots of the clitoris (which do not have sensory receptors or erogenous sensitivity) during vaginal intercourse.&quot; Puppo did, however, dismiss the orgasmic definition of the G-Spot that emerged after Ernst Gräfenberg, stating that &quot;there is no anatomical evidence of the vaginal orgasm which was invented by Freud in 1905, without any scientific basis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puppo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vincenzo Puppo |title=Anatomy of the Clitoris: Revision and Clarifications about the Anatomical Terms for the Clitoris Proposed (without Scientific Bases) by Helen O'Connell, Emmanuele Jannini, and Odile Buisson.|journal=ISRN Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume= 2011|issue=ID 261464 |pages=5 |year=2011 |month= September |pmid=21941661|laysummary=  |laysource= |laydate= |doi=10.5402/2011/261464 |pmc=3175415}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In contrast to Puppo's belief that there is no anatomical relationship between the clitoris and vagina, other researchers continue to support the hypothesis that G-Spot orgasms are the result of clitoral stimulation, reaffirming that clitoral tissue extends even where the related G-Spot would be located.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilchevsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Can't find it&quot;/&gt; &quot;My view is that the G-Spot is really just the extension of the clitoris on the inside of the vagina, analogous to the base of the male penis,&quot; said Amichai Kilchevsky. Because all humans start out as female in the womb and therefore the penis is essentially an enlarged clitoris, changed by male hormones, Kilchevsky believes that there is no evolutionary reason why females would have two separate structures capable of producing orgasms and blames the porn industry and &quot;G-Spot promoters&quot; for &quot;encouraging the myth&quot; of a distinct G-Spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Can't find it&quot;/&gt; Arguments that vaginal orgasms help encourage sexual intercourse in order to facilitate reproduction are challenged by the fact that vaginal orgasms are significantly difficult to achieve,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilchevsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd&quot;/&gt; a predicament that is believed to be the result of nature easing the process of child bearing by drastically reducing the number of vaginal nerve endings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiten&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Wayne Weiten, Dana S.

When a [[Rutgers University]] research team asked several women to stimulate themselves in a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance]] (fMRI) machine, brain scans showed stimulating the clitoris, vagina and cervix lit up distinct areas of the women's sensory cortex,&lt;ref name=&quot;Komisaruk&quot;/&gt; which means the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall – where the G-Spot is reported to be. &quot;I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-Spot is not a particular thing,&quot; stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings. &quot;It's not like saying, 'What is the thyroid gland?' The G-Spot is more of a thing like New York City is a thing. It's a region, it's a convergence of many different structures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilchevsky&quot;/&gt;

In 2010, ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' planned a debate and publications from both sides of the G-Spot issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline&quot;/&gt; In 2012, scholars Kilchevsky, Vardi, Lowenstein and Gruenwald stated in the journal, &quot;Reports in the public media would lead one to believe the G-Spot is a well-characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation, yet this is far from the truth.&quot; The authors cited that dozens of trials have attempted to confirm the existence of a G-Spot using surveys, pathologic specimens, various imaging modalities, and biochemical markers, and concluded:&lt;blockquote&gt;The surveys found that a majority of women believe a G-Spot actually exists, although not all of the women who believed in it were able to locate it. Attempts to characterize vaginal innervation have shown some differences in nerve distribution across the vagina, although the findings have not proven to be universally reproducible. Furthermore, radiographic studies have been unable to demonstrate a unique entity, other than the clitoris, whose direct stimulation leads to vaginal orgasm. Objective measures have failed to provide strong and consistent evidence for the existence of an anatomical site that could be related to the famed G-Spot. However, reliable reports and anecdotal testimonials of the existence of a highly sensitive area in the distal anterior vaginal wall raise the question of whether enough investigative modalities have been implemented in the search of the G-Spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilchevsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sex toys==
One of the most common [[sex toy]]s used in G-Spot stimulation is the specially designed [[G-Spot vibrator]]. This is a [[phallus]]-like vibrator that has a curved tip which makes G-Spot stimulation very easy. The head of the G-Spot vibrator has a special form and it is a little curved in order to ease the stimulation of the G-Spot.

The level of [[Sexual intercourse|penetration]] when using this sex toy depends on every woman because the [[physiology]] is not the same in two individuals. The effect of the G-Spot stimulation, no matter which way this is done, may be enhanced by stimulation of the other erogenous zones in a woman's body. These may include the clitoris and [[Labium (genitalia)|labia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gspotstimulation.net/ All about stimulation of the G-spot] Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt; These toys are made from the same materials as regular vibrators, including silicone, jelly, rubber or any combination of them.
