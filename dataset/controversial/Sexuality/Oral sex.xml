[[File:Achille Devéria erotism.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A furtive act of oral sex performed on a woman while a formal party is in progress]]

'''Oral sex''' is [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] involving the stimulation of the [[Sex organ|genitalia]] of a [[sex partner]] by the use of the [[Human mouth|mouth]], [[tongue]], [[Human teeth|teeth]] or throat. [[Cunnilingus]] refers to oral sex performed on females while [[fellatio]] refer to oral sex performed on males. [[Anilingus]] refers to oral stimulation of a person's [[anus]]. Oral stimulation of other parts of the body (as in [[kiss]]ing and [[licking]]) is usually not considered oral sex. People may engage in oral sex as part of [[foreplay]] before [[sexual intercourse]], during, or as intercourse.

== Practice ==
=== Sexual variants ===
[[Facesitting]] is a form of oral sex in which the receiver sits on the giver's face and pushes into it with his or her genitals. 

Oral sex can be performed by both partners at the same time in the so-called [[69 (sex position)|&quot;sixty-nine&quot; position]]. Spitting and/or swallowing of the ejaculatory fluids or giving a [[Pearl necklace (sexuality)|pearl necklace]] may cause different sexual stimulations. [[Autofellatio]] is a possible but rare variant; autocunnilingus may also be possible for women with extremely flexible spines.

An act of [[group sex]] restricted to one woman giving oral sex to several men is referred to as a ''gangsuck'', ''blowbang'' or ''lineup'', all derivatives of the slang expression ''[[gang bang]]'' for group sex.  [[Bukkake (sex act)|Bukkake]] and [[gokkun]] may also involve oral sex, though not necessarily.

===Contraception and safe sex===
[[File:ChinaScrollPN3_detail,_left,_threesome.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A late 19th century [[Beijing]] [[hand scroll]] depicting oral sex]]

Oral sex may be practiced by people of all [[sexual orientation]]s. In heterosexual contexts, oral sex is used by some couples as a method of [[contraception]] and may be chosen as an alternative to vaginal intercourse for this reason. Oral sex alone cannot result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=about.com_embarrassingsex&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teenadvice.about.com/od/sexuallyactive/a/sillysexqa.htm|title=Your Most Embarrassing Sex Questions Answered|accessdate=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under any normal circumstances, there is no way for [[sperm]] from the [[human penis|penis]] to enter the [[uterus]] and [[Fallopian tube]]s to fertilize an [[Ovum|egg]]; in humans, there is no connection between the [[gastrointestinal system]] and the [[Reproductive system|reproductive tract]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;However this has happened in [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/teen-girl-vagina-pregnant-sperm-survival-oral-sex/story?id=9732562 bizarre circumstances] involving a stabbing&lt;/ref&gt; Ingested sperm will be killed and broken down by [[acid]] in the [[stomach]] and [[protein]]s in the [[small intestine]]. The breakdown products will be absorbed as a negligible quantity of [[nutrient]]s. However, the act does carry a potential risk of pregnancy if [[semen]] from the man comes in contact with the [[vagina]]l area indirectly. This can occur if the semen in the [[ejaculate]] is carried on the fingers, hands, or other body parts; and comes in contact with the vaginal area. It is therefore still necessary to exercise caution when having oral sex to prevent pregnancy.

Oral sexual activities are not necessarily effective methods of preventing [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), although some forms of STD are believed to be less easily spread in this way, and oral sex has been recommended as a form of [[safe sex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;[http://www.gmhc.org/health/testing/geffen_sti.html Geffen Testing Center's HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis C Information Sheet].

A makeshift dental dam can be made out of a [[condom]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/dental-dams &quot;How to Make a Dental Dam Using a Condom&quot;], UCSB SexInfoOnline, February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or a latex or nitrile glove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://std.about.com/od/prevention/ht/dentaldamhowto.htm|title=How to Make Your Own Dental Dam From a Condom|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However using a real dental dam is seen as preferable because real dental dams cover a larger area, avoid accidents caused by &quot;slipping&quot; outside the covered area, and avoid the risk that makeshift versions may be accidentally damaged or poked with the scissors during the cutting procedure. Plastic wrap may also be used as a barrier during oral sex, but there exists no conclusive scientific research regarding how effective it may or may not be at preventing disease transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gossypiboma.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/oral-sex-and-plastic-wrap-the-cdc-sandwiched-between-a-riddle-and-an-enigma/|title=Oral sex and plastic wrap: the CDC sandwiched between a riddle and an enigma|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain kinds of plastic wrap are manufactured to be microwaveable and are designed to have pores that open when heated, but there also exists no scientific research on what effect, if any, this has on disease transmission when used during oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/saferse1/a/plastic-wrap-oral-sex.htm|title=Plastic Wrap and Oral Sex|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people complain that the thickness of the plastic dulls sensation. 

A report issued in September 2005 by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] was the basis of an article in the September 26, 2005, issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. The report comes from the results of a computer-administered [[statistical survey|survey]] of over 12,000 Americans between the ages of 15 and 44, and states that over half the [[adolescence|teenagers]] questioned have had oral sex. While some headlines have interpreted this as evidence that oral sex among teenagers is &quot;on the rise&quot;, this was the first comprehensive study of its kind to examine the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemonick&quot;&gt;Lemonick, Michael D.,[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1106324,00.html &quot;A Teen Twist on Sex&quot;], ''Time'', New York, September 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preserving virginity===
Among heterosexuals in particular, oral sex is often regarded as &quot;[[baseball metaphor|third base]]&quot; and is usually viewed as preserving male or female [[virginity]], due to its non-[[Reproduction|procreative]] nature. This is especially exercised in the case of female virginity, as oral sex (which can be penetrative or [[Non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]]) may leave the [[hymen]] intact. Among sexually active heterosexuals, the concept of &quot;[[technical virgin]]ity&quot;, which includes oral sex, [[anal sex]], [[mutual masturbation]] and other non-penetrative acts, is conceived as resting solely on penile-vaginal penetration.&lt;ref name=www.usatoday.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Friedman |first=Mindy |title=Sex on Tuesday: Virginity: A Fluid Issue |work=The Daily Californian |date=September 20, 2005 |url=http://www.dailycal.org/sharticle.php?id=19565 |accessdate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Uecker |title=Going Most of the Way: &quot;Technical Virginity&quot; among Young Americans |url=http://paa2007.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=70881 |accessdate=April 30, 2007|author-separator=,|author2=Jeremy E.|display-authors=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOOKS.GOogle.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Frederic C.

==Health risks and other studies==
===STDs===
[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[gonorrhea]], [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes]], [[hepatitis]] (multiple strains), and other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs)—including [[:HIV]]—can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhs.uga.edu/sexualhealth/oral_sex.html#safe University Health Center | Sexual Health | Oral Sex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact risk of transmitting HIV through oral sex is unknown, it is generally thought to be lower than other sex practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Campo J, Perea MA, del Romero J, Cano J, Hernando V, Bascones A |title=Oral transmission of HIV, reality or fiction? An update |journal=Oral Dis |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=219–228 |year=2006 |pmid=16700731 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-0825.2005.01187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risks from most of these types of infections are generally considered far less than those associated with [[vaginal sex|vaginal]] or [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;testing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Health&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulbright&quot;/&gt;

If the receiving partner has wounds or open sores on their genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in their mouth, or bleeding gums, this poses an increased risk of STD transmission. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, or eating crunchy foods such as chips relatively soon before or after giving oral sex can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are [[microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in, around, and secreted from the genital regions.

=== HPV and oral cancer ===
Links have been reported between oral cancer and oral sex with HPV-infected people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.oralcancerfoundation.org/hpv/index.htm | title=The HPV Connection - The human papilloma virus related to Oral Cancer| work=| author= | date=2011- | accessdate=2011- }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a research study at the College of [[Malmö]] in Sweden suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with [[HPV]] might increase the risk of [[oral cancer]]. The study found that 36 percent of the [[cancer patient]]s had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medindia.net/news/view_news_main.asp?x=5822 &quot;Oral Sex Linked To Mouth Cancer Risk&quot;], ''MedIndia'', November 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent study suggests a [[correlation]] between oral sex and [[head and neck cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The'' [[New England Journal of Medicine]] ''study concluded that people who had one to five oral-sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral-sex partners had a 250% increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Souza G |title=Case-control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer |journal=N.

===Miscarriage reduction===
Oral sex is correlated with reducing the risk of [[miscarriage]]s by inducing [[immunological tolerance]] to the proteins in sperm, a process known as [[paternal tolerance]]. While any exposure to a partner's semen during sexual activity appears to decrease a woman's chances for the various immunological disorders that can occur during pregnancy, [[immunological tolerance]] could be most quickly established through oral introduction and gastrointestinal absorption of semen.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10706945&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koelman CA, Coumans AB, Nijman HW, Doxiadis II, Dekker GA, Claas FH |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of preeclampsia: a role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10706945 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite news | last=Fox | first=Douglas | title=Gentle Persuasion | publisher=The New Scientist | date=February 9, 2002 | accessdate=June 17, 2007 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323294.200-gentle-persuasion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognizing that some of the studies potentially included the presence of confounding factors, such as the possibility that women who regularly perform oral sex and swallow semen also engage in more frequent intercourse, the researchers also noted that, either way, &quot;the data still overwhelmingly supports the main theory&quot; behind all their studies—that repeated exposure to semen establishes the maternal [[immunological tolerance]] necessary for a safe and successful pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewScientist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP |title=Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=253–265 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12896827 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural attitudes==
[[File:Fellatio.png|thumb|right||275px|[[Fellatio]] in [[69 sex position|69 position]]]]
{{See also|Cunnilingus|Fellatio}}

Cultural attitudes towards oral sex range from disgust to reverence. It has been considered [[taboo]], or at least frowned upon, in many cultures and parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html &quot;The History of Fellatio&quot;], ''Salon.com'', May 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome]], fellatio was considered profoundly taboo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrumation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/prp105.htm |title=Irrumation |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual acts were generally seen through the prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two [[Latin]] words for the act: ''irrumare'' (to penetrate orally), and ''fellare'' (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it was considered to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, [[anal sex]] – known practitioners were supposed to have [[Halitosis|foul breath]] and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrumation&quot;/&gt; In contrast, in Chinese [[Taoism]], cunnilingus is revered as a spiritually fulfilling practice that is believed to enhance [[longevity]].&lt;ref&gt;Octavio Paz (1969) ''Conjunctions and Disjunctions''; trans. Helen R. Lane. London: Wildwood House; p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; There is some anthropological evidence for cunnilingus as a widespread activity amongst [[Indigenous Australians|Australian aboriginals]].&lt;ref&gt;Schidloff, B. (1935) &quot;The Sexual Life of South Sea Natives&quot;; in: R. Burton, ed. ''Venus Oceanica''. New York: Oceanica Research Press; pp. 33–318; quoting p. 289&quot;Cunnilingus is very wide-spread among all primitive peoples and from Kubary's reports on the Sonsolans, it can be seen that even the children are already prepared for this&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Western culture]], oral sex is widely practiced among adolescents&lt;ref name=&quot;lemonick&quot;/&gt; and adults. 

People give various reasons for their dislike of oral sex. Some say that since it does not lead to procreation, it is therefore unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buschmiller|first=Rev. Robert|title=Oral Sex in Marriage|url=http://www.presentationministries.com/brochures/OralSex.asp|publisher=Presentation Ministries|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe that it is a humiliating or unclean practice (an opinion that is, at least in some cases, connected with the symbolism attached to different parts of the body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2804438|last=Pina-Cabral|first=Joao de|title=Tamed Violence: Genital Symbolism is Portuguese popular culture|journal=Man|year=1992|volume=28|issue=1|series=N.S|pages=101–120|jstor=2804438}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been more or less the case in Christian and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n cultures and other modern religions.

While commonly believed that all [[women who have sex with women]] engage in oral sex, some dislike it due to not liking the experience or due to psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy|last=Belge|title=Do All Lesbians Like Oral Sex?|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=|accessdate=June 3, 2012|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/f/DoAllLesbiansLikeOral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi B.

===Terminology and slang===
There are many words describing oral sex, including [[euphemism]]s and [[Sexual slang|slang]]. Like all aspects of sexuality, there exists a very large number of variations on a theme, a few common ones are given here:

*Giving head – A common slang term for giving oral sex to either a man or woman is &quot;giving head&quot;, from the term &quot;head job&quot; (in contrast to &quot;[[hand job]]&quot;, [[manual stimulation]]). A play on the slang term &quot;head&quot; resulted in the slang term &quot;brains&quot;, or &quot;brain salad surgery&quot;, &quot;domes&quot; or &quot;getting domes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dome&quot;&gt;[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dome Urban Dictionary: Dome] – Many examples of the word &quot;dome&quot; being used to refer to oral sex&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plate – A once common [[British English|British]] [[rhyming slang]] for &quot;fellate&quot; that arose in the gay slang language of [[Polari]] that spread in the 1960s. The term is less common today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ Polari]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}
*Cunnilingus is also sometimes referred to as &quot;muff diving&quot;, &quot;eating out&quot; or &quot;poon-job&quot;, a slang term and a cunnilingus variant of &quot;[[blow job]]&quot;, where &quot;poon&quot; is short for [[Sexual slang|poontang]] or [[Sexual slang|punani]].
*Additionally, in lesbian culture several common slang terms used are &quot;carpet munching&quot;, &quot;giving lip&quot;, &quot;lip service&quot; or &quot;[[Tipping the Velvet|tipping the velvet]]&quot; (a faux-&quot;Victorian&quot; expression invented by novelist [[Sarah Waters]]).

Other slang terms for oral sex include &quot;going down on&quot; (female and male), &quot;licking out&quot; and &quot;muff diving&quot; (female), &quot;blow job&quot; (male), &quot;dome&quot; (female and male),&lt;ref name=dome /&gt;, &quot;sucking off&quot; (male) &quot;playing the skin flute&quot; (male recipient), &quot;rolling cigars&quot; (male recipient), &quot;lolly-gagging&quot; (gay male-on-male), &quot;gaining knowledge&quot; (male recipient) and &quot;bust down&quot; (male). Forced fellatio is often called &quot;Egyptian Rape&quot; or simply &quot;Egyptian&quot;. This goes back to the time of the [[Crusades]] when [[Mamluk]]s were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E. L. ''The cradle of erotica'', New York: Julian Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;
