'''Zoophilia''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ζῷον (''zṓion'', &quot;animal&quot;) and φιλία (''philia'', &quot;friendship&quot; or &quot;love&quot;) is the practice of [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]] between humans and non-human animals ('''bestiality'''), or a preference for or fixation on such practice. People who practice zoophilia are known as '''zoophiles''',&lt;ref name=EB&gt;&quot;Zoophilia,&quot; ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2009; Retrieved 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; '''zoosexuals''', or simply '''&quot;zoos&quot;'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbookth&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=G_MwT9OHj4AC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=zoophilia#v=onepage&amp;q=zoophilia&amp;f=false | title = The International Handbook of Animal Abuse and Cruelty: Theory, Research, and Application | isbn = 978-1-55753-565-8 | author1 = Ascione | first1 = Frank | date = 28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoophilia may also be known as '''zoosexuality'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbookth&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=G_MwT9OHj4AC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=zoophilia#v=onepage&amp;q=zoophilia&amp;f=false | title = The International Handbook of Animal Abuse and Cruelty: Theory, Research, and Application | isbn = 978-1-55753-565-8 | author1 = Ascione | first1 = Frank | date = 28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Zoophilia is a [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;{{cite book |author= |title= [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]: DSM-IV | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Milner2008&gt;{{cite book | editor = Laws DR &amp; O'Donohue WT | last = Milner | first = JS | coauthors = Dopke CA | title = Sexual Deviance, Second Edition: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment | publisher = [[The Guilford Press]] | location = New York | year = 2008 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=yIXG9FuqbaIC&amp;pg=PA385 384–418] |isbn=1-59385-605-9 |oclc= |doi=| chapter = Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified: Psychopathology and theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Lovemaps&gt;{{cite book |author=Money, John |title=Lovemaps: Clinical Concepts of Sexual/Erotic Health and Pathology, Paraphilia, and Gender Transposition in Childhood, Adolescence, and Maturity |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |location=Buffalo, N.Y |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=0-87975-456-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Seto2000&gt;{{cite book |editor = Hersen M; Van Hasselt VB | title = Aggression and violence: an introductory text |publisher= [[Allyn &amp; Bacon]] |location=Boston |year=2000 |pages= 198–213 |isbn=0-205-26721-1 |oclc= |doi=| last = Seto| first = MC| coauthors = Barbaree HE | chapter = Paraphilias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sex with animals is not outlawed in some countries, it is not explicitly condoned anywhere. In most countries, bestiality is illegal under [[cruelty to animals|animal abuse]] laws or laws dealing with [[crime against nature|crimes against nature]].

== Terminology ==
There are three terms that are most commonly used in regards to the subject: zoophilia, bestiality, and zoosexuality. The terms are usually relatively interchangeable. [[Zoosadism]], [[sodomy]], zooerasty and zooerastia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=zooerastia definition|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zooerastia|work=Medical dictionary|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are other terms closely related to the subject but are less synonymous with the former terms and/or are not commonly used. &quot;Bestiosexuality&quot; was discussed briefly by Allen (1979), but never became established.

The term &quot;zoophilia&quot; was introduced into the field of research on sexuality in ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' (1886) by [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]], who described a number of cases of &quot;violation of animals (bestiality)&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as &quot;zoophilia erotica&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defined as a sexual attraction to animal skin or fur.

''Zoophilia'' can refer to sexual activity with non-human animals (bestiality), the desire to do so, or to the [[paraphilia]] (atypical arousal) of the same name which indicates a definite preference for animals over humans as sexual partners.

Some zoophiles and researchers draw a distinction between zoophilia and bestiality, using the former to describe the desire to form sexual relationships with animals, and the latter to describe the sex acts alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/glossary/g/zoophilia.htm |title=Sexuality.about.com |publisher=Sexuality.about.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bestiality is frequently misspelled as &quot;beastiality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common misspellings of bestiality|url=http://www.how-do-you-spell.com/beastiality|publisher=How do you spell?|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when spelled &quot;bestiality&quot;, the word has two common pronunciations, (/ˌbestʃiˈæləti/ or /ˌbistʃiˈæləti/), with the first syllable sounding either like &quot;best&quot; or &quot;beast&quot;, The latter is more frequently used in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of  bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/american/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Masters (1962) uses the term &quot;bestialist&quot; specifically in his discussion of zoosadism, which refers to deriving sexual pleasure from cruelty to animals. Stephanie LaFarge, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New Jersey Medical School, and Director of Counseling at the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]], writes that two groups can be distinguished: bestialists, who rape or abuse animals, and zoophiles, who form an emotional and sexual attachment to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All Opposed, Say Neigh |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/1999-12-15/news/all-opposed-say-neigh/ |author=Melinda Roth |work=Riverfront Times |date=15 December 1991 |accessdate=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin J. Williams]] and [[Martin Weinberg]] studied self-defined zoophiles via the internet and found they saw the term as involving concern for the animal's welfare and pleasure, and an emphasis on believing they obtained consent, as opposed to the zoophile's concept of bestialists, who zoophiles defined as a group who focused only on their own gratification.  Williams and Weinberg also quoted a British newspaper as saying that zoophilia is the term used by &quot;apologists&quot; of bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams CJ, Weinberg MS |title=Zoophilia in men: a study of sexual interest in animals |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=523–35 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14574096 |doi=10.1023/A:1026085410617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoosexuality===

The term &quot;zoosexual&quot; was cited by the researcher Miletski in the year 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbookth&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=G_MwT9OHj4AC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=zoophilia#v=onepage&amp;q=zoophilia&amp;f=false | title = The International Handbook of Animal Abuse and Cruelty: Theory, Research, and Application | isbn = 978-1-55753-565-8 | author1 = Ascione | first1 = Frank | date = 28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as a value-neutral term which would be less susceptible to being loaded with emotion or rhetoric. Usage of the noun &quot;zoosexual&quot; can be applied to both a &quot;zoosexual (person)&quot; which is synonymous with zoophile, and a &quot;zoosexual act&quot;, meaning a sex act between a human and an animal. The term &quot;zoosexuality&quot; is often used by zoophile forums and support groups, which manifests as a person being romantically and/or sexually attracted to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is zoosexuality|url=http://zoosexuality.org/?id=1|work=Information on Zoosexuality|publisher=zoosexuality.org|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbookth&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=G_MwT9OHj4AC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=zoophilia#v=onepage&amp;q=zoophilia&amp;f=false | title = The International Handbook of Animal Abuse and Cruelty: Theory, Research, and Application | isbn = 978-1-55753-565-8 | author1 = Ascione | first1 = Frank | date = 28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Zoosadism and zooerasty===
[[Ernest Bornemann]] (1990, cited by Rosenbauer 1997) coined the separate term &quot;zoosadism&quot; for those who derive pleasure from inflicting pain on an animal, sometimes with a sexual component.  Some [[horse-ripping]] incidents may have a sexual connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schedel-Stupperich A |title=[Criminal acts against horses—phenomenology and psychosocial construct] |language=German |journal=DTW |volume=109 |issue=3 |pages=116–9 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11963360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krafft-Ebing, the same author who introduced the term zoophilia, used the term &quot;zooerasty&quot; for the paraphilia of exclusive sexual attraction to animals,&lt;ref name=&quot;deviance 391&quot;&gt;D. Richard Laws and William T. O'Donohue: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yIXG9FuqbaIC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;dq=zoophilia+paraphilia Books.Google.co.uk], Sexual Deviance, page 391. [[Guilford Press]], 2008. ISBN 978-1-59385-605-2.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term has fallen out of use.

==Extent of occurrence==
The [[Kinsey report]]s rated the percentage of people who had sexual interaction with animals at some point in their lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40–50% in people living near farms,&lt;ref name=&quot;deviance 391&quot; /&gt; but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportional amount of prisoners, causing [[sampling bias]]. [[Martin Duberman]] has written that it is difficult to get a random sample in sexual research, and that even when [[Paul Gebhard]], Kinsey's research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duberman: [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html KinseyInstitute.org], Kinsey's Urethra ''The Nation,'' 3 November 1997, pp. 40–43. Review of ''Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life.'' By James H. Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, the farm population in the USA had declined by 80 percent compared to 1940, reducing the opportunity to live with animals; Hunt's 1974 study suggests that these demographic changes led to a significant change in reported occurrences of bestiality. The percentage of males who reported sexual interactions with animals in 1974 was 4.9% (1948: 8.3%), and in females in 1974 was 1.9% (1953: 3.6%). Miletski believes this is not due to a reduction in interest but merely a reduction in opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1974, cited and re-examined by Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Friday]]'s 1973 book on [[female sexuality]], ''[[My Secret Garden]]'', comprised around 190 fantasies from different women; of these, 23 involve zoophilic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Friday: [[My Secret Garden]], Pocket Books. Revised edition 1998. ISBN 978-0-671-01987-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, psychiatric patients were found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and sexual fantasy (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent).&lt;ref name=&quot;psych&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alvarez WA, Freinhar JP |title=A prevalence study of bestiality (zoophilia) in psychiatric in-patients, medical in-patients, and psychiatric staff |journal=International Journal of Psychosomatics |volume=38 |issue=1–4 |pages=45–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1778686}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crépault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crépault C, Couture M |title=Men's erotic fantasies |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |year=1980 |month=December |pmid=7458662 |doi=10.1007/BF01542159}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1982 study suggested that 7.5 percent of 186 university students had interacted sexually with an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Story MD |title=A comparison of university student experience with various sexual outlets in 1974 and 1980 |journal=Adolescence |volume=17 |issue=68 |pages=737–47 |year=1982 |pmid=7164870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex.  A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals [[mating|mate]] is cited as an indicator of latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality.&lt;ref name=&quot;watching&quot;&gt;R.E.L. Masters: ''Forbidden Sexual behavior and Morality.'' New York, NY 1962, Lancer Books, Inc. (Section &quot;Psychical bestiality&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Where in the book does it say that? I couldn't find that anywhere in the book, and I also dispute the credibility of that book --&gt;

Several studies have found that women show stronger vaginal responses to films depicting [[bonobo]] copulation than to non-sexual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chivers ML, Seto MC, Blanchard R |title=Gender and sexual orientation differences in sexual response to sexual activities versus gender of actors in sexual films |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=1108–21 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18072857 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.1108 |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/files/pubs/Chivers_Seto_Blanchard_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chivers ML, Bailey JM |title=A sex difference in features that elicit genital response |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=115–20 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16168255 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophiles have been described as &quot;occupying [many] different demographic categories: white, black, Asian, Mormon, Amish, Catholic, atheist, pagan, Jewish, male and female.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Francis |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/3/ |title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement – Page 3 – News – Broward/Palm Beach – New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people who &quot;grew up in the country around animals were no more likely to become zoophiles than those who grew up in the city without them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;palm4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Francis |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/4/ |title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement – Page 4 – News – Broward/Palm Beach – New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives on zoophilia==
[[File:Franz von Bayros 020.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Art by [[Franz von Bayros]] depicting [[oral sex]] between a woman and a [[deer]]]]

=== Psychological, psychiatric, and research perspectives ===
Zoophilia has been partly discussed by several sciences: [[Psychology]] (the study of the human [[mind]]), [[sexology]] (a relatively new discipline primarily studying [[human sexuality]]), [[ethology]] (the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]]), and [[anthrozoology]] (the study of human-animal interactions and bonds).

The nature of animal minds, animal [[mental process]]es and structures, and animal [[self-awareness]], [[perception]], [[emotion in animals]], and &quot;map of the world&quot;, are studied within [[animal cognition]] and also explored within various specialized branches of [[neuroscience]] such as [[neuroethology]].

Zoophilia is placed in the classification &quot;[[paraphilia]]s not otherwise specified.&quot; in the DSM-III and IV.  The [[World Health Organization]] takes the same position, listing a sexual preference for animals in its [[ICD]] [[ICD-10|-10]] as &quot;other disorder of sexual preference&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10, F65.8 Other disorders of sexual preference |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DSM-IV|DSM-IV (TR)]] (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]) recommends that the individual does not receive treatment of zoophilia, as with most other paraphilias, unless it is accompanied by distress or interference with normal functioning on the part of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Miletski, H. &quot;Zoophilia – Implications for Therapy,&quot; ''JSET'', 26, 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophilia may also be covered to some degree by other fields such as ethics, philosophy, law, [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]]. It may also be touched upon by [[sociology]] which looks both at zoosadism in examining patterns and issues related to [[sexual abuse]] and at non-sexual zoophilia in examining the role of animals as emotional support and companionship in human lives, and may fall within  the scope of [[psychiatry]] if it becomes necessary to consider its significance in a clinical context.
The Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine (Vol. 18, February 2011) states that sexual contact with animals is almost never a clinically significant problem by itself;&lt;ref name=&quot;scidirectpii&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X11000102 |title=Sciencedirect.com |publisher=Sciencedirect.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also states that there are several kinds of zoophiles:&lt;ref name=&quot;scidirectpii&quot;/&gt;

{| valign=&quot;top&quot;
|-
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human-animal role-players&lt;li&gt;Romantic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Zoophilic fantasizers&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tactile zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Fetishistic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Sadistic bestials&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opportunistic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Regular zoophlies&lt;li&gt;Exclusive zoophiles&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|}

Additionally, zoophiles in categories 2, 3, and 8 (romantic zoophiles, zoophilic fantisizers, and regular zoophiles) are the most common, while zoophiles found in categories 6 and 7 (sadistic bestials and opportunistic zoophiles) are the least common.&lt;ref name=&quot;scidirectpii&quot;/&gt;

Zoophilia may reflect childhood experimentation, sexual abuse or lack of other avenues of sexual expression.  Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yIXG9FuqbaIC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;dq=zoophilia+rare&amp;lr= Books.Google.co.uk] Sexual Deviance, page 391&lt;/ref&gt; with which they present. Zoophiles will not usually seek help for their condition, and so do not come to the attention of psychiatrists for zoophilia itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t7Mg3iuc9ygC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=zoophilia+other+paraphilias&amp;lr= Books.Google.co.uk] What Every Patient, Family, Friend, and Caregiver Needs to Know about Psychiatry page 133&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first detailed studies of zoophilia date from prior to 1910.  Peer reviewed research into zoophilia in its own right started around 1960. However, a number of the most oft-quoted studies, such as Miletski, were not published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journals. There have been several significant modern books, from Masters (1962) to Beetz (2002);&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetz2002&quot;&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7&lt;/ref&gt; their research arrived at the following conclusions:

:*Most zoophiles have (or have also had) long term human relationships as well or at the same time as zoosexual ones, and that zoosexual partners are usually dogs and/or horses (Masters, Miletski, Beetz)&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetz2002&quot;&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=zoophilia+most+common+animal&amp;lr=#PPA258 |title=Forensic And Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes And Unusual Sexual Practices – Anil Aggrawal |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Zoophiles' emotions and care for animals can be real, relational, authentic and (within animals' abilities) reciprocal, and not just a substitute or means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;(Masters, Miletski, Weinberg, Beetz)&lt;/ref&gt; Beetz believes zoophilia is not an inclination which is chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetz2002&quot;&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Society in general at present is considerably misinformed about zoophilia, its stereotypes, and its meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetz2002&quot;&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between zoophilia and zoosadism is a critical one to these researchers, and is highlighted by each of these studies. Masters (1962), Miletski (1999) and Weinberg (2003) each comment significantly on the social harm caused by misunderstandings regarding zoophilia: &quot;This destroy[s] the lives of many citizens&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetz2002&quot;&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetz also states the following:

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&quot;The phenomenon of sexual contact with animals is starting to lose its taboo: it is appearing more often in scholarly publications, and the public are being confronted with it, too.[...] Sexual contact with animals – in the form of bestiality or zoophilia – needs to be discussed more openly and investigated in more detail by scholars working in disciplines such as animal ethics, animal behavior, anthrozoology, psychology, mental health, sociology, and the law.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeetzPodberseck&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;lpg=PT91&amp;ots=gnVddgmO5P&amp;dq=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;pg=PT94#v=onepage&amp;q=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;f=false |title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals – Google Boeken |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt; 

More recently, research has engaged three further directions – the speculation that at least some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] is not present, and can form an affectionate bond.&lt;ref&gt;Masters, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as [[consent]] beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure.  But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Balcombe |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/may/29/animalbehaviour.evolution |title=Guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=13 May 2012 |location=London |date=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetz described the phenomenon of zoophilia/bestiality as being somewhere between crime, paraphilia and love, although she says that most research has been based on [[criminology|criminological]] reports, so the cases have frequently involved violence and psychiatric illness. She says only a few recent studies have taken data from volunteers in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk/profile.asp?guid=fac3acab-5377-4f9a-a9f0-007248ee2e43 Scie-SocialCareOnline.org.uk] Bestiality/Zoophilia: A Scarcely-Investigated Phenomenon Between Crime, Paraphilia, and Love&lt;/ref&gt;  As with all volunteer surveys and sexual ones in particular, these studies have a potential for [[self-selection]] bias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Opv9nz2M5c0C&amp;pg=PA980&amp;dq=%22volunteer+selection%22+sex&amp;client=firefox-a Books.Google.co.uk] Pornography and Sexual Representation, p.980&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical research suggests that some zoophiles only become aroused by a specific species (such as horses), some zoophiles become aroused by multiple species (which may or may not include humans), and some zoophiles are not attracted to humans at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher M.

===Religious perspectives===
[[File:Leda.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leda and the Swan]].]]

Passages in [[Leviticus 18]] (Lev 18:23: &quot;And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is a perversion.&quot; RSV) and 20:15–16 (&quot;If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.&quot; RSV) are cited by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologians as categorical denunciation of bestiality. However, the teachings of the [[New Testament]] has been interpreted by some as not expressly forbidding bestiality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plummer&quot;&gt;http://www.reclaimingthemind.org/papers/ets/2001/Plummer/Plummer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part II of his [[Summa Theologica]], medieval philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] ranked various &quot;unnatural vices&quot; (sex acts resulting in &quot;venereal pleasure&quot; rather than procreation) by degrees of sinfulness, concluding that &quot;the most grievous is the sin of bestiality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aquinas-homo.html Fordham.edu] Aquinas on Unnatural Sex&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christian theologians extend [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s view that  [[Antithesis of the Law#Adultery|even having thoughts of adultery is sinful]] to imply that thoughts of committing bestial acts are likewise sinful.

[[File:Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Man having intercourse with a horse, pictured on the exterior of a temple in [[Khajuraho]].]]

There are a few references in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures to religious figures engaging in symbolic sexual activity with animals such as explicit depictions of people having sex with animals included amongst the thousands of sculptures of &quot;Life events&quot; on the exterior of the [[Hindu temple|temple complex]] at [[Khajuraho]]. The depictions are largely symbolic depictions of the sexualization of some animals and are not meant to be taken literally.&lt;ref&gt;The Critical and Cultural Study of the Shatapatha Brahmana by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hindu tradition, having sex with a [[cattle in religion|sacred cow]] is believed to bring good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;lpg=PT12&amp;ots=gnXbeiiQZR&amp;pg=PT12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Retrieved 10 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Hindu scriptures like the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and the ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'' having sex with animals, especially the cow, leads one to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Hell]], where the person is tormented by rubbing their bodies on trees with razor-sharp thorns.&lt;ref name = &quot;mani&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 0-8426-0822-2|pages = 368–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Historical and cultural perspectives on zoophilia}}
The phenomenon of sexual intercourse with animals is not new. Instances of this behavior have been found in the Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;aggrawal_2009_16_3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aggrawal A |title=References to the paraphilias and sexual crimes in the Bible |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=109–14 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19239958 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian [[Val Camonica]] a man is shown about to penetrate an animal.  Raymond Christinger interprets that as a show of power of a tribal chief,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeometry.org/sxx.htm Archaeometry.org], Link to web page and photograph, archaeometry.org&lt;/ref&gt; and so we do not know if this practice was then more acceptable, and if the scene depicted was usual or unusual or whether it was symbolic or imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WzxmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Coren+del+Valento+animal&amp;dq=Coren+del+Valento+animal&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1 Bookds.google.co.uk] Worshippers and Warriors&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art says the scene may be humorous, as the penetrating man seems to be waving cheerfully with his hand at the same time.  Potters seem to have spent time depicting the practice, but this may be because they found the idea amusing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xwm_D1u_UTsC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22prehistoric+art%22+bestiality&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Books.Google.co.uk], The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr &quot;Jacobus X&quot;, said to be a [[nom-de-plume]] for a French author, said this was clearly &quot;before any known taboos against sex with animals existed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abuses Aberrations and Crimes of the Genital Sense, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;  Marc Epprecht states that authors such as Jacobus X do not deserve respect because their methodology is based on hearsay, and was designed for voyeuristic titilation of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dJdErRqoBeQC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22Jacobus+X%22+taboos&amp;client=firefox-a Books.Google.co.uk] &quot;Bisexuality&quot; and the politics of normal in African Ethnography, Anthropologica, Canadian Anthropology Society, Vol.48 No.2 2006 p.193&lt;/ref&gt;  Masters said that since pre-historic man is [[prehistoric]] it goes without saying that we know little of his sexual behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Forbidden Sexual Behavior and Morality, Masters, Robert E. L., p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; depictions in cave paintings may only show the artist's subjective preoccupations or thoughts.

Masters feels that in antiquity bestiality was widespread, and believed it was often incorporated into religious ritual.  He believes it to have taken place in ancient Egypt, claiming that the zoomorphic forms of Ancient Egyptian gods ensures that bestiality would have been part of their rites.&lt;ref&gt;Masters, &quot;Prehistory of bestiality&quot;, part of his 1962 paper, 1966 edition, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no evidence that the presence of gods with zoomorphic attributes ensures this in itself.  However, Pindar, Herodotus, and Plutarch claimed the Egyptians engaged in ritual congress with goats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y5HFtMkmFMYC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=bestiality+%22ancient+egypt%22+religious Books.Google.co.uk], Human Sexuality, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;  Such claims about other cultures do not necessarily reflect anything about which the author had evidence, but be a form of propaganda or [[xenophobia]], similar to [[blood libel]].

Bestiality was accepted in some cultures indigenously, such as North America and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noram&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7SXhBdqejgYC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;dq=bestiality+indigenous+gender&amp;lr= Books.Google.co.uk], Encyclopedia of Women and Gender, p.298&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual intercourse between humans and non-human animals was common among Native American tribes such as the [[Hopi|Hopi Indians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Voget61&quot;&gt;Voget, F. W. (1961) Sex life of the American Indians, in Ellis, A. &amp; Abarbanel, A. (Eds.) The Encyclopaedia of Sexual Behavior, Volume 1. London: W. Heinemann, p90-109&lt;/ref&gt; Voget describes the sexual lives of young Native Americans as &quot;rather inclusive,&quot; including bestiality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voget61&quot;&gt;Voget, F. W. (1961) Sex life of the American Indians, in Ellis, A. &amp; Abarbanel, A. (Eds.) The Encyclopaedia of Sexual Behavior, Volume 1. London: W. Heinemann, p90-109&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Copper Inuit]] people had &quot;no aversion to intercourse with live animals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voget61&quot;&gt;Voget, F. W. (1961) Sex life of the American Indians, in Ellis, A. &amp; Abarbanel, A. (Eds.) The Encyclopaedia of Sexual Behavior, Volume 1. London: W. Heinemann, p90-109&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cultures built temples ([[Khajuraho]], India) or other structures ([[Sagaholm]], [[tumulus|barrow]], Sweden) with zoophilic carvings on the exterior, however at [[Khajuraho]] these depictions are not on the interior, perhaps depicting that these are things that belong to the profane world rather than the spiritual world, and thus are to be left outside.

In the West, the most explicit records of sex involving humans and animals activity are associated with reports of the murderous sadism, [[torture]] and rape of the [[Colosseum#Games|Roman games]] and [[Circus Maximus|circus]], in which some authors estimate that several hundreds of thousands died.  Masters believes beasts were specially trained to copulate with women: if the girls or women were unwilling then the animal would attempt rape. A surprising range of creatures was used for such purposes, and taught how to copulate vaginally or anally.  Representations of scenes from the sexual lives of the gods, such as [[Pasiphaë|Pasiphaë and the Bull]], were highly popular, often causing extreme suffering, injury or death. On occasion, the more ferocious beasts were permitted to kill and (if desired) devour their victims afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;R.E.L. Masters, &quot;The Prostitute In Society&quot;, Mayflower Books&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Church-oriented culture of the [[Middle Ages]] zoophilic activity was met with execution, typically burning, and death to the animals involved either the same way or by hanging, as &quot;both a violation of [[Religion and sexuality|Biblical edicts]] and a degradation of man as a spiritual being rather than one that is purely animal and carnal.&lt;ref&gt;Masters (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Some witches were accused of having congress with the devil in the form of an animal.  As with all accusations and confessions extracted under torture in the [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], their validity cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y5HFtMkmFMYC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=bestiality+%22ancient+egypt%22+religious Books.Google.co.uk], Human Sexuality, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==
{{Sex and the Law}}
{{Main|Zoophilia and the law}}
In many jurisdictions, all forms of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without specific mention of sexual activity. In the UK, [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive).&lt;ref name=opsisect63&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb1-l1g63|work=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|title=Section 63 – Possession of extreme pornographic images|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries such as Belgium, Germany, and Russia are somewhere in between: they permit sexual activity with animals, but prohibit the promotion of animal-oriented pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stgb/__184a.html Bundesrecht.Juris.de], § 184a Verbreitung gewalt- oder tierpornographischer Schriften Distribution of violent or animal pornographic publications in ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws on zoophilia are often triggered by specific incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Fischer: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080515222156/http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/122006 AZstarnet.com], Lawmakers hope to outlaw bestiality
''Arizona Daily Star,'' 28 March 2006. In Arizona, the motive for legislation was a &quot;spate of recent cases.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While some laws are very specific, others employ vague terms such as &quot;[[sodomy]]&quot; or &quot;bestiality,&quot; which lack legal precision and leave it unclear exactly which acts are covered. In the past, some bestiality laws may have been made in the belief that sex with an animal could result in monstrous offspring, as well as offending the community.  Current anti-cruelty laws focus more specifically on animal welfare while anti-bestiality laws are aimed only at offenses to community &quot;standards&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;posner&quot;&gt;Posner, Richard, A Guide to America's Sex Laws, The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1996. ISBN 978-0-226-67564-0. Page 207&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 report by the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the government expressed concern over the increase in reports of [[horse-ripping]] incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate to call for a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |title=TheLocal.se |publisher=TheLocal.se |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it. Under Section 143 of the Crimes Act 1961, individuals can serve a sentence of seven years duration for animal sexual abuse and the offence is considered 'complete' in the event of 'penetration' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-112105423.html HighBeam.com] NSW: New Zealand man charged with bestiality and animal cruelty&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329260.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, having sex with animals is illegal in 37 U.S. states. Most of the individual anti-zoosexual state laws were created recently (between 1999 and 2012).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animallaw.info&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2005, there was a farm near [[Enumclaw, Washington]] that was described as an “animal brothel”, where people paid to have sex with animals.

=== Pornography ===

{{Main|Obscenity|Pornography|Legal status of Internet pornography}}
Pornography involving sex with animals is widely illegal, even in most countries where the act itself is not explicitly outlawed. 

In the [[United States]], zoophilic pornography would be considered [[obscene]] if it did not meet the standards of the [[Miller Test]] and therefore is not openly sold, mailed, distributed or imported across state boundaries or within states which prohibit it. Under U.S. law, 'distribution' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appear to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are {{As of|2005|lc=on}} in some doubt, having been ruled [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in ''[[United States v. Extreme Associates]]'' (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005). 

Similar restrictions apply in Germany (see [[Zoophilia#Legal status|above]]). In [[New Zealand]] the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.

The potential use of media for [[pornographic movie]]s was seen from the start of the era of [[silent film]]. ''Polissons and Galipettes'' (re-released 2002 as &quot;[[The Good Old Naughty Days]]&quot;) is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 – 1930.

Material featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to their ease of production, and because production and sale is legal in countries such as [[Denmark]]. Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as [[Playboy]], so-called [[Tijuana Bible]]s were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;An example digitized Tijuana Bible entitled ''The Pet'' from the 1960s is linked at [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=0 tijuanabibles.org page link] (also see [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi/hzpi/u/HzSt031FT7pj.ctu7.2/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=1 full size] and [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=SEARCH&amp;SEARCH_SPEC=bestiality&amp;SUBMIT_ACTION_SEARCH=Search search]).&lt;/ref&gt;
The promotion of &quot;stars&quot; began with the Danish [[Bodil Joensen]], in the period of 1969–72, along with other porn actors such as the Americans [[Linda Lovelace]] (''Dogarama'', 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was &quot;[[Animal Farm (video)|Animal Farm]]&quot;, smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4sales.com/programming-and-schedules/channel4-schedules.aspx?date=19-04-2006 Channel14Sales.com]{{dead link|date=March 2011}} ''The Search for Animal Farm'' (documentary, part of the [[Dark Side of Porn]] series) (April 2006, Channel 4, UK)&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen's 1970s Danish movies.

Into the 1980s the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like &quot;Wilma&quot; and the &quot;Dutch Sisters&quot;. In 1980s, &quot;bestiality&quot; was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and [[Marina Hedman]], manifested early in the softcore flick ''Bestialità'' in 1976.

Today, in [[Hungary]], where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces numerous films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as ''Topscore'' and ''Book &amp; Film International'', and the [[genre]] has stars such as &quot;Hector&quot;, a [[Great Dane]] starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers.  For example, Suzy Spark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobabeindex.com/sbandoindex/suzyspark.html EuroBabeIndex.com], Suzy Spark&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Russian female models performing [[fellatio]] on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. [[Sakura Sakurada]] is an [[AV idol]] known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV ''The Dog Game'' in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, ''[[24 Horas de Sexo Explícito]]'' featured zoophilia.

In the UK [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see [[extreme pornography]]), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production.  The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2086306_acts_of_depravity_found_on_dads_computer ‘Acts of depravity’ found on dad’s computer], ''[[Reading Post]]'', 26 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography of this sort has become the business of certain [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] such as [[Jeremy Jaynes]] and owners of some fake [[Thumbnail gallery post|TGP]]s, who use the promise of &quot;extreme&quot; material as a bid for users' attention.

==Health and safety==
{{Main|Zoophilia and health}}
Infections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the [[semen]], vaginal fluids, [[urine]], [[saliva]], [[feces]] and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are [[Brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[leptospirosis]], and [[toxocariasis]]. Therefore sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. [[Allergy|Allergic reactions]] to animal semen may occur, including [[anaphylaxis]]. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.

==Zoophiles==
=== Non-sexual zoophilia ===
The love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature.  In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] the word &quot;zoophilia&quot; is sometimes used without sexual implications.  Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JQMRmyOfpJ8C&amp;pg=PT157&amp;dq=zoophilia+meaning&amp;lr= Books.Google.co.uk] The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science, page 1050&lt;/ref&gt; a [[paraphilia]].  Some zoophiles may not act on their sexual attraction to animals. People who identify as zoophiles may feel their love for animals is romantic rather than purely sexual, and say this makes them different from those committing entirely sexually motivated acts of bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZjqWw-9ZQfYC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=zoophilia+romantic Books.Google.co.uk] Law and Nature, page 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoophile community===

An online survey which recruited participants over the internet concluded that prior to the arrival of widespread computer [[computer network|networking]], most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to &quot;openly&quot; express their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997, cited by Miletski 1999 p.35&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other [[alternative lifestyle|alternate lifestyles]], broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in [[online community|networked social groups]] became more common at home and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg and Williams&quot;&gt;Weinberg and Williams&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together.&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The popular newsgroup [[alt.sex|alt.sex.bestiality]], said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), – and reputedly started in humor&lt;ref&gt;Miletski p.35&lt;/ref&gt; – along with personal [[bulletin board]]s and [[talker]]s, chief among them [[Sleepy's multiple worlds]], [[Lintilla (talker)|Lintilla]], and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind&lt;!-- Clarify: Of what kind? Of all internet groups? Or of zoophilia-related internet groups? --&gt; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and [[Internet Forum|internet forums]]. By around 1992–1994, the wide social net had evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This was initially centered around the above-mentioned [[newsgroup]], alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group.&lt;ref&gt;Milteski (1999), p.35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andriette, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events.&lt;ref&gt;Donofrio, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum &quot;beastforum.com&quot; has more than one million members as of March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |title=Beast Forum statistics |publisher=Big-boards.com |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastforum.com |title=The Worlds Largest Bestiality Board |publisher=BeastForum.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey’s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg and Williams&quot;/&gt;

There also exist websites which aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized. Such work is often undertaken as needed by individuals and friends, within social networks, and by word of mouth. One notable early attempt at creating a zoophile support structure focused on social and psychological support was the newsgroup soc.support.zoophilia, which was proposed in 1994 but narrowly failed to meet the 2/3 majority needed to be created{{clarify|date=December 2011}}. There was also a German support group called &quot;Interessengemeinschaft Zoophiler Menschen (&quot;Zoophile Interest Group&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophiles tend to experience their first zoosexual feelings during adolescence, and tend to be secretive about it, hence limiting the ability for non-Internet communities to form:&lt;ref name=&quot;browplm2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Francis |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/2/ |title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement – Page 2 – News – Broward/Palm Beach – New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I was the only one who did this,' James says.

== Debate over zoophilia or zoophilic relations ==

Because of its controversial nature, people have developed arguments both for&lt;ref name=&quot;singer01&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Pablo Stafforini |url=http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |title=Heavy Petting, by Peter Singer |publisher=Utilitarian.net |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and against&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopbestiality.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/bestiality-and-lack-of-consent/ |title=Bestiality and Lack of Consent « StopBestiality |publisher=Stopbestiality.wordpress.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; zoophilia. Arguments for and against zoosexual activity from a variety of sources, including religious, moral, ethical, psychological, medical and social.

=== Arguments against zoophilia ===

[[Platonic love]] for animals is usually viewed positively, but some people express knee-jerk concern or disapproval of sexual interest in non-human animals, sometimes very strongly.  

Zoophilia is seen by the government of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK [[Home Office]] review on sexual offences in 2002)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf Archive2official-documents.co.uk] (section 79, p.33)&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Beetz states there is evidence that there can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8&quot;&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8&lt;/ref&gt; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be reciprocally pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8&quot;&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument from human dignity is given by Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow and [[Intelligent Design]] proponent at the [[Center for Science and Culture]] of the conservative Christian [[Discovery Institute]]: – &quot;such behavior is profoundly degrading and utterly subversive to the crucial understanding that human beings are unique, special, and of the highest moral worth in the known universe—a concept known as '[[human exceptionalism]]' ... one of the reasons bestiality is condemned through law is that such degrading conduct unacceptably subverts standards of basic human dignity and is an affront to humankind's inestimable importance and intrinsic moral worth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/2005/08/bestiality-and-varied-attacks-on-human.html Wesleyjsmith.com] and [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/985pgwjh.asp Weeklystandard.com], 31 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary critiques of zoophilia is that zoophilic activity is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.&lt;ref name=Regan63&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63–4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) has said that as animals don't have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. The HSUS takes the position that all sexual activity between humans and animals is abusive, whether it involves physical injury or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ Sex Abuse], NManimalControl.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1993 article, Dr. Frank Ascione stated that &quot;bestiality may be considered abusive even in cases when physical harm to an animal does not occur.&quot; In a 1997 article, Piers Beirne, Professor of Criminology at the University of Southern Maine, points out that 'for genuine consent to sexual relations to be present...both participants must be conscious, fully informed and positive in their desires.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |title=NmanimalControl.com |publisher=NmanimalControl.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ascione(1993) ''Children Who Are Cruel to Animals: A Review of Research and Implications for Developmental Psychology'', Anthrozoos, 6 (4): 226–247, also cited by Beetz (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of zoophilia argue that &quot;consent&quot; is irrelevant because human practices (such as hunting, laboratory testing, artificial insemination, and slaughtering animals for meat) do not involve the consent of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted on 28 February 2011 by Lucas Wachob |url=http://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/columnists/article_f08fbb0c-42ca-11e0-ab43-00127992bc8b.html |title=Column: In defense of chicken ‘lovers’ – The Breeze: Columnists |publisher=Breezejmu.org |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Cutteridge states the following regarding this argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Animal sexual autonomy is regularly violated for human financial gain through procedures such as [artificial insemination]. Such procedures are probably more disturbing physically and psychologically than acts of zoophilia would be, yet the issue of consent on the part of the animal is never raised in the discussion of such procedures. To confine the 'right' of any animal strictly to acts of zoophilia is thus to make a law [against zoophilia] based not on reason but on moral prejudice, and to breach the constitutional rights of zoophiles to due process and equality before the law. [...] Laws which criminalize zoophilia based on societal abhorrence of such acts rather than any real harm caused by such acts are an unjust and unconstitutional infringement on individual liberty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interdis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |title=Inter-disciplinary.net |format=PDF |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

[[Hani Miletski|Miletski]] believes that &quot;Animals are capable of sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miltski, 1999, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with (&quot;hump&quot;) the legs of people of both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Cauldwell, 1948 &amp; 1968; Queen, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes that as far as cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8&quot;/&gt;  Those supporting zoophilia feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 1971, and Greenwood, 1963, both cited in Miletski, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dekkers, 1994&quot;&gt;Dekkers, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and &quot;seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interdis&quot;/&gt; Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away.  An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it.  To those defending zoopilia this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.&lt;ref&gt;(Einsenhaim, 1971, cited in Katmandu, 2004)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preference utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] philosopher and [[Animal rights|animal liberation]] author [[Peter Singer]] argues that zoophilia is not unethical so long as it involves no harm or cruelty to the animal&lt;ref name=SingerNerve&gt;Singer, Peter. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080616055314/http://www.nerve.com/Opinions/Singer/heavyPetting/main.asp Heavy Petting], ''Nerve'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Harm principle]]'').

Singer and others have argued that people's dislike of bestiality is partly caused by irrational [[speciesism]] and [[anthropocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tadd Ruetenik |url=http://isle.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/2/317.short |title=Animal Liberation or Human Redemption: Racism and Speciesism in Toni Morrison's Beloved |publisher=Isle.oxfordjournals.org |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v076/76.boggs.html |title=Project MUSE – American Bestiality: Sex, Animals, and the Construction of Subjectivity |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date=21 March 2006 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because interspecies sex occurs in nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070314-hybrids.html |title=Interspecies Sex: Evolution's Hidden Secret? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because humans ''are'' animals,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/group/pwruab/cgi-bin/pwrofthepen/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/kerstin-grune1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; supporters argue that zoosexual activity is not &quot;unnatural&quot; and is not intrinsically wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639625.2010.538356 |title=Taylor &amp; Francis Online :: Screwing the Pooch: Legitimizing Accounts in a Zoophilia On-line Community – Deviant Behavior – Volume 32, Issue 10 |publisher=Tandfonline.com |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mroberts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1328310 |title=The Unjustified Prohibition against Bestiality: Why the Laws in Opposition Can Find No Support under the Harm Principle by Michael Roberts :: SSRN |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1328310 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophiles claim that they are not abusive towards animals:&lt;ref name=&quot;scientam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bering |first=Jesse |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/2010/03/24/animal-lovers-zoophiles-make-scientists-rethink-human-sexuality/ |title=Animal Lovers: Zoophiles Make Scientists Rethink Human Sexuality &amp;#124; Bering in Mind, Scientific American Blog Network |publisher=Blogs.scientificamerican.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In other recent surveys, the majority of zoophiles scoffed at the notion that they were abusive toward animals in any way—far from it, they said. Many even consider themselves to be animal welfare advocates in addition to zoophiles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scientam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bering |first=Jesse |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/2010/03/24/animal-lovers-zoophiles-make-scientists-rethink-human-sexuality/ |title=Animal Lovers: Zoophiles Make Scientists Rethink Human Sexuality &amp;#124; Bering in Mind, Scientific American Blog Network |publisher=Blogs.scientificamerican.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jacob M. Appel]] has also advocated for the decriminalization of bestiality, arguing that lack of consent is not a meaningful concept when discussing human-animal sex.  He has written that society does &quot;not describe owning a pet dog as kidnapping, even when the canine is restricted to the inside of a home, although confining a human being in the same manner would clearly be unethical.&quot;  According to Appel, such relations &quot;may well be neutral or even pleasurable for the animals concerned&quot;, and are primarily prohibited because of social taboos and knee-jerk reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appel1&quot;&gt;Appel, Jacob M. (13 March 2009) &quot;Three Reasons Society Shouldn't Rush to Condemn Bestiality&quot;, [[Opposing Views]]&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there are no defensible philosophical reasons for the creation of anti-zoosexual laws which prohibit non-cruel bestiality, and that such laws are unjust, irrational and discriminatory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appel1&quot;&gt;Appel, Jacob M. (13 March 2009) &quot;Three Reasons Society Shouldn't Rush to Condemn Bestiality&quot;, [[Opposing Views]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also believes that current negative attitudes towards zoophilia may be a result of [[cultural relativism]], since other cultures in the past have accepted it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noram&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Voget61&quot;/&gt; In 2011, American attorney [[Carl Person]] listed bestiality as one of several &quot;victimless crimes&quot; he felt should not be regulated. He later stated that he does not not practice or advocate bestiality and &quot;threw (it in) for the sake of controversy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2011/11/lp-pres-carl-person-defends-comments-on-legalizing-bestiality/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research has proven that non-human animals can and do have sex for non-reproductive purposes (and for pleasure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EftT_1bsPOAC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;ots=dEaLdiussh&amp;dq=animals%20homosexuality&amp;lr&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q=animals%20homosexuality&amp;f=false; |title=Animal Homosexuality: A Biosocial Perspective – Aldo Poiani, A.

==Mentions in the media==
Because of its controversial nature, different countries vary in the discussion of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator ([[OFCOM]]) updated its code stating that freedom of expression is at the heart of any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected.  Hence a [[Watershed (television)|watershed]] and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people.  Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/?a=87101 |title=OFCOM Broadcasting Code |publisher=Ofcom.org.uk |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPT was replaced after the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act in 1993, replaced with bodies designed to allow both more debate and increased consistency, and possession and supply of material that it is decided are objectionable was made a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=info:L5b3lbnO4IQJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=viewport&amp;pg=1 Scholar.Google.co.uk] An Objectionable offence (a critique of this part of the act)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mention in the media is often comical in nature. References to bestiality are not uncommon in some media, especially [[cartoon]] series such as ''[[Family Guy]]'' ''(episode: &quot;[[Screwed the Pooch]]&quot;)'' and ''[[South Park]]'' ''([[South Park#Recurring Themes|Recurring themes]])'', [[satire|satirical comedy]] such as [[Borat]], and films (especially shock [[exploitation film]]s), although a few broadcasters such as [[Howard Stern]] (who joked about bestiality dial-a-date on NBC) and  [[Tom Binns]] (whose [[Xfm London]] Breakfast Show resulted on one occasion in a live discussion about the ethics of zoophilic pornographic movies at peak child listening time) have been reprimanded by their stations for doing so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In literature, American novelist [[Kurt Vonnegut]] refers to a photo of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland Pony in ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'', and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]''.  [[Philip K. Dick]] also refers to a photo of a woman copulating with a Shetland Pony in ''[[Flow My Tears The Policeman Said]]''.  [[John Irving]]'s novel ''[[The Cider House Rules]]'' repeatedly mentions a pornographic photograph depicting oral sex on a pony.  In ''[[Clerks II]]'' Randal orders a [[donkey show]] as a going away present for his best friend Dante, in which it is referred to as &quot;interspecies erotica&quot; by the male performer.
