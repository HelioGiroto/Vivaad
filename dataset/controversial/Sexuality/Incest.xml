'''Incest''' is [[sexual intercourse]] between family members and close [[kinship|relatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incest &quot;Incest&quot;] in ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/incest/ Incest Law &amp; Legal Definition].

In some societies, such as those of [[Ancient Egypt]] and others, brother–sister, father–daughter, and mother–son, cousin-cousin, uncle-niece, aunt-nephew, and other permutations of relations were practiced among [[royal family|royalty]] as a means of perpetuating the royal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Godelier]], Métamorphoses de la parenté, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review - Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Balinese people|Balinese]]&lt;ref name= Bateson&gt;{{cite book|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology|last= Bateson|first=Gregory |author-link=Gregory Bateson |publisher=University Of Chicago Press|pages= |year=2000|isbn=978-0-226-03905-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Inuit]] tribes&lt;ref name=JBriggs&gt;{{cite book|title=Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family|last= Briggs|first=Jean|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages= |year=2006|isbn= 978-0-674-60828-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; have altogether different beliefs about what constitutes illegal and immoral incest.

Children born of close incestous unions have greatly increased risk of congenital disorders, death and disability at least in part due to genetic diseases caused by the [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref name=WolfDurham2005&gt;{{cite book |title=Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century |first=Arthur P. |last=Wolf |first2=William H. |last2=Durham |year=2004 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&amp;pg=PA169 |isbn=0-8047-5141-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The English word [[wikt:incest|incest]] is derived from the Latin ''incestus'', which has a general meaning of &quot;impure, unchaste&quot;.
It was introduced  into [[Middle English]], both in the generic Latin sense, and in the narrow modern sense. The generic Latin sense preserved throughout the Middle English period.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]].  [[Ancrene Riwle]] (c. 1225)   has  ''Incest‥is bituȝe sibbe fleschliche'', where either the generic or the narrow sense may be intended. See also [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=incest&amp;searchmode=none inetymonline.comest].&lt;/ref&gt;
The derived adjective ''incestuous'' appears in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Etymology'', T. F. Hoad (ed.) (1996), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the introduction of the Latin term, incest was known in [[Old English]] as ''sibbleger'' (from ''sibb'' 'kinship' + ''leger'' 'to lie') or ''mǣġhǣmed'' (from ''mǣġ'' 'kin, parent' + ''hǣmed'' 'sexual intercourse') but in time, both words fell out of use.

==History==
[[File:W.Clerke table.PNG|thumb|325px|Table of prohibited marriages from ''The Trial of Bastardie'' by [[William Clerke (writer)|William Clerke]]. London, 1594]]

===Antiquity===
In [[ancient China]], first cousins with the same surnames (i.e., those born to the father's brothers) were not permitted to marry, while those with different surnames (i.e., maternal cousins and paternal cousins born to the father's sisters) were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gulik, Robert Hans van |title=Sexual Life in Ancient China: a Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from ca. 1500 B.C. till 1644 A.D. |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1974 |page=19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u9MUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 |isbn=90-04-03917-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the Egyptian Pharaohs married their siblings. For example [[Tutankhamun]] married his half-sister.

According to the [[Books of the Bible|Biblical Book]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the [[Patriarch]] [[Abraham]] and his wife [[Sarah]] were half-siblings, both being children of [[Terah]] (Ge 20:12). 

The fable of [[Oedipus]], with a theme of inadvertent incest between a mother and son, ends in [[disaster]] and shows ancient taboos against incest as Oedipus is punished for incestuous actions by blinding himself. In the &quot;sequel&quot; to Oedipus, [[Antigone]], his four children are also punished for their parents having been incestuous.

Incest appears in the commonly accepted version of the birth of [[Adonis]], when his mother, [[Myrrha]] has [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with her father [[Cinyras]] during a festival, disguised as a [[prostitute]].

Incest is mentioned and condemned in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' Book VI:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_vergil_aeneid_latin_6.htm Vergil Aeneid Book VI in Latin: The descent to the Underworld]. Ancienthistory.about.com (2010-06-15). Retrieved on 2011-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt; ''hic thalamum invasit natae vetitosque hymenaeos;'' &quot;This one invaded a daughter's room and a forbidden sex act&quot;.

It is generally accepted that sibling marriages were widespread among all classes in Egypt during the Graeco-Roman period. Numerous [[papyrus|papyri]] and the Roman census declarations attest to many husbands and wives being brother and sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = N. | title = Life in Egypt under Roman Rule | isbn = 0-19-814848-8 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] | year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frier |first=Bruce W. |last2=Bagnall |first2=Roger S. |author2-link=Roger S.

Her mother and father, [[Cleopatra V of Egypt|Cleopatra V]] and [[Ptolemy XII]], had also been brother and sister. 

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Sparta|Spartan King]] [[Leonidas I]], hero of the legendary [[Battle of Thermopylae]], was married to his [[niece]] [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]], daughter of his half-brother [[Cleomenes I]]. Greek law allowed marriage between a brother and sister if they had different mothers. For example, some accounts say that [[Elpinice]] was for a time married to her half-brother [[Cimon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Bios/Elpinice.html|title=Elpinice|last=Lahanas|first=Michael|year=2006|work=Hellenic World encyclopaedia|publisher=Hellenica|accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incestuous unions were frowned upon and considered as ''[[nefas]]'' (against the laws of gods and man) in [[ancient Rome]]. In AD 295 incest was explicitly forbidden by an imperial edict, which divided the concept of ''incestus'' into two categories of unequal gravity: the ''incestus iuris gentium'', which was applied to both Romans and non-Romans in the Empire, and the ''incestus iuris civilis'', which concerned only Roman citizens. Therefore, for example, an Egyptian could marry an aunt, but a Roman could not. Despite the act of incest being unacceptable within the Roman Empire, Roman Emperor [[Caligula]] is rumored to have had sexual relationships with all three of his sisters ([[Julia Livilla]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]], and [[Agrippina the Younger]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter2007|Potter]], 2007, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Claudius]], after executing his previous wife, married his brother's daughter Agrippina the Younger, and changed the law to allow an otherwise illegal union.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, 2007, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibiting marrying a sister's daughter remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Judith Evans |last=Grubbs |title=Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: a Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Widowhood |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4X8HXDwMHawC&amp;pg=PA137 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-15240-2 |pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taboo against incest in Ancient Rome is demonstrated by the fact that politicians would use charges of incest (often false charges) as insults and means of political disenfranchisement.

In [[Norse mythology]] there are themes of brother-sister marriage, a prominent example being  between [[Njörðr]] and his unnamed sister (perhaps [[Nerthus]]), parents of [[Freyja]] and [[Freyr]]. [[Loki]] in turn also accuses Freyja and Freyr of having a sexual relationship.

===Middle Ages===
Many European monarchs were related due to political marriages, sometimes resulting in distant cousins (and even first cousins) being married. This was especially true in the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]], [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] royal houses. Incestuous marriages were also seen in the royal houses of ancient [[Japan]] and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, George Patrick (1998).

[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] via [[Google Books]]. p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Half-sibling marriages were found in ancient Japan such as the marriage of [[Emperor Bidatsu]] and his half-sister [[Empress Suiko]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Arthur (2004).

According to the National Center for Victims of Crime a large proportion of [[rape]] committed in the United States is perpetrated by a family member:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Research indicates that 46% of children who are raped are victims of family members (Langan and Harlow, 1994). The majority of American rape victims (61%) are raped before the age of 18; furthermore, 29% of all rapes occurred when the victim was less than 11 years old. 11% of rape victims are raped by their fathers or step-fathers, and another 16% are raped by other relatives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32360 | title=Incest |work=National Center for Victims of Crime and Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center|year=1992|publisher=National Center for Victims of Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A study of victims of father–daughter incest in the 1970s showed that there were &quot;common features&quot; within families before the occurrence of incest: estrangement between the mother and the daughter, extreme paternal dominance, and reassignment of some of the mother's traditional major family responsibility to the daughter. Oldest and only daughters were more likely to be the victims of incest. It was also stated that the incest experience was psychologically harmful to the woman in later life, frequently leading to feelings of low self-esteem, unhealthy sexual activity, contempt for other women, and other emotional problems.&lt;ref&gt;Emotional Inheritance: A Dubious Legacy.

Adults who as children were incestuously victimized by adults often suffer from low [[self-esteem]], difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and [[sexual dysfunction]], and are at an extremely high risk of many mental disorders, including [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[Phobia|phobic avoidance reactions]], [[somatoform disorder]], [[substance abuse]], [[borderline personality disorder]], and [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name= Courtois/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systemic Treatment of Incest: A Therapeutic Handbook|last= Trepper|first=Terry S.|coauthor=Mary Jo Barrett |publisher=Psychology Press|year=1989|isbn= 0-87630-560-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Incest-Related Syndromes of Adult Psychopathology |first=Richard P.|last=Kluft |year=1990 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub , Inc.|pages=83, 89 |isbn=0-88048-160-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Leslie Margolin indicates that mother-son incest does not trigger some innate biological response, but that the effects are more directly related to the symbolic meanings attributed to this act by the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Margolin|first=Leslie|title=The effects of mother-son incest|journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues|year=1985|volume=8|issue=2|pages=104–114|doi=10.1007/BF01553341|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l1577233721v0512/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Goler clan]] is a specific instance in which child sexual abuse in the form of forced adult/child and sibling/sibling incest took place over at least three generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;cruise&quot;&gt;Cruise, David, and Griffiths, Alison. ''On South Mountain: The Dark Secrets of the Goler Clan'' (Penguin Books, 1998) ISBN 0-670-87388-8&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of Goler children were victims of sexual abuse at the hands of fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, sisters, brothers, cousins, and each other. During interrogation by police, several of the adults openly admitted to engaging in many forms of sexual activity, up to and including full intercourse, multiple times with the children. Sixteen adults (both men and women) were charged with hundreds of allegations of incest and sexual abuse of children as young as five.&lt;ref name=&quot;cruise&quot; /&gt;

===Between childhood siblings===
Childhood sibling–sibling incest is considered to be widespread but rarely reported.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt; It is believed to be the most common form of intrafamilial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael G. Kalogerakis|author2=American Psychiatric Association.

Sibling-sibling incest becomes [[child-on-child sexual abuse]] when it occurs without consent, without equality, or as a result of [[coercion]]. The most commonly reported form of abusive sibling incest is abuse of a younger sibling by an older sibling.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt; A 2006 study showed a large portion of adults who experienced sibling incest abuse have distorted or disturbed beliefs (such as that the act was &quot;normal&quot;) both about their own experience and the subject of sexual abuse in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson &quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bonnie E.

Sibling abusive incest is most prevalent in families where one or both parents are often absent or emotionally unavailable, with the abusive siblings using incest as a way to assert their power over a weaker sibling.&lt;ref name=leder&gt;{{cite news|title=Adult Sibling Rivalry: Sibling rivalry often lingers through adulthood | url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=19930101-000023&amp;page=1 |author=Jane Mersky Leder |work=Psychology Today |volume=January/February 93 |publisher=Sussex Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of the father in particular has been found to be a significant element of most cases of sexual abuse of female children by a brother.&lt;ref name=rudd&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brother-sister incest—father-daughter incest: a comparison of characteristics and consequences |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |author=Jane M.

Proponents of incest between consenting adults draw clear boundaries between the behavior of consenting adults and rape, child molestation, and abusive incest.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2002&quot; /&gt; According to one incest participant who was interviewed for an article in ''The Guardian'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;You can't help who you fall in love with, it just happens. I fell in love with my sister and I'm not ashamed ... I only feel sorry for my mom and dad, I wish they could be happy for us. We love each other. It's nothing like some old man who tries to fuck his three-year-old, that's evil and disgusting ... Of course we're consenting, that's the most important thing. We're not fucking perverts. What we have is the most beautiful thing in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Slate Magazine]]'', [[William Saletan]] drew a legal connection between gay sex and incest between consenting adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2081904/|title=Incest Repellent? If gay sex is private, why isn't incest?|last=Saletan |first=William |authorlink=William Saletan |date=2003-04-23|publisher=''[[Slate Magazine]]''|accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he described in his article, in 2003, U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]] commented on a pending U.S. Supreme Court case involving sodomy laws (primarily as a matter of [[Civil and political rights|Constitutional rights to Privacy and Equal Protection under the Law]]). He stated: &quot;If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate2003&quot; /&gt; However, David Smith of the [[Human Rights Campaign]] professed outrage that Santorum placed being gay on the same moral and legal level as someone engaging in incest. Saletan argued that, legally and morally, there is essentially no difference between the two, and went on to support incest between consenting adults being covered by a legal right to privacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate2003&quot; /&gt; [[UCLA School of Law|UCLA]] law professor [[Eugene Volokh]] has made similar arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2010/12/12/incest/ |title=Incest |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |date=December 12, 2010 |work=[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent article, Saletan said that incest is wrong because it introduces the possibility of irreparably damaging family units by introducing &quot;a notoriously incendiary dynamic—sexual tension—into the mix&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;slt10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/12/incest_is_cancer.2.html|title=Incest Is Cancer|last=Saletan|first=William|date=Dec. 14, 2010|work=Slate|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludman - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Between adult siblings====
The most public case of consensual adult sibling incest in recent years is the case of a brother-sister couple from Germany, [[Patrick Stübing]] and Susan Karolewski. Because of violent behavior on the part of the father, the brother was taken in at the age of 3 by foster parents, who adopted him later. At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16 year old sister for the first time. The now-adult brother moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the couple became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated [[prosecution]]s and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all. An article about them in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' states that the couple are happy together. According to court records, the first three children have mental and physical disabilities, and have been placed in foster care.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel&quot; /&gt; In April 2012, at the [[European Court of Human Rights]], Patrick Stuebing lost his case that the conviction violated his right to a private and family life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/13/world/europe/germany-incest-court/index.html?hpt=hp_bn2 CNN: German incest couple lose European court case]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ECtHR judgment&quot;&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=905957&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Judgment] on the ''Stübing vs. Germany'' case.

====Cousin relationships====
{{See also|Cousin marriage|List of coupled cousins}}

Marriages and sexual relationships between first cousins are stigmatized as incest in some western cultures. In modern secular law, notably some [[US states]], prohibit  marriages between first cousins. Currently, 24 states prohibit such marriages, and another seven permit them only under special circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Grossman, [http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20020408.html Should the law be kinder to kissin' cousins?]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Cousin marriages, while not illegal, are highly stigmatized, except in the Middle East, North Africa and other parts of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.paed.2008.02.008|title=Consanguinity and child health|year=2008|last1=Saggar|first1=A|last2=Bittles|first2=A|journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|volume=18|issue=5|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities such as the [[Dhund Abbasi|Dhond]] and the [[Bhittani]] of Pakistan clearly prefer marriages between cousins as believe they ensure purity of the descent line, provide intimate knowledge of the spouses, and ensure that [[Property|patrimony]] will not pass into the hands of &quot;outsiders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Apart from the partial prohibition in the United States, there are some cultures in Asia which stigmatize cousin marriage, in some instances even marriages between second cousins or more remotely related people. This concerns notably the culture of [[Korea]], and some [[Hindu]] communities in India. In South Korea, before 1997, anyone with the same last name and clan were prohibited from marriage. In light of this law being held unconstitutional, South Korea now only prohibits up to third cousins (see [[Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code]]). [[Hmong]] culture prohibits the marriage of anyone with the same last name - to do so would result in being shunned by the entire community, and they are usually stripped of their last name.  In [[Western Australia]] over 500 marriages are between cousins. In a review of 48 studies on the children parented by cousins, most of the babies born to cousins were healthy contrary to the popular perception, with birth defects being 4% of births for consanguineous couples as opposed to 2% for the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Towie |first=Narelle |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/kissing-cousins-ok/story-fna7dq6e-1111116504749 |title=Most babies born to first-cousins are healthy |publisher=Perth Now |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inbreeding over many generations does increase risks however.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

====Incest defined through marriage====
Some cultures include relatives by marriage in incest prohibitions; these relationships are called [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] rather than [[consanguinity]]. For example, the question of the legality and morality of a widower who wished to marry his [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|deceased wife's sister]] was the subject of long and fierce debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, involving, among others, [[Matthew Boulton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollak|first=Ellen |title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684–1814|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore MD|year=2003|page=38|isbn=0-8018-7204-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tann|first=Jennifer|title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=May 2007|chapter=Boulton, Matthew (1728–1809)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, standing as a [[godparent]] to a child also created a bond of affinity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} But in other societies, a deceased spouse's sibling was considered the ideal person to marry. The Hebrew Bible forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow with the exception that, if his brother died childless, the man is instead required to marry his brother's widow so as to &quot;raise up seed to him&quot; (taken from Deuteronomy 25:5–6).

==Inbreeding==
{{Main|Inbreeding}}
Incest that results in offspring is a form of close [[inbreeding]] (reproduction between two individuals with a common ancestor). Inbreeding leads to a higher probability of [[Congenital disorder|congenital birth defects]] because it increases that proportion of zygotes that are [[homozygous]], in particular for deleterious [[recessive allele]]s that produce such disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Livingstone | first=F. B. |year=1969 | title =Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=10 |pages=45–62 |doi= 10.1086/201009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most such alleles are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives [[Coefficient of relationship|share a large fraction of their alleles]], the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. However, because the increased proportion of deleterious homozygotes exposes the allele to [[natural selection]], in the long run its frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred population. In the short term, incestuous reproduction is expected to produce increases in spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thornhill, Nancy Wilmsen |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=0-226-79854-2 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There may also be other deleterious effects besides those caused by recessive diseases. Thus, similar [[immune system]]s may be more vulnerable to infectious diseases (see [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]).&lt;ref name=moral&gt;{{cite doi|10.1098/rspb.2002.2290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livestock]] breeders often practice controlled breeding to eliminate undesirable characteristics within a population, which is also coupled with [[culling]] of what is considered unfit offspring, especially when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock.

==In popular culture==
{{main|Incest in popular culture}}
Incest is a somewhat popular topic in English [[erotic fiction]]; there are entire collections and websites devoted solely to this genre, with an entire genre of pornographic [[Pulp fiction (genre)|pulp fiction]] known as &quot;incest novels&quot;.

==Laws==
{{Main|Laws regarding incest}}
Incest is illegal in many jurisdictions. The exact legal definition of &quot;incest,&quot; including the nature of the relationship between persons, and the types sexual activity, varies by country, and by even individual states or provinces within a country. These laws can also extend to marriage between subject individuals.

In some places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other places, incestuous relationships between two consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted. Such countries where it is permissible and legal, includes the [[Netherlands]] and [[Sweden]] where incestuous couples must seek government counseling before marriage. The only type of incestuous relationship allowed by law in Sweden is that between half-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6424337.stm Incest: an age-old taboo]. BBC. 12 March 2007. retrieved 22 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A jurisdiction's definition of an incestuous relationship will also limit who a person is permitted to marry. Some jurisdictions forbid first-cousins to marry, while others limit the prohibition to brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles.

==Religious views==

===Jewish===
{{Main|Incest in the Bible|Jewish views on incest}}
In three places in the [[Torah]], there are lists of family members between whom it is prohibited to have sexual relations; each of these lists is progressively shorter. The biblical lists are not symmetrical – the implied rules for women and men are not the same. Relationships compare as follows:
{{legend|#6090ff|Forbidden for men}}
{{legend|#ff70b8|Forbidden for women}}
{{legend|#9870ff|Forbidden for both men and women}}

Apart from the questionable case of the daughter, the first incest list in the Holiness code roughly produces the same rules as were followed in early (pre-Islamic) Arabic culture;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncInce&quot;&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=incest|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=126&amp;letter=I}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Islam]], these pre-existing rules were made statutory.&lt;ref&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=marriage|section=Manius-Mash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century BCE, the [[Soferim]] (''scribes'') declared that there were relationships within which marriage constituted incest, in addition to those mentioned by the Torah. These additional relationships were termed ''seconds'' (Hebrew: ''sheniyyot''), and included the wives of a man's grandfather and grandson.&lt;ref name=&quot;TosYeb23&quot;&gt;''Yebamot' ([[Tosefta]]) 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; The classical rabbis prohibited marriage between a man and any of these ''seconds'' of his, on the basis that doing so would act as a ''safeguard'' against infringing the biblical incest rules,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeb21a&quot;&gt;Yebamot 21a&lt;/ref&gt; although there was inconclusive debate about exactly what the limits should be for the definition of ''seconds''.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncInce&quot; /&gt;

Marriages forbidden in the Torah were regarded by the rabbis of the Middle Ages as invalid – as if they had never occurred;&lt;ref name=&quot;EbenezerSA&quot;&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch|Shulchan 'Aruk]]'', ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 16, 1&lt;/ref&gt; any children born to such a couple were regarded as [[mamzer|Jewish bastards]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EbenezerSA&quot; /&gt; and the relatives of the spouse were not regarded as forbidden relations for a further marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Yebamot 94b&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, those relationships which were prohibited due to qualifying as ''seconds'', and so forth, were regarded as wicked, but still valid;&lt;ref name=&quot;EbenezerSA&quot; /&gt; while they might have pressured such a couple to divorce, any children of the union were still seen as legitimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;EbenezerSA&quot; /&gt;

===Christian===

In the Roman Catholic Church, marriage is generally not permitted if the potential spouses are related in the collateral line up to and including the second degree, although a dispensation may be granted permitting marriages between first cousins or even uncle/niece unions as in the marriage of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor to his niece, and first cousin, Margarita Teresa of Spain in 1666.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The Church does not generally permit the marriage if a doubt exists on whether the potential spouses are related by consanguinity in any degree of the direct line or in the second degree of the collateral line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3Y.HTM Code of Canon Law]. Can. 1091&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], marriages are banned between second cousins or closer and between second uncles / aunts and second nieces / nephews (between first cousins once removed) or closer. Also, marriages that produce children that are closer genetic relatives than legal are also not permitted (unless the genetic relationship does allow marriage between those children). For example, two siblings may not marry two other siblings because legally their children will be cousins, but genetically they'll be half-siblings. On the other hand, two siblings may marry two cousins.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The [[Anglican Communion]] allows marriages up to and including first cousins. But in all of the three preceding Christian churches, marriages to uncles, aunts, relatives in the direct line, or their respective spouses are not allowed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Islamic===
{{main|Mahram}}

The [[Quran]] gives specific rules regarding incest, which prohibit a man from marrying or having sexual relationships with:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
*his father's wife&lt;ref name=&quot;Quran22&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://quran.com/4/22 | title = Sûrah an Nisa 4:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (his mother,&lt;ref name=&quot;Quran23&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://quran.com/4/23 | title = Sûrah an Nisa 4:23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or stepmother&lt;ref name=Quran23&gt;{{cite web | url = http://quran.al-islam.com/Targama/DispTargam.asp?nType=1&amp;nSeg=0&amp;l=eng&amp;nSora=4&amp;nAya=22&amp;t=eng | title = Surah an-Nisa 4:23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), his mother-in-law, a woman from whom he has nursed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Quran23&quot; /&gt;
*either parent's sister (aunt),&lt;ref name=&quot;Quran23&quot;/&gt;
*his sister, his half sister, a woman who has nursed from the same woman as he, his sister-in-law (wife's sister) while still married,&lt;ref name=&quot;Quran23&quot; /&gt;
*his niece (child of sibling),&lt;ref name=&quot;Quran23&quot; /&gt;
*his daughter, his stepdaughter (if the marriage to her mother had been [[consummation|consummated]]), his daughter-in-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quran23&quot; /&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

The main differences (apart from relationships between a man and his daughter) are:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
*a woman from '''whom he has nursed'''
*a woman who has '''nursed from the same woman''' as he
*a niece
|}&lt;/center&gt;

A [[Hadith]] also prohibits marriage to a woman and her parent's sister at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iicwc.org/lagna/iicwc/iicwc.php?id=874&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies for a woman with the male counterparts to the aforementioned.

===Hindu===
[[Hinduism]] speaks of incest in abhorrent terms. Hindus are fearful of the bad effects of incest and thus practice strict rules of both [[endogamy]] and [[exogamy]] within [[caste]]s (''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'') but not in the same family tree (''[[gotra]]'') or bloodline (''[[Pravaras|Pravara]]''). Marriages within the gotra (&quot;[[swagotra]]&quot; marriages) are banned under the rule of exogamy in the traditional matrimonial system.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;there can be no matrimony between the sects of Gehlawat and Kadiyan as they have a “brotherhood” akin to consanguinity.&quot;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haryana-panchayat-takes-on-govt-over-samegotra-marriage/491548/ Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage]. Indian Express. July 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; People within the gotra are regarded as kin and marrying such a person would be thought of as incest. i.e. Marriage with paternal cousins is strictly prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In India these rules are reproduced in the form of that one must not marry within the Gotra, but not without the caste&quot; [http://www.sanathanadharma.com/samskaras/marriage/mar3.htm#Limitations Limitations of Marriage]. sanathanadharma.com&lt;/ref&gt; In fact marriage between two people whose parents are related paternally up to seven generations is expressly prohibited. Gotra is transferred down the male lineage while the Gotra of a female changes upon marriage. i.e., upon marriage a woman belongs to her husband's Gotra and no longer belongs to her father's Gotra.Hence marriage with a person having same Gotra as of the original [[Gotra]]s of grandparents is prohibited{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

Nevertheless, in [[Tamil Nadu]] of Southern India, Marriage with maternal cousins and marriages between Maternal Uncle and Niece were widely in practice a few decades back. However the tradition of getting married to maternal uncle has declined considerably now and may soon become a relic of the past. In matrilinial societies of [[Kerala]] marriage between first cousins were common. It is said to have helped in preserving family wealth.

===Buddhist===
[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] societies take a strong ethical stand in human affairs and sexual behavior in particular. Most variations of Buddhism decide locally about the details of incest as a wrongdoing, according to local cultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpuuf.org/2008/08/03/glbt-in-world-religions/ GLBT in World Religions | Thomas Paine Unitarian Universalist Fellowship]. Tpuuf.org (2008-08-03). Retrieved on 2011-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual misconduct is mentioned but the definition of what constitutes misconduct sex is an individual issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_budd.htm| accessdate=2010-04-27| title=Buddhism and Homosexuality| publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance| author= B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics are the [[Five Precepts]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]: one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure. These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Five Precepts is &quot;To refrain from committing sexual misconduct&quot;. 'Sexual misconduct' means any sexual conduct involving violence, manipulation or deceit – conduct that therefore leads to suffering and trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Higgins | first =W | title =Buddhist Sexual Ethics | publisher =BuddhaNet Magazine | url =http://www.buddhanet.net/winton_s.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monks and nuns strictly forbid any type of sexual misconduct but incest is not specifically defined as sexual misconduct, and therefore depends on the culture of the area, not on mandate from Buddhism itself. However, there are no enforced rules for laypeople in Buddhism, only guidance.
