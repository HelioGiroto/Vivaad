[[File:Human semen in petri dish2.jpg|thumb|Human semen in a [[petri dish]].]]

'''Semen''' is an organic [[fluid]], also known as ''seminal fluid'', that may contain [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]. It is secreted by the [[gonad]]s (sexual glands) and other sexual organs of [[male]] or [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[animal]]s and can [[fertilization|fertilize]] [[female]] [[ovum|ova]]. In humans, seminal fluid contains several components besides spermatozoa: proteolytic and other enzymes as well as fructose are elements of seminal fluid which promote the survival of spermatozoa and provide a medium through which they can move or &quot;swim&quot;. 

Semen is produced and originates from the [[seminal vesicle]], which is located in the pelvis. The process that results in the discharge of semen is called ''[[ejaculation]]''.

==Physiological aspects==
===Internal and external fertilization===

Depending on the [[species]], spermatozoa can fertilize ova externally or internally. In [[external fertilization]], the spermatozoa fertilize the ova directly, outside of the female's sexual organs. Female [[fish]], for example, [[spawn (biology)|spawn]] ova into their aquatic environment, where they are fertilized by the semen of the male fish.

During [[internal fertilization]], however, fertilization occurs inside the female's sexual organs. Internal fertilization takes place after [[insemination]] of a female by a male through [[copulation]]. In low [[vertebrate]]s ([[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[monotreme]] mammals), copulation is achieved through the physical mating of the [[cloaca]] of the male and female. In [[marsupial]] and [[Placentalia|placental mammal]]s, [[copulation]] occurs through the [[vagina]].

===Composition of human semen===
During the process of [[ejaculation]], [[sperm]] passes through the [[ejaculatory duct]]s and mixes with fluids from the [[seminal vesicle]]s, the [[prostate]], and the [[bulbourethral gland]]s to form the semen.  The seminal vesicles produce a yellowish viscous fluid rich in fructose and other substances that makes up about 70% of human semen.&lt;ref name=Mann1954&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1954 |author=Mann, T |title=The Biochemistry of Semen |publisher=London: Methuen &amp; Co; New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons |url= http://www.archive.org/stream/biochemistryofse00mann#page/n5/mode/2up |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostatic secretion, influenced by dihydrotestosterone, is a whitish (sometimes clear), thin fluid containing proteolytic enzymes, citric acid, acid phosphatase and lipids.&lt;ref name=Mann1954/&gt; The bulbourethral glands secrete a clear secretion into the lumen of the [[urethra]] to lubricate it.&lt;ref name=textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |last=Guyton |first=Arthur C. |authorlink=Arthur Guyton |year=1991|edition=8th|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|pages=890–891|isbn=0-7216-3994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sertoli cell]]s, which nurture and support developing [[spermatocyte]]s, secrete a fluid into seminiferous tubules that helps transport sperm to the genital ducts. The ductuli efferentes possess cuboidal cells with [[microvillus|microvilli]] and [[lysosome|lysosomal]] granules that modify the semen by reabsorbing some fluid. Once the semen enters the ductus epididymis the principle cells, which contain [[pinocytotic vessel]]s indicating fluid reabsorption, secrete glycerophosphocholine which most likely inhibits premature [[capacitation]]. The accessory genital ducts, the [[seminal vesicle]], [[prostate gland]]s, and the [[bulbourethral gland]]s, produce most of the seminal fluid.

Seminal plasma of humans contains a complex range of [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] constituents.

The seminal plasma provides a nutritive and protective medium for the spermatozoa during their journey through the female reproductive tract. The normal environment of the [[vagina]] is a hostile one for [[sperm]] cells, as it is very [[acidic]] (from the native microflora producing [[lactic acid]]), viscous, and patrolled by immune cells. The components in the seminal plasma attempt to compensate for this hostile environment. Basic [[amines]] such as [[putrescine]], [[spermine]], [[spermidine]] and [[cadaverine]] are responsible for the smell and flavor of semen. These alkaline bases counteract and buffer the acidic environment of the vaginal canal, and protect [[DNA]] inside the [[sperm]] from acidic denaturation.

The components and contributions of semen are as follows:

===Appearance and consistency of human semen===
Semen is typically translucent with white, grey or even yellowish tint. Blood in the semen can cause a pink or reddish colour, known as ''[[hematospermia]]'', and may indicate a medical problem which should be evaluated by a doctor if the symptom persists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcentral.com/prostate/question-answer-27466-63.html Blood in Semen – What could cause blood in my semen?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semen quality===
{{Main|Semen quality}}
Semen quality is a measure of the ability of semen to accomplish fertilization. Thus, it is a measure of fertility in a man. It is the sperm in the semen that is the fertile component, and therefore semen quality involves both sperm quantity and sperm quality.

===Semen storage===
Semen can be stored in diluents such as the ''Illini Variable Temperature'' (IVT) diluent, which have been reported to be able to preserve high fertility of semen for over seven days.&lt;ref name=Watson1993&gt;{{cite doi|10.1071/RD9930691}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVT diluent is composed of several salts, sugars and antibacterial agents and gassed with [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Watson1993/&gt;

[[Semen cryopreservation]] can be used for far longer storage durations. For human sperm, the longest reported successful storage with this method is 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planer.com/PlanerComWebsite.nsf/7dc62b5d9e44dd40802575460048fc4e/df90c37237a74df88025757d005b0057?OpenDocument Planer NEWS and Press Releases &gt; Child born after 21 year semen storage using Planer controlled rate freezer] 14/10/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
In addition to its central role in reproduction, some studies have made claims that semen may have certain beneficial effects on human health:

*[[Antidepressant]]: One study suggested that vaginal absorption of semen could act as an antidepressant; the study compared two groups of women, one of which used condoms and the other did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Jesse Bering | title = An ode to the many evolved virtues of human semen | journal = Scientific American | year = 2010 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=an-ode-to-the-many-evolved-virtues-2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon Gallup 2002 289–293&quot;&gt;{{citation | author = Gordon Gallup | title = Does Semen Have Antidepressant Properties? | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | year = 2002 | volume = 31 | number= 3 | pages = 289–293 | ISSN = 0004-0002 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/wrkl9lc5ueu43rh8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related [[urban legend]] parodied these findings and claimed that performing fellatio at least three times a week reduced the risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*Preeclampsia prevention: It has been hypothesized that substances in semen condition a mother's [[immune system]] to accept the &quot;foreign&quot; proteins found in sperm as well as the resulting fetus and placenta, keeping [[blood pressure]] low and thereby reducing the risk of [[preeclampsia]]. A study shows that oral sex and swallowing semen may help make a woman's [[pregnancy]] safer and more successful, because she is absorbing her partner's [[antigens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1340021 |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of preeclampsia : a role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date=1999-12-17 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Increased libido: Another hypothesis has emerged that absorption of the testosterone contained in semen through a woman's vaginal walls during sexual intercourse (or even through the act of swallowing semen) may increase her sex drive.

Other studies claim adversarial effects:

===Semen and transmission of disease===
Semen can be the vehicle for many [[sexually transmitted diseases]], including [[HIV]], the [[virus]] that causes [[AIDS]].

Further research, such as that by Mathur and Goust, demonstrated that non-preexisting antibodies were produced in humans in response to the sperm. These antibodies mistakenly recognized native [[T lymphocytes]] as ''foreign'' [[antigens]], and consequently T lymphocytes would fall under attack by the body's [[B lymphocytes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Mathur S, Goust J, Williamson H, Fudenberg H | title = Cross-reactivity of sperm and T lymphocyte antigens | journal = Am J Reprod Immunol | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 113–8 | year = 1981 | pmid = 6175235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semen contains many proteins with potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi and virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edström|first=AM|coauthors=Malm, J, Frohm, B, Martellini, JA, Giwercman, A, Mörgelin, M, Cole, AM, Sørensen, OE|title=The major bactericidal activity of human seminal plasma is zinc-dependent and derived from fragmentation of the semenogelins.|journal=Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)|date=Sep 1|year=2008|volume=181|issue=5|pages=3413–21|pmid=18714013|pmc=2585754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edström Hägerwall|first=Anneli M.

===Blood in the semen (hematospermia)===
{{Main|Hematospermia}}

The presence of blood in semen or [[hematospermia]] may be undetectable (it only can be seen microscopically) or visible in the fluid. Its cause could be the result of [[inflammation]], [[infection]], blockage, or injury of the male reproductive tract or a problem within the [[urethra]], [[testicles]], [[epididymis]] or [[prostate]].

It usually clears up without treatment, or with [[antibiotics]], but if persistent further [[semen analysis]] and other [[urogenital|urogenital system]] tests might be needed to find out the cause.

===Semen allergy===
In rare cases, people have been known to experience allergic reactions to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma [[hypersensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Guillet G, Dagregorio G, Guillet M | title = [Vulvar contact dermatitis due to seminal allergy: 3 cases] | journal = Ann Dermatol Venereol | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15798560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include vaginal itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include generalized itching, [[hives]], and even difficulty breathing.

One way to test for human seminal plasma sensitivity is to use a [[condom]] during intercourse. If symptoms dissipate with the use of a condom, it is possible that a sensitivity to semen is present. Mild cases of semen [[allergy]] can often be overcome by repeated exposure to seminal fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Weidinger S, Ring J, Köhn F | title = IgE-mediated allergy against human seminal plasma | journal = Chem Immunol Allergy | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 128–38 | year = 2005| pmid = 16129942 | doi = 10.1159/000087830| series = Chemical Immunology and Allergy, 2005| isbn = 3-8055-7951-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more severe cases, it is important to seek the advice of a physician, particularly in the event that a couple is trying to conceive, in which case, [[artificial insemination]] may be indicated.

Scientists at Utrecht University studied the condition whereby some men &quot;get flu-like symptoms such as feverishness, runny nose, extreme fatigue and burning eyes immediately after they ejaculate. Symptoms can last for up to week.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;POIS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Semen allergy suspected in rare post-orgasm illness|author=Kate Kelland|location=LONDON|date=Jan 17, 2011|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE70G00D20110117?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a49:g43:r2:c0.070894:b41084762:z0|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is termed post orgasmic illness syndrome or POIS, and it was discovered that this stemmed from an allergy to their own semen, its effects could be cured using hyposensitization therapy or allergen immunotherapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;POIS&quot;/&gt;

==Psychological aspects==
A recent study has suggested that semen acts as an [[antidepressant]] in women, so that [[women]] physically exposed to semen are less likely to suffer from depression. It is thought that the psychological effects of semen are a result of its complex chemical make-up including several mood-altering hormones ([[testosterone]], [[oestrogen]], follicle-stimulating [[hormone]], luteinizing hormone, prolactin and several different prostaglandins). In a scientific survey of 293 college women it was also found that those who did not use [[condom]]s were most likely to initiate sex and to seek out new partners as soon as a relationship ended, suggesting that the chemical dependency to semen creates a &quot;[[rebound effect]]&quot;. The effect of semen on a male sexual partner (as the receiver of semen) is not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon Gallup 2002 289–293&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Tiffany Kary | title = Crying Over Spilled Semen | journal = Psychology Today | published on September 01, 2002 – last reviewed on May 29, 2007}} http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200210/crying-over-spilled-semen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Raj Persaud | title =  Semen acts as an anti-depressant | journal = New Scientist | year = 2002 | unused_data = 26 June}} http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2457&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects==
===Qigong===

[[Qigong]] and [[Chinese medicine]] place huge emphasis on a form of energy called 精 ([[pinyin]]: jīng, also a morpheme denoting &quot;essence&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chikung.com/chapter8.html Qigong Bible, Chapter #8&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunyuantaijiacademy.com/Articles/On%20Qigong.aspx |title=Home |publisher=hunyuantaijiacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which one attempts to develop and accumulate. &quot;Jing&quot; is sexual energy and is considered to dissipate with ejaculation so [[masturbation]] is considered &quot;energy suicide&quot; amongst those who practice this art. According to Qigong theory, energy from many pathways/meridians becomes diverted and transfers itself to the sexual organs during sexual excitement. The ensuing orgasm and ejaculation will then finally expel the energy from the system completely. The Chinese proverb 一滴精，十滴血 (pinyin: yì dī jīng, shí dī xuè, literally: a drop of semen is equal to ten drops of blood) illustrates this point.

The scientific term for semen in Chinese is 精液 (pinyin: jīng yè, literally: fluid of essence/jing) and the term for [[spermatozoon|sperm]] is 精子 (pinyin: jīng zǐ, literally: basic element of essence/jing), two modern terms with classical referents.

===Greek philosophy===
In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Aristotle]] remarked on the importance of semen: &quot;For Aristotle, semen is the residue derived from nourishment, that is of blood, that has been highly concocted to the optimum temperature and substance. This can only be emitted by the male as only the male, by nature of his very being, has the requisite heat to concoct blood into semen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The connection between food and physical growth, on the one hand, and semen, on the other, allows Aristotle to warn against &quot;engag[ing] in sexual activity at too early an age ... [since] this will affect the growth of their bodies. Nourishment that would otherwise make the body grow is diverted to the production of semen.... Aristotle is saying that at this stage the ''body'' is still growing; it is best for sexual activity to begin when its growth is 'no longer abundant', for when the body is more or less at full height, the transformation of nourishment into semen does not drain the body of needed material.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Additionally, &quot;Aristotle tells us that the region round the eyes was the region of the head most fruitful of seed (&quot;most seedy&quot; σπερματικώτατος), pointing to generally recognised effects upon the eyes of sexual indulgence and to practices which imply that seed comes from liquid in the region of the eyes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Onians|first=R.

Greek [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy conceived of the ''[[Logos]] spermatikos'' (&quot;seminal word&quot;) as the principle of active reason that fecundated passive [[matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tripolitis|first=Antonia|year=2002|title=Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age|pages=37–38|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-4913-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] similarly spoke in sexual terms of the Logos as the masculine principle of reason that sowed seeds of virtue in the feminine soul.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And when she (intelligence) lives as a comely wife with comely Reason (Logos), that is with virtuous Reason, this self-same Reason himself undertakes the care of her, sowing, like a husband, the most excellent concepts in her.&quot; Philo, ''De Spec.

The Christian Platonist [[Clement of Alexandria]] likened the Logos to physical blood&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And that the blood is the Word, is testified by the blood of Abel, the righteous interceding with God.&quot; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02091.htm Clement of Alexandria, ''The Paedagogus,'' 1, 47.]&lt;/ref&gt; as the &quot;substance of the soul,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:14}}; Clement of Alexandria, ''The Paedagogus,'' 1, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that some held &quot;that the animal semen is substantially foam of its blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''The Paedagogus,'' 1, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Clement reflected an early Christian view that &quot;the seed ought not be wasted nor scattered thoughtlessly nor sown in a way it cannot grow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''The Paedagogus,'' 2, 91. See also: [[Onan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred semen===
In some [[pre-industrial]] societies, semen and other body fluids were revered because they were believed to be magical. [[Blood]] is an example of such a fluid, but semen was also widely believed to be of supernatural origin and effect and was, as a result, considered holy or sacred.

[[Dew]] was once thought to be a sort of rain that fertilized the earth and, in time, became a metaphor for semen. The [[Bible]] employs the term &quot;dew&quot; in this sense{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} in such verses as [[Song of Solomon]] 5:2 and [[Psalm]] 110:3, declaring, in the latter verse, for example, that the people should follow only a king who was virile enough to be full of the &quot;dew&quot; of youth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

It was widely believed, in ancient times, that gemstones were drops of divine semen which had coagulated after having fertilized the earth. There is an ancient Chinese belief that [[jade]], in particular, was the dried semen of the celestial dragon.

Based upon the resemblance of [[dandelion]] juice to human semen, it was historically believed that the flower magically promoted the flow of sperm. (This belief probably derives from the [[doctrine of signatures]].)

The [[orchid]]’s twin bulbs were thought to resemble the [[testicles]], and there was an ancient Roman belief that the flower sprang from the spilled semen of copulating [[satyr]]s.

Barbara G. Walker recounts these examples of sacred semen in ''The Woman’s Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects'', the thesis of which is that myth and folklore show a pre-patriarchic rule by women that was later supplanted by masculine culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In primitive mythology around the world, semen is very often considered analogous to breast milk in some way. In the traditions of Bali, it is considered to be the returning or refunding of the milk of the mother in an alimentary metaphor. The wife feeds her husband who returns to her his semen, the milk of human kindness, as it were.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows, Laura J. (2003).

In some systems of medical philosophy, such as traditional Russian medicine and the Vital Force theory of [[Herbert Nowell]], semen is regarded as the product of a complex physiological interaction between a man and a woman (rather than merely the product of the male reproductive system).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Semen in espionage===
[[File:Sperma unter UV-Licht und ohne UV-Licht (Semen with and without Ultraviolet).JPG|thumb|Semen stain on carpet observed with and without ultraviolet light]]
When the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] discovered that semen made a good [[invisible ink]], [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Sir George Mansfield Smith-Cumming]] noted of his agents that &quot;Every man (is) his own [[stylus|stylo]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article154746.ece The Independent review of ''The Quest for C: Mansfield Cumming and the founding of the British Secret Service'' by Alan Judd]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semen ingestion==
Some reasons for human ingestion of human or other semen are erotic gratification and physical and spiritual benefits.

===Health risks===
There is no risk in ingesting the semen of a healthy man. Swallowing semen carries no additional risk other than those inherent in [[fellatio]]. Fellatio does carry some transmission risk for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[HIV]] or [[herpes]], especially for people with bleeding gums, gingivitis or open sores.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Sara. ''The Gynecological Sourcebook'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2003, ISBN 0-07-140279-9 p151&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if semen is cold before the individual ingests it, viruses can stay active for a long period of time once outside the body.

Research has  suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) might increase the risk of oral or throat cancer. The study found that 36% of the cancer patients had HPV compared to only 1% of the healthy control group.  It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV because this virus has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Oral-Sex-Linked-To-Mouth-Cancer-Risk-5772-1/ |title=Oral Sex Linked To Mouth Cancer Risk ( One of the studies conducted at the Joh...) |publisher=Bio-medicine.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantity===

The volume of semen ejaculate varies. A review of 30 studies concluded that the average was around 3.4 milliliters (ml), with some studies finding amounts as high as 4.99 ml or as low as 2.3 ml.&lt;ref name=&quot;owen&quot;&gt;[http://www.andrologyjournal.org/cgi/content/full/26/4/459 A Review of the Physical and Chemical Properties of Human Semen and the Formulation of a Semen Simulant], Derek H, Owen; David F. Katz, Journal of Andrology, Vol. 26, No. 4, July/August 2005. {{doi|10.2164/jandrol.04104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study with Swedish and Danish men, a prolonged interval between [[ejaculations]] caused an increase of the sperm count in the semen but not an increase of its amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/17/9/2468 |title=Higher sperm counts in Southern Sweden compared with Denmark |publisher=Humrep.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural practices===
In some cultures, semen is attributed with special properties of [[masculinity]]. Several tribes of [[Papua New Guinea]], including the [[Sambia people|Sambia]] and the [[Etoro people|Etoro]], believe that semen provides sexual maturation among the younger men of their tribe. To them, sperm possesses the manly nature of the tribal elders, and in order to pass down their authority and powers, younger men of their next generation must  [[fellatio|fellate]] their elders and ingest their semen. This custom commences among prepubescent males and postpubescents.&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Francoeur, Raymond J. Noonan (2004) [http://books.google.com/books?id=dciuj1-F3fYC&amp;pg=PA819 ''The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality''] p.819&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettingit.com/article/56 Semen Warriors Of New Guinea], Hank Hyena, September 16, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This act may also be attributed to the culturally active homosexuality throughout these and other tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Spiritual views===
The [[church father]] [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] records that the [[Borborites]]&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''[[Panarion]]'', 26, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and other libertine [[Gnostic]] sects&lt;ref&gt;I.e., the [[Simonians]]; Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 21, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; consumed semen as the [[Body of Christ]]. The ''[[Pistis Sophia]]''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We have heard that there are men on the earth who take the sperm of men and the flux of women, and mix them with lentils and eat them, saying, 'We believe in Esau and Jacob'&quot; (386–387). {{Cite book| authorlink = G.R.S.

===Sexual practices===
There are several sexual practices involving the ingestion of semen. They can be done with one or more partners, like [[Snowballing (sexual practice)|snowballing]], [[felching]] and [[Creampie (sexual act)|creampie eating]], or with multiple partners, like the practices of [[Bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]] and [[gokkun]], which originate from Japan.

===Increasing semen volume===
Some [[dietary supplement]]s have been marketed with claims to increase seminal volume. Like other supplements, including so-called [[herbal viagra]], these are not approved or regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (as licensed medications would be), and none of the claims have been scientifically verified.  Similar claims are made about traditional [[aphrodisiac]] foods, with an equal lack of verification.

==Euphemisms==
A huge variety of [[euphemism]]s and [[dysphemism]]s have been invented to describe semen. For a complete list of terms, see ''[[sexual slang]]''.
