'''Fornication''' typically refers to consensual [[sexual intercourse]] between two people not married to each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fornication Merriam Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; For many people, the term carries a moral or religious association, but the significance of sexual acts to which the term is applied varies between religions, societies and cultures. The definition is often disputed. In modern usage, the term is often replaced with the more judgment-neutral terms [[premarital sex]], sex before marriage or [[extramarital sex]].

==Etymology==
It is a common belief that the [[etymology|origin]] of the word derives from Latin. The word ''fornix'' means &quot;an archway&quot; or &quot;vault&quot; and it became a common [[euphemism]] for a brothel as [[prostitute]]s could be solicited in the vaults beneath [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. More directly, ''fornicatio'' means &quot;done in the archway,&quot; perhaps a reference to prostitution.

The first recorded use of the noun in its modern meaning was in 1303 AD, with the verb ''fornicate'' first recorded around 250 years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/78/F0267800.html The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religions==
{{See also|Religion and sexuality}}

===Christianity===
In the [[English translations of the Bible]] the Greek term πορνεία (''porneia'') has given rise to some dispute. The traditional translation of the term into [[English language|English]] has been ''fornication'',&lt;ref&gt;Vine's Dictionary of New Testament Words&lt;/ref&gt; but has also been translated as ''whoredom''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Young's Literal Translation]]&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent translations have preferred the alternate translation of ''[[sexual immorality]]'' or simply ''immorality''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/591-the-english-standard-version&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Fornication laws have traditionally been tied to [[religion]] and the legal and political traditions within the particular jurisdiction. Laws differ greatly from country to country. Most [[Western countries]] and some secular Muslim countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]] have no laws against fornication if both parties are above the [[age of consent]].

===United Kingdom===
In England in 1650, during the ascendancy of the [[Puritan]]s, fornication was made a felony. At the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] in 1660, this statute was not renewed, and prosecution of the mere act of fornication itself was abandoned. However, notorious and open lewdness, when carried to the extent of exciting public scandal, continued to be an indictable offence at common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|Fornication|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
[[Premarital sex]], [[adultery]], and other ethical issues arising from sexual relations between consenting heterosexuals who have reached the [[age of consent]] have generally been viewed as matters of private [[morality]], and so, have not generally been prosecuted as [[criminal offense]]s in the [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Thompson, The Journal of [[Criminal Law]], [[Criminology]], and [[Police Science]], Vol. 49, No. 4 (Nov. – Dec., 1958), pp. 350–356&lt;/ref&gt; This legal position was inherited by the [[U.S.]] from the [[U.K.]]. Later, some jurisdictions, a total of 16 in the southern and eastern [[United States]], as well as the states of [[Wisconsin]]&lt;ref&gt;Jim Thompson The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science, Vol. 49, No. 4 (Nov. – Dec., 1958), pp. 350–356, 353&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Utah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Utah Code, Title 76, Chapter 07. ''Offenses Against the Family'' |url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_07_010400.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed statutes creating the offense of &quot;fornication&quot; that prohibited ([[vagina]]l) [[sexual intercourse]] between two unmarried people of the opposite sex. Most of these laws either were repealed, were not enforced, or were struck down by the courts in several states as being odious to their state constitutions. See also ''[[State v. Saunders]]'', [[Court decision|381 A.2d 333]] (N.J. 1977), ''[[Martin v. Ziherl]]'',  [[Court decision|607 S.E.2d 367]] (Va. 2005).

Some acts may be prohibited under criminal laws defining the offense of &quot;[[sodomy]]&quot;, rather than the laws defining the offense of &quot;fornication.&quot; The U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) rendered the states' remaining laws related to &quot;sodomy&quot; unconstitutional. ''Lawrence v. Texas'' is also presumed by many to invalidate laws prohibiting fornication, as the decision declared sodomy laws unconstitutional due to the interference of such laws with private, consensual, non-commercial intimate relations between unrelated adults, and therefore are odious to the rights of liberty and privacy, such rights being retained by the people of the [[United States]].

In recent years, political debate in the [[U.S.]] about [[abstinence-only sex education]] has brought the issue of [[premarital sex]] to the forefront of the &quot;[[Culture Wars]]&quot;.
