The '''North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA)''' is a [[pedophile]] and [[pederasty]] advocacy organization in the United States that works to [[Age of consent reform|abolish age of consent laws]] criminalizing adult sexual involvement with minors,&lt;ref name= Holmes&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current perspectives on sex crimes|first=Ronald M. |last=Holmes |coauthors=Stephen T.

==Goals and positions==
NAMBLA's website states that it is a political, civil rights, and educational organization whose goal is to end &quot;the extreme oppression of men and boys in mutually consensual relationships.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welcome&quot;&gt;&quot;Who We Are.&quot; North American Man/Boy Love Association.  {{code|www.nambla.org/welcome.htm}}. Accessed 2010-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NAMBLA, some of the organization's primary positions are:
*Supporting and promoting [[Pederasty|man/boy relationships]]: they hold that when consensual these relationships are not harmful or [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=Science/&gt; One study they cite is the controversial [[Rind et al.]] paper.&lt;ref name = Lilienfeld2002&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Lilienfeld | first = SO | year = 2002 | url = http://www.haverford.edu/psych/ble/SciSoc/lilienfeld02.pdf  | title = When Worlds Collide: Social Science, Politics and the Rind et al.

*Age-of-consent reform: what NAMBLA describes as &quot;empowerment of youth in all areas, not just the sexual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welcome&quot;/&gt;

==Operations==
NAMBLA, and its affiliated organization, Zymurgy, Inc., are controlled by a Steering Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecpac&quot;/&gt; NAMBLA publications include:
*''NAMBLA Bulletin,'' a quarterly publication sent to dues-paying members&lt;ref name=&quot;thecpac&quot;/&gt; In 1996 co-founder David Thorstad stated that, &quot;The ''Bulletin'' is turning into a semi-pornographic jerk-off mag for pedophiles.&quot; Other members stated that the group only had a minority who were pedophiles, with the majority being [[pederasty|pederasts]].&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;
*''Gayme Magazine,'' a publication mailed periodically to dues-paying members and sold at some bookstores.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecpac&quot;/&gt; It was a periodical published by NAMBLA during the 1990s that became involved in obscenity lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/otoole/pdf/curley%20mem%20ord%20mot%20to%20dism.pdf Memorandum and Order on Motions to Dismiss], March 31, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

*TOPICS, a series of booklets providing more focused consideration of issues related to &quot;man-boy love&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thecpac&quot;/&gt;
*Arrel's Pages, a project through which literature concerning &quot;man-boy love&quot; was sold
*A prison newsletter&lt;ref name=&quot;thecpac&quot;/&gt;
[[Bill Andriette|William Andriette]] was the editor of the ''NAMBLA Bulletin'' and ''Gayme''.&lt;ref name='Gayhistory'&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Haggerty | first1 = George E | title = Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2000 | pages = 628 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=L9Mj7oHEwVoC&amp;pg=PA628&amp;lpg=PA628&amp;dq=Bill+Andriette+was+the+editor+of+the+NAMBLA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cbuuX49UZm&amp;sig=aoIe65ql5a-N_INB4uaRLMVdGZY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=waWOTLTbFIm8sQOBuqyUCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Events such as [[Anita Bryant]]'s &quot;[[Save Our Children]]&quot; campaign in 1977, and a police raid of [[Toronto]]-area gay newspaper ''[[The Body Politic (magazine)|The Body Politic]]'' for publishing  &quot;Men Loving Boys Loving Men&quot; set the stage for the founding of NAMBLA.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

In December 1977, police raided a house in the Boston suburb of [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]]. Twenty-four men were arrested and indicted on over 100 felony counts of the [[statutory rape]] of boys aged eight to fifteen. Suffolk County District Attorney [[Garrett Byrne]] found that the men used drugs and [[video game]]s to lure the boys into a house, where they photographed them as they engaged in sexual activity. The men were members of a &quot;sex ring&quot;, and said that the arrest was only &quot;the tip of the iceberg.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;boston&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/home/articles/boy_crazy/ |title=Boston Magazine, Boy Crazy, By Benoit Denizet-Lewis, May 2001 |publisher=Bostonmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6610eRu6g | archivedate = 2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrests sparked intense media coverage, and local newspapers published the photographs and personal information of the accused men. The &quot;Boston-Boise Committee&quot;, a [[gay rights]] organization, formed in response to these events and to protect the &quot;rights of gay men&quot; and promote &quot;gay solidarity.&quot; NAMBLA's founding was inspired by this gay rights organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/voices/gl_sexual2.htm | title = Gay Community Fights Back (1978) | accessdate = 2010-08-26 | work = We Raise Our Voices | publisher = Northeastern University | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6611tUXn0 | archivedate = 2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded by the gay historian [[David Thorstad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=L9Mj7oHEwVoC&amp;pg=PA628&amp;lpg=PA628&amp;dq=chicken+hawk+Adi+Sideman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cbuu_94M_m&amp;sig=7kCP_UPaaidtgIdRk6QvniMuu00&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U-aTTPn_CYvUtQP_x9DkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chicken%20hawk%20Adi%20Sideman&amp;f=false Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia] By George E. Haggerty p.628&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 a NAMBLA member was falsely linked to the disappearance of [[Etan Patz]]. Although the accusation was groundless, the negative publicity was disastrous to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Jenkins | first1 = Philip | title = Moral Panic: Changing Concepts of the Child Molester in Modern America | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 158 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=g_wT9QQgu1IC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=Etan+Patz+nambla&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Iyn8ctxYEh&amp;sig=tdGBPzTu3aA7StULm0BrCQwM4y8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ue5-TO2LBo-8sAOztMj0Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Etan%20Patz%20nambla&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-09-02 | isbn = 978-0-300-10963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; NAMBLA published a book documenting the events, ''A Witchhunt Foiled: The FBI vs. NAMBLA''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = A Witch-hunt foiled: The FBI vs. NAMBLA | journal = The Advocate | date = 1986-05-13 | first = Hubert | last = Kennedy | issue = 446 | pages = 54| id = | accessdate = 2010-09-10 | authorlink=Hubert Kennedy| quote = book review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In testimony before the United States Senate, NAMBLA was exonerated from any criminal activities and it concluded &quot;It is the pedophile with no organized affiliations who is the real threat to children,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=L9Mj7oHEwVoC&amp;pg=PA628&amp;lpg=PA628&amp;dq=chicken+hawk+Adi+Sideman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cbuu_94M_m&amp;sig=7kCP_UPaaidtgIdRk6QvniMuu00&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U-aTTPn_CYvUtQP_x9DkCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chicken%20hawk%20Adi%20Sideman&amp;f=false Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia] By George E. Haggerty p.627&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Echols]], the author of ''[[Steven Stayner|I Know My First Name is Steven]]'', infiltrated NAMBLA and his observations are recorded in his book, published in 1991. At one point he published the names, addresses and phone numbers of 80 suspected NAMBLA members on his website, which lead to death threats towards people who were not members.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

In 1994 NAMBLA was expelled from the International Lesbian and Gay Association, having been the first US based organization to be a member.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; ''[[Chicken Hawk: Men Who Love Boys]]'' was produced and directed by Adi Sideman in 1994. Members of NAMBLA were interviewed and presented defenses of the organization. Allen Ginsberg appeared in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Stephen | last = Holden | title = FILM REVIEW; Men Who Love Boys Explain Themselves | date = 1994-07-08 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/08/movies/film-review-men-who-love-boys-explain-themselves.html | work = New York Times | accessdate = 2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Curley v. NAMBLA|Robert and Barbara Curley]] sued NAMBLA for the wrongful death of their son.  A NAMBLA founder speculated that the case would &quot;break our backs, even if we win, which we will.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;boston&quot;/&gt; The suit was eventually dismissed.  Media reports from 2006 have suggested that for practical purposes the group no longer exists and that it consists only of a web site maintained by a few enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonmagazine.com/home/articles/boy_crazy/page2 Boy Crazy] By Benoit Denizet-Lewis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with LGBT organizations==
The first documented opposition from LGBT organizations to NAMBLA occurred in the conference that organized the [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights|first gay march on Washington in 1979]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thorstad&quot;&gt;{{citation

In 1980 a group called the &quot;Lesbian Caucus – Lesbian &amp; Gay Pride March Committee&quot; distributed a hand-out urging women to split from the annual [[Gay Pride March (New York City)|New York City Gay Pride March]] because the organizing committee had supposedly been dominated by NAMBLA and its supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;thorstad&quot;/&gt; The next year, after some lesbians threatened to picket, the [[Cornell University]] gay group Gay PAC (Gay People at Cornell) rescinded its invitation to NAMBLA founder David Thorstad to be the keynote speaker at the annual May Gay Festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;thorstad&quot;/&gt; In the following years, gay rights groups attempted to block NAMBLA’s participation in gay pride parades, prompting leading gay rights figure [[Harry Hay]] to wear a sign proclaiming &quot;NAMBLA walks with me&quot; as he participated in a 1986 gay pride march in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=hogan&gt;Hogan, Steve and Lee Hudson (1998). ''Completely Queer: The Gay and Lesbian Encyclopedia''. New York, Henry Holt and Company. ISBN 0-8050-3629-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1980s, NAMBLA was virtually alone in its positions and found itself politically isolated. Gay rights organizations, burdened by accusations of child recruitment and child abuse, had abandoned the radicalism of their early years and had &quot;retreat[ed] from the idea of a more inclusive politics,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;Johnson, Matthew D. (2004).  ''[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/nambla.html NAMBLA]'' on [[glbtq.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; opting instead to appeal more to the mainstream. Support for &quot;groups perceived as being on the fringe of the gay community,&quot; such as NAMBLA, vanished in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;

In 1994 the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) adopted a &quot;Position Statement Regarding NAMBLA&quot; saying GLAAD &quot;deplores the North American Man Boy Love Association's (NAMBLA) goals, which include advocacy for sex between adult men and boys and the removal of legal protections for children. These goals constitute a form of child abuse and are repugnant to GLAAD.&quot;  Also in 1994 the Board of Directors of the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] (NGLTF) adopted a resolution on NAMBLA that said: &quot;NGLTF condemns all abuse of minors, both sexual and any other kind, perpetrated by adults. Accordingly, NGLTF condemns the organizational goals of NAMBLA and any other such organization.&quot;

In 1994 NAMBLA, along with many members of the [[Gay Liberation Front]] participated in the &quot;The Spirit of Stonewall&quot; march which commenorated the [[Stonewall riots|1969 Stonewall Riots]].&lt;ref name= rhh&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/other_stories/documents/02511115.htm|title=The real Harry Hay|date=2002-11-07|accessdate=2008-11-16|first=Michael|last=Bronski|publisher=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Patrick Califia|Pat Califia]]&lt;ref&gt;Califa, Pat (1994). &quot;The Aftermath of the Great Kiddy-Porn Panic of '77,&quot; ''The Culture of Radical Sex.''&lt;/ref&gt; argued that politics played an important role in the gay community's rejection of NAMBLA, however, Califia has since completely repudiated his earlier support for NAMBLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2000/10/27/WB78665.DTL&amp;type=printable |title='&amp;#39;Radical Transformation'&amp;#39;, Writer Patrick Califia-Rice has long explored the fringes.

===The International Lesbian and Gay Association controversy===
In 1993, the [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|International Lesbian and Gay Association]] achieved [[United Nations]] consultative status.  NAMBLA's membership in ILGA drew heavy criticism and caused the suspension of ILGA. Many gay organizations called for the ILGA to dissolve ties with NAMBLA. Republican Senator [[Jesse Helms]] proposed a bill to withhold $119 million in U.N. contributions until U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] could certify that &quot;no UN agency grants any official status, accreditation, or recognition to any organization which promotes, condones, or seeks the legalization of [[pedophilia]], that is, the sexual abuse of children&quot;. The bill was unanimously approved by Congress and signed into law by Clinton in April 1994.

IN 1994, ILGA  expelled NAMBLA and two other groups ([[Vereniging MARTIJN|MARTIJN]] and [[Project Truth]]) because they were judged to be &quot;groups whose predominant aim is to support or promote pedophilia.&quot;  Although ILGA removed NAMBLA, the U.N. reversed its decision to grant ILGA special consultative status. Repeated attempts by ILGA to reacquire special status with the U.N. were eventually successful in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/ecosoc6242.doc.htm |title='&amp;#39;Economic and Social Council Approves Consultative Status for Three Non-Governmental Organizations Focusing on Gay, Lesbian Rights'&amp;#39;, Economic and Social Council ECOSOC/6242, December 11, 2006 |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory King of the [[Human Rights Campaign]] later said that &quot;NAMBLA is not a gay organization ... They are not part of our community and we thoroughly reject their efforts to insinuate that pedophilia is an issue related to gay and lesbian civil rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamson&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0891-2432%28199704%2911%3A2%3C178%3AMOEGMA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S |title=Gamson, Joshua (1997).

Gender and Society 11(2):178-199 |publisher=Links.jstor.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NAMBLA responded by claiming that &quot;man/boy love is by definition homosexual,&quot; that &quot;man/boy lovers are part of the gay movement and central to gay history and culture,&quot; and that &quot;homosexuals denying that it is 'not gay' to be attracted to adolescent boys are just as ludicrous as heterosexuals saying it's 'not heterosexual' to be attracted to adolescent girls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamson&quot;/&gt;

==''Curley v. NAMBLA''==
{{Main|Curley v. NAMBLA}}
In 2000, a Boston couple, Robert and Barbara Curley, sued NAMBLA for the wrongful death of their son.   According to the plaintiffs, Charles Jaynes and Salvatore Sicari, who were convicted of murdering the Curleys' son Jeffrey, &quot;stalked ... tortured, murdered and mutilated [his] body on or about October 1, 1997. Upon information and belief immediately prior to said acts Charles Jaynes accessed NAMBLA's website at the Boston Public Library.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thecpac&quot;/&gt;  The lawsuit further alleged that &quot;NAMBLA serves as a conduit for an underground network of pedophiles in the United States who use their NAMBLA association and contacts therein and the Internet to obtain  and promote pedophile activity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thecpac&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecpac.com/Curleys-v-NAMBLA.html |title=Curley v.

Citing cases in which NAMBLA members have been convicted of sexual offenses against children, Larry Frisoli, the attorney representing the Curleys, argued that it is a &quot;training ground&quot; for adults who wish to seduce children, in which men exchange strategies on how to find and groom child sex partners. Frisoli also claimed that NAMBLA has sold at its website what he called &quot;The Rape and Escape Manual&quot; that detailed how to avoid being caught and prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, Deroy (2004). &quot;[http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200402270920.asp No Boy Scouts: The ACLU defends NAMBLA.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) stepped in to defend NAMBLA as a free speech matter and won a dismissal based on the fact that NAMBLA is organized as an unincorporated association, not a corporation.  John Reinstein, the director of the ACLU Massachusetts, said that although NAMBLA &quot;may extol conduct which is currently illegal&quot;, there was nothing on its website that &quot;advocated or incited the commission of any illegal acts, including murder or rape&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reinstein, John. &quot;ACLU Agrees to Represent NAMBLA in Freedom of Speech Case.&quot; ACLU of Massachusetts Press Release, 9 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curleys continued the suit as a wrongful death action against individual NAMBLA members, some of whom were active in the group's leadership. The targets of the wrongful death suits included David Thorstad, a co-founder of NAMBLA. The Curleys alleged that Jaynes and Sicari, who were convicted of the rape and murder of their son, were members.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The lawsuit was dropped in April 2008 after a judge ruled that a key witness was not competent to testify.&lt;ref&gt;Saltzman, Jonathan.

==Purpose of NAMBLA==
NAMBLA is perceived as a front for the criminal sexual exploitation of children, functioning as a meeting place for male [[pedophilia|pedophiles]] and [[pederasty|pederasts]] and their sympathizers.

Onell R. Soto, a ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' writer, wrote in February 2005: &quot;Law enforcement officials and mental health professionals say that while NAMBLA's membership numbers are small, the group has a dangerous ripple effect through the Internet by sanctioning the behavior of those who would abuse children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;soto&quot;/&gt;

NAMBLA rejects the widely held view that sex between adults and minors is always harmful, arguing that &quot;the outcomes of personal experiences between adults and younger people primarily depend upon whether their relationships were consensual.&quot;&lt;ref name=Science&gt;[http://nambla.org/benefit.htm NAMBLA: What Does Science Have to Say?]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Samuel R. Delany]], professor and author. In extended interviews about his novel ''Hogg'' in 2004 he stated he supported a group like NAMBLA because &quot;abuse is fostered by the secrecy itself and lack of social policing&quot;. He expounded that &quot;for thousands of years, relations we assume are abusive by definition ([[child marriage]]s, [[slavery]], [[child labor]], etc.) were the social and legal norm, institutional and ubiquitous [..] behavior that we [today] find wholly unacceptable—flogging slaves, [[wife beating]], and [[child abuse|child beating]] (in the family, in the school, and at the factory)—was recommended by experts and clergymen as the most efficient and least disruptive way to maintain [social] order. All of these institutions changed, nevertheless, only when they were no longer economically feasible or beneficial to the greater society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Delany | first1 = Samuel R. | last2 = Freedman | first2 = Carl | title = Conversations with Samuel R.
