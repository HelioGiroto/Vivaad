Deforestation occurs for many reasons: trees are cut down to be used or sold as fuel (sometimes in the form of [[charcoal]]) or timber, while cleared land is used as [[pasture]] for livestock, plantations of commodities, and settlements. The removal of trees without sufficient [[reforestation]] has resulted in damage to [[habitat]], [[biodiversity]] loss and [[arid]]ity. It has adverse impacts on [[biosequestration]] of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]]. Deforestation has also been used in [[war]] to deprive an enemy of cover for its forces and also vital resources. A modern example of this was the use of [[Agent Orange]] by the United States military in Vietnam during the [[Vietnam War]]. Deforested regions typically incur significant adverse [[soil erosion]] and frequently degrade into [[wikt:wasteland|wasteland]].

Disregard or ignorance of intrinsic value, lack of ascribed value, lax forest management and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors that allow deforestation to occur on a large scale. In many countries, deforestation, both naturally occurring and human induced, is an ongoing issue. Deforestation causes [[extinction]], changes to climatic conditions, [[desertification]], and displacement of populations as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt;

==Causes==
According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat, the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is agriculture. [[Subsistence farming]] is responsible for 48% of deforestation; [[commercial agriculture]] is responsible for 32% of deforestation; [[logging]] is responsible for 14% of deforestation and fuel wood removals make up 5% of deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/pub_07_financial_flows.pdf|author=UNFCCC|title=Investment and financial flows to address climate change|work=unfccc.int|publisher=UNFCCC|page=81 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts do not agree on whether industrial logging is an important contributor to global deforestation.&lt;ref name=causesof&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/wbrobs/v14y1999i1p73-98.html|author=Arild Angelsen, David Kaimowitz|title=Rethinking the causes of deforestation: Lessons from economic models|work=The World Bank Research Observer, 14:1|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=73–98 |date=February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentresearch.wcp.muohio.edu/BiogeogDiversityDisturbance/ReflectionsDeforestCrisis.pdf|first=William F.|last=Laurance|title=Reflections on the tropical deforestation crisis|work=Biological Conservation, Volume 91, Issues 2–3|date=December 1999|pages=109–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that poor people are more likely to clear forest because they have no alternatives, others that the poor lack the ability to pay for the materials and labour needed to clear forest.&lt;ref name=causesof /&gt; One study found that population increases due to high fertility rates were a primary driver of tropical deforestation in only 8% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.freenetwork.org/resources/documents/2-5Deforestationtropical.pdf|author=Helmut J.

In 2000 the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) found that &quot;the role of population dynamics in a local setting may vary from decisive to negligible,&quot; and that deforestation can result from &quot;a combination of population pressure and stagnating economic, social and technological conditions.&quot;&lt;ref name=population1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/sd/WPdirect/WPan0050.htm|title=Population and deforestation|author=Alain Marcoux|date=August 2000|work=SD Dimensions|publisher=Sustainable Development Department, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degradation of forest ecosystems has also been traced to economic incentives that make forest conversion appear more profitable than forest conservation.&lt;ref name=economicvalue&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/external/academic/forest-es-2003-en.pdf|last=Pearce|first=David W|title=The Economic Value of Forest Ecosystems|journal=Ecosystem Health|volume= 7|issue=4|month=December|year=2001|pages=284–296|doi=10.1046/j.1526-0992.2001.01037.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important forest functions have no markets, and hence, no economic value that is readily apparent to the forests' owners or the communities that rely on forests for their well-being.&lt;ref name=economicvalue /&gt; From the perspective of the developing world, the benefits of forest as carbon sinks or biodiversity reserves go primarily to richer developed nations and there is insufficient compensation for these services. Developing countries feel that some countries in the developed world, such as the United States of America, cut down their forests centuries ago and benefited greatly from this deforestation, and that it is hypocritical to deny developing countries the same opportunities: that the poor shouldn't have to bear the cost of preservation when the rich created the problem.&lt;ref name=costarica&gt;{{cite journal|author=Erwin H Bulte; Mark Joenje; Hans G P Jansen|title=Is there too much or too little natural forest in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica?|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=30|issue=3|doi=10.1139/x99-225|year=2000|pages=495–506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have noted a shift in the drivers of deforestation over the past 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.mongabay.com/Butler_and_Laurance-TREE.pdf|author=Butler, Rhett A. and Laurance, William F.|title=New strategies for conserving tropical forests|date=August 2008|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume= 23|issue= 9|pages=469–472|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas deforestation was primarily driven by subsistence activities and government-sponsored development projects like [[transmigration program|transmigration]] in countries like [[Indonesia]] and [[colonization]] in [[Latin America]], [[India]], [[Java]], and so on, during late 19th century and the earlier half of the 20th century. By the 1990s the majority of deforestation was caused by industrial factors, including extractive industries, large-scale cattle ranching, and extensive agriculture.&lt;ref name=rud&gt;Rudel, T.K. 2005 [http://books.google.com/books?id=j4AvOb_R9h8C&amp;printsec=frontcover &quot;Tropical Forests: Regional Paths of Destruction and Regeneration in the Late 20th Century&quot;] Columbia University Press ISBN 0-231-13195-X&lt;/ref&gt;

As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes global warming, which is better known as the greenhouse effect. &lt;ref&gt;Mumoki, Fiona. “The Effects of Deforestation on our Environment Today.” Panorama.

Web. 24 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other plants remove [[carbon]] (in the form of [[carbon dioxide]]) from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] during the process of [[photosynthesis]] and release oxygen back into the atmosphere during normal respiration. Only when actively growing can a tree or forest remove carbon over an annual or longer timeframe. Both the decay and burning of wood releases much of this stored carbon back to the atmosphere. In order for forests to take up carbon, the wood must be harvested and turned into long-lived products and trees must be re-planted.&lt;ref&gt;I.C. Prentice. [http://www.grida.no/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg1/pdf/TAR-03.PDF &quot;The Carbon Cycle and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide&quot;] IPCC&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation may cause carbon stores held in soil to be released. Forests are stores of carbon and can be either sinks or sources depending upon environmental circumstances. Mature forests alternate between being net sinks and net sources of carbon dioxide (see [[carbon dioxide sink]] and [[carbon cycle]]). In deforested areas, the land heats up faster and reaches a higher temperature, leading to localized upward motions that enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/jun/HQ_04183_deforestation.html NASA Data Shows Deforestation Affects Climate In The Amazon].

Forests are also able to extract [[carbon dioxide]] and [[pollutant]]s from the air, thus contributing to biosphere stability.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Hydrological===
The water cycle is also affected by deforestation. Trees extract groundwater through their roots and release it into the atmosphere. When part of a forest is removed, the trees no longer transpire this water, resulting in a much drier climate. Deforestation reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. The dry soil leads to lower water intake for the trees to extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation|work= UN Secretary-General’s Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that [[Soil erosion|erosion]], flooding and [[landslide]]s ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|author=Daniel Rogge|work=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire|title=Deforestation and Landslides in Southwestern Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/413717.stm China's floods: Is deforestation to blame?] BBC News. August 6, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shrinking forest cover lessens the landscape's capacity to intercept, retain and [[Transpiration|transpire]] precipitation. Instead of trapping precipitation, which then percolates to groundwater systems, deforested areas become sources of surface water runoff, which moves much faster than subsurface flows. That quicker transport of surface water can translate into [[flash flood]]ing and more localized floods than would occur with the forest cover. Deforestation also contributes to decreased [[evapotranspiration]], which lessens atmospheric moisture which in some cases affects precipitation levels downwind from the deforested area, as water is not recycled to downwind forests, but is lost in runoff and returns directly to the oceans. According to one study, in deforested north and northwest China, the average annual precipitation decreased by one third between the 1950s and the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Trees, and plants in general, affect the [[water cycle]] significantly:
*their canopies intercept a proportion of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], which is then evaporated back to the atmosphere ([[Interception (water)|canopy interception]]);

As a result, the presence or absence of trees can change the quantity of water on the surface, in the soil or groundwater, or in the atmosphere. This in turn changes erosion rates and the availability of water for either ecosystem functions or human services.

The forest may have little impact on flooding in the case of large rainfall events, which overwhelm the storage capacity of forest soil if the soils are at or close to saturation.

===Soil===
[[File:Hillside_deforestation_in_Rio_de_Janeiro.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Deforestation for the use of [[clay]] in the [[Deforestation in Brazil|Brazil]]ian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The hill depicted is Morro da Covanca, in [[Jacarepaguá]]]]
Undisturbed forests have a very low rate of [[soil]] loss, approximately 2 metric [[ton]]s per square kilometer (6 short tons per square mile).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Deforestation generally increases rates of soil [[erosion]], by increasing the amount of [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and reducing the protection of the soil from tree litter. This can be an advantage in excessively leached tropical rain forest soils. Forestry operations themselves also increase erosion through the development of roads and the use of mechanized equipment.

China's [[Loess Plateau]] was cleared of forest millennia ago. Since then it has been eroding, creating dramatic incised valleys, and providing the sediment that gives the Yellow River its yellow color and that causes the flooding of the river in the lower reaches (hence the river's nickname 'China's sorrow').

Removal of trees does not always increase erosion rates. In certain regions of southwest US, shrubs and trees have been encroaching on grassland. The trees themselves enhance the loss of grass between tree canopies. The bare intercanopy areas become highly erodible. The US Forest Service, in Bandelier National Monument for example, is studying how to restore the former ecosystem, and reduce erosion, by removing the trees.

Tree roots bind soil together, and if the soil is sufficiently shallow they act to keep the soil in place by also binding with underlying [[bedrock]]. Tree removal on steep slopes with shallow soil thus increases the risk of [[landslide]]s, which can threaten people living nearby.

==Economic impact==
Damage to forests and other aspects of nature could halve [[living standard]]s for the world's [[Poverty|poor]] and reduce global [[GDP]] by about 7% by 2050, a report concluded at the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) meeting in Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7424535.stm Nature loss 'to hurt global poor'], BBC News, May 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, utilization of forest products, including timber and fuel wood, has played a key role in human societies, comparable to the roles of water and cultivable land. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for [[paper]]. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas.aaas.org/pdf/63-66.pdf Forest Products]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The forest products industry is a large part of the economy in both developed and developing countries. Short-term economic gains made by conversion of forest to agriculture, or [[over-exploitation]] of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long-term biological productivity. [[West Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many other regions have experienced lower revenue because of declining timber harvests. Illegal logging causes billions of dollars of losses to national economies annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0905.htm|work=rainforests.mongabay.com|title=Destruction of Renewable Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new procedures to get amounts of wood are causing more harm to the economy and overpower the amount of money spent by people employed in logging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgiar.org/Newsroom/releases/news.asp?idnews=663 Deforestation Across the World's Tropical Forests Emits Large Amounts of Greenhouse Gases with Little Economic Benefits, According to a New Study at CGIAR.org], December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study, &quot;in most areas studied, the various ventures that prompted deforestation rarely generated more than US$5 for every ton of carbon they released and frequently returned far less than US$1&quot;.

The forest area change may follow a pattern suggested by the [[forest transition]] (FT) theory&lt;ref name=&quot;MeyfroidtLambin2011&quot;&gt;Meyfroidt, P., Lambin, E.F. 2011. Global Forest Transition: Prospects for an End to Deforestation. ''Annual Review of Environment and Resources 36: 343-371&lt;/ref&gt;, whereby at early stages in its development a country is characterized by high forest cover and low deforestation rates (HFLD countries).&lt;ref name=rud/&gt;

Then deforestation rates accelerate (HFHD, high forest cover – high deforestation rate), and forest cover is reduced (LFHD. low forest cover – high deforestation rate), before the deforestation rate slows (LFLD, low forest cover – low deforestation rate), after which forest cover stabilizes and eventually starts recovering. FT is not a “law of nature,” and the pattern is influenced by national context (for example, human population density, stage of development, structure of the economy), global economic forces, and government policies. A country may reach very low levels of forest cover before it stabilizes, or it might through good policies be able to “bridge” the forest transition.

FT depicts a broad trend, and an extrapolation of historical rates therefore tends to underestimate future BAU deforestation for counties at the early stages in the transition (HFLD), while it tends to overestimate BAU deforestation for countries at the later stages (LFHD and LFLD).

Countries with high forest cover can be expected to be at early stages of the FT. GDP per capita captures the stage in a country’s economic development, which is linked to the pattern of natural resource use, including forests. The choice of forest cover and GDP per capita also fits well with the two key scenarios in the FT:

(i) a forest scarcity path, where forest scarcity triggers forces (for example, higher prices of forest products) that lead to forest cover stabilization; and

(ii) an economic development path, where new and better off-farm employment opportunities associated with economic growth (= increasing GDP per capita) reduce profitability of frontier agriculture and slows deforestation.&lt;ref name=rud/&gt;

==Historical causes==
{{Further|Timeline of environmental events}}

===Prehistory===
The [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt; was an event that occurred 300 million years ago. Climate change devastated tropical rainforests causing the extinction of many plant and animal species. The change was abrupt, specifically, at this time climate became cooler and drier, conditions that are not favourable to the growth of rainforests and much of the biodiversity within them. Rainforests were fragmented forming shrinking 'islands' further and further apart. This sudden collapse affected several large groups, effects on amphibians were particularly devastating, while reptiles fared better, being ecologically adapted to the drier conditions that followed.

In Europe there is little solid evidence before 7000 BC. Mesolithic [[hunter-gatherer|foragers]] used fire to create openings for [[red deer]] and [[wild boar]]. In Great Britain, shade-tolerant species such as [[oak]] and [[Ash tree|ash]] are replaced in the [[palynology|pollen record]] by [[hazel]]s, brambles, grasses and nettles. Removal of the forests led to decreased [[transpiration]], resulting in the formation of upland [[peat bog]]s. Widespread decrease in [[elm]] [[pollen]] across Europe between 8400–8300 BC and 7200–7000 BC, starting in southern Europe and gradually moving north to Great Britain, may represent land clearing by fire at the onset of [[Neolithic]] agriculture.

The [[Neolithic period]] saw extensive deforestation for [[Agriculture|farming land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254115/hand-tool/39205/Neolithic-tools|title=hand tool: Neolithic tools|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeolink.co.uk/Neolithic-Age.html|title=Neolithic Age from 4,000 BC to 2,200 BC or New Stone Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone axes were being made from about 3000 BC not just from flint, but from a wide variety of hard rocks from across Britain and North America as well. They include the noted [[Langdale axe industry]] in the [[English Lake District]], quarries developed at [[Penmaenmawr]] in [[North Wales]] and numerous other locations. Rough-outs were made locally near the quarries, and some were polished locally to give a fine finish. This step not only increased the [[mechanical strength]] of the axe, but also made penetration of wood easier. [[Flint]] was still used from sources such as [[Grimes Graves]] but from many other mines across Europe.

Evidence of deforestation has been found in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]]; for example the environs of the [[Palace of Knossos]] were severely deforested in the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Pre-industrial history===
Throughout most of history, humans were hunter gatherers who hunted within forests. In most areas, such as the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], the tropics, Central America, and the Caribbean,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.school.eb.com/comptons/article-9310969?query=deforestation&amp;ct= Encyclopćdia Britannica Online School Edition]. School.eb.com. Retrieved on 2010-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt; only after shortages of wood and other forest products occur are policies implemented to ensure forest resources are used in a sustainable manner.

In [[ancient Greece]], Tjeered van Andel and co-writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tjeerd H. van Andel, Eberhard Zangger, Anne Demitrack|title=Land Use and Soil Erosion in Prehistoric and Historical Greece|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|pages= 379–396|url=http://www.esf.edu/cue/documents/vanAndel-etal_LandUse-HistoricGreece_1990.pdf|doi=10.1179/009346990791548628}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized three regional studies of historic erosion and alluviation and found that, wherever adequate evidence exists, a major phase of erosion follows, by about 500-1,000 years the introduction of farming in the various regions of Greece, ranging from the later Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The thousand years following the mid-first millennium BC saw serious, intermittent pulses of soil erosion in numerous places. The historic [[silting]] of ports along the southern coasts of [[Asia Minor]] (''e.g.'' [[Clarus]], and the examples of [[Ephesus]], [[Priene]] and [[Miletus]], where harbors had to be abandoned because of the silt deposited by the Meander) and in coastal [[Syria]] during the last centuries BC.
[[Image:Rano Raraku quarry.jpg|thumb|Easter Island]]
[[Easter Island]] has suffered from heavy [[soil erosion]] in recent centuries, aggravated by agriculture and deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/The_Mystery_of_Easter_Island.html &quot;The Mystery of Easter Island&quot;], ''Smithsonian Magazine'', April 01, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] gives an extensive look into the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders in his book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse]]''. The disappearance of the island's trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th century. He attributed the collapse to deforestation and over-exploitation of all resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/09easter_island.htm|title=Historical Consequences of Deforestation: Easter Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/24/042.html|title=Jared Diamond, Easter Island's End}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous silting up of the harbor for [[Bruges]], which moved port commerce to [[Antwerp]], also followed a period of increased settlement growth (and apparently of deforestation) in the upper river basins. In early medieval [[Riez]] in upper [[Provence]], alluvial silt from two small rivers raised the riverbeds and widened the floodplain, which slowly buried the Roman settlement in alluvium and gradually moved new construction to higher ground; concurrently the headwater valleys above Riez were being opened to pasturage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

A typical [[progress trap]] was that cities were often built in a forested area, which would provide wood for some industry (for example, construction, shipbuilding, pottery). When deforestation occurs without proper replanting, however; local wood supplies become difficult to obtain near enough to remain competitive, leading to the city's abandonment, as happened repeatedly in Ancient [[Asia Minor]]. Because of fuel needs, mining and metallurgy often led to deforestation and city abandonment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

With most of the population remaining active in (or indirectly dependent on) the agricultural sector, the main pressure in most areas remained land clearing for crop and cattle farming. Enough wild green was usually left standing (and partially used, for example, to collect firewood, timber and fruits, or to graze pigs) for wildlife to remain viable. The elite's (nobility and higher clergy) protection of their own hunting privileges and game often protected significant woodlands.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Major parts in the spread (and thus more durable growth) of the population were played by monastical 'pioneering' (especially by the [[Benedictine]] and [[commerce|Commercial]] orders) and some [[feudal]] lords' recruiting farmers to settle (and become tax payers) by offering relatively good legal and fiscal conditions. Even when speculators sought to encourage towns, settlers needed an agricultural belt around or sometimes within defensive walls. When populations were quickly decreased by causes such as the [[Black Death]] or devastating warfare (for example, [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[Mongol]] hordes in eastern and central Europe, [[Thirty Years' War]] in Germany), this could lead to settlements being abandoned. The land was reclaimed by nature, but the [[secondary forest]]s usually lacked the original [[biodiversity]].
[[File:Rugendas - Defrichement d une Foret.jpg|thumb|Deforestation of Brazil's [[Atlantic Forest]] c.1820-1825]]
From 1100 to 1500 AD, significant deforestation took place in [[Western Europe]] as a result of the [[overpopulation|expanding human population]]. The large-scale building of wooden sailing ships by European (coastal) naval owners since the 15th century for exploration, [[Colonialism|colonisation]], [[slave trade]]–and other trade on the high seas consumed many forest resources. [[Piracy]] also contributed to the over harvesting of forests, as in Spain. This led to a weakening of the domestic economy after Columbus' discovery of America, as the economy became dependent on colonial activities (plundering, mining, cattle, plantations, trade, etc.){{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In ''Changes in the Land'' (1983), [[William Cronon]] analyzed and documented 17th-century English colonists' reports of increased seasonal flooding in [[New England]] during the period when new settlers initially cleared the forests for agriculture. They believed flooding was linked to widespread forest clearing upstream.

The massive use of [[charcoal]] on an industrial scale in [[Early Modern Europe]] was a new type of consumption of western forests; even in Stuart England, the relatively primitive production of charcoal has already reached an impressive level. Stuart England was so widely deforested that it depended on the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] trade for ship timbers, and looked to the untapped forests of [[New England]] to supply the need. Each of Nelson's [[Royal Navy]] war ships at Trafalgar (1805) required 6,000 mature oaks for its construction. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] planted [[oak]] forests to supply the French navy in the future. When the oak plantations matured in the mid-19th century, the masts were no longer required because shipping had changed.

[[Norman F. Cantor]]'s summary of the effects of late medieval deforestation applies equally well to Early Modern Europe:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman F. Cantor|title=The civilization of the Middle Ages: a completely revised and expanded edition of Medieval history, the life and death of a civilization|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0qiYM2_HhJgC|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=9 June 1994|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-092553-6|pages=564}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries. After 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 they were running short of wood for heating and cooking. They were faced with a nutritional decline because of the elimination of the generous supply of wild game that had inhabited the now-disappearing forests, which throughout medieval times had provided the staple of their carnivorous high-protein diet. By 1500 Europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster [from] which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of potatoes and maize.}}

==Industrial era==
In the 19th century, introduction of [[steamboat]]s in the United States was the cause of deforestation of banks of major rivers, such as the [[Mississippi River]], with increased and more severe flooding one of the environmental results. The steamboat crews cut wood every day from the riverbanks to fuel the steam engines. Between [[St. Louis]] and the confluence with the [[Ohio River]] to the south, the Mississippi became more wide and shallow, and changed its channel laterally. Attempts to improve navigation by the use of snagpullers often resulted in crews' clearing large trees 100 to {{convert|200|ft|m}} back from the banks. Several French colonial towns of the [[Illinois Country]], such as [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]] and St. Philippe, [[Illinois]] were flooded and abandoned in the late 19th century, with a loss to the cultural record of their [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Terry Norris, [http://books.google.com/books?id=HwH3kdOgvfAC&amp;pg=PA73 &quot;Where Did the Villages Go? Steamboats, Deforestation, and Archaeological Loss in the Mississippi Valley&quot;], in ''Common Fields: an environmental history of St. Louis'', Andrew Hurley, ed., St. Louis, MO: Missouri Historical Society Press, 1997, ISBN 978-1-883982-15-7 pp. 73–89&lt;/ref&gt;

The wholescale clearance of woodland to create agricultural land can be seen in many parts of the world, such as the [[Central forest-grasslands transition]] and other areas of the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]]. Specific parallels are seen in the 20th-century deforestation occurring in many developing nations.

===Rates===

Global deforestation sharply accelerated around 1852.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;[[E. O.

Because of this omission, the most harmful impacts of deforestation (such as habitat loss) could be increasing despite a possible decline in the global rate of deforestation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they are based largely on reporting from forestry departments of individual countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0629-deforestation.html|title=Remote sensing versus self-reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt; which do not take into account unofficial activities like illegal logging.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank estimates that 80% of logging operations are illegal in Bolivia and 42% in Colombia, while in Peru, illegal logging accounts for 80% of all logging activities.

==Control==
===Reducing emissions===
{{Main|Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation}}
Main international organizations including the United Nations and the World Bank, have begun to develop programs aimed at curbing deforestation. The blanket term [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD) describes these sorts of programs, which use direct monetary or other incentives to encourage developing countries to limit and/or roll back deforestation. Funding has been an issue, but at the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties-15 (COP-15) in Copenhagen in December 2009, an accord was reached with a collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, that will approach USD 30 billion for the period 2010–2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Copenhagen Accord of 18 December 2009 |publisher=UNFCC |year= 2009 |url= http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf |accessdate= 2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant work is underway on tools for use in monitoring developing country adherence to their agreed REDD targets. These tools, which rely on remote forest monitoring using satellite imagery and other data sources, include the [[Center for Global Development|Center for Global Development's]] FORMA (Forest Monitoring for Action) initiative &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/forestmonitoringforactionforma Forest Monitoring for Action (FORMA) : Center for Global Development : Initiatives: Active].

===Farming===
New methods are being developed to farm more intensively, such as high-yield [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] crops, [[greenhouse]], [[autonomous building]] gardens, and [[hydroponic]]s. These methods are often dependent on chemical inputs to maintain necessary yields. In cyclic [[agriculture]], cattle are grazed on farm land that is resting and rejuvenating. Cyclic agriculture actually increases the fertility of the soil. Intensive farming can also decrease soil nutrients by consuming at an accelerated rate the trace minerals needed for crop growth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}The most promising approach, however, is the concept of [[forest gardening|food forests]] in [[permaculture]], which consists of agroforestal systems carefully designed to mimic natural forests, with an emphasis on plant and animal species of interest for food, timber and other uses. These systems have low dependence on [[fossil fuels]] and [[agro-chemicals]], are highly self-maintaining, highly productive, and with strong positive impact on soil and water quality, and [[biodiversity]].

===Monitoring deforestation===
There are multiple methods that are appropriate and reliable for reducing and monitoring deforestation. One method is the “visual interpretation of aerial photos or satellite imagery that is labor-intensive but does not require high-level training in computer image processing or extensive computational resources”.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Another method includes hot-spot analysis (that is, locations of rapid change) using expert opinion or coarse resolution satellite data to identify locations for detailed digital analysis with high resolution satellite images.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Deforestation is typically assessed by quantifying the amount of area deforested, measured at the present time.
From an environmental point of view, quantifying the damage and its possible consequences is a more important task, while conservation efforts are more focused on forested land protection and development of land-use alternatives to avoid continued deforestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Deforestation rate and total area deforested, have been widely used for monitoring deforestation in many regions, including the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring by INPE.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Monitoring deforestation is a very complicated process, which becomes even more complicated with the increasing needs for resources.

===Forest management===
Efforts to stop or slow deforestation have been attempted for many centuries because it has long been known that deforestation can cause environmental damage sufficient in some cases to cause societies to collapse. In [[Tonga]], paramount rulers developed policies designed to prevent conflicts between short-term gains from converting forest to farmland and long-term problems forest loss would cause,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared ''Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed''; Viking Press 2004, pp. 301–302 ISBN 0-14-311700-9&lt;/ref&gt; while during the 17th and 18th centuries in [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared ''Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed''; Viking Press 2004, pp. 320–331 ISBN 0-14-311700-9&lt;/ref&gt; the shoguns developed a highly sophisticated system of long-term planning to stop and even reverse deforestation of the preceding centuries through substituting timber by other products and more efficient use of land that had been farmed for many centuries. In 16th century Germany landowners also developed [[silviculture]] to deal with the problem of deforestation. However, these policies tend to be limited to environments with ''good rainfall'', ''no dry season'' and ''very young [[soil]]s'' (through [[volcano|volcanism]] or [[glaciation]]). This is because on older and less fertile soils trees grow too slowly for silviculture to be economic, whilst in areas with a strong dry season there is always a risk of forest fires destroying a tree crop before it matures.

In the areas where &quot;[[slash-and-burn]]&quot; is practiced, switching to &quot;[[slash-and-char]]&quot; would prevent the rapid deforestation and subsequent degradation of soils. The [[biochar]] thus created, given back to the soil, is not only a durable [[carbon sequestration]] method, but it also is an extremely beneficial [[Soil conditioner|amendment]] to the soil. Mixed with [[biomass]] it brings the creation of [[terra preta]], one of the richest soils on the planet and the only one known to regenerate itself.

====Sustainable practices====

Certification, as provided by global certification systems such as [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] and [[Forest Stewardship Council]], contributes to tackling deforestation by creating market demand for timber from sustainably managed forests. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), &quot;A major condition for the adoption of sustainable forest management is a demand for products that are produced sustainably and consumer willingness to pay for the higher costs entailed. Certification represents a shift from regulatory approaches to market incentives to promote sustainable forest management. By promoting the positive attributes of forest products from sustainably managed forests, certification focuses on the demand side of environmental conservation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/011/i0350e/i0350e00.HTM &quot;State of the World's Forests 2009&quot;]. United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Some nations have taken steps to help increase the amount of trees on Earth.

In many parts of the world, especially in East Asian countries, reforestation and [[afforestation]] are increasing the area of forested lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Foley Jonathan A|year = 2005|title = Global Consequences of Land Use|volume = 309|issue = 5734| pages = 570–574|doi = 10.1126/science.1111772|pmid = 16040698|journal = Science|author2 = DeFries Ruth|author3 = Asner Gregory P|author4 = Barford Carol|display-authors = 4|last5 = Bonan|first5 = G|last6 = Carpenter|first6 = SR|last7 = Chapin|first7 = FS|last8 = Coe|first8 = MT|last9 = Daily|first9 = GC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of woodland has increased in 22 of the world's 50 most forested nations. Asia as a whole gained 1 million [[hectare]]s of forest between 2000 and 2005. Tropical forest in El Salvador expanded more than 20% between 1992 and 2001. Based on these trends, one study projects that global forest will increase by 10%—an area the size of India—by 2050.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.nationalgeographic.com&quot;&gt;James Owen, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/11/061113-forests.html &quot;World's Forests Rebounding, Study Suggests&quot;] National Geographic News, 13 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]], where large scale destruction of forests has occurred, the government has in the past required that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in other forest services. The government claims that at least 1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] trees have been planted in China every year since 1982. This is no longer required today, but March 12 of every year in China is the [[Planting Holiday]]. Also, it has introduced the [[Green Wall of China]] project, which aims to halt the expansion of the Gobi desert through the planting of trees. However, due to the large percentage of trees dying off after planting (up to 75%), the project is not very successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} There has been a 47-million-hectare increase in forest area in China since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.nationalgeographic.com&quot; /&gt; The total number of trees amounted to be about 35 billion and 4.55% of China's land mass increased in forest coverage. The forest coverage was 12% two decades ago and now is 16.55%.&lt;ref&gt;John Gittings, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/mar/20/worlddispatch.china &quot;Battling China's deforestation&quot;], World News, 20 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

An ambitious proposal for China is the [[Aerially Delivered Re-forestation and Erosion Control System]] and the proposed Sahara Forest Project coupled with the [[Seawater Greenhouse]].

In Western countries, increasing consumer demand for wood products that have been produced and harvested in a sustainable manner is causing forest landowners and forest industries to become increasingly accountable for their forest management and timber harvesting practices.

The [[Arbor Day Foundation]]'s Rain Forest Rescue program is a charity that helps to prevent deforestation. The charity uses donated money to buy up and preserve rainforest land before the [[lumber]] companies can buy it. The Arbor Day Foundation then protects the land from deforestation. This also locks in the way of life of the primitive tribes living on the forest land. Organizations such as [[Community Forestry International]], [[Cool Earth]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[African Conservation Foundation]] and [[Greenpeace]] also focus on preserving forest habitats. Greenpeace in particular has also mapped out the forests that are still intact&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090327183443/http://www.intactforests.org/publications/intactforests_poster_preview.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and published this information on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intactforests.org|work=intactforests.org|title=World Intact Forests campaign by Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Resources Institute in turn has made a simpler thematic map&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.web.archive.org/20100724183523/http://www.wri.org/map/worlds-forests-restoration-perspective The World's Forests from a Restoration Perspective], WRI&lt;/ref&gt; showing the amount of forests present just before the age of man (8000 years ago) and the current (reduced) levels of forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/maps/pdf/WOR_THEM_Forests.pdf|title=Alternative thematic map by Howstuffworks; in pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These maps mark the amount of afforestation required to repair the damage caused by people.

===Forest plantations===
To meet the world's demand for wood, it has been suggested by forestry writers Botkins and [[Sedjo]] that high-yielding forest [[plantations]] are suitable. It has been calculated that plantations yielding 10 cubic meters per hectare annually could supply all the timber required for international trade on 5% of the world's existing forestland. By contrast, natural forests produce about 1–2 cubic meters per hectare; therefore, 5–10 times more forestland would be required to meet demand. Forester Chad Oliver has suggested a forest mosaic with high-yield forest lands interpersed with conservation land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel B. Botkin|title=No man's garden: Thoreau and a new vision for civilization and nature|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OvF40zunJR4C&amp;pg=PA246|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=2001|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-55963-465-6|pages=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the country of Senegal, on the western coast of Africa, a movement headed by youths has helped to plant over 6 million mangrove trees. The trees will protect local villages from storm damages and will provide a habitat for local wildlife. The project started in 2008, and already the Senegalese government has been asked to establish rules and regulations that would protect the new mangrove forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenstrup|first=Allen|title=Forests|year=2010|publisher=Morgan Reynolds Publishing|location=Greensboro, North Carolina|isbn=978-1-59935-116-2|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military context==
[[File:Attack on bloody ridge.jpg|thumb|American [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] knocked out by Japanese artillery on Okinawa.]]While the preponderance of deforestation is due to demands for agricultural and urban use for the human population, there are some examples of military causes. One example of deliberate deforestation is that which took place in the U.S. [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|zone of occupation]] in Germany after World War II. Before the onset of the [[Cold War]], defeated Germany was still considered a potential future threat rather than potential future ally. To address this threat, attempts were made to [[Industrial plans for Germany|lower German industrial potential]], of which forests were deemed an element. Sources in the U.S. government admitted that the purpose of this was that the &quot;ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests.&quot; As a consequence of the practice of clear-felling, deforestation resulted which could &quot;be replaced only by long forestry development over perhaps a century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Balabkins, &quot;Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945–1948, Rutgers University Press, 1964. p. 119. The two quotes used by Balabkins are referenced to, respectively: U.S. office of Military Government, ''A Year of Potsdam: The German Economy Since the Surrender'' (1946), p. 70; and U.S. Office of Military Government, ''The German Forest Resources Survey'' (1948), p. II. For similar observations see G.W. Harmssen, ''Reparationen, Sozialproduct, Lebensstandard'' (Bremen: F. Trujen Verlag, 1948), I, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[War]] can also be a cause of deforestation, either deliberately such as through the use of [[Agent Orange]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Encyclopedia of World Environmental History&quot;. Routledge, 2004. ISBN 0-415-93733-7&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Vietnam War]] where, together with bombs and bulldozers, it contributed to the destruction of 44% of the forest cover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Patricia Marchak|title=Logging the globe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Oi-xLllDK8oC&amp;pg=PA157|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=18 September 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-1346-4|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; or inadvertently such as in the 1945 [[Battle of Okinawa]] where bombardment and other combat operations reduced the lush tropical landscape into &quot;a vast field of mud, lead, decay and maggots&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Takejiro Higa,
