The '''Three Gorges Dam''' is a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dam that spans the [[Yangtze River]] by the town of [[Sandouping]], located in [[Yiling District]], [[Yichang]], [[Hubei]] province, China. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest [[power station]] in terms of [[installed capacity]] (22,500&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]]) but is second to [[Itaipu Dam]] with regard to the generation of electricity annually.&lt;ref name=iet2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kn.theiet.org/magazine/issues/0904/taming-the-yangtze-0904.cfm# |title=Taming the Yangtze |author=Acker, Fabian |date=2009-03-02 |work=IET magazine }}{{Dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as producing electricity, the dam is intended to increase the Yangtze River's shipping capacity and reduce the potential for floods downstream by providing flood storage space.

==History==
A large dam across the Yangtze River was originally envisioned by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in ''The International Development of China'', in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lin Yang |title=China's Three Gorges Dam Under Fire |url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1671000,00.html |work=Time |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-10-23/113410303856s.shtml |title=中国国民党、亲民党、111新党访问团相继参观三峡工程_新闻中心_新浪网 |publisher=News.sina.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that a dam capable of generating 30&amp;nbsp;million horsepower (22&amp;nbsp;GW) was possible downstream of the [[Three Gorges]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2006&quot;/&gt; In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges. In 1939, [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese military forces]] occupied [[Yichang]] and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam in anticipation of a Japanese victory over China.

In 1944, the United States [[Bureau of Reclamation]] chief design engineer, [[John L. Savage]], surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasbio&quot;&gt;
[http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/jsavage.pdf John Lucian Savage Biography] by Abel Wolman &amp; W. H. Lyles, National Academy of Science, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next. In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods.&lt;ref&gt; [http://books.google.com/books?id=7SADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=G2rcTviEOcTj0QGanrDFDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAThQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;China's Dream Dam.&quot;] ''Popular Science'', July 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Some exploration, survey, economic study, and design work was done, but the government, in the midst of the [[Chinese Civil War]], halted work in 1947.

After the 1949 Communist takeover, [[Mao Zedong]] supported the project, but began the [[Gezhouba Dam]] project nearby first, and economic problems including the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]] slowed progress. After the [[1954 Yangtze River Floods]], in 1956, Mao Zedong authored &quot;Swimming&quot;, a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River. In 1958, after the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPhist&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=Washington Post | author=Steven Mufson | url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/yangtze/yangtze.htm | title= The Yangtze Dam: Feat or Folly? | date=1997-11-09 | accessdate=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the idea of a dam reemerged. The [[National People's Congress]] approved the dam in 1992: out of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 forfeited, and 25 members did not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.china.com/history/all/11025807/20110402/15882237.html |title=1992年4月3日全国人大批准兴建三峡工程 |publisher=News.rednet.cn |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction started on December&amp;nbsp;14, 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;allin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Economics==
The government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180&amp;nbsp;billion yuan (US$22.5&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref name=wpm2007/&gt; By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365&amp;nbsp;billion yuan, among which 64.613&amp;nbsp;billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557&amp;nbsp;billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195&amp;nbsp;billion yuan on financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chinaneast.xinhuanet.com/jszb/2009-01/11/content_15419027.htm |title=国家重大技术装备 |publisher=Chinaneast.xinhuanet.com |date=2009-01-11 |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the construction cost will be recovered when the dam has generated {{convert|1000|TWh|link=in}} of electricity, yielding 250&amp;nbsp;billion yuan. Full cost recovery is expected to occur ten years after the dam starts full operation.&lt;ref name=wpm2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |title=International Water Power and Dam Construction |publisher=Waterpowermagazine.com |date=2007-01-10 |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the [[Gezhouba Dam]], loans from the [[China Development Bank]], loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, [[corporate bond]]s, and revenue before and after the dam is fully operational. Additional charges were assessed as follows: Every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam has to pay ¥7.00&amp;nbsp;per MWh extra. Other provinces had to pay an additional charge of ¥4.00&amp;nbsp;per MWh. Tibet pays no surcharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Power generation is managed by [[China Yangtze Power]], a listed subsidiary of [[China Three Gorges Corporation]] (CTGC) — a Central Enterprise [[State-owned enterprise|SOE]] administered by [[SASAC]]. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity hydroelectric power station with 34&amp;nbsp;generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700&amp;nbsp;MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50&amp;nbsp;MW, making a total capacity of 22,500&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name=&quot;iet2009&quot;/&gt; Among those 32 main generators, 14 are installed in the north side of the dam, 12 in the south side, and the remaining six in the [[underground power station|underground power plant]] in the mountain south of the dam. The expected annual electricity generation will be over 100&amp;nbsp;TWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/zhibo/2008-12/04/content_15097047.htm |title=三峡机组国产化已取得成功 |language=Chinese |publisher=hb.xinhuanet.com |date=2008-12-04 |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generators===
The main generators weigh about 6,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes each and are designed to produce more than 700&amp;nbsp;MW of power. The designed [[Hydraulic head|head]] of the generator is {{convert|80.6|m|ft|sp=us}}. The flow rate varies between {{convert|600|-|950|m3/s|ft3/s}}  depending on the head available. The greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses [[Francis turbine]]s. Turbine diameter is 9.7/10.4&amp;nbsp;m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and rotation speed is 75&amp;nbsp;revolutions per minute. Rated power is 778 [[Volt ampere|MVA]], with a maximum of 840&amp;nbsp;MVA and a [[power factor]] of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20&amp;nbsp; [[Volt|kV]]. The outer diameter of the generator [[stator]] is 21.4/20.9&amp;nbsp;m. The inner diameter is 18.5/18.8&amp;nbsp;m. The stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3&amp;nbsp;m in height. Bearing load is 5050/5500 tonnes. Average efficiency is over 94%, and reaches 96.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2008-08/28/content_9723523_2.htm |title=李永安:我水轮发电机组已具完全自主设计制造能力_财经频道_新华网 |language=Chinese |agency=Xinhua News Agency  |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/~panos/444_09_4_9.pdf THREE GORGES DAM by Matthew Morioka, Alireza Abrishamkar, Yve Kay CEE 491]&lt;/ref&gt;

The generators are manufactured by two joint ventures. One of them includes [[Alstom]], [[ABB Group]], [[Kvaerner]], and the Chinese company Haerbin Motor. The other includes [[Voith]], [[General Electric]], [[Siemens]] (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some newer ones are air-cooled, which are simpler in design and manufacture and are easier to maintain.&lt;ref name=Chinacom20020726&gt;{{cite news

During the November to May dry season, power output is limited by the river's flow rate, as seen in the diagrams on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175&amp;nbsp;m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sgcc.com.cn/dwxx/qydwyxqk/lsyxqk/default.shtml |title=国家电网公司-主要水电厂来水和运行情况 |publisher=Sgcc.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sgcc.com.cn/dwxx/sgddxx/gdzdxxxt/default.shtml |title=国家电网公司-国调直调信息系统 |publisher=Sgcc.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01}} [[State Grid Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
The [[State Grid Corporation]] and [[China Southern Power Grid]] paid a flat rate of ¥250&amp;nbsp;per MWh (US$35.7) until July&amp;nbsp;2, 2008. Since then, the price has varied by province, from ¥228.7–401.8&amp;nbsp;per MWh. Higher-paying customers receive priority, such as [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ctgpc.com.cn/sx/news.php?mNewsId=29096 |title=中国长江三峡工程开发总公司 |publisher=Ctgpc.com.cn |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam.&lt;ref name=&quot;chinagate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Chinagate.com.cn

The dam was expected to provide 10% of China's power. However, electricity demand has increased more quickly than planned. Even fully operational, on average, it supports only about 1.7% of electricity demand in China in the year of 2011, when the Chinese electricity demand reached 4692.8 TWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.csee.net.cn/data/2006/0525/article_864.htm

===Erosion and sedimentation===
Two hazards are uniquely identified with the dam.&lt;ref&gt;
Topping, Audrey Ronning. Environmental controversy over the Three Gorges Dam. Earth Times News Service.&lt;/ref&gt; One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, and the other is that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40&amp;nbsp;million tons of [[sediment]] into the [[Yangtze]] annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.

The absence of silt downstream has three effects:
* Some hydrologists expect downstream riverbanks to become more vulnerable to flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://chinese.wsj.com/gb/20070829/chw110745.asp?source=baidu |title=三峡大坝之忧 |work=The Wall Street Journal  |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shanghai, more than {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on}} away, rests on a massive sedimentary plain. The &quot;arriving silt—so long as it does arrive—strengthens the bed on which Shanghai is built... the less the tonnage of arriving sediment the more vulnerable is this biggest of Chinese cities to inundation...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The dam catalyzed improved upstream [[wastewater]] treatment around [[Chongqing]] and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007 more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84&amp;nbsp;million tonnes per day, 65% of the total need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5&amp;nbsp;tonnes of solid waste every day.&lt;ref name=Xinhua20080503&gt;{{cite news

===Forest cover===
The Three Gorges area currently has 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

The [[FAO]]'s research suggests that the Asia-Pacific region will, overall, gain about 6,000 square km of forest in 2008. That is quite a turnaround from the 13,000 square km net loss of forest each year in the 1990s. The main reason is China's huge reforestation effort. This accelerated after [[1998 Yangtze River floods|severe flooding in 1998]] convinced the government that it must restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.&lt;ref&gt;

It is home to 6,388 species of plants, which belong to 238 families and 1508 genera. Of these plant species, 57 percent are endangered.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Jianguo, et al. “Three-Gorges Dam— Experiment in Habitat Fragmentation?” Science 300-5623 (May 23, 2003): 1239–1240.&lt;/ref&gt; These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Chetham, Deirdre. “Before the Deluge: The Vanishing World of the Yangtze's Three Gorges.” New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Already, the percentage of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam has dropped from twenty percent in 1950 to less than ten percent as of 2002,&lt;ref&gt;Chetham, Deirdre. “Before the Deluge: The Vanishing World of the Yangtze's Three Gorges.”&lt;/ref&gt; negatively affecting all plant species in this locality.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam contributed to the [[functional extinction]] of the [[Baiji]] Yangtze river dolphin.  Though it was close to this level even at the start of construction, the dam further decreased its habitat and increased ship travel, which are among the factors causing what will be its ultimate demise.  In addition, populations of the [[Yangtze sturgeon]] are guaranteed to be &quot;negatively affected&quot; by the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Floods, agriculture, industry==
An important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze. Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like [[Wuhan]], [[Nanjing]], and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river. Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.

The reservoir's flood storage capacity is {{convert|22|km3|acre.ft|lk=out}}. This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every ten years to once every 100&amp;nbsp;years. The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a &quot;super&quot; flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://finance.people.com.cn/GB/1039/60370/62598/63180/4385148.html |title=三峡工程的防洪作用将提前两年实现-经济-人民网 |work=People's Daily  |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chn-consulate-sapporo.or.jp/chn/ztxw/t252626.htm |title=三峡工程防洪、通航、发电三大效益提前全面发挥 |publisher=Chn-consulate-sapporo.or.jp |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2009-08-01}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1954 Yangtze River Floods|In 1954 the river flooded]] {{convert|193000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, killing 33,169&amp;nbsp;people and forcing 18,884,000&amp;nbsp;people to move.

In early August 2009, the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site. The dam limited the water flow to less than {{convert|40000|m3|cuyd}} per second, raising the upstream water level from 145.13&amp;nbsp;metres on August&amp;nbsp;1, 2009, to 152.88 on August&amp;nbsp;8, 2009. 4.27 cubic kilometres of flood water were captured and the river flow was cut by as much as 15,000 cubic metres per second.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctgpc2&quot;/&gt;

The dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season between December and March every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2009-02/18/content_1235518.htm |title=经过不懈努力三峡枢纽主体工程建设任务提前完成 |publisher=Gov.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increases the flow rate of the river downstream, and provides fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage. It also improves shipping conditions.

The water also powers the Gezhouba Dam downstream.

Since the filling of the reservoir in 2003, the Three Gorges Dam has supplied an extra 11&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometres of fresh water to downstream cities and farms during the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ctgpc.com.cn/sx/news.php?mNewsId=35412 |title=中国长江三峡工程开发总公司 |publisher=Ctgpc.com.cn |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam's reservoir rose nearly {{Convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in 24 hours and reduced the outflow to {{Convert|40000|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}} in discharges downstream, effectively alleviating serious impacts on the middle and lower river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easyseosolution.com/blog/archives/910 Three Gorges Dam will meet the first large-scale flood since being completed] July 20, 2010.

==Navigating the dam==
===Locks===
[[Image:Three gorges dam locks view from vantage point.jpg|thumb|[[lock (water transport)|Ship locks]] for river traffic to bypass the Three Gorges Dam, May 2004]]
The installation of [[lock (water transport)|ship locks]] is intended to increase river shipping from ten&amp;nbsp;million to 100&amp;nbsp;million tonnes annually, as a result transportation costs will be cut between 30 and 37%. Shipping will become safer, since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate.&lt;ref name=Xinhuar2007023/&gt; Ships with much deeper draft will be able to navigate {{convert|2400|km}} upstream from Shanghai all the way to [[Chongqing]]. It is expected that shipping to Chongqing will increase fivefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=yAgGHnENHjoC&amp;pg=PA377&amp;dq=three+gorges+dam#v=onepage&amp;q=three%20gorges%20dam&amp;f=false |title=World Regional Geography |author=Joseph J.

There are two ship locks installed near the dam. Each of them is made up of five stages, with transit time at around four hours. Maximum vessel size is 10,000&amp;nbsp;tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; That is 30&amp;nbsp;m longer than those on the [[St Lawrence Seaway]], but half as deep. Before the dam was constructed, the maximum freight capacity at the Three Gorges site was 18.0&amp;nbsp;million tonnes per year. From 2004 to 2007, a total of 198&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of freight passed through the locks. The freight capacity of the river increased six&amp;nbsp;times and the cost of shipping was reduced by 25%. The total capacity of the ship locks is expected to reach 100&amp;nbsp;million tonnes per year.&lt;ref name=Xinhuar2007023/&gt;

These locks are [[Lock gates#Special cases|staircase locks]], whereby inner lock gate pairs serve as both the upper gate and lower gate.  The [[Lock gates#Variations|gates]] are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable. As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic, this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks.

===Ship lifts===
In addition to the canal locks, a [[boat lift|ship lift]], a kind of elevator for vessels, is under construction. The ship lift is designed to be capable of lifting ships of up to 3,000&amp;nbsp;tons.&lt;ref name=Bbc2005050&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The original plans specified a lift with the capacity to lift 11,500&amp;nbsp;ton vessels. The vertical distance traveled will be 113 metres,&lt;ref name=ChinaThreeGorgesProject&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the size of the ship lift's basin will be 120x18x3.5 metres. The ship lift, when completed, will take 30 to 40 minutes to transit, as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks.&lt;ref name=Bbc050504&gt;{{cite news

However, the municipal government explained that the relocation is due to urbanization, rather than the dam, and people involved included other areas of the municipality.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccdv20071116&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Allegedly, funds for relocating 13,000 farmers around Gaoyang disappeared after being sent to the local government, leaving residents without compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1925172.stm

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural and historical relics are being moved to higher ground as they are discovered, but the flooding inevitably covered undiscovered relics. Some sites could not be moved because of their location, size, or design. For example, the [[hanging coffins]] site high in the [[Shen Nong Stream|Shen Nong Gorge]] is part of the cliffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogan&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===National security===
The [[United States Department of Defense]] reported that in [[Taiwan]], “proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to China's urban population or high-value targets, such as the Three Gorges Dam, will deter Chinese military coercion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion that the [[Military of the Republic of China|military in Taiwan]] would seek to destroy the dam provoked an angry response from the mainland Chinese media. [[People's Liberation Army]] General [[Liu Yuan (politician)|Liu Yuan]] was quoted in the ''[[China Youth Daily]]'' saying that the People's Republic of China would be &quot;seriously on guard against threats from [[Taiwan independence]] terrorists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Structural integrity===
Days after the first filling of the reservoir, around 80 hairline cracks were observed in the dam's structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://internationalrivers.org/en/china/three-gorges-dam |title=Three Gorges Dam |publisher=International Rivers |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams|first=Jerry |url= http://www.awesomelibrary.org/Library/Local_Information/Asia/China/Three_Gorges_Dam.html |title=Three Gorges Dam |work=Electronic Data Interchange |publisher=Awesome Library |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.loe.org/series/3gorges/ |title=Three Gorges Dam |publisher=Living On Earth |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of [[cavitation]], similar to what severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]] in the US state of [[Arizona]], which was unable to properly withstand the [[Risks of the Glen Canyon Dam#Colorado River Floods of 1983|Colorado river floods of 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Hannon.

An experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aqsiq.gov.cn/zjxw/zjxw/zjftpxw/200907/t20090721_122359.htm |title=三峡工程质量处于良好受控状态 |publisher=Aqsiq.gov.cn |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upstream dams==
[[Image:Yangtze longitudinal profile upstream.JPG|thumb|Longitudinal profile of upstream Yangtze River]]
In order to maximize the utility of the Three Gorges Dam and cut down on sedimentation from the [[Jinsha River]], upstream of the Yangtze River before reaching [[Yibin]] in [[Sichuan]], authorities plan to build a series of dams downstream of Jinsha, including [[Wudongde Dam]], [[Baihetan Dam]], [[Xiluodu Dam]], and [[Xiangjiaba Dam]]. The total capacity of those four dams is 38,500&amp;nbsp;MW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chinapower.com.cn/newsarticle/1008/new1008554.asp |title=中国三峡总公司拟在金沙江上建４座梯级水电站 总装机容量为３８５０万千瓦_中国电力网(www.chinapower.com.cn)新闻中心 |publisher=chinapower.com.cn |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost double the capacity of the Three Gorges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
