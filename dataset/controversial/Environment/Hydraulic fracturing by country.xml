[[Hydraulic fracturing]] has become a contentious environmental and health issue with France banning the practice and a moratorium in place in New South Wales (Australia), Karoo basin (South Africa), Quebec (Canada), and some of the states of the US.

==Australia==
Up until the mid 2000s, hydraulic fracturing was generally limited to conventional oil and gas wells in the [[Cooper Basin]]. This was limited to one, two or sometimes zero ongoing fracturing operations.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The vast majority of coal seam gas wells have not been hydraulically fractured as the wells presently being drilled are in coal seams that have good natural permeability.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The NSW Government has banned [[BTEX]] chemicals as additives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trade.nsw.gov.au/policy/TI-O-120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bulgaria==
A number of protests occurred in Bulgaria after the government's decision to grant an approval for [[Chevron Corporation]] to research the possibilities of [[shale gas]] extraction in the country's northeast in 2011. After a nationwide protest in January 2012, the government decided to ban the hydraulic fracturing technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesofiaecho.com/2012/01/17/1746998_bulgaria-says-chevron-cannot-use-fracking-to-search-for-shale-gas Bulgaria says Chevron cannot use fracking to search for shale gas], The Sofia Echo, 17 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
Fracking has been in use in Canada at an industrial level since the 1990s. Concerns about fracking began in late July 2011, when the [[Government of British Columbia]] gave [[Talisman Energy]] a long-term water licence to draw water from the [[BC Hydro]]-owned [[Williston Lake]] [[reservoir]], for a twenty year term. Fracking has also received criticism in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], and the Nova Scotia government is currently reviewing the practice, with recommendations expected in March 2012. The practice has been temporarily suspended, in [[Quebec]], pending an environmental review. The [[Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives]] has also expressed concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/07/29/bc-talisman-fracking.html|title=Northern B.C. fracking licence concerns critics |date=July 29, 2011 |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
China completed its first horizontal shale gas well in 2011. A global shale gas study by the US [[Energy Information Administration]] said China's technically recoverable shale gas reserves were almost 50% higher than those of the number two nation, the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watts 27Feb2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/apr/21/china-shale-gas-well |title=China takes step towards tapping shale gas potential with first well |author=Jonathan Watts |date=21 April 2011 |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denmark==
In 2012, the first research has begun in North Jutland where 80% of underground gas has been commissioned for extraction by Total E&amp;P Denmark B.V., a subsidy of the multinational company [[Total S.A.]]. The remaining 20% have been commissioned to the Danish State's oil- and gas company Nordsøfonden. The research is due for completion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skifergas.dk/en/shale-gas-in-denmark.aspx Total website on shale gas operations in Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a critical view is reflected in national media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE1344114/danmark-satser-paa-kontroversiel-gas/|title=Denmark attempts controversial gas |date=July 23, 2011 |publisher=[[Politiken.dk]] |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national campaigns against shale gas have started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skifergasnejtak.dk Protest campaign: &quot;Shale gas no thanks&quot; - skifergasnejtak.dk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
Hydraulic fracturing was banned in France in 2011 after public pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bweek 31.03.2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_15/b4223060759263.htm |title=The French Public Says No to {{'}}''Le Fracking''{{'}} |author=Tara Patel |date=31 March 2011 |newspaper=Businessweek |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bweek 04.10.2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-04/france-to-keep-fracking-ban-to-protect-environment-sarkozy-says.html |title=France to Keep Fracking Ban to Protect Environment, Sarkozy Says |author=Tara Patel |date=4 October 2011 |newspaper=Businessweek |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
In Northern Ireland, Tamboran Resources has tested sites in [[County Fermanagh]] which they claim could supply gas to Northern Ireland for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16823664|title=Fermanagh shale gas 'could supply Northern Ireland' |publisher=BBC |date=February 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamboran Resources also has a license for gas exploration and plan to proceed hydraulic fracturing in the [[Lough Allen]] basin area of [[County Leitrim]]. The CEO of Tamboran Resources has declared a “zero-chemical hydraulic fracturing” pledge. The Protest group &quot;No Fracking Ireland&quot; has been set up by locals of counties Leitrim, [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]] and [[County Sligo|Sligo]] and petitions against hydraulic fracturing are still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leitrimobserver.ie/news/zero_chemical_promise_on_fracking_is_not_enough_1_3019372|title=|date=September 1, 2011 |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |accessdate=2012-01-03}} Local bans are in place in five counties of the Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
{{Main|Hydraulic fracturing in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], hydraulic fracturing is part of petroleum exploration and extraction on a small scale mainly in Taranaki and concerns have been raised by environmentalists.

On 28 March 2012, Dr Jan Wright, NZ Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment announced her office would lead an independent investigation into the practice of hydraulic fracturing or fracking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pce.parliament.nz/media/media-releases/pce-to-investigate-fracking/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poland==
Poland is busy aggressively developing its shale gas reserves, thought to be the largest in Europe, though the latest estimate is significantly lower than that previously provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webb 24May2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/naturalresources/article3033728.ece |title=Shale gas extraction given clean bill of health by MPs |author=Tim Webb |date=24 May 2011 |newspaper=The Sunday Times |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg 02Mar2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-02/poland-says-22-shale-gas-wells-underway-planned-for-this-year.html |title=Poland Says 22 Shale Gas Wells Under Way or Planned in 2012 |author=Marek Strzelecki |date=2 March 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Polish Geological Institute study published in March 2012 concluded that, while fracking at one site had produced toxic waste, the latter was reused and did not harm the environment,&lt;ref name=&quot;WAPO 02Mar2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/polish-report-shale-gas-procedure-produces-toxic-refuse-but-does-not-harm-environment/2012/03/02/gIQAvwSamR_story.html |title=Polish report: shale gas procedure produces toxic refuse but does not harm environment |date=2 March 2012 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=WashingtonPost.com |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though critics said the study was carried out at the start of exploration in Poland and does not reflect dangers from a long-term activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP 02Mar2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/polish-report-shale-gas-extraction-harmful-15832525 |title=Polish Report: Shale Gas Extraction Not Harmful |author=Monika Scislowska |date=2 March 2012 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ABC.com |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale fracking in Poland would relieve some of the EU's dependency on Russian gas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 09Feb2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-poland-shalegas-idUSTRE8180PM20120209 |title=Insight: Poland's shale gas play takes on Russian power |author1=Michael Kahn |author2=Braden Reddall |author3=Gabriela Baczynska |date=9 February 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Indie 27Sep2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/polands-shale-gas-dilemma-for-europe-2361570.html |title=Poland's Shale Gas dilemma for Europe |author=Mary Dejevksy |date=27 September 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the East European state is densely populated and has a large agricultural sector, meaning the massive amounts of water required for fracking have raised additional concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urbina 30Dec2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/world/south-african-farmers-see-threat-from-fracking.html |title=Hunt for Gas Hits Fragile Soil, and South Africans Fear Risks |author=Ian Urbina |date=30 December 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=23 February 2012 |quote=Covering much of the roughly 800 miles between Johannesburg and Cape Town, this arid expanse—its name [Karoo] means &quot;thirsty land&quot;—sees less rain in some parts than the Mojave Desert.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
There is currently a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in South Africa's [[Karoo]] region despite the interest of several energy companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urbina 30Dec2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/21/us-safrica-fracking-idUSTRE73K45620110421 |title=S.Africa imposes &quot;fracking&quot; moratorium in Karoo |publisher=Reuters.com |date=April 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ban was lifted on 7 September 2012 and the decision was condemned by environmental campaigners, despite the fact that it will bring new jobs to poor and deprived areas of [[South Africa]]. One study has shown that the region of [[Karoo]] could hold enough gas to supply [[South Africa]] for 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Despite these benefits, activists vehemently opposed the move by the government and made a series of well-publicised protests at the end of September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|Hydraulic fracturing in the United Kingdom}}
Fracking is carried out in the United Kingdom by Cuadrilla Resources, though other companies have exploration licenses. Though not officially suspended, the process was unofficially suspended for nearly a year in the UK from June 2011 over safety concerns, but an expert report in April 2012 concluded the practice was safe, clearing the way for its resumption.&lt;ref name = &quot;FiHa 17Apr2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/apr/17/gas-fracking-gets-green-light |title= Gas 'fracking' gets green light |author= Fiona Harvey |date= 17 April 2012 |newspaper= The Guardian |accessdate= 17 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protest groups have emerged since April 2012, with the major nationwide group being [[Frack Off]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15021328 |last=Melley |first=James |date=28 September 2011 |title=New groups protest at shale gas |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Main|Hydraulic fracturing in the United States}}
Hydraulic fracturing is the practice of injecting liquid into a well to clear obstructions in the reservoir, in order to rejuvenate the well. The technique has been applied to water, oil, and gas wells. A modification of this technique, called slickwater fracking, was used in Texas in 1998 to drill for natural gas from the Barnett Shale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebreakthrough.org/blog/2011/12/interview_with_dan_steward_for.shtml |title=Interview with Dan Steward, Former Mitchell Energy Vice President |date=20 December 2011 |work=Breakthrough blog |publisher=The Breakthrough Institute |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Shale has cracks, which can collect gas if there are [[Oil_shale |hydrocarbons present in the shale]]. Fracking is used to create a reservoir in the shale by enlarging the cracks and extending them, and by inserting sand to prop the cracks open. This type of drilling was made possible by a number of advances in [[directional drilling]] and microseismic 3-dimensional imaging supported by the Department of Energy and other federal agencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-boom-in-shale-gas-credit-the-feds/2011/12/07/gIQAecFIzO_story.html |title=A boom in shale gas? Credit the feds |author=Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus |date=16 December 2011 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drilling into shale now accounts for 30 percent of US gas production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bweek 13.10.2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-13/new-jersey-senate-committee-again-passes-gas-fracking-ban.html  |title=New Jersey Senate Committee Again Passes Gas-Fracking Ban |author=Terrence Dopp |date=13 February 2012 |newspaper=Businessweek |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of drilling has become controversial because of the complaints, from some residents of the areas, about pollution, and health effects, and a sense that their lives and their community have been ruined by the system. 

Hydraulic fracturing for the purpose of oil, natural gas, and geothermal production was exempted under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
