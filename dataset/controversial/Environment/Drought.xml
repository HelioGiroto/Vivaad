A '''drought''' is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply whether surface or underground water. Generally, this occurs when a region receives consistently below average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. It can have a substantial impact on the [[ecosystem]] and [[agriculture]] of the affected region. Although droughts can persist for several years, even a short, intense drought can cause significant damage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml Living With Drought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and harm the local [[economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/environmental/Australian-Drought.html Australian Drought and Climate Change], retrieved on June 7th 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Huntington Desert Garden Cactus (etc).jpg|thumb|250px|Succulent plants are well-adapted to survive long periods of drought.]]
Many plant species, such as cacti, have adaptations such as reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought. Some others survive dry periods as buried seeds. Semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands. &lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2007. [http://www.amazon.com/Plants-Vegetation-Origins-Processes-Consequences/dp/0521864801 Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity.

This global phenomenon has a widespread impact on agriculture. Lengthy periods of drought have long been a key trigger for [[mass migration]] and played a key role in a number of ongoing migrations and other humanitarian crises in the [[Horn of Africa]] and the [[Sahel]].

== Consequences ==
[[File:Drought.jpg|thumb|Dry earth in the [[Sonoran desert]], [[Mexico]].]]
Periods of drought can have significant environmental, agricultural, health, economic and social consequences. The effect varies according to vulnerability. For example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food sources. Areas with populations that depend on  as a major food source are more vulnerable to drought-triggered famine. 

Drought can also reduce water quality, because lower water flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase [[contamination]] of remaining water sources. Common consequences of drought include:
* Diminished [[crop yield|crop growth or yield productions]] and carrying capacity for [[livestock]]
* [[Dust bowl]]s, themselves a sign of [[erosion]], which further erode the [[landscape]]
* [[Dust storms]], when drought hits an area suffering from desertification and [[erosion]]
* [[Famine]] due to lack of water for [[irrigation]]
* [[Habitat]] damage, affecting both [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] and [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] wildlife&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010.

* [[Malnutrition]], [[dehydration]] and related diseases
* [[Mass migration]], resulting in [[internally displaced person|internal displacement]] and international [[refugee]]s
* Reduced [[electricity generation|electricity production]] due to reduced water flow through [[hydroelectric energy|hydroelectric]] [[dam]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyestimate.com/article.asp?idcategory=35&amp;idSub=175&amp;idArticle=12286 Drought affecting US hydroelectric production | Daily Estimate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Drought is a normal, recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world. It is among the earliest documented climatic events, present in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and tied to the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s arrival in and the later [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/bible_drought.shtml BBC - Weather Centre - Features - History and Religion - Weather in the Bible - Drought and Famine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter-gatherer migrations in 9,500 BC Chile have been linked to the phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1024_021024_ChileAtacama.html Ancient Chile Migration Mystery Tied to Drought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as has the exodus of early humans [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa]] and into the rest of the world around 135,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azstarnet.com/all-headlines/205715m/ Drought pushed ancient African immigration ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation. Failure to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era, exacerbated by [[population growth|ever-increasing]] population densities.

Recurring droughts leading to [[desertification]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] have created grave [[ecological]] [[Disaster|catastrophes]], prompting massive [[1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia|food shortages]], [[2006 Horn of Africa food crisis|still recurring]].&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Sara Pantuliano and Sara Pavanello (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3591&amp;title=drought-livelihoods-pastoralists-humanitarian Taking drought into account Addressing chronic vulnerability among pastoralists in the Horn of Africa] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; To the north-west of the Horn, the Darfur conflict in neighboring [[Sudan]], also affecting [[Chad]], was fueled by decades of drought; combination of drought, [[desertification]] and [[overpopulation]] are among the causes of the Darfur conflict, because the [[Arab]] [[Baggara]] [[nomads]] searching for water have to take their livestock further south, to land mainly occupied by non-Arab farming peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/db/blogs/1265/2007/06/30-100806-1.htm Looking to water to find peace in Darfur]&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the largest part of [[Australia]] is [[Deserts of Australia|desert]] or semi-arid lands commonly known as the [[outback]].

Generally, rainfall is related to the amount and dew point [determined by air temperature] of water vapour carried by regional atmosphere, combined with the upward forcing of the air mass containing that water vapour. If these combined factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficient to reach the surface, the result is a drought. This can be triggered by high levels of reflected sunlight, [high albedo], and above average prevalence of high [[pressure system]]s, [[wind]]s carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses (i.e. reduced water content), and ridges of [[high pressure area]]s form with behaviors which prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region. Oceanic and atmospheric weather cycles such as the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) make drought a regular recurring feature of the Americas along the Midwest and Australia. ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' author [[Jared Diamond]] sees the stark impact of the multi-year ENSO cycles on Australian weather patterns as a key reason that [[Australian aborigines]] remained a [[hunter-gatherer society]] rather than adopting agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]] by [[Jared Diamond]] 1997, pgs 308-309&lt;/ref&gt;  Another climate oscillation known as the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] has been tied to droughts in northeast Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~wsoon/ChristopherMonckton08-d/Vicente-SerranoCuadrat07-NAOonNESpainDroughts.pdf|title=North Atlantic oscillation control of droughts in north-east Spain: evaluation since 1600 A.D.|author=Sergio M.

As a drought persists, the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases. People tend to define droughts in three main ways:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/brochures/climate/Drought.pdf [[NOAA]] factsheet], retrieved April 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] drought is brought about when there is a prolonged period with less than average precipitation. Meteorological drought usually precedes the other kinds of drought.
# [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] droughts are droughts that affect crop production or the ecology of the [[Range (biology)|range]]. This condition can also arise independently from any change in precipitation levels when [[soil]] conditions and erosion triggered by poorly planned agricultural endeavors cause a shortfall in water available to the crops. However, in a traditional drought, it is caused by an extended period of below average precipitation.
# [[Hydrology|Hydrological]] [[Meteorology|drought]] is brought about when the water reserves available in sources such as [[aquifer]]s, [[lake]]s and [[reservoir]]s fall below the [[statistical]] [[average]]. Hydrological drought tends to show up more slowly because it involves stored water that is used but not replenished. Like an agricultural drought, this can be triggered by more than just a loss of rainfall. For instance, [[Kazakhstan]] was recently awarded a large amount of money by the [[World Bank]] to restore water that had been diverted to other nations from the [[Aral Sea]] under [[Soviet]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6538219.stm BBC article on the World Bank loan to save the Aral Sea]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar circumstances also place their largest lake, [[Lake Balkhash|Balkhash]], at risk of completely drying out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3397077.stm BBC article from 2004 concerning the risk of Kazakhstan losing the lake]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protection and relief ==

Strategies for drought protection, mitigation or relief include:
* [[Dam]]s - many dams and their associated reservoirs supply additional water in times of drought.
* [[Cloud seeding]] - an artificial technique to induce rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-07/24/content_351196.htm Cloud seeding helps alleviate drought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Desalination]] of sea water for irrigation or consumption.
* Drought monitoring - Continuous observation of rainfall levels and comparisons with current usage levels can help prevent man-made drought. For instance, analysis of water usage in [[Yemen]] has revealed that their [[water table]] (underground water level) is put at grave risk by over-use to fertilize their [[Khat]] crop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm BBC's] [[From Our Own Correspondent]] on khat water usage&lt;/ref&gt; Careful monitoring of moisture levels can also help predict increased risk for wildfires, using such metrics as the [[Keetch-Byram Drought Index]]&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; or [[Palmer Drought Index]].
* Land use - Carefully planned [[crop rotation]] can help to minimize [[erosion]] and allow farmers to plant less water-dependent crops in drier years.
* [[Outdoor water-use restriction]] - Regulating the use of sprinklers, hoses or buckets on outdoor plants, filling pools, and other water-intensive home maintenance tasks.
* [[Rainwater harvesting]] - Collection and storage of rainwater from roofs or other suitable catchments.
* [[Recycled water]] - Former wastewater (sewage) that has been treated and purified for reuse.
* [[Transvasement]] - Building canals or redirecting rivers as massive attempts at [[irrigation]] in drought-prone areas.
