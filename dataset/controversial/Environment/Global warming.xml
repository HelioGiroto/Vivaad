{{Main|Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse effect|Radiative forcing|Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere}}
The greenhouse effect is the process by which [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[Emission spectrum|emission]] of [[infrared]] radiation by gases in the [[atmosphere]] warm a [[planet]]'s lower atmosphere and surface. It was proposed by [[Joseph Fourier]] in 1824 and was first investigated quantitatively by [[Svante Arrhenius]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Studies in 2011 have indicated that solar activity may be slowing, and that the next solar cycle could be delayed. To what extent is not yet clear; Solar Cycle 25 is due to start in 2020, but may be delayed to 2022 or even longer. It is even possible that the Sun could be heading towards another [[Maunder Minimum]]. While there is not yet a definitive link between solar sunspot activity and global temperatures, the scientists conducting the solar activity study believe that global greenhouse gas emissions would prevent any possible cold snap.&lt;ref&gt;Jaggard, Victoria.

== Feedback ==
{{Main|Climate change feedback}}
[[File:Aerial view of the edge of the ice in Nunavut 2.jpg|thumb|left|Sea ice, shown here in [[Nunavut]], in northern Canada, reflects more sunshine, while open ocean absorbs more, accelerating melting.]]
[[Feedback]] is a process in which changing one quantity changes a second quantity, and the change in the second quantity in turn changes the first. [[Positive feedback]] increases the change in the first quantity while [[negative feedback]] reduces it. Feedback is important in the study of global warming because it may amplify or diminish the effect of a particular process.

The main positive feedback in the climate system is the [[water vapor feedback]]. The main negative feedback is [[radiative cooling]] through the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], which increases as the fourth power of temperature. Positive and negative feedbacks are not imposed as assumptions in the models, but are instead [[emergent properties]] that result from the interactions of basic dynamical and thermodynamic processes.

A wide range of potential feedback processes exist, such as [[Arctic methane release]] and [[ice-albedo feedback]]. Consequentially, potential [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping points]] may exist, which may have the potential to cause [[abrupt climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0705414105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the &quot;emission scenarios&quot; used by IPCC in its 2007 report primarily examined greenhouse gas emissions from human sources. In 2011, a joint study by the US [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] calculated the additional greenhouse gas emissions that would emanate from melted and decomposing permafrost, even if policymakers attempt to reduce human emissions from the A1FI scenario to the A1B scenario.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSDIC_permafrost_study&quot; /&gt; The team found that even at the much lower level of human emissions, permafrost thawing and decomposition would still result in {{val|190|u=Gt}} C of permafrost carbon being added to the atmosphere on top of the human sources. Importantly, the team made three extremely conservative assumptions: (1) that policymakers will embrace the A1B scenario instead of the A1FI scenario, (2) that all of the carbon would be released as carbon dioxide instead of methane, which is more likely and over a 20 year lifetime has [[Global warming potential#Values|72x the greenhouse warming power of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and (3) their model did not project additional temperature rise caused by the release of these additional gases.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSDIC_permafrost_study&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CP-Permafrost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Romm |first=Joe |url=http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/02/17/207552/nsidc-thawing-permafrost-will-turn-from-carbon-sink-to-source-in-mid-2020s-releasing-100-billion-tons-of-carbon-by-2100/ |title=NSIDC bombshell: Thawing permafrost feedback will turn Arctic from carbon sink to source in the 2020s, releasing 100&amp;nbsp;billion tons of carbon by 2100 |publisher=ThinkProgress |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These very conservative permafrost carbon dioxide emissions are equivalent to about 1/2 of all carbon released from fossil fuel burning since the dawn of the Industrial Age,&lt;ref name=&quot;SciDaily-permafrost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110216132100.htm |title=Thawing permafrost likely will accelerate global warming, study finds |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0889.2011.00527.x |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is enough to raise atmospheric concentrations by an additional {{val|87|29|ul=ppm}}, beyond human emissions.

Other research published in 2011 found that increased emissions of methane could instigate significant feedbacks that amplify the warming attributable to the methane alone. The researchers found that a 2.5-fold increase in methane emissions would cause indirect effects that increase the warming 250% above that of the methane alone. For a 5.2-fold increase, the indirect effects would be 400% of the warming from the methane alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A [[climate model]] is a [[mathematical models|computerized representation]] of the five components of the climate system: [[Earth's Atmosphere|Atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[cryosphere]], land surface, and [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexessglossary-a-d.html Glossary A-D]: &quot;Climate Model&quot;, in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such models are based on physical principles including [[fluid dynamics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[radiative transfer]]. There can be components which represent air movement, temperature, clouds, and other atmospheric properties; ocean temperature, [[salinity|salt content]], and [[ocean circulation|circulation]]; ice cover on land and sea; the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere; chemical and biological processes; and others.

Although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible, simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system. Results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model's climate sensitivity. For example, the uncertainty in IPCC's 2007 projections is caused by (1) the use of multiple models&lt;ref name=&quot;meehl 2007 global warming projections&quot;&gt;

The models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes. One of the mathematical results of these complex equations is a prediction whether warming or cooling will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Models are also used to help investigate the [[Attribution of recent climate change|causes of recent climate change]] by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human-derived causes. Although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects, they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by man-made greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=Hegerl-2001/&gt;

The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.&lt;ref&gt;Randall ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch8.html Chapter 8, Climate Models and Their Evaluation], Sec.

This trend corresponds to a hydrological sensitivity (HS) of 7% K−1 of global warming, which is close to the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) rate expected from the increase in saturation water vapor pressure with temperature. Analysis of two available global ocean evaporation datasets confirms this observed intensification of the atmospheric water cycle. The observed hydrological sensitivity over the past 20-yr period is higher by a factor of 5 than the average HS of 1.4% K−1 simulated in state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere–ocean climate models for the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

&quot;Detection&quot; is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined [[statistics|statistical]] sense, without providing a reason for that change. Detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause. &quot;Attribution&quot; of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/annexessglossary-a-d.html Glossary A-D]: &quot;Detection and attribution&quot;, in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.

=== Natural systems ===

{{Main|Physical impacts of climate change}}

Global warming has been detected in a number of natural systems. Some of these changes are described in the section on [[Global warming#Observed temperature changes|observed temperature changes]], e.g., [[Current sea level rise|sea level rise]] and widespread decreases in [[snow]] and [[ice]] extent.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipcc.ch&quot;&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spm.html Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spms1.html Section 1: Observed changes in climate and their effects], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the increase in global average temperature since the mid-20th century is, with high probability,{{Cref2|D}} attributable to human-induced changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spm.html Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spms2.html Section 2: Causes of change], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with policies to reduce emissions, global emissions are still expected to continue to grow over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;IPCC AR4 SYR 2007&quot;&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spm.html Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spms3.html Section 3: Projected climate change and its impacts], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The following sentence is probably true, but it needs a citation as it is OR synthesis:  Over the course of the 21st century, increases in emissions at or above their rate as of 2012 would very likely induce changes in the climate system larger than those observed in the 20th century.--&gt;

In the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, across a range of future emission scenarios, model-based estimates of sea level rise for the end of the 21st century (the year 2090–2099, relative to 1980–1999) range from 0.18 to 0.59&amp;nbsp;m. These estimates, however, were not given a likelihood due to a lack of scientific understanding, nor was an upper bound given for sea level rise. On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the melting of [[ice sheet]]s could result in even higher sea level rise. Partial deglaciation of the [[Greenland ice sheet]], and possibly the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]], could contribute 4–6&amp;nbsp;metres (13 to 20&amp;nbsp;ft) or more to sea level rise.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/spm.html WG2 Summary for Policymakers], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/spmsspm-c-15-magnitudes-of.html Magnitudes of impact], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land, with most warming at high northern [[latitudes]], and least warming over the [[Southern Ocean]] and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;IPCC AR4 SYR 2007&quot;/&gt; Snow cover area and sea ice extent are expected to decrease, with the Arctic expected to be largely ice-free in September by 2037.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=M|coauthors=J.E.

It is calculated that, with [[confidence interval|high statistical confidence]], certain weather events, such as the heat waves in [[Texas]] and the [[2003 European heat wave]], would not have occurred without global warming. Extremely hot outliers, defined as three [[standard deviation]]s from climatology records, now cover about 10% of the land surface and, under present trends, would be the norm by 2050. These temperatures are expected to excaberate the hydrological cycle, with more intense [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=James Hansen |authorlink=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Reto Ruedy |year=August 2012 |title=Perception of climate change |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=109 |issue=32 |pages= |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205276109 |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/07/30/1205276109 |accessdate=August 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect on hurricane activity is less certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emanuel|first=Kerry|coauthors=Sundararajan, Williams |title=Hurricanes and Global Warming: Results from downscaling IPCC AR4 Simulations|journal=[[American Meteorological Society]]|year=2008|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-89-3-347|accessdate=24 May 2012|doi=10.1175/BAMS-89-3-347|bibcode = 2008BAMS...89..347E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological systems ===

{{Main|Climate change and ecosystems}}

In terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, the earlier timing of spring events, and poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges, have been linked with high confidence to recent warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipcc.ch&quot;/&gt;
Future climate change is expected to particularly affect certain ecosystems, including [[tundra]], [[mangrove]]s, and [[coral reef]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;IPCC AR4 SYR 2007&quot;/&gt; It is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, combined with higher global temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Fischlin, ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/contents.html Chapter 4: Ecosystems, their Properties, Goods and Services],

Executive summary not present in on-line text; see pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the [[extinction]] of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;
Schneider ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19.html Chapter 19: Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch19s19-3-4.html Section 19.3.4: Ecosystems and biodiversity], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases ocean acidity. This process is known as [[ocean acidification]] and has been called the &quot;equally evil twin&quot; of global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, 9 July 2012, &quot;US Official: Higher Ocean Acidity Is Climate Change’s ‘Evil Twin,’ Major Threat to Coral Reefs,&quot; http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/us-official-higher-ocean-acidity-is-climate-changes-evil-twin-major-threat-to-coral-reefs/2012/07/09/gJQAVAvRXW_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Increased ocean acidity decreases the amount of [[carbonate ion]]s, which organisms at the base of the marine [[food chain]], such as [[foraminifera]], use to make structures they need to survive. The current rate of ocean acidification&lt;ref&gt;In 2010, the worlds oceans were 30% more acidic than before the industrial revolution - see Morello, Lauren (22 February 2010) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=acidic-oceans Oceans Turn More Acidic Than Last 800,000 Years]  Scientific American, Retrieved 23 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; is many times faster than at least the past 300 million years, which included four [[mass extinction]]s that involved rising ocean acidity, such as the [[Permian mass extinction]], which killed 95% of marine species. By the end of the century, acidity changes since the industrial revolution would match the [[Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]], which occurred over 5000 years and killed 35–50% of {{wict|benthic}} [[foraminifera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Responses to global warming ==
=== Mitigation ===
{{main|Climate change mitigation}}
{{See also|Fee and dividend|}}
Reducing the amount of future climate change is called [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]] of climate change. The IPCC defines mitigation as activities that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, or enhance the capacity of [[carbon sink]]s to absorb GHGs from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexessglossary-j-p.html Glossary J-P]: &quot;Mitigation&quot;, in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG3|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, both [[developing country|developing]] and [[developed country|developed]], are aiming to use cleaner, less polluting, technologies.&lt;ref name=worldbank2010 /&gt;{{Rp|192}} Use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Policies include targets for emissions reductions, increased use of [[renewable energy]], and increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

In order to limit warming to within the lower range described in the IPCC's &quot;Summary Report for Policymakers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{AR4|WG1|chapter=SPM}}&lt;/ref&gt; it will be necessary to adopt policies that will limit greenhouse gas emissions to one of several significantly different scenarios described in the full report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since even in the most optimistic scenario, [[fossil fuel]]s are going to be used for years to come, mitigation may also involve [[carbon capture and storage]], a process that traps CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by factories and [[natural gas|gas]] or coal [[power station]]s and then stores it, usually underground.&lt;ref name=futureenergysummit&gt;{{cite news

=== Adaptation ===
{{main|Adaptation to global warming}}
Other policy responses include [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] to climate change. Adaptation to climate change may be planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change, or spontaneous, i.e., without government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Smit ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/641.htm Chapter 18: Adaptation to Climate Change in the Context of Sustainable Development and Equity], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/644.htm#1823 Section 18.2.3: Adaptation Types and Forms], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG2|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt; The barriers, limits, and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt;

A concept related to adaptation is &quot;[[adaptive capacity]],&quot; which is the ability of a system (human, natural or managed) to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with consequences.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation

 | chapter=Appendix I. Glossary
}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unmitigated climate change (i.e., future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions) would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geoengineering ===
{{main|Geoengineering}}
Geoengineering, the deliberate modification of the climate, has been investigated as a possible response to global warming, e.g. by [[NASA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://event.arc.nasa.gov/main/home/reports/SolarRadiationCP.pdf|title=Workshop on managing solar radiation|date=April 2007|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Techniques under research fall generally into the categories [[solar radiation management]] and [[carbon dioxide removal]], although various other schemes have been suggested.  Research is at a generally early stage, with no large-scale schemes currently deployed.

== Views on global warming ==
{{Main|Global warming controversy|Politics of global warming}}
{{See also|Scientific opinion on climate change|Public opinion on climate change}}

There are different views over what the appropriate policy response to climate change should be.&lt;ref&gt;Banuri, ''et al.'', Chapter 3: Equity and Social Considerations, Section 3.1.2: Concepts of equity,
[http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sar/wg_III/ipcc_sar_wg_III_full_report.pdf p. 85 ''et seq.''] in {{Harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
These competing views weigh the benefits of limiting emissions of greenhouse gases against the costs. In general, it seems likely that climate change will impose greater damages and risks in poorer regions.&lt;ref&gt;Banuri, ''et al.'', Chapter 3: Equity and Social Considerations, Section ??, [http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sar/wg_III/ipcc_sar_wg_III_full_report.pdf p. 83], in {{Harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global warming controversy ===

The [[global warming controversy]] refers to a variety of disputes, significantly more pronounced in the [[Media coverage of climate change|popular media]] than in the scientific literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;merchants_doubt&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming | first1=Naomi | last1=Oreskes | author1-link = Naomi Oreskes| first2=Erik | last2=Conway | publisher=Bloomsbury Press | edition=first | isbn=978-1-59691-610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the nature, causes, and consequences of global warming. The disputed issues include the causes of increased [[instrumental temperature record|global average air temperature]], especially since the mid-20th century, whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether [[attribution of recent climate change|humankind has contributed significantly to it]], and whether the increase is wholly or partially an artifact of poor measurements. Additional disputes concern estimates of [[climate sensitivity]], predictions of additional warming, and what the consequences of global warming will be.

In the scientific literature, there is a [[scientific opinion on climate change|strong consensus]] that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing [[Scientific opinion on climate change#Statements by dissenting organizations|disagrees with this view]],&lt;ref name=AQAonAAPG&gt;{{cite journal|author=Julie Brigham-Grette et al.|title=Petroleum Geologists' Award to Novelist Crichton Is Inappropriate|journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]]|volume=87|issue=36|quote=The AAPG stands alone among scientific societies in its denial of human-induced effects on global warming.|url=http://www.agu.org/fora/eos/pdfs/2006EO360008.pdf|month=September | year=2006|accessdate=23 January 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The MIT Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Climate Change: What It Means for Us, Our Children, and Our Grandchildren|last1= DiMento|first1= Joseph F.

From 1990–1997 in the United States, [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] think tanks mobilized to undermine the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. They [[climate change denial|challenged the scientific evidence]]; argued that global warming will have benefits; and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron M. McCright and Riley E. Dunlap, &quot;Challenging Global Warming as a Social Problem: An Analysis of the Conservative Movement's Counter-Claims,&quot; ''Social Problems,'' November 2000, Vol. 47 Issue 4, pp 499–522 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/3097132 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary assessment published in November 2010 by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) suggests a possible &quot;emissions gap&quot; between the voluntary pledges made in the Accord and the emissions cuts necessary to have a &quot;likely&quot; (greater than 66% probability) chance of meeting the {{val|2|u=°C}} objective.&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;{{Rp|10–14}}
The UNEP assessment takes the {{val|2|u=°C}} objective as being measured against the pre-industrial global mean temperature level. To having a likely chance of meeting the {{val|2|u=°C}} objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter.

The [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|16th Conference of the Parties]] (COP16) was held at [[Cancún]] in 2010. It produced an agreement, not a binding treaty, that the Parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to {{val|2|u=°C}} above pre-industrial temperatures. It also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of {{val|1.5|u=°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Public opinion ===
In 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]]s surveyed 127 countries. Over a third of the world's population was unaware of global warming, with people in developing countries less aware than those in [[Developed country|developed]], and those in Africa the least aware. Of those aware, Latin America leads in belief that temperature changes are a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the Former Soviet Union lead in the opposite belief.&lt;ref&gt;

A survey in October, 2009 by the [[Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press]] showed decreasing public perception in the US that global warming was a serious problem.

By 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed Global Warming as a serious threat. In the US, a little over half the population (53%) now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families; this was 10% below the 2008 poll (63%). Latin America had the biggest rise in concern, with 73% saying global warming was a serious threat to their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147203/Fewer-Americans-Europeans-View-Global-Warming-Threat.aspx |title=Fewer Americans, Europeans View Global Warming as a Threat| last=Pugliese | first=Anita | publisher=Gallup | date=20 April 2011 | accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That global poll also found that people are more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes, except in the USA where nearly half (47%) of the population attributed global warming to natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;

On the other hand, in May 2011 a joint poll by Yale and George Mason Universities found that nearly half the people in the USA (47%) attribute global warming to human activities, compared to 36% blaming it on natural causes. Only 5% of the 35% who were &quot;disengaged&quot;, &quot;doubtful&quot;, or &quot;dismissive&quot; of global warming were aware that 97% of publishing US climate scientists agree global warming is happening and is primarily caused by humans.&lt;ref name=YaleMay2011&gt;{{cite book|last=Leiserowitz|first=A.|title=Global Warming's Six Americas, May 2011|year=2011|publisher=Yale University and George Mason University|location=New Haven CT: Yale Project on Climate Change Communication|url=http://environment.yale.edu/climate/news/SixAmericasMay2011/|coauthors=E.

Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that the public's belief as to the causes of global warming depends on the [[Opinion poll#Wording of questions|wording choice used in the polls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's All in a Name: 'Global Warming' Vs.

A September 2011 [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] poll found that Britons (43%) are less likely than Americans (49%) or Canadians (52%) to say that &quot;global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities.&quot; The same poll found that 20% of Americans, 20% of Britons and 14% of Canadians think &quot;global warming is a theory that has not yet been proven.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011.09.12_Climate.pdf |title=Angus Reid Public Opinion poll conducted 25&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;through 2 September 2011 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''global warming'' was probably first used in its modern sense on 8 August 1975 in a science paper by [[Wally Broecker]] in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' called &quot;Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Stefan | title = Happy 35th birthday, global warming! | url = http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/07/happy-35th-birthday-global-warming/ | publisher=[[RealClimate]] | date = 28 July 2010 | accessdate =10 August 2010 | quote = [Broecker's article is] the first of over 10,000 papers for this search term according to the ISI database of journal articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Johnson | first = Brad | title = Wally's World | url = http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/03/wallys_world | work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]] | date = 3 August 2010 | accessdate =10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Broecker, &quot;Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?&quot; Science, vol. 189 (8 August 1975), 460–463.&lt;/ref&gt; Broecker's choice of words was new and represented a significant recognition that the climate was warming; previously the phrasing used by scientists was &quot;inadvertent climate modification,&quot; because while it was recognized humans could change the climate, no one was sure which direction it was going.&lt;ref name=nasacbaon&gt;[[Erik M. Conway|Erik Conway]]. [http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/climate_by_any_other_name.html &quot;What's in a Name? Global Warming vs. Climate Change&quot;], NASA, 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences first used ''global warming'' in a 1979 paper called the Charney Report, which said: &quot;if carbon dioxide continues to increase, [we find] no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Science, Carbon Dioxide and Climate, Washington, D.C., 1979, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; The report made a distinction between referring to surface temperature changes as ''global warming'', while referring to other changes caused by increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as ''climate change''.&lt;ref name=nasacbaon/&gt;

''Global warming'' became more widely popular after 1988 when NASA climate scientist [[James Hansen]] used the term in a testimony to Congress.&lt;ref name=nasacbaon/&gt; He said: &quot;global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, &quot;Greenhouse Effect and Global Climate Change, part 2&quot; 100th Cong., 1st sess., 23 June 1988, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; His testimony was widely reported and afterward ''global warming'' was commonly used by the press and in public discourse.&lt;ref name=nasacbaon/&gt;
