'''''An Inconvenient Truth''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Davis Guggenheim]] about former [[Vice President of the United States|United States Vice President]] [[Al Gore]]'s campaign to educate citizens about [[global warming]] via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given more than a thousand times.

Premiering at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]] and opening in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on May 24, 2006, the documentary was a critical and box-office success, winning 2 [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Feature)|Best Documentary Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/342290/An-Inconvenient-Truth/awards |title=NY Times: An Inconvenient Truth |accessdate=2008-11-23|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $24 million in the U.S. and $26 million in the foreign [[box office]], becoming the 9th highest grossing documentary films to date in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo-chart&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=documentary.htm |title=Documentary 1982–present (film rankings by lifetime gross) |accessdate=2010-03-13 |publisher= [[Amazon.com]] | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100401184710/http://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=documentary.htm| archivedate= 1 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea to document his efforts came from producer [[Laurie David]] who saw his presentation at a
town-hall meeting on global warming which coincided with the opening of ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer [[Lawrence Bender]], met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.

Since the film's release, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' has been credited for raising international public awareness of [[climate change]] and reenergizing the [[environmental movement]]. The documentary has also been included in science curricula in schools around the world, which has spurred some controversy.

==Synopsis {{anchor|Synopsis|Plot}}==
''An Inconvenient Truth'' focuses on Al Gore and on his travels in support of his efforts to educate the public about the severity of the climate crisis. Gore says, &quot;I've been trying to tell this story for a long time and I feel as if I've failed to get the message across.&quot;&lt;ref name='revkin-thefight'&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Revkin |authorlink= Andrew Revkin |title='An Inconvenient Truth': Al Gore's Fight Against Global Warming |date=2006-05-22 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/22/movies/22gore.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-11-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091210071020/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/22/movies/22gore.html| archivedate= 10 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film documents a [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]] presentation (which Gore refers to as &quot;the slide show&quot;) that Gore has presented throughout the world. It intersperses Gore's exploration of data and predictions regarding [[climate change]] and its potential for disaster with his own life story.

The former vice president opens the film by greeting an audience with a joke: &quot;I am Al Gore; I used to be the next President of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Rainer |authorlink= |title=Al Gore's global warning |date=2006-05-26 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0526/p14s02-almo.html |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gore then begins his slide show on climate change; a comprehensive presentation replete with detailed graphs, flow charts and stark visuals. Gore shows off several majestic photographs of the Earth taken from multiple space missions, [[Earthrise]] and [[The Blue Marble]].&lt;ref name='goreplaysleadingman'&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Al Gore plays leading man |date=2006-05-28 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060528/PEOPLE/605280306 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gore notes that these photos dramatically transformed the way we see the Earth, helping spark modern environmentalism.

Following this, Gore shares anecdotes that inspired his interest in the issue, including his college education with early climate expert [[Roger Revelle]] at [[Harvard University]], his sister's death from [[lung cancer]] and his young son's near-fatal car accident. Gore recalls a story from his grade-school years, where a fellow student asked his geography teacher about [[continental drift]]; in response, the teacher called the concept the &quot;most ridiculous thing [he'd] ever heard.&quot; Gore ties this conclusion to the assumption that &quot;the Earth is so big, we can't possibly have any lasting, harmful impact on the Earth's environment.&quot; For comic effect, Gore uses a clip from the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode &quot;[[Crimes of the Hot]]&quot; to describe the [[greenhouse effect]]. Gore refers to his loss to [[George W. Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 United States presidential election]] as a &quot;hard blow&quot; yet one which subsequently &quot;brought into clear focus, the mission [he] had been pursuing for all these years.&quot;
[[File:PaleBlueDot.jpg|thumb|alt=A tiny, pale blue dot is contrasted against the vastness of space|The [[Pale Blue Dot]], a [[Voyager 1]] photo showing [[Earth]] ''(circled)'' as a single pixel from 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometres) away, is featured in the film. Al Gore points out that all of human history has happened on that tiny pixel, which is our only home.]]

Throughout the movie, Gore discusses the [[scientific opinion on climate change]], as well as the present and future [[effects of global warming]] and stresses that climate change &quot;is really not a political issue, so much as a moral one&quot;, describing the consequences he believes global climate change will produce if the amount of human-generated [[greenhouse gases]] is not significantly reduced in the very near future. Gore also presents [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[ice core|ice coring]] data showing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels higher now than in the past 650,000 years.

The film includes segments intended to refute [[Scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|critics]] who say that global warming is unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major [[ice sheet]] in [[Greenland]] or in [[West Antarctica]], either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet, flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower [[salinity]], could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to climate change.

The documentary ends with Gore arguing that if appropriate actions are taken soon, the effects of global warming can be successfully reversed by releasing less [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and planting more vegetation to consume existing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Gore calls upon his viewers to learn how they can help him in these efforts. Gore concludes the film by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero. The solutions are in our hands, we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will. But in America, the will to act is a renewable resource.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gallo | first = Carmine | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Fire them up!: 7 simple secrets to inspire colleagues, customers, and clients, sell yourself, your vision, and your values, communicate with charisma and confidence | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2007 | location = | page = 92 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-470-16566-9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the film's end credits, a [[diaporama]] pops up on screen suggesting to viewers things at home they can do to combat climate change, including &quot;recycle&quot;, &quot;speak up in your community&quot;, &quot;try to buy a [[hybrid vehicle]]&quot; and &quot;encourage everyone you know to watch this movie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Philander | first = S.

{{See also|Environmental activism of Al Gore}}
Gore became interested in global warming when he took a course at [[Harvard University]] with Professor [[Roger Revelle]], one of the first scientists to measure [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Voynar | first=Kim | title=Sundance: ''An Inconvenient Truth'' Q &amp; A – Al Gore on fire!

Later, when Gore was in Congress, he initiated the first congressional hearing on the subject in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Remnick |first=David |title=The Talk of the Town |work=The New Yorker |date=2006-04-14 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/060424ta_talk_remnick }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gore's 1992 book, ''[[Earth in the Balance]]'', dealing with a number of environmental topics, reached the [[New York Times bestseller list]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biosen&quot;&gt;{{cite web

As Vice President during the [[Clinton Administration]], Gore pushed for the implementation of a [[carbon tax]] to encourage energy efficiency and diversify the choices of fuel better reflecting the true environmental costs of energy use; it was partially implemented in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Gore also supported the funding of the ill-fated satellite called [[Triana (satellite)|Triana]], which would have provided an image of the Earth 24 hours a day, over the internet and would've acted as a barometer measuring the process of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leary |first=Warren |title=Politics Keeps a Satellite Earthbound |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/01/science/politics-keeps-a-satellite-earthbound.html |date=1999-06-01 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|his 2000 presidential campaign]], Gore ran, in part, on a pledge to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontheissues.org/News_Kyoto_Treaty.htm OnTheIssues.org – Topics in the News: Kyoto Treaty].

===The slide show===
[[File:Al gore presentation.jpg|thumb|alt=A man is standing on a stage in front of a giant projection of the Earth|Gore presents his global warming slide show at the [[University of Miami]].]]
After his defeat in [[United States presidential election, 2000|the 2000 presidential election]] by [[George W. Bush]], Gore returned his focus to the topic. He edited and adapted a slide show he had compiled years earlier, and began featuring the slide show in presentations on global warming across the U.S. and around the world. At the time of the film, Gore estimated he had shown the presentation more than one thousand times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Breslau | first=Karen | title=The Resurrection of Al Gore | work=Wired Magazine | month=05 | year=2006 | url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.05/gore_pr.html|accessdate=2010-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer David saw Gore's slide show in [[New York City]] at a global warming town-hall meeting after the May 27, 2004 premiere of ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;goreleadingman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Booth | first=William | title=Al Gore, Sundance's Leading Man | work=The Washington Post | date=2006-01-26 | url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/25/AR2006012502230.html|accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gore was one of several panelists and he showed a ten-minute version of his slide show.

{{quote|I had never seen it before, and I was floored. As soon as the evening's program concluded, I asked him to let me present his full briefing to leaders and friends in New York and Los Angeles. I would do all the organizing if he would commit to the dates. Gore's presentation was the most powerful and clear explanation of global warming I had ever seen. And it became my mission to get everyone I knew to see it too.}} Inspired, David assembled a team, including producer Lawrence Bender and former president of [[eBay]] [[Jeffrey Skoll]], who met with Gore about the possibility of making the slide show into a movie. It took some convincing. The slide show, she says, &quot;was his baby, and he felt proprietary about it and it was hard for him to let go.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;goreleadingman&quot; /&gt;

David said the box office returns weren't important to her. &quot;None of us are going to make a dime.&quot; What is at stake, she says, &quot;is, you know, the planet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;goreleadingman&quot; /&gt;

David and Bender later met with director Davis Guggenheim, to have him direct the film adaptation of his slide show. Guggenheim, who was skeptical at first, later saw the presentation for himself, stating that he was &quot;blown away,&quot; and &quot;left after an hour and a half thinking that global warming [was] the most important issue...I had no idea how you’d make a film out of it, but I wanted to try,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Alex Steffen |title=Interview: David Guggenheim and ''An Inconvenient Truth'' |publisher=WorldChanging.com | date= 2006-05-04 |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004388.html |accessdate=2010-06-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100610095053/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004388.html| archivedate= 10 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Gore enlisted Duarte Design to condense and update his material and add video and animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Quinn | first=Michelle | title=Helping others grab an audience | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=2008-09-15 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/15/business/fi-duarte15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As designer Ted Boda described the work: &quot;As a designer for the presentation, [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]] was the first choice to help create such an engaging presentation.

{{quote|I had seen enough to gain a tremendous respect for his skill and sensitivity. And he said that one of the huge differences between a live stage performance and a movie is that when you're in the same room with a live person who's on stage speaking – even if it's me – there's an element of dramatic tension and human connection that keeps your attention. And in a movie, that element is just not present. He explained to me that you have to create that element on screen, by supplying a narrative thread that allows the audience to make a connection with one or more characters. He said, &quot;You've got to be that character.&quot; So we talked about it, and as I say, by then he had earned such a high level of trust from me that he convinced me.}}

===Production===
When Bender first saw Gore's visual presentation he had concerns about connection with viewers, citing a &quot;need to find a personal way in.&quot; In the string of interviews with Gore that followed, Gore himself felt like they &quot;were making ''Kill Al Vol. 3''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lawrencebendertruthdig&quot; /&gt; Bender had other issues including a time frame that was &quot;grueling&quot; and needed to be done in &quot;a very short period of time&quot; despite many filming locations planned. These included many locations throughout the United States and also included [[China]]. &quot;It was a lot of travel in a very short period of time. And they had to get this thing edited and cut starting in January, and ready to screen in May. That’s like a seriously tight schedule. So the logistics of pulling it off with a low budget were really difficult, and if there’s one person who gets credit, it’s Leslie Chilcott, because she really pulled it together.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lawrencebendertruthdig&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Blair | last=Golson | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Lawrence Bender: The Truthdig Interview | date=2006-05-26 | publisher= | url =http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20060526_lawrence_bender_interview/ | work =[[Truthdig]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-09-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technical aspects====
The majority of the movie exhibits Gore delivering his lecture to an audience at a relatively small theater in Los Angeles. Gore's presentation was delivered on a 70-foot digital screen that Bender commissioned specifically for the movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;lawrencebendertruthdig&quot; /&gt;

While the bulk of the film was shot on 4:4:4 [[HDCAM]], according to director Guggenheim, a vast array of different film formats were used: &quot;There’s [[35mm]] and [[16mm]]. A lot of the stuff on the farm I just shot myself on [[8mm film]]. We used four [[Sony F950]] HDCAMs for the presentation. We shot three different kinds of [[prosumer]] HD, both 30 and 24. There’s MiniDV, there’s 3200 black-and-white stills, there’s digital stills, some of them emailed on the day they were taken from as far off as Greenland. There was three or four different types of animation. One of the animators is from New Zealand and emailed me his work. There’s JPEG stuff.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sheddinglight&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Frazier |first=Bryant |title=Shedding Light on An Inconvenient Truth |work=Film &amp; Video |date=2006-06-06 |url=http://www.studiodaily.com/filmandvideo/searchlist/6681.html |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guggenheim says while it would've been a lot easier to use one format, it would not have had the same impact. &quot;Each format has its own feel and texture and touch. For the storytelling of what Gore’s memory was like of growing up on the farm, some of this 8mm stuff that I shot is very impressionistic. And for some of his memories of his son’s accident, these grainy black-and-white stills...have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that we shot. Every format was used to its best potential. Some of the footage of Katrina has this blown-out video, where the [[wikt:chroma|chroma]] is just blasted, and it looks real muddy, but that too has its own kind of powerful, impactful feeling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sheddinglight&quot; /&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] contacted more than 100 climate researchers and questioned them about the film's veracity. All 19 climate scientists who had seen the movie said that Gore accurately conveyed the science, with few errors.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientistsokmovieforaccuracy&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Ted Scambos, lead scientist from the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]], said the film &quot;does an excellent job of outlining the science behind global warming and the challenges society faces in the coming century because of it.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsidc.org/news/press/20060706_goremoviefaq.html |title=Does Al Gore get the science right in the movie An Inconvenient Truth? |accessdate=2010-04-03 |date=2006-07-07 |publisher=[[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100509183718/http://nsidc.org/news/press/20060706_goremoviefaq.html| archivedate= 9 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One concern among scientists in the film was the connection between hurricanes and global warming, which remains contentious in the science community. Gore cited five recent scientific studies to support his view.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientistsokmovieforaccuracy&quot; /&gt; &quot;I thought the use of imagery from Hurricane Katrina was inappropriate and unnecessary in this regard, as there are plenty of disturbing impacts associated with global warming for which there is much greater scientific consensus,&quot; said Brian Soden, professor of meteorology and oceanography at the University of Miami.&lt;ref name=&quot;scientistsokmovieforaccuracy&quot; /&gt;
[[Gavin Schmidt]], climate modeler for NASA, thought Gore appropriately addressed the issue.&lt;ref name='did-al-get-the-science-right'&gt;{{cite news | first=Katharine | last=Mieszkowski | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Did Al get the science right? | date=2006-06-10 | publisher=Salon | url =http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/06/10/truths | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-29 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Gore talked about 2005 and 2004 being very strong seasons, and if you weren't paying attention, you could be left with the impression that there was a direct cause and effect, but he was very careful to not say there's a direct correlation,&quot; Schmidt said.&lt;ref name=&quot;did-al-get-the-science-right&quot;/&gt; &quot;There is a difference between saying 'we are confident that they will increase' and 'we are confident that they have increased due to this effect,'&quot; added Steig. &quot;Never in the movie does he say: 'This particular event is caused by global warming.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;did-al-get-the-science-right&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Co2-temperature-plot.svg|thumb|300px|[[EPICA]] and [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] ice cores display the relationship between temperature and level of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the last 650,000 years.]]

Gore's use of long ice core records of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and temperature (from oxygen isotope measurements) in Antarctic ice cores to illustrate the correlation between the two drew some scrutiny; Schmidt, Steig and [[Michael E. Mann]] back up Gore's data. &quot;Gore stated that the greenhouse gas levels and temperature changes over ice age signals had a complex relationship but that they 'fit'. Both of these statements are true,&quot; said Schmidt and Mann.&lt;ref name=&quot;convenient-untruths&quot; /&gt; &quot;The complexity though is actually quite fascinating...a full understanding of why CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; changes in precisely the pattern that it does during ice ages is elusive, but among the most plausible explanations is that increased received solar radiation in the southern hemisphere due to changes in Earth’s orbital geometry warms the southern ocean, releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere, which then leads to further warming through an enhanced greenhouse effect. Gore’s terse explanation of course does not mention such complexities, but the crux of his point–that the observed long-term relationship between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and temperature in Antarctica supports our understanding of the warming impact of increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations–is correct. Moreover, our knowledge of why CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is changing now (fossil fuel burning) is solid. We also know that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a greenhouse gas, and that the carbon cycle feedback is positive (increasing temperatures lead to increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), implying that future changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be larger than we might anticipate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;convenient-untruths&quot;&gt;{{cite news | coauthors = Gavin Schmidt, Michael E. Mann | title = Convenient Untruths | date = 2007-10-15 | publisher = RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/10/convenient-untruths/| accessdate = 2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Gore is careful not to state what the temperature/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scaling is,&quot; said Steig. &quot;He is making a qualitative point, which is entirely accurate. The fact is that it would be difficult or impossible to explain past changes in temperature during the ice age cycles without CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; changes. In that sense, the ice core CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-temperature correlation remains an appropriate demonstration of the influence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on climate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gore-steig&quot; /&gt;

Steig disputed Gore's statement that you can visibly see the effect that the [[United States Clean Air Act]] has had on ice cores in Antarctica. &quot;One can neither see, nor even detect using sensitive chemical methods any evidence in Antarctica of the Clean Air Act,&quot; he said, but did note that they are &quot;clearly recorded in ice core records from Greenland.&quot;&lt;ref name='another-look' /&gt; Despite these flaws,
Steig said that the film got the fundamental science right and the minor factual errors did not undermine the main message of the film,&lt;ref name='another-look' /&gt; adding &quot;''An Inconvenient Truth'' rests on a solid scientific foundation.&quot;&lt;ref name='another-look'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Another look at An Inconvenient Truth|journal=GeoJournal|date=September 2007|first=Eric|last=Steig|coauthors=|volume=70|issue=1|page=5|doi= 10.1007/s10708-008-9130-3|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lonnie Thompson]], Earth Science professor at [[Ohio State University]], whose work on retreating glaciers was featured in the film, was pleased with how his research was presented. &quot;It's so hard given the breadth of this topic to be factually correct, and make sure you don't lose your audience,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;As scientists, we publish our papers in ''Science'' and ''Nature'', but very few people read those. Here's another way to get this message out. To me, it's an excellent overview for an introductory class at a university. What are the issues and what are the possible consequences of not doing anything about those changes? To me, it has tremendous value. It will reach people that scientists will never reach.&quot;&lt;ref name='did-al-get-the-science-right'/&gt;

[[John Nielsen-Gammon]] from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] said the &quot;main scientific argument presented in the movie is for the most part consistent with the weight of scientific evidence, but with some of the main points needing updating, correction, or qualification.&quot;&lt;ref name='ait-the-scientific-argument'&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Inconvenient Truth: The Scientific Argument|journal=GeoJournal|year=2008|first=John |last=Nielsen-Gammon|coauthors=|volume=70|issue=|page=21|doi= 10.1007/s10708-008-9126-z|url=http://geotest.tamu.edu/userfiles/222/ait.pdf |format=|accessdate=2010-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen-Gammon thought the film neglected information gained from computer models, and instead relied entirely on past and current observational evidence, &quot;perhaps because such information would be difficult for a
lay audience to grasp, believe, or connect with emotionally.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ait-the-scientific-argument&quot; /&gt;

Steven Quiring, climatologist from Texas A&amp;M University added that &quot;whether scientists like it or not, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' has had a much greater impact on public opinion and public awareness of global climate change than any scientific paper or report.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Science and Hollywood: a discussion of the scientific accuracy of An Inconvenient Truth |journal= GeoJournal |year= 2008 |first= Steven |last= Quiring |coauthors= |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= | url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/e135182138xl0412/ |accessdate= 2010-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New Yorker]]'''s [[David Remnick]] added that while it was &quot;not the most entertaining film of the year...it might be the most important&quot; and a &quot;brilliantly lucid, often riveting attempt to warn Americans off our hellbent path to global suicide.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = David Remnick | title = Ozone Man | date = 2006-05-24 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_remnick | work = The New Yorker | accessdate = 2009-02-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090220140210/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_remnick| archivedate= 20 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer [[A.O. Scott]] thought the film was &quot;edited crisply enough to keep it from feeling like 90 minutes of [[C-SPAN]] and shaped to give Mr. Gore's argument a real sense of drama,&quot; and &quot;as unsettling as it can be,&quot; Scott continued, &quot;it is also intellectually exhilarating, and, like any good piece of pedagogy, whets the appetite for further study.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Warning of Calamities and Hoping for a Change in An Inconvenient Truth | date = 2006-05-24 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/movies/24trut.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2010-06-16 | first=A.

''[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]'' critic Jayson Harsin declared the film's aesthetic qualities groundbreaking, as a new genre of slideshow film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/53/gore.htm | title = Eco-apocalypse and the Powerpoint film | accessdate = 2010-06-16 | last = Harsin | first = Jayson | date = 2006-08 | publisher = 'Bright Lights Film Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[NASA]] climatologist [[James E. Hansen]] said that with ''An Inconvenient Truth'', &quot;Al Gore may have done for global warming what ''[[Silent Spring]]'' did for pesticides. He will be attacked, but the public will have the information needed to distinguish our long-term well-being from short-term special interests.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=James | last=Hansen | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=The Threat to the Planet | date=2006-07-13 | publisher= | url =http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19131 | work =New York Review of Books | pages = | accessdate = 2009-08-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Several reviews criticized the film on scientific and political grounds. Journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] argued in the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that although &quot;Gore gets [the science] more right than wrong,&quot; he exaggerates the risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Ronald Bailey | url = http://www.reason.com/rb/rb061606.shtml | title = Gore as climate exaggerator | work = Reason | date = 2006-06-16| accessdate = 2007-01-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061227062020/http://www.reason.com/rb/rb061606.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|Global warming skeptics]] were vocally critical of the film, such as [[MIT]] physicist [[Richard Lindzen|Richard S. Lindzen]], who wrote in a June 26, 2006 op-ed in the ''Wall Street Journal'' that Gore was using a biased presentation to exploit the fears of the public for his own political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Richard | last = S.

Some reviewers were also skeptical of Gore's intent, wondering whether he was setting himself for another Presidential run. ''[[Boston Globe]]'' writer Peter Canello criticized the &quot;gauzy biographical material that seems to have been culled from old Gore campaign commercials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Gore's ecology film gets an 'inconvenient' label of liberalism | date = 2006-06-26 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/06/06/gores_ecology_film_gets_an_inconvenient_label_of_liberalism | work = The Boston Globe | accessdate = 2009-02-25 | first1=Peter S. | last1=Canellos}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Phil Hall (US writer)|Phil Hall]] of ''[[Film Threat]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying &quot;''An Inconvenient Truth'' is something you rarely see in movies today: a blatant intellectual fraud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=8451 |title=An Inconvenient Truth |last=Hall |first=Phil |date=2006-05-15 |work=[[Film Threat]] |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conservative commentator [[Glenn Beck]] aired a one-hour special, ''[[Glenn Beck (TV program)#Exposed: The Climate of Fear|Exposed: Climate of Fear]]'', as a counterpoint to Gore's film with viewpoints of [[scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming]]. &quot;Yes, Al Gore, there is another credible side,&quot; Beck said. &quot;''An Inconvenient Truth'' is a study in absolutes, a one-sided argument devoid of any gray area.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Exposed: The Climate of Fear | date = 2007-05-02 | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/02/gb.01.html | work = CNN.com | accessdate = 2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
Following the film, Gore founded [[The Climate Project]] in 2006 which trained 1,000 activists to give Gore’s presentation in their communities. Presently, the group has 3,500 presenters worldwide.&lt;ref name='inconvenient-youth'&gt;{{cite news |first=Anne |last=Payne |title=Inconvenient Youth: Al Gore's group takes new step |date=2010-04-20 |url =http://www.repoweramerica.org/states/tennessee/inconvenient-youth-al-gore%E2%80%99s-group-takes-new-step/ |work=Tennessean |accessdate=2010-04-22}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional initiative was launched in 2010, called [[Environmental groups and resources serving K–12 schools#Inconvenient Youth|&quot;Inconvenient Youth&quot;]]. &quot;'Inconvenient Youth' is built on the belief that teens can help lead efforts to solve the climate crisis,” said Gore. The project was inspired by Mary Doerr, a 16-year-old who trained as presenter for the organization.&lt;ref name='inconvenient-youth'/&gt;

===Public opinion===
In a July 2007 47-country Internet survey conducted by [[The Nielsen Company]] and [[Oxford University]], 66% of those respondents who said they had seen ''An Inconvenient Truth'' stated that it had “changed their mind” about global warming and 89% said it had made them more aware of the problem. Three out of four (74%) said they had changed some of their habits because of seeing the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;global survey&quot;/&gt;

Then-president George W. Bush, when asked whether he would watch the film, responded: &quot;Doubt it.&quot; He later stated that &quot;And in my judgment we need to set aside whether or not greenhouse gases have been caused by mankind or because of natural effects, and focus on the [[Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate|technologies]] that will enable us to live better lives and at the same time protect the environment.&quot; Gore responded that &quot;The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [Bush] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true.&quot; White House deputy press secretary [[Dana Perino]] stated that &quot;The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity&quot;.&lt;ref name=APBush&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush gives thumbs down to Gore's new movie |date=2006-05-24 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12930351/ |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bingaman disputed this saying, &quot;It seems to me we were having great difficulty recruiting Republican members of Congress to support a bill before Al Gore came up with this movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;republicans-not-warming&quot;/&gt;

[[Oklahoma]] Republican Senator [[Jim Inhofe]], then-chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, didn't plan to see the film (which he appears in), and compared it to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s book &quot;[[Mein Kampf]]&quot;.&quot;If you say the same lie over and over again, and particularly if you have the media's support, people will believe it,&quot; Inhofe said, adding that he thought Gore was trying to use the issue to run for president again in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;republicans-not-warming&quot;/&gt;

In contrast to Inhofe, Arizona Republican Senator [[John McCain]], did not criticize Gore's efforts or the movie, which he planned to see.&lt;ref name=&quot;republicans-not-warming&quot;/&gt;

[[Tennessee]] Republican Senator [[Lamar Alexander]], said &quot;Because (Gore) was a former vice president and presidential nominee, he brings a lot of visibility to (the issue),&quot; Alexander said. &quot;On the other hand it may be seen as political by some, and they may be less eager to be a part of it.&quot; Alexander also criticized the omission of nuclear power in the film. &quot;Maybe it needs a sequel: 'An Inconvenient Truth 2: Nuclear Power.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;republicans-not-warming&quot;/&gt;

In September 2006, Gore traveled to [[Sydney, Australia]] to promote the film. Then-Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] said he would not meet with Gore or agree to [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]] because of the movie: &quot;I don't take policy advice from films.&quot; Former Opposition Leader [[Kim Beazley]] joined Gore for a viewing and other [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] attended a special screening at [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] earlier in the week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard-isolated&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Howard isolated on climate change: Gore |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=143315 |date=2006-09-11 |accessdate=2007-05-31 |publisher=[[Nine Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the general election a year later, Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] ratified Kyoto in his first week of office, leaving the United States the only industrialized nation in the world not to have signed the treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard-isolated&quot;/&gt;

====Dimmock case====
{{Further2|[[Dimmock v Secretary of State for Education and Skills]]}}

In May 2007, a group of global warming skeptics led by Stewart Dimmock, a [[lorry]] (HGV) driver and school governor from [[Kent]], [[England]], challenged the UK Government's distribution of the film in a lawsuit, [[Dimmock v Secretary of State for Education and Skills]] with help from political ally [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Viscount Monckton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newparty.co.uk/news/may2007/encouraging-results-for-new-party-candidates.html &quot;News from the New Party&quot;], May 5, 2007, New Party website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leake&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article2652851.ece &quot;Please, sir – Gore's got warming wrong&quot;], Jonathan Leake, Environment Editor, ''[[Sunday Times]]'', 2007-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs sought an [[injunction]] preventing the screening of the film in English schools, arguing that schools are legally forbidden to promote partisan political views and, when dealing with political issues, are required to provide a balanced presentation of opposing views.

On 10 October 2007, Mr Justice Burton, after explaining that the requirement for a balanced presentation does not warrant that equal weight be given to alternative views of a mainstream view, ruled that it was clear that the film was substantially founded upon scientific research and fact, albeit that the science is used, in the hands of a &quot;talented politician and communicator&quot;, to make a political statement and to support a political program.&lt;ref name=&quot;dimmock&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The judge said that showing the film without the explanations of error would be a violation of education laws.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, &quot;Gore climate film's nine 'errors',&quot; 11 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge concluded &quot;I have no doubt that Dr Stott, the Defendant's expert, is right when he says that: 'Al Gore's presentation of the causes and likely effects of climate change in the film was broadly accurate.'&quot; On the basis of testimony from [[Robert M. Carter]] and the arguments put forth by the claimant's lawyers, the judge also pointed to [[Dimmock v Secretary of State for Education and Skills#The nine inaccuracies|nine &quot;errors&quot;]], i.e. statements the truth of which he did not rule on, but that he found to depart from the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|mainstream scientific positions on global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/7037671.stm|title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; UK &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; Gore climate film's nine 'errors'|date=Thursday, 11 October 2007, 08:10 GMT 09:10 UK|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article2633838.ece|title=Al Gore's inconvenient judgment|last=Smith|first=Lewis|date=October 11, 2007|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=7 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3310137/Al-Gores-nine-Inconvenient-Untruths.html|title=Al Gore's 'nine Inconvenient Untruths' – Telegraph|last=Peck|first=Sally|date=12:01AM BST 11 Oct 2007|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=7 June 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100528022453/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3310137/Al-Gores-nine-Inconvenient-Untruths.html| archivedate= 28 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that some of these departures from the mainstream arose in the context of alarmism and exaggeration in support of political theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23416151-judge-attacks-nine-errors-in-al-gores-alarmist-climate-change-film.do|title=Judge attacks nine errors in Al Gore's 'alarmist' climate change film&amp;#124; News &amp;#124; This is London|date=07:52am on 11.10.07|work=[[Evening Standard]]|accessdate=7 June 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100716235649/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23416151-judge-attacks-nine-errors-in-al-gores-alarmist-climate-change-film.do| archivedate= 16 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/11/21/new-documentary-challenges-gores-inconvenient-truth-global-warming/|title=FOXNews.com – New Documentary Challenges Gore's 'Inconvenient Truth' on Global Warming|date=November 22, 2009|work=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the government had already accepted to amend the guidance notes to address these along with other points in a fashion that the judge found satisfactory, no order was made on the application.

===In the United States===
In the United States, 50,000 free copies of ''An Inconvenient Truth'' were offered to the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), which declined to take them. Producer David provided an email correspondence from the NSTA detailing that their reasoning was that the DVDs would place &quot;unnecessary risk upon the [NSTA] capital campaign, especially certain targeted supporters,&quot; and that they saw &quot;little, if any, benefit to NSTA or its members&quot; in accepting the free DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/1%20NSTA%20-%20Paramount%20Emails%20-%20redacted.pdf |title=Conversation: Al Gore/An Inconvenient Truth |author=Laurie David

The NSTA also said that they had offered several other options for distributing the film but ultimately &quot;[it] appears that these alternative distribution mechanisms were unsatisfactory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nsta.org/about/pressroom.aspx?id=52977 |title=NSTA Statement on November 26 Washington Post Op-ed &quot;Science à la Joe Camel&quot; |author=Gerald Wheeler |date=2006-11-28 |publisher=[[National Science Teachers Association]] |accessdate=2007-01-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; David has said that NSTA Executive Director Gerry Wheeler promised in a telephone conversation to explore alternatives with NSTA's board for advertising the film but she had not yet received an alternative offer at the time of NSTA's public claim. She also said that she rejected their subsequent offers because they were nothing more than offers to sell their &quot;commercially available member mailing list&quot; and advertising space in their magazine and newsletter, which are available to anyone. She noted that in the past, NSTA had shipped out 20,000 copies of a 10-part video produced by Wheeler with funding provided by [[ConocoPhillips]] in 2003. NSTA indicated that they retained editorial control over the content, which David questioned based on the point of view portrayed in the global warming section of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurie-david/crooked-curriculum-oil-c_b_35829.html |title=Crooked Curriculum: Oil Company Money Scandal at Nat'l Science Teachers Association Deepens |author=Laurie David |date=2006-12-08 |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] publication ''ScienceNOW'' published an assessment discussing both sides of the NSTA decision in which it was reported that &quot;David says NSTA's imprimatur [i.e. endorsement or sanction] was essential and that buying a mailing list is a nonstarter.

Former [[ACT New Zealand]] Member of Parliament [[Muriel Newman]] filed a petition to have New Zealand schoolchildren be protected from political indoctrination by putting provisions that resembled those in the UK to the Education Act.

''An Inconvenient Truth'' was [[Film score|scored]] by [[Michael Brook]] with an accompanying theme song played during the end credits by [[Melissa Etheridge]]. Brook explained that he wanted to bring out the emotion expressed in the film: &quot;...in Inconvenient Truth, there's a lot of information and it's kind of a lecture, in a way, and very well organized and very well presented, but it's a lot to absorb. And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have – sort of give people a little break every once in a while and say, okay, you don't have to absorb this information, you can just sort of – and it was more the personal side of Al Gore's life or how it connected to the theme of the film. And that's when there's music.&quot;&lt;ref name='michaelbrooknpr'&gt;{{cite news | first=Liane | last=Hansen | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Michael Brook | date=2006-07-30 | publisher= | url =http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5592610 | work =NPR | pages = | accessdate = 2009-09-06 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etheridge agreed to write ''An Inconvenient Truth'''s theme song, &quot;[[I Need to Wake Up]]&quot; after viewing Gore's slide show.&lt;ref name=&quot;melissaetheridgelatimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I was so honored he would ask me to contribute to a project that is so powerful and so important, I felt such a huge responsibility,&quot; she said. &quot;Then I went, 'What am I going to write? What am I going to say?' &quot; Etheridge's former partner, [[Tammy Lynn Michaels]], told her: &quot;Write what you feel, because that's what people are going to feel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;melissaetheridgelatimes&quot; /&gt; Of Etheridge's commitment to the project, Gore said, &quot;Melissa is a rare soul who gives a lot of time and effort to causes in which she strongly believes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;melissaetheridgelatimes&quot; /&gt; Etheridge received the 2006 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for &quot;I Need to Wake Up.&quot; Upon receiving the award, she noted in her acceptance speech:
