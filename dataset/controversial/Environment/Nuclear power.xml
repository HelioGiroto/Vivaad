===Use in space===
{{main|Nuclear power in space}}
Both [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and fusion appear promising for [[Spacecraft propulsion|space propulsion]] applications, generating higher mission velocities with less [[reaction mass]]. This is due to the much higher energy density of nuclear reactions: some 7 orders of magnitude (10,000,000 times) more energetic than the chemical reactions which power the current generation of rockets.

[[Radioactive decay]] has been used on a relatively small scale (few kW), mostly to power [[space mission]]s and experiments by using [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s such as those developed at [[Idaho National Laboratory#Space and Security Power Systems Facility|Idaho National Laboratory]].

==History==

===Origins===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
{{See also|Nuclear fission#History}}
The pursuit of nuclear energy for [[electricity generation]] began soon after the discovery in the early 20th century that [[radioactive]] elements, such as [[radium]], released immense amounts of energy, according to the principle of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. However, means of harnessing such energy was impractical, because intensely radioactive elements were, by their very nature, short-lived (high energy release is correlated with short [[half-life|half-lives]]). However, the dream of harnessing &quot;atomic energy&quot; was quite strong, even though it was dismissed by such fathers of [[nuclear physics]] like [[Ernest Rutherford]] as &quot;moonshine.&quot; This situation, however, changed in the late 1930s, with the discovery of [[nuclear fission]].

In 1932, [[James Chadwick]] discovered the [[neutron]], which was immediately recognized as a potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge. Experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frédéric]] and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] to discover [[induced radioactivity]] in 1934, which allowed the creation of radium-like elements at much less the price of natural radium. Further work by [[Enrico Fermi]] in the 1930s focused on using [[slow neutron]]s to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity. Experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led Fermi to believe he had created a new, transuranic element, which he dubbed [[hesperium]].

[[File:Hanford B Reactor.jpg|left|thumb|Constructing the core of [[B-Reactor]] at [[Hanford Site]] during the [[Manhattan Project]].]]
But in 1938, German chemists [[Otto Hahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1944/hahn-bio.html |title=Otto Hahn, The Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1944 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=http://www.nobelprize.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fritz Strassmann]], along with Austrian physicist [[Lise Meitner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/atomic/hahn-meitner.html |title=Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, and Lise Meitner |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=http://www.chemheritage.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Meitner's nephew, [[Otto Robert Frisch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/biographies/bio_frisch-otto.htm |title=Otto Robert Frisch |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=http://www.nuclearfiles.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted experiments with the products of neutron-bombarded uranium, as a means of further investigating Fermi's claims. They determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces, contradicting Fermi. This was an extremely surprising result: all other forms of [[nuclear decay]] involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus, whereas this process—dubbed &quot;fission&quot; as a [[binary fission|reference to biology]]—involved a complete rupture of the nucleus. Numerous scientists, including [[Leó Szilárd]], who was one of the first, recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons, a self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] could result. Once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by Frédéric Joliot-Curie in 1939, scientists in many countries (including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union) petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research, just on the cusp of World War II.

In the United States, where Fermi and Szilárd had both emigrated, this led to the creation of the first man-made reactor, known as [[Chicago Pile-1]], which achieved [[Critical mass|criticality]] on December 2, 1942. This work became part of the [[Manhattan Project]], which made [[enriched uranium]] and built large reactors to breed [[plutonium]] for use in the first [[nuclear weapon]]s, which were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|used on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

[[File:First four nuclear lit bulbs.jpeg|thumb|The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at [[EBR-1]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne National Laboratory-West]].]]
After World War II, the prospects of using &quot;atomic energy&quot; for good, rather than simply for war, were greatly advocated as a reason not to keep all nuclear research controlled by military organizations. However, most scientists agreed that civilian nuclear power would take at least a decade to master, and the fact that nuclear reactors also produced weapons-usable plutonium created a situation in which most national governments (such as those in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the USSR) attempted to keep reactor research under strict government control and classification. In the United States, reactor research was conducted by the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], primarily at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], [[Hanford Site]], and [[Argonne National Laboratory]].

===Early years===
[[Image:Calderhall.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Calder Hall nuclear power station]] in the United Kingdom was the world's first nuclear power station to produce electricity in commercial quantities.&lt;ref name = Kragh/&gt;]]

On June 27, 1954, the [[USSR]]'s [[Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant]] became the world's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a [[power grid]], and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEANews&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=From Obninsk Beyond: Nuclear Power Conference Looks to Future|work=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] |url= http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2004/obninsk.html | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WNA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear Power in Russia |work=[[World Nuclear Association]] |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf45.htm | accessdate = 2006-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1954, [[Lewis Strauss]], then chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (U.S. AEC, forerunner of the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Energy]]) spoke of electricity in the future being &quot;[[too cheap to meter]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thisdayinquotes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2009/09/too-cheap-to-meter-nuclear-quote-debate.html |title=This Day in Quotes: SEPTEMBER 16 - Too cheap to meter: the great nuclear quote debate  |accessdate=2009-09-16 |publisher=This day in quotes |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss was very likely referring to hydrogen fusion&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Richard (1984) ''No Sacrifice Too Great: The Life of Lewis L.

The U.S. AEC itself had issued far more conservative testimony regarding nuclear fission to the U.S. Congress only months before, projecting that &quot;costs can be brought down... [to]... about the same as the cost of electricity from conventional sources...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1955 the [[United Nations]]' &quot;First Geneva Conference&quot;, then the world's largest gathering of scientists and engineers, met to explore the technology. In 1957 [[EURATOM]] was launched alongside the [[European Economic Community]] (the latter is now the European Union). The same year also saw the launch of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA).

[[Image:Shippingport Reactor.jpg|thumb|The [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station]] in [[Shippingport, Pennsylvania]] was the first commercial reactor in the USA and was opened in 1957.]]

The world's first commercial nuclear power station, [[Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] at Windscale, England, was opened in 1956 with an initial capacity of 50 MW (later 200 MW).&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{cite book|last=Kragh|first=Helge|title=Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ|year=1999|page=286|isbn=0-691-09552-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc17oct&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_3147000/3147145.stm |title=On This Day: October 17 |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=BBC News | date=1956-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial nuclear generator to become operational in the United States was the [[Shippingport Reactor]] ([[Pennsylvania]], December 1957).

One of the first organizations to develop nuclear power was the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], for the purpose of propelling [[submarine]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. The first nuclear-powered submarine, {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|USS ''Nautilus'' (SSN-571}}, was put to sea in December 1954.&lt;ref name = &quot;iaeapdf&quot;/&gt; Two U.S. nuclear submarines, {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589|6}} and {{USS|Thresher|SSN-593|6}}, have been lost at sea.

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] also had a [[Army Nuclear Power Program|nuclear power program]], beginning in 1954. The SM-1 Nuclear Power Plant, at [[Fort Belvoir]], [[Virginia]], was the first power reactor in the U.S. to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid (VEPCO), in April 1957, before Shippingport.  The [[SL-1]] was a U.S. Army experimental [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power reactor]] at the [[Idaho National Laboratory|National Reactor Testing Station]] in [[Eastern Idaho|eastern]]  [[Idaho]].  It underwent a [[steam explosion]] and [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] in January 1961, which killed its three operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKeown |first=William |title=Idaho Falls: The Untold Story of America's First Nuclear Accident |isbn=978-1-55022-562-4 |year=2003 |publisher=ECW Press |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly, rising from less than 1 [[gigawatt]] (GW) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s, and 300 GW in the late 1980s. Since the late 1980s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly, reaching 366 GW in 2005. Between around 1970 and 1990, more than 50 GW of capacity was under construction (peaking at over 150 GW in the late 70s and early 80s) — in 2005, around 25 GW of new capacity was planned. More than two-thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after January 1970 were eventually cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;iaeapdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC48/Documents/gc48inf-4_ftn3.pdf |title=50 Years of Nuclear Energy |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of [[List of canceled nuclear plants in the United States|63 nuclear units were canceled]] in the USA between 1975 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=C5W8uxwMqdUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=%22nuclear+power+industry%22+history+u.s.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eKoapFItQj&amp;sig=7EIt76uytpHLlc5eOIaERDRENyk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y9osSoDWJYP6kAXhnZH9Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3 The Changing Structure of the Electric Power Industry] p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs (related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure-group litigation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter9.html |title=THE NUCLEAR ENERGY OPTION |author=Bernard L.

In the 1980s (U.S.) and 1990s (Europe), flat load growth and [[electricity liberalization]] also made the addition of large new baseload capacity unattractive.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] had a significant effect on countries, such as France and Japan, which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation (39%&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.iea.org/textbase/stats/pdf_graphs/FRELEC.pdf Evolution of Electricity Generation by Fuel]|39.4&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=April 2011}} and 73% respectively) to invest in nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Beder, '[http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/privatisation/japan.html The Japanese Situation]', English version of conclusion of Sharon Beder, &quot;Power Play: The Fight to Control the World's Electricity&quot;, Soshisha, Japan, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear power plant==
[[Image:Nuclear Power Plant Cattenom a.png|right|thumb|Unlike [[Fossil-fuel power station|fossil fuel power plants]], the only substance leaving the cooling towers of [[nuclear power plants]] is water vapour and thus does not [[Air pollution|pollute the air]] or cause [[global warming]].]]
{{main|Nuclear power plant}}
Just as many conventional [[thermal power station]]s generate electricity by harnessing the [[thermal energy]] released from burning [[fossil fuels]], nuclear power plants convert the energy released from the nucleus of an atom via [[nuclear fission]] that takes place in a [[nuclear reactor]]. The heat is removed from the reactor core by a cooling system that uses the heat to generate steam, which drives a [[steam turbine]] connected to a [[Electrical generator|generator]] producing [[electricity]].

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|thumb|The nuclear fuel cycle begins when uranium is mined, enriched, and manufactured into nuclear fuel, (1) which is delivered to a [[nuclear power plant]]. After usage in the power plant, the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (2) or to a final repository (3) for geological disposition. In [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can potentially be recycled to be returned to usage in a power plant (4).]]

{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}

A nuclear reactor is only part of the life-cycle for nuclear power. The process starts with mining (see ''[[Uranium mining]]''). Uranium mines are underground, [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]], or [[in-situ leach]] mines. In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as [[yellowcake]], and then transported to a processing facility. Here, the yellowcake is converted to [[uranium hexafluoride]], which is then [[uranium enrichment|enriched]] using various techniques. At this point, the enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% U-235, is used to make [[Fuel rod#Common physical forms of nuclear fuel|rods]] of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. The fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a [[spent fuel pool]] where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. After about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle, and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.

===Conventional fuel resources===
{{Main|Uranium market|Energy_development#Nuclear_energy|l2=Energy development - Nuclear energy}}

[[Uranium]] is a fairly common [[chemical element|element]] in the Earth's crust. Uranium is approximately as common as [[tin]] or [[germanium]] in Earth's crust, and is about 40&amp;nbsp;times more common than [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/uranium.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Uranium is a constituent of most rocks, dirt, and of the oceans. The fact that uranium is so spread out is a problem because mining uranium is only economically feasible where there is a large concentration. Still, the world's present measured resources of uranium, economically recoverable at a price of 130&amp;nbsp;USD/kg, are enough to last for &quot;at least a century&quot; by some estimates, or at little at 70 years by others &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spp.nus.edu.sg/docs/policy-briefs/201101_RSU_PolicyBrief_1-2nd_Thought_Nuclear-Sovacool.pdf |title=Second Thoughts About Nuclear Power |work=A Policy Brief - Challenges Facing Asia |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nea.fr/html/general/press/2008/2008-02.html | title= Uranium resources sufficient to meet projected nuclear energy requirements long into the future |date= June 3, 2008 |work= |publisher= [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] (NEA) | accessdate= 2008-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;[[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]], [[IAEA]]: [http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?sf1=identifiers&amp;st1=9789264047662 Uranium 2007 – Resources, Production and Demand]. [[OECD]] Publishing, June 10, 2008, ISBN 978-92-64-04766-2.&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. On the basis of analogies with other metallic minerals, a doubling of price from present levels could be expected to create about a tenfold increase in measured resources, over time. However, the cost of nuclear power lies for the most part in the construction of the power station. Therefore the fuel's contribution to the overall cost of the electricity produced is relatively small, so even a large fuel price escalation will have relatively little effect on final price. For instance, typically a doubling of the uranium market price would increase the fuel cost for a light water reactor by 26% and the electricity cost about 7%, whereas doubling the price of natural gas would typically add 70% to the price of electricity from that source. At high enough prices, eventually extraction from sources such as granite and seawater become economically feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf75.html] [http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf02.html] {{cite web |url= http://www.americanenergyindependence.com/uranium.html |title=World Uranium Reserves |accessdate=2006-11-10 |publisher=American Energy Independence |year=2004 |author=James Jopf}} [http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/nt/va-144-2-274-278] [http://www.nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/WebHomeEnergyLifecycleOfNuclear_Power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uraniumworld.org |title=Uranium in a global context}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current [[light water reactor]]s make relatively inefficient use of nuclear fuel, fissioning only the very rare uranium-235 isotope. [[Nuclear reprocessing]] can make this waste reusable and more efficient reactor designs allow better use of the available resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;wna-wmitnfc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf04.html |title=Waste Management in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |work=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breeding====
{{Main|Breeder reactor}}

As opposed to current light water reactors which use uranium-235 (0.7% of all natural uranium), fast breeder reactors use uranium-238 (99.3% of all natural uranium). It has been estimated that there is up to five billion years' worth of uranium-238 for use in these power plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford-cohen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts From Cohen and Others |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=Stanford |year=2006 |author=John McCarthy |authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist) |work=Progress and its Sustainability}} Citing Breeder reactors: A renewable energy source, ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'', vol.&amp;nbsp;51, (1), Jan.&amp;nbsp;1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeder technology has been used in several reactors, but the high cost of reprocessing fuel safely requires uranium prices of more than 200 USD/kg before becoming justified economically.&lt;ref name=&quot;wna-anpr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf08.html |title=Advanced Nuclear Power Reactors |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |work=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2005, the only breeder reactor producing power is BN-600 in Beloyarsk, Russia. The electricity output of BN-600 is 600 MW — Russia has planned to build another unit, BN-800, at Beloyarsk nuclear power plant. Also, Japan's [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju]] reactor is planned for restart (having been shut down since 1995), and both China and India intend to build breeder reactors.

Another alternative would be to use uranium-233 bred from [[thorium]] as fission fuel in the [[thorium fuel cycle]]. Thorium is about 3.5 times more common than uranium in the Earth's crust, and has different geographic characteristics. This would extend the total practical fissionable resource base by 450%.&lt;ref name=&quot;wna-thorium&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf62.html |title=Thorium |accessdate=2006-11-09 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |year=2006 |work=Information and Issue Briefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the breeding of U-238 into plutonium, fast breeder reactors are not necessary — it can be performed satisfactorily in more conventional plants. India has looked into this technology, as it has abundant thorium reserves but little uranium.

====Fusion====
[[Fusion power]] advocates commonly propose the use of [[deuterium]], or [[tritium]], both [[isotope]]s of [[hydrogen]], as fuel and in many current designs also [[lithium]] and [[boron]]. Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the current global output and that this does not increase in the future, then the known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years, lithium from sea water would last 60 million years, and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium from sea water would have fuel for 150 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Solid waste===
{{details|Radioactive waste}}
{{See also|List of nuclear waste treatment technologies}}

The most important waste stream from nuclear power plants is [[spent nuclear fuel]]. It is primarily composed of unconverted uranium as well as significant quantities of transuranic [[actinides]] (plutonium and [[curium]], mostly). In addition, about 3% of it is fission products from nuclear reactions. The actinides (uranium, plutonium, and curium) are responsible for the bulk of the long-term radioactivity, whereas the fission products are responsible for the bulk of the short-term radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;M.

====High-level radioactive waste====
{{Main|High-level radioactive waste management}}
[[File:Spent nuclear fuel hanford.jpg|thumb|right|Spent nuclear fuel stored underwater and uncapped at the [[Hanford site]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], USA.]]

''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; High-level radioactive waste management concerns management and disposal of highly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials created during production of nuclear power. The technical issues in accomplishing this are daunting, due to the extremely long periods [[radioactive waste]]s remain deadly to living organisms. Of particular concern are two [[long-lived fission product]]s, [[Technetium-99]] (half-life 220,000 years) and [[Iodine-129]] (half-life 15.7 million years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |title=Environmental Surveillance, Education and Research Program |url=http://www.stoller-eser.com/Quarterlies/iodine.htm |accessdate=2009-01-05 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081121041307/http://www.stoller-eser.com/Quarterlies/iodine.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dominate spent nuclear fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years. The most troublesome [[Transuranium element|transuranic element]]s in spent fuel are [[Isotopes of neptunium|Neptunium-237]] (half-life two million years) and [[Plutonium-239]] (half-life 24,000 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vandenbosch|2007|p=21.|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, high-level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the [[biosphere]]. This usually necessitates treatment, followed by a long-term management strategy involving permanent storage, disposal or transformation of the waste into a non-toxic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ojovan, M.

Since the fraction of a radioisotope's atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human [[radioactive waste]] would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes (such as the decay chains of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each]] over the crust's 3 * 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; ton mass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sevior M. |title=Considerations for nuclear power in Australia |journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies |volume=63 |issue=6 |pages=859–872 |doi=10.1080/00207230601047255 |year=2006 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a767886528 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20402%20ME%20405%20Nuclear%20Power%20Engineering/Thorium%20Resources%20in%20%20Rare%20Earth%20Elements.pdf Thorium Resources In Rare Earth Elements]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, abstract #V33A-1161.

====Low-level radioactive waste====
{{See also|Low-level waste}}

[[File:Ikata Nuclear Powerplant.JPG|thumb|The [[Ikata Nuclear Power Plant]], a [[pressurized water reactor]] that cools by secondary coolant exchange with the ocean]]

The nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low-level radioactive waste in the form of contaminated items like clothing, hand tools, water purifier resins, and (upon decommissioning) the materials of which the reactor itself is built. In the United States, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has repeatedly attempted to allow low-level materials to be handled as normal waste: landfilled, recycled into consumer items, etcetera.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

====Comparing radioactive waste to industrial toxic waste====
In countries with nuclear power, radioactive wastes comprise less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, much of which remains hazardous indefinitely.&lt;ref name=&quot;wna-wmitnfc&quot; /&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2012}} Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Coal]]-burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste&lt;/ref&gt; A recent report from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] concludes that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation, and that the population [[Effective dose (radiation safety)|effective dose]] equivalent  from radiation from coal plants is 100 times as much as from ideal operation of nuclear plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;colmain&quot;&gt;{{cite web

====Waste disposal====
Disposal of nuclear waste is often said to be the Achilles' heel of the industry.&lt;ref name=mont2011&gt;Montgomery, Scott L. (2010). ''The Powers That Be'', University of Chicago Press, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, waste is mainly stored at individual reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate. Some experts suggest that centralized underground repositories which are well-managed, guarded, and monitored, would be a vast improvement.&lt;ref name=mont2011/&gt; There is an &quot;international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in [[Deep geological repository]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=go/&gt; with much confidence in the safety of the method coming from the analysis of the lack of movement of nuclear waste in the numerous 2 billion year old [[Natural nuclear fission reactor]]s in [[Oklo]] [[Gabon]].&lt;ref&gt;www.efn.org.au/NucWaste-Comby.pdf international Journal of Environmental Studies, The Solutions for Nuclear waste, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Reprocessing===
{{details|Nuclear reprocessing}}

Reprocessing can potentially recover up to 95% of the remaining uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel, putting it into new [[mixed oxide fuel]]. This produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste, since this is largely short-lived fission products, and reduces its volume by over 90%. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in Britain, France and (formerly) Russia, soon will be done in China and perhaps India, and is being done on an expanding scale in Japan. The full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved because it requires [[breeder reactor]]s, which are not commercially available. France is generally cited as the most successful reprocessor, but it presently only recycles 28% (by mass) of the yearly fuel use, 7% within France and another 21% in Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot;&gt;[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/feb07/4891 IEEE Spectrum: Nuclear Wasteland].

====Depleted uranium====
{{Main|Depleted uranium}}

Uranium enrichment produces many tons of [[depleted uranium]] (DU) which consists of U-238 with most of the easily fissile U-235 isotope removed. U-238 is a tough metal with several commercial uses—for example, aircraft production, radiation shielding, and armor—as it has a higher density than [[lead]]. Depleted uranium is also controversially used in munitions; DU penetrators (bullets or [[APFSDS]] tips) &quot;self sharpen&quot;, due to uranium's tendency to fracture along shear bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Economics==

{{Main|Economics of new nuclear power plants}}

The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multi-billion dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. [[Nuclear power plant]]s typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low fuel costs.  Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants as well as the future costs of fossil fuels and renewables as well as for energy storage solutions for intermittent power sources. Cost estimates also need to take into account [[nuclear decommissioning|plant decommissioning]] and [[nuclear waste]] storage costs. On the other hand measures to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate]] [[global warming]], such as a [[carbon tax]] or [[carbon emissions trading]], may favor the economics of nuclear power.

In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which has an impact on large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks.&lt;ref name=kidd2011/&gt; In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out.&lt;ref name=kidd2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653  |title=New reactors—more or less? |author=Kidd, Steve |date=January 21, 2011 |work=Nuclear Engineering International }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.&lt;ref name=kidd2011/&gt;

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by [[Nationalized|state-owned]] or [[Regulated market|regulated]] [[Electric utility|utility monopolies]]&lt;ref name=ft-20100912&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad15fcfe-bc71-11df-a42b-00144feab49a.html |title=Nuclear: New dawn now seems limited to the east |author=Ed Crooks |publisher=Financial Times |date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where many of the risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, accident liability and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. In addition, because the potential liability from a nuclear accident is so great, the full cost of liability insurance is generally limited/capped by the government, which the [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] concluded constituted a significant subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1983. The Price-Anderson Act: the Third Decade, NUREG-0957&lt;/ref&gt;  Many countries have now liberalized the [[electricity market]] where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=MIT-2003&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-615-12420-8 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]], costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/nuclear-fuel-cycle/The_Nuclear_Fuel_Cycle-all.pdf |title=The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2011 |work= |page=xv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some serious [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|nuclear and radiation accidents]] have occurred.

==Nuclear proliferation==
Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can be used to make [[nuclear weapons]] if a country chooses to do so. When this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to the atomic bomb or a public annex to a secret bomb program. The crisis over [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear activities]] is a case in point.&lt;ref name=dfall2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/daed.2009.138.4.7  |title=Nuclear power without nuclear proliferation? |author=Steven E. Miller &amp; Scott D. Sagan |date=Fall 2009  |work=Dædalus }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental goal for American and global security is to minimize the [[nuclear proliferation]] risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power. If this development is &quot;poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful, the nuclear future will be dangerous&quot;.&lt;ref name=dfall2009/&gt;

A &quot;number of high-ranking officials, even within the United Nations, have argued that they can do little to stop states using [[nuclear reactor]]s to produce nuclear weapons&quot;.&lt;ref name=bks2011/&gt; A 2009 United Nations report said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, one factor influencing the support of reactors is due to the appeal that reactors have at reducing Nuclear weapons arsenals through the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]], a program which has thus far eliminated 425 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, the equivalent of 17,000 nuclear warheads, by converting it into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors, and is the single most successful non-proliferation program to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebulletin.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/support-of-the-megatons-to-megawatts-program |title= The Bulletin of atomic scientists support the megatons to megawatts program |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usec.com&quot;&gt;http://www.usec.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Nuclear weapon advocates, such as the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] want to see the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] not only continue but be expanded,&lt;ref name=&quot;thebulletin.org&quot;/&gt; The program appeals to anti-Nuclear weapon advocates as it provides a financial incentive for countries with vast quantities of Nuclear weapons, like Russia, to dismantle their arsenal and sell the fissile fuel contained within to operators of Nuclear reactors.
[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|[[United States]] and [[USSR]]/[[Russia]]n [[nuclear weapons]] stockpiles, 1945-2006.The [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] was the main driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of Nuclear Weapons worldwide since the cold war ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebulletin.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usec.com&quot;/&gt; However without an increase in Nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling has dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament.]]
The [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] has been hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of Nuclear Weapons worldwide since the cold war ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebulletin.org&quot;/&gt; However without an increase in Nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and downblending has dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament.
Currently, according to Harvard professor Matthew Bunn: The Russians are not remotely interested in extending the program beyond 2013. We've managed to set it up in a way that costs them more and profits them less than them just making new low-enriched uranium for reactors from scratch. But there are other ways to set it up that would be very profitable for them and would also serve some of their strategic interests in boosting their nuclear exports.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121125743&lt;/ref&gt;

As there are currently [[Nuclear power by country|thiry one countries]] that have Civil Nuclear power plants,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf01.html&lt;/ref&gt; with only [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nine of which with Nuclear weapons]] it confirms that Nuclear weapons manufacture, generally, does not always follow the construction of civilian nuclear reactors. 
In contrast, almost every [[Nuclear weapons state]] began producing weapons first and not commercial Nuclear power plants.
Together with the fact that commercial nuclear reactors are the most successful non-proliferation agent to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;usec.com&quot;/&gt; The suggested link between reactors and proliferation is, although complex, with the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]] the trend has been towards acting not as a proliferation risk, but on balance as a non-proliferation benefit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore there are many [[Nuclear weapon design]]s that do not require any reactor produced materials at all, meaning that if a state is motivated to produce weapons it does not necessarily have to go through the high profile process of constructing Nuclear power reactors or indeed production reactors. For example, the enriched Uranium necessary for the first primitive Nuclear weapon, designated [[Little Boy]], did not require any appreciable reactor products, instead relying entirely on [[Enriched uranium|Uranium Enrichment]] technology.

==Environmental issues==
[[Image:Sovacool 2008 life-cycle study.png|thumb|right|A 2008 [[meta analysis|synthesis]] of 103 studies, published by Benjamin K. Sovacool, estimated that the value of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions for nuclear power over the lifecycle of a plant was 66.08&amp;nbsp;g/kW·h. Comparative results for various [[renewable power]] sources were 9–32&amp;nbsp;g/kW·h.&lt;ref name=sov/&gt; However a more recent 2012 study by [[Yale University]] revealed this nuclear estimate to be too high, and the mean value, depending on which Reactor design was analyzed, arrived at a range from 11 to 25&amp;nbsp;g/kW·h of [[Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions|total life cycle]] nuclear power CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00472.x/full |title=Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Nuclear Electricity Generation |year= 2012 |location=Yale}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Life cycle analysis]] (LCA) of carbon dioxide emissions show nuclear power as comparable to [[renewable energy]] sources. Emissions from burning fossil fuels are many times higher.&lt;ref name=sov&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool.

''[[Energy Policy]]'', Vol. 36, 2008, p. 2950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf100.html Energy Balances and {{CO2}} Implications] World Nuclear Association November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nei.org/keyissues/protectingtheenvironment/lifecycleemissionsanalysis/ |title=Life-cycle emissions analyses |publisher=Nei.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United Nations ([[UNSCEAR]]), regular nuclear power plant operation including the nuclear fuel cycle causes radioisotope releases into the environment amounting to 0.0002 mSv
(milli-[[Sievert]]) per year of public exposure as a global average.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf |title=UNSCEAR 2008 Report to the General Assembly |publisher=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Such is small compared to variation in natural [[background radiation]], which averages 2.4 mSv/yr globally but frequently varies between 1 mSv/yr and 13 mSv/yr depending on a person's location as determined by UNSCEAR).&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA/&gt; As of a 2008 report, the remaining legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident (Chernobyl) is 0.002 mSv/yr in global average exposure (a figure which was 0.04 mSv per person averaged over the entire populace of the Northern Hemisphere in the year of the accident in 1986, although far higher among the most affected local populations and recovery workers).&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR_GA/&gt;

=== Climate change ===
[[Climate change]] causing weather extremes such as [[heat waves]], reduced precipitation levels and [[droughts]] can have a significant impact on nuclear energy infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Dr. Frauke Urban and Dr. Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; Seawater is corrosive and so nuclear energy supply is likely to be negatively affected by the fresh [[water shortage]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This generic problem may become increasingly significant over time.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; This can force nuclear reactors to be shut down, as happened in France during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves. Nuclear power supply was severely diminished by low river ﬂow rates and droughts, which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling reactors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; During the heat waves, 17 reactors had to limit output or shut down. 77% of French electricity is produced by nuclear power and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8GW shortage and forced the French government to import electricity.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Other cases have been reported from Germany, where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; In particular:
* the [[Unterweser Nuclear Power Plant|Unterweser nuclear power plant]] reduced output by 90% between June and September 2003&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* the [[Isar Nuclear Power Plant|Isar nuclear power plant]] cut production by 60% for 14 days due to excess river temperatures and low stream ﬂow in the river Isar in 2006&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
Similar events have happened elsewhere in Europe during those same hot summers.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; If [[global warming]] continues, this disruption is likely to increase.

==[[Nuclear decommissioning]]==
The price of energy inputs and the environmental costs of every nuclear power plant continue long after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may last as long as a century, reactors must be dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for final disposal. The process is very expensive, time-consuming, dangerous for workers, hazardous to the natural environment, and presents new opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.&lt;ref name=sov11/&gt; 

The total energy required for decommissioning can be as much as 50% more than the energy needed for the original construction. In most cases, the decommissioning process costs between US $300 million to US$5.6 billion. Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming. In the U.S. there are 13 reactors that have permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning, and none of them have completed the process.&lt;ref name=sov11&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate on nuclear power==
{{Main|Nuclear power debate}}
{{See also|Nuclear energy policy|Anti-nuclear movement}}

The [[nuclear power debate]] is about the controversy&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Reasonable Bet on Nuclear Power&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=eleven&gt;J. Samuel Walker (2004).

The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, when it &quot;reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies&quot;, in some countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;marcuse.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Falk]] (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a [[sustainable energy]] source that reduces [[carbon emissions]] and increases [[energy security]] by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloomberg.com&quot;/&gt; Proponents claim that nuclear power produces virtually no conventional air pollution, such as greenhouse gases and smog, in contrast to the chief viable alternative of [[Fossil-fuel power station|fossil fuel]].

==Nuclear renaissance==
{{Main|Nuclear renaissance}}
Since about 2001 the term &quot;nuclear renaissance&quot; has been used to refer to a possible nuclear power industry revival, driven by rising [[Price of petroleum|fossil fuel prices]] and new concerns about meeting [[greenhouse gas]] emission limits.  Being able to rely on an uninterrupted domestic [[Energy security|supply of electricity]] is also a factor. In the words of the French, &quot;We have no [[coal]], we have no [[petroleum|oil]], we have no [[natural gas|gas]], we have no choice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher= Platts |url= http://www.platts.com/Nuclear/Resources/News%20Features/nukeinsight/ | title = Nuclear renaissance faces realities | accessdate=2007-07-13 |id={{Subscription required}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in [[nuclear reactor]] safety, and the public's waning memory of past [[nuclear accident]]s ([[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] in 1979 and [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] in 1986), as well as of the plant construction cost overruns of the 1970s and 80s, are lowering public resistance to new nuclear construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html The Nuclear Renaissance (by the World Nuclear Association)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, various barriers to a nuclear renaissance have been identified. These include: unfavourable economics compared to other sources of energy, slowness in addressing [[climate change]], industrial bottlenecks and personnel shortages in nuclear sector, and the unresolved [[High-level radioactive waste management|nuclear waste]] issue. There are also concerns about more accidents, security, and [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]].&lt;ref name=tf2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Findlay.

The U.S. NRC and the U.S. Department of Energy have initiated research into [[Light water reactor sustainability]] which is hoped will lead to allowing extensions of reactor licenses beyond 60 years, in increments of 20 years, provided that safety can be maintained, as the loss in non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emitting generation capacity by retiring reactors &quot;may serve to challenge U.S. energy security, potentially resulting in increased [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, and contributing to an imbalance between electric supply and demand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LifeAfter60&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Following the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]], the [[International Energy Agency]] halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist-20110428&quot;/&gt; [[Platts]] has reported that &quot;the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platts&quot;/&gt; In 2011, ''The Economist'' reported that nuclear power &quot;looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky&quot;, and that &quot;it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works&quot;.&lt;ref name=econ2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |author= |date=March 24, 2011 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early April 2011, analysts at Swiss-based investment bank UBS said: &quot;At Fukushima, four reactors have been out of control for weeks, casting doubt on whether even an advanced economy can master nuclear safety . . .. We believe the Fukushima accident was the most serious ever for the credibility of nuclear power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fukushima crisis worse for atomic power than Chernobyl, USB says |author=Paton J  |date=April 4, 2011 |work=Bloomberg.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Deutsche Bank]] analysts concluded that &quot;the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public
perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways&quot;. As a consequence, &quot;[[renewable energy]] will be a clear long-term winner in most energy systems, a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks. At the same time, we consider [[natural gas]] to be, at the very least, an important transition fuel, especially in those regions where it is considered secure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Bank Group (2011).

In September 2011, German engineering giant [[Siemens]] announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan, and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world. The company’s chairman, Peter Löscher, said that &quot;Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company, in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/energy-environment/the-year-of-peril-and-promise-in-energy-production.html?src=un&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fbusiness%2Fglobal%2Findex.jsonp  |title=The Year of Peril and Promise in Energy Production |author=John Broder |date=October 10, 2011   |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 |title=Siemens to quit nuclear industry |author= |date=18 September 2011  |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster &quot;caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2011/09/23/IAEA-sees-slow-nuclear-growth-post-Japan/UPI-87041316777856/ |title=IAEA sees slow nuclear growth post Japan |author= |date=September 23, 2011 |work=UPI }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] approved the construction of two additional reactors at the [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant]], the first reactors to be approved in over 30 years since the Three Mile Island accident,&lt;ref name=yah12&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.yahoo.com/first-next-gen-us-reactor-designed-avoid-fukushima-005203660.html | title=First Next-Gen US Reactor Designed to Avoid Fukushima Repeat | publisher=Live Science (hosted on Yahoo!) | date=February 9, 2012 | accessdate=February 9, 2012 | author=Hsu, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but NRC Chairman [[Gregory Jaczko]] cast a dissenting vote citing safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], and saying &quot;I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-usa-nuclear-nrc-idUSTRE8182J720120209  |title=U.S. approves first new nuclear plant in a generation  |author=Ayesha Rascoe | date=Feb 9, 2012  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; One week after Southern received the license to begin major construction on the two new reactors, a dozen environmental and [[anti-nuclear]] groups are suing to stop the Plant Vogtle expansion project, saying &quot;public safety and environmental problems since Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor accident have not been taken into account&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/business/groups-sue-to-stop-1351830.html |title=Groups sue to stop Vogtle expansion project |author=Kristi E. Swartz |date=February 16, 2012 |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear reactors to be built at Vogtle are new [[AP1000]] third generation reactors, which are said to have safety improvements over older power reactors.&lt;ref name=yah12/&gt; However, John Ma, a senior structural engineer at the NRC, is concerned that some parts of the AP1000 steel skin are so brittle that the &quot;impact energy&quot; from a plane strike or storm driven projectile could shatter the wall.&lt;ref name=bs11/&gt; Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the AP1000.&lt;ref name=bs11&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear energy: Planning for the Black Swan |author=Adam Piore |date=June 2011 |work=Scientific American }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Gundersen]], a nuclear engineer commissioned by several anti-nuclear groups, released a report which explored a hazard associated with the possible rusting through of the containment structure steel liner.&lt;ref name=mlw&gt;Matthew L.

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] has referred to the [[European Pressurized Reactor]], currently under construction in China, Finland and France, as the only new reactor design under consideration in the United States that &quot;...appears to have the potential to be significantly safer and more secure against attack than today's reactors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPIAWW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Power in a Warming World|work=Union of Concerned Scientists |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced concepts===
{{Main|Generation IV reactor}}

Current reactors in operation around the world are second or third generation systems, with most of the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into advanced generation IV reactor types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals, including to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste, improve natural resource utilization, the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity, and decrease the cost to build and run such plants. Most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors, and are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030.&lt;ref&gt;http://ossfoundation.us/projects/energy/nuclear&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear fusion===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions appear potentially viable, though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant. Fusion power has been under intense theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s.
