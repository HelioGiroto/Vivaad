'''Air pollution''' is the introduction (into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]) of [[chemical]]s, [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], or [[biomolecule|biological material]]s that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the [[natural environment]] or [[built environment]].   

The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet [[Earth]]. [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's [[ecosystems]].

Indoor air pollution and urban air quality are listed as two of the World’s Worst Toxic Pollution Problems in the 2008 [[Blacksmith Institute]] World's Worst Polluted Places report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpolluted.org/ |title=Reports |publisher=WorstPolluted.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100811155338/http://www.worstpolluted.org/| archivedate= 11 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pollutants==
{{main|Pollutant|Greenhouse gas}} 
[[Image:Air .pollution 1.jpg|thumb|260px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
[[File:Air Pollution-Causes&amp;Effects.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic drawing, causes and effects of air pollution: (1) greenhouse effect, (2) particulate contamination, (3) increased UV radiation, (4) acid rain, (5) increased ground level ozone concentration, (6) increased levels of nitrogen oxides.]]

A substance in the air that can cause harm to humans and the environment is known as an air pollutant. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases.  In addition, they may be natural or man-made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/airairpollutants.html |title=EPA: Air Pollutants |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2010-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100722123609/http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/airairpollutants.html| archivedate= 22 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollutants can be classified as primary or secondary. Usually, primary pollutants are directly emitted from a process, such as ash from a volcanic eruption, the [[carbon monoxide]] gas from a motor vehicle exhaust or sulfur dioxide released from factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. An important example of a secondary pollutant is [[ground level ozone]]&amp;nbsp;— one of the many secondary pollutants that make up photochemical smog. Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: that is, they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants.

Major primary pollutants produced by human activity include:

* [[Sulphur oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) - especially sulfur dioxide, a chemical compound with the formula SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes. Since coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, their combustion generates sulfur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, forms H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus acid rain.[2] This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.
* [[Nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) - especially [[nitrogen dioxide]] are emitted from high temperature combustion, and are also produced naturally during [[thunderstorms]] by [[electrical discharge]]. Can be seen as the brown haze dome above or [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is the chemical compound with the formula NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is one of the several nitrogen oxides. This reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor. NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the most prominent air pollutants.
* [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO)- is a colourless, odorless, non-irritating but very poisonous gas. It is a product by [[incomplete combustion]] of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. Vehicular exhaust is a major source of carbon monoxide.
* [[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) - a colourless, odorless, non-toxic [[greenhouse gas]] also associated with [[ocean acidification]], emitted from sources such as combustion, cement production, and [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. It is otherwise recycled in the atmosphere in the [[carbon cycle]].
* [[Volatile organic compounds]] - VOCs are an important outdoor air pollutant. In this field they are often divided into the separate categories of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases via their role in creating ozone and in prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere, although the effect varies depending on local air quality. Within the NMVOCs, the aromatic compounds benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia through prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound which is often associated with industrial uses.

* [[Atmospheric particulate matter]] - Particulates, alternatively referred to as particulate matter (PM) or fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosol refers to particles and the gas together. Sources of particulate matter can be man made or natural. Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged over the globe, anthropogenic aerosols—those made by human activities—currently account for about 10 percent of the total amount of aerosols in our atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsroom.heart.org/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1029 Evidence growing of air pollution’s link to heart disease, death] // American Heart Association. May 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; altered lung function and lung cancer.

* [[Radical (chemistry)#Persistent radicals|Persistent free radicals]] connected to airborne fine particles could cause cardiopulmonary disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/pdf138201201.pdf |title=Newly detected air pollutant mimics damaging effects of cigarette smoke |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090722123751.htm |title=Infant Inhalation Of Ultrafine Air Pollution Linked To Adult Lung Disease |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Toxic [[metal]]s, such as [[lead]], [[cadmium]] and [[copper]].
* [[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs) - harmful to the [[ozone layer]] emitted from products currently banned from use.
* [[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) - emitted from agricultural processes. Ammonia is a compound with the formula NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is normally encountered as a gas with a characteristic pungent odor. Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals. Although in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous.
* [[Odor]]s&amp;nbsp;— such as from garbage, sewage, and industrial processes
* [[Radioactive pollutants]] - produced by [[nuclear explosions]], nuclear events, war [[explosives]], and natural processes such as the [[radioactive decay]] of [[radon]].
[[File:Smoke Above Sintagma.jpg|thumb|left|Pollution in the sky of [[Athens]], [[Greece]].]]
Secondary pollutants include:

* Particulate matter formed from gaseous primary pollutants and compounds in photochemical smog. Smog is a kind of air pollution; the word &quot;smog&quot; is a portmanteau of smoke and fog. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide. Modern smog does not usually come from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the atmosphere by [[ultraviolet]] light from the sun to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog.
* [[Ground level ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) formed from NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and VOCs. Ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a key constituent of the troposphere. It is also an important constituent of certain regions of the stratosphere commonly known as the Ozone layer. Photochemical and chemical reactions involving it drive many of the chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere by day and by night. At abnormally high concentrations brought about by human activities (largely the combustion of fossil fuel), it is a pollutant, and a constituent of smog.
* [[Peroxyacetyl nitrate]] (PAN) - similarly formed from NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and VOCs.

Minor air pollutants include:

* A large number of minor [[:Category:Hazardous air pollutants|hazardous air pollutants]]. Some of these are regulated in USA under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and in Europe under the Air Framework Directive.
* A variety of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s, which can attach to particulate matter.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes. Because of this, they have been observed to persist in the environment, to be capable of long-range transport, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and to have potential significant impacts on human health and the environment.

Sources of air pollution refer to the various locations, activities or factors which are
responsible for the releasing of pollutants into the atmosphere. These sources can be classified into two major categories which are:

'''Anthropogenic sources (human activity)''' mostly related to burning different kinds of [[fuel]]

* &quot;Stationary Sources&quot; include smoke stacks of [[power plant]]s, manufacturing facilities (factories) and waste incinerators, as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices. In developing and poor countries, traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants; traditional biomass includes wood, crop waste and dung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass Pollution Basics|author=David Pennise and Kirk Smith|publisher=WHO|url=http://www.who.int/indoorair/interventions/antiguamod21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indoor air pollution and household energy|publisher=WHO and UNEP|year=2011|url=http://www.who.int/heli/risks/indoorair/indoorair/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &quot;Mobile Sources&quot; include [[Roadway air dispersion modeling|motor vehicles]], marine vessels, aircraft and the effect of sound etc.

* [[Chemicals]], dust and [[controlled burn]] practices in agriculture and forestry management. Controlled or prescribed burning is a technique sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing the forest.

* Fumes from [[paint]], [[hair spray]], [[varnish]], [[aerosol spray]]s and other solvents

* Waste deposition in [[landfill]]s, which generate [[methane]]. Methane is not toxic; however, it is highly flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia or suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5% by displacement

* Military, such as [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[toxic gas]]es, [[germ warfare]] and [[rocket]]ry

'''Natural sources'''

* [[Dust]] from natural sources, usually large areas of land with little or no vegetation
* [[Methane]], [[Flatulence|emitted]] by the [[digestion]] of food by [[animal]]s, for example [[cattle]]
* [[Radon]] gas from [[radioactive decay]] within the [[Earth's crust]]. Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium. It is considered to be a health hazard. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as the basement and it is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after [[cigarette]] smoking

* [[Smoke]] and [[carbon monoxide]] from [[wildfires]]
* Vegetation, in some regions, emits environmentally significant amounts of VOCs on warmer days.  These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants—specifically, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds—to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/8835.full|title=Biogenic carbon and anthropogenic pollutants combine to form a cooling haze over the southeastern United States|work=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|author=Goldstein, Allen H., Charles D. Koven, Colette L. Heald, Inez Y. Fung|date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Volcano|Volcanic]] activity, which produce [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], and ash [[particulate]]s

===Emission factors===
{{main|AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors}}

[[File:Industrial-pollution.JPG|thumb|240px|Industrial Air Pollution emissions]]Air [[pollutant]] emission factors are representative values that people attempt to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant. These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per [[megagram]] of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.

There are 12 compounds in the list of POPs. Dioxins and furans are two of them and are intentionally created by combustion of organics, like open burning of plastics. The POPs are also endocrine disruptor and can mutate the human genes.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a multitude of industrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html |title=AP 42, Volume I |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100924132127/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html| archivedate= 24 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and many other countries have published similar compilations, as well as the [[European Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naei.org.uk/emissions/index.php |title=United Kingdom's emission factor database |publisher=Naei.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-emission-inventory-guidebook-2009 EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook — 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/environmental-issues/environmental-pollution/ Environmental Pollution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/invs6.htm |title=Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (reference manual) |publisher=Ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indoor air quality (IAQ)==
{{main|Indoor air quality}}

A lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often spend the majority of their time.  Radon (Rn) gas, a [[carcinogen]], is exuded from the Earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses. Building materials including [[carpet]]ing and [[plywood]] emit [[formaldehyde]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) gas. Paint and solvents give off [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) as they dry. [[Lead]] paint can degenerate into [[dust]] and be inhaled. Intentional air pollution is introduced with the use of [[air freshener]]s, [[incense]], and other scented items. Controlled wood fires in stoves and [[fireplace]]s can add significant amounts of smoke particulates into the air, inside and out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index130.html |title=Duflo, E., Greenstone, M., and Hanna, R. (2008) &quot;Indoor air pollution, health and economic well-being&quot;. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor pollution fatalities may be caused by using [[pesticide]]s and other chemical sprays indoors without proper ventilation.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys, or by the burning of [[charcoal]] indoors. Chronic [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] can result even from poorly adjusted [[pilot light]]s. Traps are built into all domestic [[plumbing]] to keep sewer gas, [[hydrogen sulfide]], out of interiors.  Clothing emits [[tetrachloroethylene]], or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after [[dry cleaning]].

Though its use has now been banned in many countries, the extensive use of [[asbestos]] in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities. [[Asbestosis]] is a chronic [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] medical condition affecting the tissue of the [[lung]]s. It occurs after long-term, heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials in structures. Sufferers have severe [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of [[lung cancer]].  As clear explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature, care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. According to the [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/123072/AQG2ndEd_6_2_asbestos.PDF World Health Organisation (WHO)], these may defined as; [[asbestosis]], ''lung cancer'', and ''[[Peritoneal Mesothelioma]]'' (generally a very rare form of cancer, when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos).

Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors, as gases and airborne particulates. [[Pet]]s produce dander, people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair, dust [[mite]]s in bedding, carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane, [[mold]] forms in walls and generates [[mycotoxins]] and spores, [[air conditioning]] systems can incubate [[Legionellosis|Legionnaires' disease]] and mold,  and [[houseplant]]s, soil and surrounding [[gardens]] can produce [[pollen]], dust, and mold. Indoors, the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature.

==Health effects==
Air pollution is a significant risk factor for multiple  health conditions including respiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer, according to the WHO.  The health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions.  These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits, more hospital admissions and premature death.  The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system.  Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, the individual's health status and genetics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;!-- mostly obvious, but at least the genetics claim needs citation --&gt;

The most common sources of air pollution include particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.  Both indoor and outdoor air pollution have caused approximately 3.3 million deaths worldwide.   Children aged less than five years that live in developing countries are the most vulnerable population in terms of total deaths attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization states that 2.4 million people die each year from causes directly attributable to air pollution, with 1.5 million of these deaths attributable to indoor air pollution.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/quantifying_ehimpacts/countryprofilesebd.xls |title=Estimated deaths &amp; DALYs attributable to selected environmental risk factors, by WHO Member State, 2002 |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;[[Epidemiological]] studies suggest that more than 500,000 Americans die each year from [[cardiopulmonary]] disease linked to breathing [[Atmospheric particulate matter|fine particle air pollution]]. . .&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

The US EPA estimates allowing a ground-level ozone concentration of 65 parts per billion, would avert 1,700 to 5,100 premature deaths nationwide in 2020 compared with the current 75-ppb standard.

Diesel exhaust (DE) is a major contributor to combustion derived particulate matter air pollution. In several human experimental studies, using a well validated exposure chamber setup, DE has been linked to acute vascular dysfunction and increased thrombus formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18952612 Diesel exhaust inhalation increases thrombus formation in man] Andrew J. Lucking, Magnus Lundback, Nicholas L. Mills, Dana Faratian, Stefan L. Barath, Jamshid Pourazar, Flemming R. Cassee, Kenneth Donaldson,

This serves as a plausible mechanistic link between the previously described association between particulate matter air pollution and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

===Effects on cardiovascular health===
A 2007 review of evidence found ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor correlating with increased  total mortality from cardiovascular events (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m3 increase). PMID 19235364. 

Air pollution is also emerging as a risk factor for stroke, particularly in developing countries where pollutant levels are highest.&lt;ref&gt;Farrah J. Mateen &amp; Robert D.

===Effects on cystic fibrosis===
{{main|Cystic fibrosis}}
A study from around the years of 1999 to 2000, by the University of Washington, showed that patients near and around particulate matter air pollution had an increased risk of pulmonary exacerbations and decrease in lung function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine]] | volume = 169 | pages = 816–821 | year = 2004 | title = Effect of Ambient Air Pollution on Pulmonary Exacerbations and Lung Function in Cystic Fibrosis | author = Christopher H.

Participants involved in the study were located in the United States in close proximity to an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].{{Clarify|date=February 2008}}  During the time of the study 117 deaths were associated with air pollution. Many patients in the study lived in or near large metropolitan areas in order to be close to medical help. These same patients had higher level of pollutants found in their system because of more emissions in larger cities. As cystic fibrosis patients already suffer from decreased lung function, everyday pollutants such as smoke, emissions from automobiles, tobacco smoke and improper use of indoor heating devices could further compromise lung function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michael Kymisis, Konstantinos Hadjistavrou | title = Short-Term Effects Of Air Pollution Levels On Pulmonary Function Of Young Adults | journal = The Internet Journal of Pulmonary Medicine | year = 2008 | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | url = http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijpm/vol9n2/pollution.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on COPD and asthma===

{{main|Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}}
[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) includes diseases such as [[chronic bronchitis]] and [[emphysema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zoidis, John D. | title = The Impact of Air Pollution on COPD | journal = RT: for Decision Makers in Respiratory Care | year = 1999 | url = http://www.rtmagazine.com/issues/articles/1999-10_06.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researches have demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma &lt;ref&gt;Gehring, U., Wijga, A. H., Brauer, M., Fischer, P., de Jongste, J. C., Kerkhof, M., Brunekreef, B. (2010).

A study conducted in 1960-1961 in the wake of the [[Great Smog of 1952]] compared 293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis.  All subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59.  Compared to the subjects from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and peak flow rate), and increased sputum production and purulence.  The differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59.  The study controlled for age and smoking habits, so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences.&lt;ref&gt;Holland WW, Reid DD. The urban factor in chronic bronchitis. Lancet. 1965;I:445-448.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is believed that much like [[cystic fibrosis]], by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent. Studies have shown that in urban areas patients suffer [[mucus]] hypersecretion, lower levels of lung function, and more self diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = European Respiratory Journal | title = Urban air pollution and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease: a review | author = J.

===Links to cancer===
A review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) increases the overall risk of nonaccidental mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m3 increase.PMID 19235364
:Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer (range: 15% to 21% per a 10 microg/m3 increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m3 increase). PMID 19235364

The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes (increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall nonaccidental deaths.  PMID 19235364 

The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO2 increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions.  

In 2011, a large Danish epidemiological study found an increased risk of lung cancer for patients who lived in areas with high nitrogen oxide concentrations.  In this study, the association was higher for non-smokers than smokers.&lt;ref&gt;Raaschou-Nielsen, O., Andersen, Z. J., Hvidberg, M., Jensen, S. S., Ketzel, M., Sorensen, M., Tjonneland, A. (2011).

Environmental health perspectives, 119(6), 860-865. {{doi|10.1289/ehp.1002353}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional Danish study, also in 2011, likewise noted evidence of possible associations between air pollution and other forms of cancer, including cervical cancer and brain cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Raaschou-Nielsen, O., Andersen, Z. J., Hvidberg, M., Jensen, S. S., Ketzel, M., Sorensen, M., Tjonneland, A. (2011).

===Effects on children===

Around the world, children living in cities with high exposure to air pollutants are at increased risk of developing asthma, pneumonia and other lower respiratory infections.  Because children are outdoors more and have higher minute ventilation they are more susceptible to the dangers of air pollution.  Risks of [[low birth weight|low initial birth weight]] are also heightened in such cities.  

The [[World Health Organization]] reports that the greatest concentrations of particulate matter particles are found in countries with low economic world power and high poverty and population growth rates. Examples of these countries include [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Indonesia]].  However even in the United States, despite the passage of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] in 1970, in 2002 at least 146 million Americans were living in [[Non-Attainment Area|non-attainment areas]]—regions in which the concentration of certain air pollutants exceeded federal standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Committee on Environmental Health | title = Ambient Air Pollution: Health Hazards to Children | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | year = 2004 | pages = 1699–1707 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2004-2166 | pmid = 15574638}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dangerous pollutants are known as the [[criteria pollutant]]s, and include ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead.  

Protective measures to ensure childrens' health are being taken in cities such as [[New Delhi, India|New Delhi]], [[India]] where buses now use [[compressed natural gas]] to help eliminate the &quot;pea-soup&quot; smog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | title = Polluted Cities: The Air Children Breathe | url = http://www.who.int/ceh/publications/en/11airpollution.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health effects in relatively &quot;clean&quot; areas===

Even in the areas with relatively low levels of air pollution, public health effects can be significant and costly, since a large number of people breathe in such pollutants. A 2005 scientific study for the British Columbia Lung Association showed that a small improvement in air quality (1% reduction of ambient PM2.5 and ozone concentrations) would produce a $29 million in annual savings in the [[Metro Vancouver]] region in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.lung.ca/pdf/health_and_air_quality_2005.pdf |title=2005 BC Lung Association report on the valuation of health impacts from air quality in the Lower Fraser Valley airshed|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is based on health valuation of lethal (death) and sub-lethal (illness) effects.

==Reduction efforts==
There are various air pollution control technologies and [[land use planning]] strategies available to reduce air pollution. At its most basic level land use planning is likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning. In most developed countries, land use planning is an important part of social policy, ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population as well as to protect the environment.

Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations),{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} expanding regulation to new sources (such as [[Cruise ships|cruise]] and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as lawn trimmers, [[chainsaw]]s, and [[snowmobiles]]), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of [[hybrid vehicle]]s), conversion to cleaner fuels (such as [[bioethanol]], [[biodiesel]], or conversion to electric vehicles).

===Control devices===

The following items are commonly used as pollution control devices by industry or transportation devices.  They can either destroy [[contaminant]]s or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere.
&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;

* '''[[Particulate|Particulate control]]'''
** Mechanical collectors ([[Cyclonic separation|dust cyclones]], multicyclones)
** [[Electrostatic precipitator]]s An electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air) using the force of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream.
** [[Dust collector#Types of baghouses|Baghouses]] Designed to handle heavy dust loads, a dust collector consists of a blower, dust filter, a filter-cleaning system, and a dust receptacle or dust removal system (distinguished from air cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust).

** [[Wet scrubber|Particulate scrubbers]]Wet scrubber is a form of pollution control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.

==Legal regulations==
[[Image:Cairo in smog.jpg|thumb|right|Smog in Cairo]]
In general, there are two types of air quality standards.  The first class of standards (such as the U.S. [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] and E.U. [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/directive.htm Air Quality Directive]) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants.  Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the North American [[Air Quality Index]]) take the form of a scale with various thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity.  The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants.

===Canada===
In Canada air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the The Air Quality Health Index or (AQHI). It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution.

The Air Quality Health Index or &quot;AQHI&quot; is a federal program jointly coordinated by [[Health Canada]] and [[Environment Canada]].  However, the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities and NGOs.   From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to AQHI implementation. The AQHI provides a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice.

As it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as ‘low’, ‘moderate’, ‘high’ or ‘very high’, and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure.

It is measured based on the observed relationship of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ground-level Ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) with mortality from an analysis of several Canadian cities. Significantly, all three of these pollutants can pose health risks, even at low levels of exposure, especially among those with pre-existing health problems.

When developing the AQHI, Health Canada’s original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants: [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[ozone]], and [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO2), as well as [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the AQHI formulation.

The AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, [[pollen]], dust, heat or humidity.

The National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) is EPA's ongoing comprehensive evaluation of air toxics in the U.S. EPA developed the NATA as a state-of-the-science screening tool for State/Local/Tribal Agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of risks.  NATA assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources, but rather, use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them. NATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing (inhaling) air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics, emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk.  This in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest.  Assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, including assessments of non-cancer health effects for Diesel Particulate Matter (PM). Assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;EPA; http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/natamain/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing urban air pollution – a regional example (London)==

In [[Europe]], Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management provides a common strategy against which [[member states]] can &quot;set objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment . . . and improve air quality where it is unsatisfactory&quot;.&lt;ref name=Europa1996&gt;{{cite web|last=Europa (1996)|title=Summaries of EU legislation - Management and quality of ambient air|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l28031a_en.htm|accessdate=7 April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2008 in the case Dieter Janecek v Freistaat Bayern CURIA, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that under this directive&lt;ref name=Europa1996/&gt; citizens have the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values.&lt;ref name=&quot;CURIA 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=European Court of Justice|first=CURIA (2008)|title=PRESS RELEASE No 58/08 Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-237/07|url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp08/aff/cp080058en.pdf|accessdate=6 April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This important [[case law]] appears to confirm the role of the EC as centralised regulator to European nation-states as regards air pollution control. It places a [[supranational]] legal obligation on the UK to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution, furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen.

In 2010, the [[European Commission]] (EC) threatened the [[UK]] with legal action against the successive breaching of [[PM10]] limit values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=Air quality: Commission sends final warning to UK over levels of fine particle pollution|url=http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/press_releases/2010/pr1055_en.htm|accessdate=7 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110511090215/http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/press_releases/2010/pr1055_en.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government has identified that if fines are imposed, they could cost the nation upwards of £300 million per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoC Air Quality Report 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee (2010)|title=Environmental Audit Committee - Fifth Report Air Quality|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmenvaud/229/22902.htm|accessdate=6 April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the [[City of London]] remains the only UK region in breach of the EC’s limit values, and has been given 3 months to implement an emergency action plan aimed at meeting the EU Air Quality Directive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Guardian|title=Britain fends off threat of £300m fine over London air pollution|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/mar/11/britain-300m-fine-london-air-pollution|accessdate=6 April|newspaper=Guardian|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of London has dangerous levels of PM10 concentrations, estimated to cause 3000 deaths per year within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Assembly Environment Committee (2009)|title=Every Breath You Take|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/archive/assembly/reports/environment/air-quality-report-200904.pdf.|accessdate=4 April}}&lt;/ref&gt; As  well as the threat of EU fines, in 2010 it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western [[congestion charge]] zone, which is claimed to have led to an increase in air pollution levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC (2010)|title=Threat to sue over London congestion charge scrapping|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11928005|accessdate=5 April|work=BBC News|date=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these charges, Boris Johnson, [[Mayor of London]], has criticised the current need for European cities to communicate with Europe through their nation state’s [[central government]], arguing that in future &quot;A great city like London&quot; should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the European Commission  regarding its air quality action plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2011&quot;/&gt;

In part, this is an attempt to divert blame away from the Mayors office, but it can also be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions to air pollution using global governance networks, for example through transnational relations. Transnational relations include but are not exclusive to national governments and intergovernmental organisations &lt;ref name=&quot;Kappen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Risse-Kappen|first=T|title=Bringing transnational relations back in: non-state actors, domestic structures, and international institutions|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=3–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing sub-national actors including cities and [[regions]] to partake in air pollution control as independent actors.

Particularly promising at present are global city partnerships.&lt;ref name=&quot;pattberg&quot;/&gt; These can be built into networks, for example the C40 network, of which London is a member. The C40 is a public ‘non-state’ network of the world’s leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;pattberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pattberg|first=P|coauthors=Stripple, J.|title=Beyond the public and private divide: remapping transnational climate governance in the 21st century|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2008|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The C40 has been identified as ‘governance from the middle’ and is an alternative to intergovernmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roman|first=M|title=Governing from the middle: the C40 Cities Leadership Group|journal=Corporate Governance|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the potential to improve urban air quality as participating cities &quot;exchange information, learn from best practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from national government decisions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pattberg&quot;/&gt;  A criticism of the C40 network is that its exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.

==Atmospheric dispersion==
{{main|Atmospheric dispersion modeling}}''

The basic technology for analyzing air pollution is through the use of a variety of [[mathematical model]]s for predicting the transport of air pollutants in the lower atmosphere.  The principal methodologies are:

* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#Air pollutant emission sources|Point source]] dispersion, used for industrial sources.
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#Air pollutant emission sources|Line source]] dispersion, used for airport and [[roadway air dispersion modeling]]
* [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#Air pollutant emission sources|Area source]] dispersion, used for [[forest fire]]s or [[duststorm]]s
* [[Photochemical]] models, used to analyze reactive pollutants that form smog

[[Image:Gaussian Plume.png|thumb|right|333px|Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollution dispersion plume as used in many atmospheric dispersion models]]

The point source problem is the best understood, since it involves simpler mathematics and has been studied for a long period of time, dating back to about the year 1900.  It uses a [[Gaussian]] dispersion model for buoyant pollution plumes to forecast the air pollution [[contour line|isopleths]], with consideration given to wind velocity, stack height, emission rate and stability class (a measure of atmospheric [[turbulence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com/ www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This model has been extensively validated and calibrated with experimental data for all sorts of atmospheric conditions.

The [[roadway air dispersion model]] was developed starting in the late 1950s and early 1960s in response to requirements of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] (then known as the Federal Highway Administration) to understand impacts of proposed new highways upon air quality, especially in urban areas.  Several research groups were active in this model development, among which were: the Environmental Research and Technology (ERT) group in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Massachusetts]], the ESL Inc. group in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] and [[California]], [[California Air Resources Board]] group in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]]. The research of the ESL group received a boost with a contract award from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to validate a line source model using [[sulfur hexafluoride]] as a tracer gas.  This program was successful in validating the line source model developed by ESL inc.  Some of the earliest uses of the model were in court cases involving highway air pollution, the [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]] portion of [[Interstate 66]] and the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] widening project through [[East Brunswick, New Jersey|East Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]].

Area source models were developed in 1971 through 1974 by the ERT and ESL groups, but addressed a smaller fraction of total air pollution emissions, so that their use and need was not as widespread as the line source model, which enjoyed hundreds of different applications as early as the 1970s.  Similarly photochemical models were developed primarily in the 1960s and 1970s, but their use was more specialized and for regional needs, such as understanding smog formation in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

==Environmental impacts of ''greenhouse gas'' pollutants==
{{main|Ocean acidification|Greenhouse effect}}

The [[greenhouse effect]] is a phenomenon whereby [[greenhouse gas]]es create a condition in the upper atmosphere causing a trapping of [[heat]] and leading to increased surface and lower [[troposphere|tropospheric]] temperatures. Carbon dioxide emissions from combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s are a source of greenhouse gas emissions.

Other greenhouse gases include [[methane]], [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s, [[perfluorocarbon]]s, [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], and [[ozone]].

This effect has been understood by scientists for about a century, and technological advancements during this period have helped increase the breadth and depth of data relating to the phenomenon. Currently, scientists are studying the role of changes in composition of greenhouse gases from natural and anthropogenic sources for the effect on [[climate change]].

A number of studies have also investigated the potential for long-term rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to cause [[ocean acidification|increases in the acidity of ocean waters]] and the possible effects of this on marine ecosystems.
