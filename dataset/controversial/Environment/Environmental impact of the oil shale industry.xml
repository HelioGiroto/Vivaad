'''Environmental impact of the oil shale industry''' includes the consideration of issues such as [[land use]], [[waste management]], and [[Water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]] caused by the [[oil shale industry|extraction and processing]] of [[oil shale]]. [[Surface mining]] of [[oil shale reserves|oil shale deposits]] causes the usual environmental impacts of [[open-pit mining]]. In addition, the [[combustion]] and [[Shale oil extraction|thermal processing]] generate waste material, which must be disposed of, and harmful atmospheric emissions, including [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]]. Experimental in-situ conversion processes and [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future, but may raise others, such as the pollution of groundwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartisBoston&quot;&gt;

==Surface mining and retorting==

===Land use and waste management===
Surface mining and ''in-situ'' processing requires extensive land use. Mining, processing and waste disposal require land to be withdrawn from traditional uses, and therefore should avoid high density population areas.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt; Oil shale mining reduces the original ecosystem diversity with habitats supporting a variety of plants and animals. After mining the land has to be reclaimed. However, this process takes time and cannot necessarily re-establish the original biodiversity.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;&lt;ref name=kattel&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact of sub-surface mining on the surroundings will be less than for open pit mines. However, sub-surface mining may also cause subsidence of the surface due to the collapse of mined-out area and abandoned stone drifts.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;

Disposal of mining wastes, spent oil shale (including [[semi-coke]]) and combustion ashes needs additional land use.  According to the study of the European Academies Science Advisory Council, after processing, the waste material occupies a greater volume than the material extracted, and therefore cannot be wholly disposed underground. According to this, production of a barrel of [[shale oil]] can generate up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;tons of semi-coke, which may occupy up to 25% greater volume than the original shale.&lt;ref name=eu&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not confirmed by the results of the Estonia's oil shale industry. The mining and processing of 1000 million tons of oil shale in Estonia has created about 360-370&amp;nbsp;million tons of solid waste, of which 90&amp;nbsp;million tons is a mining waste, 70–80&amp;nbsp;million tons is a semi-coke, and 200&amp;nbsp;million tons are combustion ashes.&lt;ref name=kahru/&gt;

The waste material may consist of several pollutants including [[sulfate]]s, [[heavy metals]], and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], some of which are [[Toxicity|toxic]] and [[carcinogen]]ic.&lt;ref name=oilshale2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid contamination of the groundwater, the solid waste from the thermal treatment process is disposed in an open dump ([[landfill]] or &quot;heaps&quot;), not underground. As semi-coke consists of, in addition to minerals, up to 10% [[Organic compound|organics]] that may pose hazard to the environment owing  to leaching of toxic compounds as well as to the possibility of self-ignition.&lt;ref name=kahru/&gt;

===Water management===
Mining influences the water runoff pattern of the area affected. In some cases it requires the lowering of [[groundwater]] levels below the level of the oil shale strata, which may have harmful effects on the surrounding [[arable land]] and forest.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;  In Estonia, for each cubic meter of oil shale mined, 25&amp;nbsp;cubic meters of water must be pumped from the mine area.&lt;ref name=symposium&gt;

Water represents the major vector of transfer of oil shale industry pollutants. One environmental issue is to prevent noxious materials leaching from spent shale into the water supply.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;  The oil shale processing is accompanied by the formation of process waters and waste waters containing [[phenols]], [[tar]] and several other products, heavily separable and toxic to the environment.&lt;ref name=kahru&gt;

===Air pollution management===
Main air pollution is caused by the [[fossil fuel power plant|oil shale-fired power plants]], which provide the atmospheric emissions of gaseous products like [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]], and the airborne particulate matter ([[fly ash]]). It includes particles of different types (carbonaceous, inorganic ones) and different sizes.&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirso&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The concentration of air pollutants in [[flue gas]] depends primarily on the combustion technology and burning regime, while the emissions of solid particles are determined by the efficiency of fly ash-capturing devices.&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt;

Open deposition of semi-coke causes distribution of pollutants in addition to aqueous vectors also via air (dust).&lt;ref name=kahru/&gt;

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
Carbon dioxide emissions from the production of shale oil and shale gas are higher than conventional oil production and a report for the [[Energy policy of the European Union|European Union]] warns that increasing public concern about the adverse consequences of global warming may lead to opposition to oil shale development.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartisBoston&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=eu /&gt;

Emissions arise from several sources. These include CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released by the decomposition of the [[kerogen]] and [[carbonate minerals]] in the extraction process, the generation of the energy needed to heat the shale and in the other oil and gas processing operations, and fuel used in the mining of the rock and the disposal of waste.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;&lt;ref name=arvoots&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  As the varying mineral composition and [[Heating value|calorific value]] of oil shale deposits varies widely, the actual values vary considerably.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;  At best, the direct combustion of oil shales produces carbon emissions similar to those from the lowest form of coal, [[lignite]], at 2.15&amp;nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|moles]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/[[Joule|MJ]],&lt;ref name=eu /&gt; an energy source which is also politically contentious due to its high emission levels.&lt;ref&gt;

For both power generation and oil extraction, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions can be reduced by better utilization of waste heat from the product streams.

==''In-situ'' processing==
Currently, the ''[[in-situ]]'' process is the most attractive proposition due to the reduction in standard surface environmental problems. However, ''in-situ'' processes do involve possible significant environmental costs to [[aquifer]]s, especially since ''in-situ'' methods may require ice-capping or some other form of barrier to restrict the flow of the newly gained oil into the groundwater aquifers. However, after the removal of the freeze wall these methods can still cause groundwater contamination as the hydraulic conductivity of the remaining shale increases allowing groundwater to flow through and leach salts from the newly toxic aquifer.&lt;ref name=rand&gt;
