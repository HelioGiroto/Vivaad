'''Love Canal''' was a neighborhood in [[Niagara Falls, New York]], located in the [[Niagra Falls, New York#LaSalle|LaSalle]] section of the city. It officially covers 36 square blocks in the far southeastern corner of the city, along 99th Street and Read Avenue.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Two bodies of water define the northern and southern boundaries of the neighborhood: Bergholtz Creek to the north and the [[Niagara River]] one-quarter mile (400 m) to the south. In the mid-1970s Love Canal became the subject of national and international attention after it was revealed in the press that the site had formerly been used to bury 21,000 tons of [[toxic waste]] by [[Hooker Chemical|Hooker Chemical (now Occidental Petroleum Corporation)]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Hooker Chemical sold the site to the [[Niagara Falls School Board]] in 1953 for $1, with a deed explicitly detailing the presence of the waste,&lt;ref name = &quot;Zuesse-LoveCanal&quot;/&gt; and including a liability limitation clause about the contamination.  The construction efforts of housing development, combined with particularly heavy rainstorms, released the chemical waste, leading to a [[public health]] emergency and an [[urban planning]] scandal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Hooker Chemical was found to be negligent in their disposal of waste, though not reckless in the sale of the land, in what became a test case for liability clauses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The dumpsite was discovered and investigated by the local newspaper, the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', from 1976 through the evacuation in 1978. Potential health problems were first raised by reporter Michael H. Brown in July 1978.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Ten years after the incident, [[New York State Department of Health|New York State Health Department]] Commissioner David Axelrod (not to be confused with presidential advisor [[David Axelrod]]) stated that Love Canal would long be remembered as a &quot;national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  Sam How | last = Verhovek | title = After 10 Years, the Trauma of Love Canal Continues | publisher = New York Times | date = August 5, 1988 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D9143CF936A3575BC0A96E948260 | accessdate = 2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Love Canal incident was especially significant as a situation where the inhabitants &quot;overflowed into the wastes instead of the other way around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colten &amp; Skinner, p. 153&quot;&gt;Colten &amp; Skinner, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The Love Canal came from the last name of William T. Love, who in the early 1890s envisioned a canal connecting the Niagara River to Lake Ontario. He believed it would serve the area's burgeoning industries with much needed hydro electricity; however, the power scheme was never completed due to limitations of [[direct current]] (DC) power transmission, and Tesla's introduction of [[alternating current]] (AC). Furthermore, the [[Panic of 1893]] caused investors to drop sponsorship of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum p.21&quot;&gt;Blum, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Congress passed a law barring the removal of water from the Niagara River, to preserve Niagara Falls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, p.9&quot;&gt;Levine, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; After 1892, Love's plan changed to incorporate a shipping lane that would bypass the Niagara Falls, reaching Lake Ontario. He envisioned a perfect urban area called &quot;[[Model City, New York|Model City]]&quot; and prepared a plan with a community of parks and homes along Lake Ontario. His plan was never realized. He began digging the canal and built a few streets and homes when his funds were depleted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berton&quot;&gt;Berton, Pierre.  Niagara: a history of the falls.  McClelland &amp; Stewart Inc. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) of the canal, about 50 feet (15 m) wide and 10 to 40 feet (3 m to 12 m) deep, stretching northward from the Niagara River, was dug.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum p.21&quot;/&gt;

There is little information about those who actually worked for Love.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Canal building was exhausting, dirty and often dangerous.  Immigrants usually performed this arduous work, along with removing all trees and vegetation.

With the project abandoned, the canal gradually filled with water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berton&quot;/&gt; The local children swam there in the summer and skated in the winter. In the 1920s, the canal became a dump site for the City of Niagara Falls, with the city regularly unloading its municipal refuse into the pit. In the 1940s, the [[U.S. Army]] began using the site to dump wastes from the war effort during [[World War II]], including some nuclear waste from the [[Manhattan Project]], the rest of which was dumped in nearby [[Lewiston, New York]] at the Niagara Falls Storage Site.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

By the 1940s,  Hooker Electrochemical Company (later known as Hooker Chemical Company), founded by Elon Hooker, began searching for a place to dump the large quantity of chemical waste it was producing. Hooker was granted permission by the Niagara Power and Development Company in 1942 to dump wastes in the canal. The canal was drained and lined with thick clay. Into this site, Hooker began placing {{convert|55|USgal|L|adj=on}} metal or fibre barrels. The City of Niagara Falls and the army continued the dumping of refuse.

In 1948, after World War II had ended and the City of Niagara Falls had ended self-sufficient disposal of refuse, Hooker became the sole user and owner of the site.

This dumpsite was in operation until 1953. During this time, 21,000 tons of chemicals such as &quot;caustics, alkalines, fatty acids and chlorinated hydrocarbons from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, solvents for rubber and synthetic resins&quot; were added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.22&quot;&gt;Blum, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  These chemicals were buried at a depth of twenty to twenty-five feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, p.9&quot;/&gt; In 1947, Hooker bought the canal and the {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} banks on either side of the canal.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; After 1953, the canal was covered with soil, and vegetation began to grow atop the dumpsite.

==The Love Canal Disaster==

===Sale of the site===
At the time of the dump's closure, Niagara Falls was entering an economic boom and the population had surpassed 85,000, with the population expanding at record percentages. The [[Niagara Falls City School District]] needed land to build new schools, and attempted to purchase the property from Hooker Chemical that had been used to bury toxic waste. The corporation refused to sell, citing safety concerns, and took members of the school board to the canal and drilled several bore holes to demonstrate that there were toxic chemicals below the surface. However, the board refused to capitulate.&lt;ref name = &quot;Zuesse-LoveCanal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = Eric | last = Zuesse | title = Love Canal: The Truth Seeps Out | publisher = Reason Magazine | date = February 1981 | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/29319.html | accessdate = 2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually faced with the property being condemned and/or expropriated, Hooker Chemical agreed to sell on the condition that the board buy the entire property for one dollar. In the agreement signed on April 28, 1953, Hooker included a seventeen-line [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]] that explained the dangers of building on the site.  Hooker believed it was thus released from all legal obligations should lawsuits arise in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.22&quot;/&gt;

{{cquote|Prior to the delivery of this instrument of conveyance, the grantee herein has been advised by the grantor that the premises above described have been filled, in whole or in part, to the present grade level thereof with waste products resulting from the manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its plant in the City of Niagara Falls, New York, and the grantee assumes all risk and liability incident to the use thereof. It is therefore understood and agreed that, as a part of the consideration for this conveyance and as a condition thereof, no claim, suit, action or demand of any nature whatsoever shall ever be made by the grantee, its successors or assigns, against the grantor, its successors or assigns, for injury to a person or persons, including death resulting therefrom, or loss of or damage to property caused by, in connection with or by reason of the presence of said industrial wastes. It is further agreed as a condition hereof that each subsequent conveyance of the aforesaid lands shall be made subject to the foregoing provisions and conditions.&lt;ref name = &quot;Zuesse-LoveCanal&quot;/&gt;}}

[[File:Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education.pdf|thumb|Hooker Electrochemical Quit Claim Deed to Board of Education]]
Hooker stated that the area should be sealed off &quot;so as to prevent the possibility of persons or animals coming in contact with the dumped materials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Colten &amp; Skinner, p157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction of the 93rd Street School and the 99th Street School===
Despite the disclaimer, the board began construction of the '''99th Street School''' in its originally intended location. In January 1954, the architect of the school wrote to the education committee informing them that during excavation, workers discovered two dump sites filled with {{convert|55|USgal|L|adj=on}} drums containing chemical wastes.  The architect also noted that it would be &quot;poor policy&quot; to build in that area since it was not known what wastes were present in the ground, and the concrete foundation might be subsequently damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  The school board then moved the school site eighty to eighty-five feet further north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colten &amp; Skinner, p. 153&quot;/&gt; The kindergarten playground also had to be relocated because a chemical dump lay directly beneath. Upon completion in 1955, 400 children attended the school, and it opened along with several other schools that had been built to accommodate students. That same year, a twenty-five foot area crumbled exposing toxic chemical drums, which then filled with water during rainstorms.  This created large puddles that children enjoyed playing in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colten &amp; Skinner, p. 153&quot;/&gt;

In 1956, a second school, the 93rd Street School, had opened six blocks away.

In 1957, the City of Niagara Falls constructed sewers for a mixture of low-income and single family residences be built on lands adjacent to the landfill site. The school district had sold off the remaining land, and homes were to be built by private developers, as well as the Niagara Falls Housing Authority, who planned to build the Griffon Manor housing project. While building the gravel sewer beds, construction crews broke through the clay seal, breaching the canal walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zuesse-LoveCanal&quot;/&gt; Specifically, the local government removed part of the protective clay cap to use as [[fill dirt]] for the nearby 93rd Street School, and punched holes in the solid clay walls to build water lines and the [[LaSalle Expressway]]. This allowed the toxic wastes to escape when rainwater, no longer kept out by the partially removed clay cap, washed them through the gaps created in the walls.&lt;ref name=Stroup/&gt; Hence, the buried chemicals had a further opportunity to migrate and [[soil mechanics|seep]] from the canal. The land where the homes were being built was not part of the agreement between the school board and Hooker; thus, none of these residents knew the history of the canal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, p.13&quot;&gt;Levine, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; There was no monitoring or evaluating of the chemical wastes which were being stored under the ground. Additionally, the clay cover of the canal which was supposed to be impermeable began to crack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, p.13&quot;/&gt; The subsequent construction of the [[LaSalle Expressway]] &lt;!--, seen at the bottom of the aerial photo above, --&gt; restricted [[groundwater]] from flowing to the Niagara River. Following the exceptionally wet winter and spring of 1962, the elevated expressway turned the breached canal into an overflowing pool. People reported having puddles of oil or colored liquid in yards or basements.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health problems, activism, and site cleanup ===
[[File:Love Canal protest.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A protest by Love Canal residents, ca. 1978.]]
In 1976, two reporters for the ''[[Niagara Gazette|Niagara Falls Gazette]]'', David Pollak and David Russell, tested several sump-pumps near Love Canal and found toxic chemicals in them. The matter went quiet for more than a year and was resurrected by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by carrying forth an informal door-to-door survey in early 1978, finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs. He advised the local residents to create a protest group, which was led by resident Karen Schroeder, whose daughter had many (about a dozen) birth defects. The New York State Health Department followed suit and found an abnormal incidence of miscarriages. The dumpsite was declared an unprecedented state emergency on August 2, 1978. Mr. Brown, who wrote more than  a hundred articles on the dump, also further tested groundwater and later found that the dump was three times the size officials knew, with possible ramifications beyond the original evacuation zone. He was also to discover that highly toxic [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]] was there. On August 2, 1978, [[Lois Gibbs]], a local mother who called an election to head the Love Canal Homeowners' Association, began to further rally homeowners. Her son, Michael Gibbs, began attending school in September 1977. He developed [[epilepsy]] in December, suffered from [[asthma]] and a [[urinary tract infection]], and had a low [[white blood cell]] count,&lt;ref name=gibbsheroproj&gt;[http://www.heroism.org/class/1970/gibbs.html Heroism Project - Lois Gibbs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.26&quot;&gt;Blum, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; all associated with his exposure to the leaking chemical waste. Gibbs had learned from Mr. Brown that her neighborhood sat on top of 21,000 tons of buried chemical waste.&lt;ref name=goldman&gt;[http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/103 Goldman Environmental Prize - Lois Gibbs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, Gibbs led an effort to investigate community concerns about the health of its residents; she and other residents made repeated complaints of strange odors and &quot;substances&quot; that surfaced in their yards. In Gibbs' neighborhood, there was a high rate of unexplained illnesses, miscarriages, and mental retardation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.26&quot;/&gt;  Furthermore, basements were often covered with a thick, black substance, and vegetation was also dying.  In many yards, the only vegetation that grew were shrubby grasses.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Although city officials were asked to investigate the area, they did not act to solve the problem.

According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in 1979, residents exhibited a &quot;disturbingly high rate of [[miscarriage]]s ... Love Canal can now be added to a growing list of environmental disasters involving toxics, ranging from industrial workers stricken by [[anxiety disorder|nervous disorders]] and [[cancer]]s to the discovery of toxic materials in the milk of nursing mothers.&quot; In one case, two out of four children in a single Love Canal family had [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]]; one girl was born [[hearing impairment|deaf]] with a [[cleft palate]], an extra row of teeth, and slight [[mental retardation|retardation]], and a boy was born with an eye defect.&lt;ref name=epa1&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm The Love Canal Tragedy]&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by the Love Canal Homeowners Association found that 56% of the children born from 1974–1978 had at least one birth defect.&lt;ref name=epa2&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/action/20years/ch1pg2.htm New Protections and Newly Discovered Threats]&lt;/ref&gt;

With further investigation, Gibbs discovered the chemical danger of the adjacent canal. This began her organization's two-year effort to demonstrate that the waste buried by Hooker Chemical was responsible for the health problems of local residents. Throughout the ordeal, homeowners' concerns were ignored not only by Hooker Chemical (now a subsidiary of [[Occidental Petroleum]]), but also by members of government. These parties argued that the area's endemic health problems were unrelated to the toxic chemicals buried in the Canal. Since the residents could not prove the chemicals on their property had come from Hooker's disposal site, they could not prove [[legal liability|liability]]. Throughout the legal battle, residents were unable to sell their properties and move away.

However, when Eckhardt C. Beck (EPA Administrator for Region 2, 1977 – 1979) visited Love Canal in the late 1970s, he discerned the presence of toxic substances in the community:

{{cquote|I visited the canal area at that time. Corroding waste-disposal drums could be seen breaking up through the grounds of backyards. Trees and gardens were turning black and dying. One entire swimming pool had been popped up from its foundation, afloat now on a small sea of chemicals. Puddles of noxious substances were pointed out to me by the residents. Some of these puddles were in their yards, some were in their basements, others yet were on the school grounds. Everywhere the air had a faint, choking smell. Children returned from play with burns on their hands and faces.&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt;}}

Robert Whalen, New York's Health Commissioner, also visited Love Canal and believed that the Canal constituted an emergency, stating: &quot;Love Canal Chemical Waste Landfill constitutes a public nuisance and an extremely serious threat and danger to the health, safety and welfare of those using it, living near it or exposed to the conditions emanating from it, consisting among other things, of chemical wastes lying exposed on the surface in numerous places pervasive, pernicious and obnoxious chemical vapors and fumes affecting both the ambient air and the homes of certain residents living near such sites.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;  Whalen also instructed people to avoid going into their basements as well as to avoid fruits and vegetables grown in their gardens.  People became very worried because many had consumed produce from their gardens for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Whalen urged that all pregnant women and children under the age of two be removed from Love Canal as soon as possible.

However, local politicians were all but indifferent if not trying to mask the problem. The Mayor of Niagara Falls, Michael C. O'Laughlin, went so far as to say &quot;There's nothing wrong here [in Love Canal]!&quot; in order to address the irate residents of the area.

The 99th Street School, on the other hand, was located within the former boundary of the Hooker Chemical landfill site. The school was closed and demolished, but both the school board and the chemical company refused to accept liability. The 93rd Street School was closed some two years later due to concerns about seeping toxic waste.
&lt;!-- This first paragraph doesn't go with the rest of the section, or it at least needs to segue into the 2nd par. --&gt;

===State of emergency===
The lack of public interest in Love Canal made matters worse for the homeowners' association, which now battled two organizations who were spending vast amounts of money to disprove negligence. Initially, members of the association had been frustrated by the lack of a public entity that could advise and defend them. Gibbs met with considerable public resistance from a number of residents within the community: the mostly middle-class families did not have the resources to protect themselves, and many did not see any alternative other than abandoning their homes at a loss.

By 1978, Love Canal had become a national media event with articles referring to the neighborhood as &quot;a public health time bomb,&quot; and &quot;one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history.&quot;&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt;  Brown, a reporter for the local newspaper called the ''Niagara Gazette'', was the first person to discover and further investigate health problems at the Love Canal.  His research is credited with not only breaking open that case but with establishing toxic chemical wastes as a nationwide issue.  Brown's book, ''Laying Waste'', examined the Love Canal disaster and many other toxic waste catastrophes nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael, ''Laying Waste:  The Poisoning of America by Toxic Chemicals.''  New York:  Washington Square Press, 1981, ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 1978, United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced a federal health emergency, called for the allocation of federal funds and ordered the Federal Disaster Assistance Agency to assist the City of Niagara Falls to remedy the Love Canal site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.28&quot;&gt;Blum, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in American history that emergency funds were used other than for a natural disaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Eckardt C. |title=The Love Canal Tragedy|work=EPA Journal|date=January 1979|url=http://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/history/topics/lovecanal/01.htm|accessdate= February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carter had trenches built that would transport the wastes to sewers and had home sump pumps sealed off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.28&quot;/&gt;

At first, scientific studies did not conclusively prove that the chemicals were responsible for the residents' illnesses, and scientists were divided on the issue, even though eleven known or suspected [[carcinogens]] had been identified, one of the most prevalent being [[benzene]]. There was also dioxin ([[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]]) in the water, a very hazardous substance. Dioxin pollution is usually measured in parts per ''[[Parts per trillion|trillion]]''; at Love Canal, water samples showed dioxin levels of 53 parts per ''[[Parts per billion|billion]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.28&quot;/&gt; [[Geologist]]s were recruited to determine whether underground [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]] were responsible for carrying the chemicals to the surrounding residential areas. Once there, chemicals could [[soil contamination|leach]] into [[basement]]s and evaporate into [[Indoor air quality|household air]].

In 1979, the EPA announced the result of [[blood test]]s that showed high [[white blood cell]] counts, a precursor to [[leukemia]],&lt;ref name=epa1 /&gt; and [[chromosome]] damage in Love Canal residents. In fact, 33 percent of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage; in a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.28&quot;/&gt; Other studies were unable to find harm.&lt;ref&gt;Cancer incidence in the Love Canal area. Science, v. 212, June 19, 1981: 1404-1407. &quot;Data from the New York Cancer Registry show no evidence for higher cancer rates associated with residence near the Love Canal toxic waste burial site in comparison with the entire state outside of New York City.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ember, Lois R. Uncertain science pushes Love Canal solutions to political, legal arenas. Chemical &amp; Engineering News, v. 58, August 11, 1980: 22-29. Relates the chronology of Hooker Chemical Company and the discovery of toxic chemicals at Love Canal and describes the medical research on the former residents to determine the health effects.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maugh, Thomas H., 11.

This two-part series first addresses the question &quot;Just how hazardous are dumps?&quot; and then, in &quot;Biological markers for chemical exposure,&quot; suggests that alterations in chromosomes indicate exposure but that long term studies will be necessary to determine the severity of effects of health.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Risks of living near Love Canal.

The NRC noted that the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater &quot;seeped into basements&quot; and then led to exposure through air and soil&lt;ref name=NRC1991/&gt;{{rp|196}} noted that several studies reported higher levels of low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents&lt;ref name=NRC1991&gt;National Research Council, Committee on Environmental Epidemiology, [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=1802 Environmental Epidemiology, vol. 1: Public Health and Hazardous Wastes] (Washington: National Academy Press, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190-91}} with some evidence that the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated.&lt;ref name=NRC1991/&gt;{{rp|165}} The National Research Council also noted a study which found that exposed children were found to have an &quot;excess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence&quot; and stunted growth.&lt;ref name=NRC1991/&gt;{{rp|196}} Voles in the area were studied and found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals &quot;23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days&quot; for control animals).&lt;ref name=NRC1991/&gt;{{rp|215}} New York State also has an ongoing health study of Love Canal residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.state.ny.us/environmental/investigations/love_canal/ New York State Department of Health - Love Canal]&lt;/ref&gt; In that year the Albert Elia Building Co., Inc., now Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., was selected as the principal contractor to safely re-bury the toxic waste at the Love Canal Site.

Eventually, the government relocated more than 800 families and reimbursed them for their homes, and the [[United States Congress]] passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), or the [[Superfund]] Act. Because the Superfund fact contained a &quot;retroactive liability&quot; provision, Occidental was held liable for cleanup of the waste even though it had followed all applicable U.S. laws when disposing of it. In 1994, Federal District Judge [[John Thomas Curtin|John Curtin]] ruled that Hooker/Occidental had been [[Negligence|negligent]], but not reckless, in its handling of the waste and sale of the land to the [[Niagara Falls School Board]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v. Hooker Chemicals and Plastics Corp., 850 Federal Supplement, 993 (W.D.N.Y., 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Curtin's decision also contains a detailed history of events leading up to the Love Canal disaster. [[Occidental Petroleum]] was sued by the EPA and in 1995 agreed to pay $129 million in restitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Occidental to pay $129 Million in Love Canal Settlement | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice | date = December 21, 1995 | url = http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/Pre_96/December95/638.txt.html | accessdate = 2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Residents' lawsuits were also settled in the years following the Love Canal disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, houses in the residential areas on the east and west sides of the canal have been demolished. All that remains on the west side are abandoned residential streets. Some older east side residents, whose houses stand alone in the demolished neighborhood, chose to stay. It was estimated that fewer than 90 of the original 900 families opted to remain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, p.28&quot;/&gt; They were willing to remain as long as they were guaranteed that their homes were in a relatively safe area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, p.215&quot;&gt;Levine, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 1980, the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency (LCARA) was founded to restore the area.  The area north of Love Canal became known as Black Creek Village.  LCARA wanted to resell 300 homes that had been originally bought by New York when the residents were relocated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, p.215&quot;/&gt;  These homes were farther away from where the chemicals had been dumped.  The most toxic area ({{convert|16|acre|m2}}) has been reburied with a thick plastic liner, clay and dirt.  A {{Convert|2.4|m}} high barbed wire fence was constructed around this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan, Michael 2003, p.108&quot;&gt;Jordan, Michael, ''Hush Hush: The Dark Secrets of Scientific Research''. Buffalo: Firefly Books, 2003, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been calculated that 248 separate chemicals, including {{Convert|60|kg}} of dioxin, have been unearthed from the canal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan, Michael 2003, p.108&quot;/&gt;

In 1998, Dr. Elizabeth Whelan wrote an editorial about the Canal in which she stated that when the media started calling the Canal a &quot;public health time bomb,&quot; it created hysteria.  She declared that people were not falling ill due to exposure to chemical waste, but from stress caused by the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan, Michael 2003, p.108&quot;/&gt;  Besides double the rate of birth defects to children born while living on Love Canal, a follow-up study two decades after the incident demonstrated the largest effect of Love Canal was stress due to media attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Love Canal Follow-up Health Study&quot;&gt;http://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/investigations/love_canal/docs/report_public_comment_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Love Canal, along with [[Times Beach, Missouri]], are important in United States environmental history as the two sites that in large part led to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA is much more commonly referred to as &quot;[[Superfund]]&quot; because of the fund established by the act to help the clean-up of toxic pollution in residential locations such as Love Canal.  It has been stated that Love Canal has &quot;become the symbol for what happens when hazardous industrial products are not confined to the workplace but 'hit people where they live' in inestimable amounts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

Love Canal was not an isolated case.  Eckardt C. Beck, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Love Canal crisis suggested that there are probably hundreds of similar dumpsites.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa.gov&quot;/&gt; President Carter declared that discovering these dumpsites was &quot;one of the grimmest discoveries of the modern era.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;epa.gov&quot;/&gt; Had the residents of Love Canal been aware that they were residing on toxic chemicals, most would not have moved there in the first place.  Beck noted that one main problem remains that ownership of such chemical companies can change over the years making liability difficult to assign (a problem that would be addressed by CERCLA, or the Superfund Act).&lt;ref name=&quot;epa.gov&quot;/&gt;  Beck contended that increased commitment was necessary to develop controls that would &quot;defuse future Love Canals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;epa.gov&quot;/&gt;  

The [[free market environmentalist]] movement has often cited the Love Canal incident as a consequence of government decision-makers not taking responsibility for their decisions. Stroup writes, &quot;The school district owning the land had a laudable but narrow goal: it wanted to provide education cheaply for district children. Government decision makers are seldom held accountable for broader social goals in the way that private owners are by liability rules and potential profits.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stroup&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nesgeorgia.org/files/free_market_environmentalism.pdf|author=Stroup, Richard|title=Free-Market Environmentalism|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the disaster spawned a fictionalized made-for-TV film entitled ''Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal'' (1982). A documentary entitled ''In Our Own Backyard'' was released in the U.S. in 1983, and ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' retold the disaster in 2004.{{http://www.epa.gov/region1/education/pdfs/GREENModule1VideoLinks.pdf}} The film ''[[Tootsie]]'' has a character attempting to produce a play called &quot;Return To Love Canal&quot;. [[Joyce Carol Oates]] has brought the story of Love Canal into her 2004 novel ''[[The Falls (Oates novel)|The Falls]]'' however setting the suspicions of harm to the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
