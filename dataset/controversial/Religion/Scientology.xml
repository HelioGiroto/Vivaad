'''Scientology''' is a [[Scientology beliefs and practices|body of beliefs and related practices]] created by [[L.

==Etymology and earlier usage==
The word ''Scientology'' is a pairing of the [[Latin]] word ''scientia'' (&quot;knowledge&quot;, &quot;skill&quot;), which comes from the verb ''scīre'' (&quot;to know&quot;), and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] λόγος ''lógos'' (&quot;word&quot; or &quot;account [of]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cusack|2009|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin J. Hubbard/John T. Hatfield/James A. Santucci ''An Educator's Classroom Guide to America's Religious Beliefs and Practices'', p. 89, Libraries Unlimited, 2007 ISBN 978-1-59158-409-4&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scientology'', as coined by L. Ron Hubbard, comes from the Latin scio, which means &quot;knowing, in the fullest meaning of the word&quot; and the Greek word logos, which means &quot;study of&quot;. Scientology is further defined as &quot;the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes, and other life.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Scientology/Origins/Beginnings.html |title=Beginnings |publisher=Patheos.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120905/http://www.patheos.com/Library/Scientology/Origins/Beginnings.html |archivedate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, [[Allen Upward]] coined ''Scientology'' &quot;as a disparaging term, to indicate a blind, unthinking acceptance of scientific doctrine&quot; according to the [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]] as quoted in the preface to Forgotten Books' recent edition of Upward's book, ''The New Word: On the meaning of the word Idealist''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Lc7nNIo-UukC&amp;printsec=frontcover The New Word] original version available for download.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing to quote, the publisher writes &quot;I'm not aware of any evidence that Hubbard knew of this fairly obscure book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The New Word, Publisher: Forgotten Books (February 7, 2008), ISBN 1-60506-811-X ISBN 978-1-60506-811-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, philosopher [[Anastasius Nordenholz]] published a book that used the term to mean &quot;science of science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasius Nordenholz ''Scientology: Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge'', Freie Zone e. V., 1995 ISBN 978-3-9804724-1-8&lt;/ref&gt; It is also uncertain whether Hubbard was aware of this prior usage of the word.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey W. Bromiley, page 556&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics uses a counseling technique known as ''auditing'', developed by Hubbard to enable conscious recall of traumatic events in an individual's past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton28&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally intended to be a new [[psychotherapy]] and was not expected to become the foundation for a new religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson1970&quot;&gt;Wilson, Bryan (1970).

Hubbard, an American writer of [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], especially [[science fiction]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; first published his ideas on the human mind in the ''Explorers Club Journal'' and the May 1950 issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=9, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of Dianetics in May 1950 is considered by Scientologists a seminal event of the century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Hubbard's key supporters at the time were John W. Campbell Jr., the editor of ''Astounding Science Fiction'', and Dr. [[Joseph A. Winter]]. Winter, hoping to have Dianetics accepted in the medical community, submitted papers outlining the principles and methodology of Dianetic therapy to the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' and the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' in 1949, but these were rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bare-faced Messiah151&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Miller, Russell|title=[[Bare-faced Messiah]], The True Story of L.

May 1950 saw the publication of Hubbard's ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]''. His book entered the ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller list on June 18 and stayed there until December 24 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawes.com/1950/1950.htm |title=Adult New York Times Best Seller Lists for 1950 |publisher=Hawes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120908/http://www.hawes.com/1950/1950.htm |archivedate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dianetics appealed to a broad range of people who used instructions from the book and applied the method to each other, becoming practitioners themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot; /&gt; Hubbard found himself the leader of a growing Dianetics movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton9&quot; /&gt; He became a popular lecturer and established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], where he trained his first Dianetics counselors or ''auditors''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics soon met with criticism. [[Morris Fishbein]], the editor of the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' and well-known at the time as a debunker of [[quack medicine]], dismissed Hubbard's book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in Newsweek stated that &quot;the dianetics concept is unscientific and unworthy of discussion or review&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poor Man's Psychoanalysis?|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|date=November 6, 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for teaching medicine without a license, which eventually led to that foundation's bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flowers|1984|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Streissguth ''Charismatic Cult Leaders'', p. 70, The Oliver Press Inc., 1996 ISBN 978-1-881508-18-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Malko ''Scientology: the now religion'', p. 58, Delacorte Press, 1970 ASIN B0006CAHJ6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practitioners of Dianetics reported experiences which they believed had occurred in past lives, or previous incarnations.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot; /&gt; In early 1951, [[reincarnation]] became a subject of intense debate within Dianetics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Winter, who was still hopeful of winning support for Dianetics from the medical community, championed a resolution to ban the topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton10&quot; /&gt; But Hubbard decided to take the reports of past life events seriously and postulated the existence of the ''[[thetan]]'', a concept similar to the [[soul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot; /&gt; This was an important factor in the transition from secular Dianetics to the religion of Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot; /&gt;

Also in 1951, Hubbard introduced the ''electropsychometer'' ([[E-meter]] for short), a kind of [[galvanometer]], as an auditing aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton10&quot;/&gt; Based on a design by Hubbard, the device is held by Scientologists to be a useful tool in detecting changes in a person's state of mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton10&quot; /&gt;

[[Publishers Weekly]] gave a plaque posthumously to L. Ron Hubbard commemorating the appearance of Dianetics on its bestseller list for one hundred consecutive weeks. One scholar has called Dianetics the bestselling non-Christian religious book of the century.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | title = The State of the Discipline.

===The Church of Scientology===
[[File:The Founding Church of Scientology.jpg|thumb|right|200px|the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington D.C.]]

In 1952, Hubbard built on the existing framework set forth in ''Dianetics'', and published a new set of teachings as ''Scientology, a religious philosophy.''&lt;ref&gt;Christian D. Von Dehsen-Scott L. Harris ''Philosophers and Religious Leaders'', p. 90, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999 ISBN 978-1-57356-152-5&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1953, Hubbard incorporated three churches&amp;nbsp;– a &quot;Church of American Science&quot;, a &quot;Church of Scientology&quot; and a &quot;Church of Spiritual Engineering&quot;&amp;nbsp;– in [[Camden, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bare-faced Messiah220&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Miller, Russell|title=[[Bare-faced Messiah]], The True Story of L.

Ron Hubbard.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bare-faced Messiah220&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton11&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement spread quickly through the United States and to other English-speaking countries such as Britain, Ireland, South Africa and Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton12&quot; /&gt; The second local Church of Scientology to be set up, after the one in California, was in [[Auckland, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton12&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Hubbard established the [[L. Ron Hubbard House|Founding Church of Scientology]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot;/&gt; In 1957, the Church of Scientology of California was granted tax-exempt status by the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and so, for a time, were other local churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times tax exempt status&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Douglas|last=Frantz|title=Scientology's Puzzling Journey From Tax Rebel to Tax Exempt|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DE1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|date=March 9, 1997|accessdate=2008-10-26  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120720/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DE1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 however, the IRS started a review of the appropriateness of this status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton13&quot; /&gt; In 1959, Hubbard moved to England, remaining there until the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot; /&gt;

The Church experienced further challenges. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) began an investigation concerning the claims the Church of Scientology made in connection with its E-meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton13&quot; /&gt; On January 4, 1963, they raided offices of the Church of Scientology and seized hundreds of E-meters as illegal medical devices. The devices have since been required to carry a disclaimer saying that they are a purely religious artifact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/E-Meter/Mark-VII/ |title=1963 FDA raid |publisher=Cs.cmu.edu |date=January 4, 1963 |accessdate=2010-09-04 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120804/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/E-Meter/Mark-VII/ |archivedate=2012-08-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-sixties, the Church of Scientology was banned in several Australian states, starting with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton14&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was based on the [[Anderson Report]], which found that the auditing process involved &quot;command&quot; hypnosis, in which the hypnotist assumes &quot;positive authoritative control&quot; over the patient. On this point the report stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;It is the firm conclusion of this Board that most scientology and dianetic techniques are those of authoritative hypnosis and as such are dangerous ... the scientific evidence which the Board heard from several expert witnesses of the highest repute ... leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is only in name that there is any difference between authoritative hypnosis and most of the techniques of scientology. Many scientology techniques are in fact hypnotic techniques, and Hubbard has not changed their nature by changing their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Kevin Victor, Q.C.|author-link=Kevin Victor Anderson|coauthors=Victoria Board of Enquiry into Scientology|title=Report of the Board of Enquiry into Scientology|publisher=Government Printer|location=Melbourne|year=1965|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Australian Church was forced to operate under the name of the &quot;Church of the New Faith&quot; as a result, the name and practice of Scientology having become illegal in the relevant states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton14&quot; /&gt; Several years of court proceedings aimed at overturning the ban followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton14&quot; /&gt;

In the course of developing Scientology, Hubbard presented rapidly changing teachings that were often self-contradictory.&lt;ref name=&quot;lindholm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Roy|title=The Road to Total Freedom|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1977|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the inner cadre of Scientologists in that period, involvement depended not so much on belief in a particular doctrine but on unquestioning faith in Hubbard.&lt;ref name=&quot;lindholm&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindholm|first=Charles|year=1992|title=Charisma, Crowd Psychology and Altered States of Consciousness|journal=Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|volume=16|issue=3|pages=287–310|doi=10.1007/BF00052152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Hubbard stepped down as executive director of Scientology to devote himself to research and writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner225&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Neusner|2003|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he formed the Sea Organization or [[Sea Org]], which was to develop into an elite group within Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA172&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton17&quot; /&gt; The Sea Org was based on three ships, the ''Diana'', the ''Athena'', and the ''Apollo'', which served as the flag ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month after the establishment of the Sea Org, Hubbard announced that he had made a breakthrough discovery, the result of which were the &quot;OT III&quot; materials purporting to provide a method for overcoming factors inhibiting spiritual progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton17&quot; /&gt; These materials were first disseminated on the ships, and then propagated by Sea Org members reassigned to staff Advanced Organizations on land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton17&quot; /&gt;

In 1967, the IRS removed Scientology's tax-exempt status, asserting that its activities were commercial and operated for the benefit of Hubbard, rather than for charitable or religious purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times tax exempt status&quot;/&gt; The decision resulted in a process of litigation that would be settled in the Church's favour a quarter of a century later, the longest case of litigation in IRS history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton13&quot; /&gt;

In 1979, as a result of FBI raids during [[Operation Snow White]], eleven senior people in the church's Guardian's Office were convicted of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property. In 1981, Scientology took the German government to court for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Amveck ''Researching New Religious Movements'', p. 261, Routledge, 2006 ISBN 978-0-415-27754-9&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1982, Scientology established the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC) to oversee and ensure the standard application of Scientology technology.&lt;ref name=LewHam24&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Hammer|2007|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 1982, the [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] was established by former top Scientologists in disagreement with RTC.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Zellner ''Extraordinary Groups'', p. 295, Macmillan, 2007 ISBN 978-0-7167-7034-3&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Zone Association was founded and registered under the laws of Germany, and believes that the Church of Scientology has departed from its original philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freezone.org/english.htm |title=Free Zone |date= |accessdate=2011-07-13 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120801/http://www.freezone.org/english.htm |archivedate=2012-08-01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, in a unanimous decision, the [[High Court of Australia]] recognized Scientology as a religion in Australia, overturning restrictions that had limited activities of the church after the Anderson Report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton14-15&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 1986, L. Ron Hubbard died at his ranch near [[San Luis Obispo, California]], and [[David Miscavige]] became the head of the organization.

Starting in 1991, persons connected with Scientology filed fifty lawsuits against the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN), a group that had been critical of Scientology.&lt;ref name=cnn96 /&gt; Although many of the suits were dismissed, one of the suits filed against the Cult Awareness Network resulted in $2 million in losses for the network.&lt;ref name=cnn96 /&gt; Consequently, the organization was forced to go bankrupt.&lt;ref name=cnn96 /&gt; In 1996, Steven L.

==Membership statistics==
In 2005, the Church of Scientology stated its worldwide membership to be eight million, although that number included people who took only the introductory course and did not continue on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flinn-WashingtonPost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Frank K.|last=Flinn|title=Scientology|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/06/30/DI2005063001394.html|work=Live discussion|publisher=Washington Post|date=July 5, 2005|accessdate=2008-02-04  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/06/30/DI2005063001394.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a Church official claimed 3.5 million members in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Collison, Kevin (March 17, 2007). &quot;Scientology center heads downtown&quot;, ''Kansas City Star''&lt;/ref&gt; but a 2001 survey conducted by the [[City University of New York]] found only 55,000 people in the United States who claimed to be Scientologists. Worldwide, some observers believe a reasonable estimate of Scientology's core practicing membership ranges between 100,000 and 200,000, mostly in the U.S., Europe, South Africa and Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Reitman|first=Janet|title=Inside Scientology|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/inside-scientology-20110208|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=August 22, 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/inside-scientology-20110208 |archivedate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the American Religious Identification Survey found that the number of American Scientologists had dropped to 25,000.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Fred|title=In Pasadena, a Model for Scientology's Growth Plan|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/business/10scientology.html|accessdate=July 13, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 9, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/business/10scientology.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scientologists tend to disparage general religious surveys on the grounds that many members maintaining cultural and social ties to other religious groups will, when asked their religion, answer with their traditional and more socially acceptable affiliation. The Church of Scientology claims to be the fastest growing religious movement on earth. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Bromley | first1 = David | last2 = Cowan | first2 = Douglas | title = Cults and new religions: a brief history | accessdate = 2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, religious scholar [[J.

Ninety-nine percent of them don't ever darken the door of the church again.&quot; If the church indeed had 4 million members in the United States, he says, &quot;they would be like the Lutherans and would show up on a national survey&quot; such as the Harris poll. |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120708/http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595091823,00.html |archivedate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
{{Main|Scientology beliefs and practices}}

According to Scientology, its beliefs and practices are based on rigorous research, and its doctrines are accorded a significance equivalent to that of scientific laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA170-171&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|pp=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Scientology works 100 percent of the time when it is properly applied to a person who sincerely desires to improve his life&quot;, the Church of Scientology says.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA170-171&quot; /&gt; Conversion is held to be of lesser significance than the practical application of Scientologist methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA170-171&quot; /&gt; Adherents are encouraged to validate the value of the methods they apply through their personal experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA170-171&quot; /&gt; Hubbard himself put it this way: &quot;For a Scientologist, the final test of any knowledge he has gained is, 'did the data and the use of it in life actually improve conditions or didn't it?{{'&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GA170-171&quot; /&gt;

===Body and Spirit===
Scientology beliefs revolve around the ''thetan'', the individualized expression of the cosmic source, or life force, named after the Greek letter [[theta]] ('''θ''').&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Neusner|2003|pp=221–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{cite book  | last = Chryssides | first = George D. | authorlink = George D. Chryssides | title = Exploring New Religions | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] | year = 1999 | page = 283  | isbn  = 0-8264-5959-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl G. Liungman ''Symbols'', p. 297, Ionfox AB, 2004 ISBN 978-91-972705-0-2&lt;/ref&gt; The thetan is the true identity of a person&amp;nbsp;– an intrinsically good, omniscient, non-material core capable of unlimited creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chryssides /&gt;

In the primordial past, thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; The universe has no independent reality, but derives its apparent reality from the fact that most thetans agree it exists.&lt;ref name=Chryssides /&gt; Thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation, rather than their original state of spiritual purity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; Eventually they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers. As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings.&lt;ref name=Chryssides /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thetans are reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called &quot;assumption&quot; which is analogous to [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; Like [[Hinduism]], Scientology posits a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one's present life, and with each rebirth, the effects of the ''MEST'' universe (MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time) on the thetan become stronger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt;

In simple terms, however, there are a number of basic concepts that underpin all beliefs and practices of the Church of Scientology: the reality of spirit; the nature of mind; and the path to salvation. Scientologists maintain that by understanding these principles, and by applying the techniques developed by L. Ron Hubbard, not only will the individual person find infinite and ultimate fulfillment, but the world will eventually be cleansed of all the prevents such fulfillment -- crime, drugs, prejudice and warfare. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Bromley | first1 = David | last2 = Cowan | first2 = Douglas | title = Cults and new religions: a brief history | accessdate = 2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotions and the mind===
{{See also|Tone scale}}
Scientology presents two major divisions of the mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;strangetimes98&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Flowers|1984|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''reactive mind'' is thought to absorb all pain and emotional trauma, while the ''analytical mind'' is a rational mechanism which is responsible for consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chryssides&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farwell&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Bednarowski, Mary Farrell |title=New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America (Religion in North America) |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1995 |page=60 |isbn=0-253-20952-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical (conscious) mind; these are referred to as ''engrams''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollock&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Pollock, Robert |title=The Everything World's Religions Book: Discover the Beliefs, Traditions, and Cultures of Ancient and Modern Religions |publisher=Adams Media Corporation |location=Avon, MA |year=2002 |page=210 |isbn=1-58062-648-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engrams are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; To avoid this fate is Scientology's basic goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; Dianetic [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the ''Clear'' state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind's engrams, and acquiring certainty of his or her reality as a thetan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton32&quot; /&gt;

Scientology uses an emotional classification system called the ''tone scale''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowreligion&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Malko, George |title=Scientology: The Now Religion |publisher=Delacorte Press |location=New York |year=1970 |page=109 |isbn=1-112-96373-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tone scale is a tool used in counseling; Scientologists maintain that knowing a person's place on the scale makes it easier to predict his or her actions and assists in bettering her or his condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;tone scale&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kkj3yBwED2IC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Scientology+tone+scale |title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion, page 132 |author=John Corrigan |isbn=978-0-19-517021-4 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survival and ethics===
[[File:Scientology Symbol Logo.png|thumb|upright|The Scientology symbol is composed of the letter S, which stands for Scientology, and the ARC and KRC triangles, two important concepts in Scientology.]]

Scientology emphasizes the importance of survival, which it subdivides into eight classifications that are referred to as ''dynamics''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wallis/wallis1.txt |title=The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology, page 1 |author=Roy Wallis |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wallis/wallis1.txt |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dynamics&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's desire to survive is considered to be the first dynamic, while the second dynamic relates to procreation and family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton25&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining dynamics encompass wider fields of action, involving groups, mankind, all life, the physical universe, the spirit, and the Infinity, often associated with the Supreme Being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis1&quot; /&gt; The optimum solution to any problem is held to be the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis1&quot;/&gt;

Scientology teaches that spiritual progress requires and enables the attainment of high ethical standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner228&quot;/&gt; In Scientology, rationality is stressed over morality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner228&quot;/&gt; Actions are considered ethical if they promote survival across all eight dynamics, thus benefiting the greatest number of people or things possible while harming the fewest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton33-34&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ARC and KRC triangles===
 {{See also|Scientology terminology}}
The ARC and KRC triangles are [[concept map]]s which show a relationship between three concepts to form another concept. These two triangles are present in the Scientology symbol. The lower triangle, the ARC triangle, is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; It encompasses '''''A'''ffinity'' (affection, love or liking), '''''R'''eality'' (consensual reality) and '''''C'''ommunication'' (the exchange of ideas).&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; Scientologists believe that improving one of the three aspects of the triangle &quot;increases the level&quot; of the other two, but Communication is held to be the most important.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA176&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper triangle is the KRC triangle, the letters KRC positing a similar relationship between '''''K'''nowledge'', '''''R'''esponsibility'' and '''''C'''ontrol''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/scientol1.htm |title=The KRC Triangle |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120910/http://www.religioustolerance.org/scientol1.htm |archivedate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Scientologists, the letters ARC are used as an affectionate greeting in personal communication, for example at the end of a letter.&lt;ref name=turmoilcook&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/01/scientology_in_3.php |title=Scientology in Turmoil: Debbie Cook's E-Mail, Annotated |last= Ortega|first=Tony |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/01/scientology_in_3.php |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social problems are ascribed to breakdowns in ARC&amp;nbsp;– in other words, a lack of agreement on reality, a failure to communicate effectively, or a failure to develop affinity.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA177&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can take the form of ''overts''&amp;nbsp;– harmful acts against another, either intentionally or by omission&amp;nbsp;– which are usually followed by ''withholds''&amp;nbsp;– efforts to conceal the wrongdoing, which further increase the level of tension in the relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA177&quot; /&gt;

===Social and antisocial personalities===
While Scientology states that many social problems are the unintentional results of people's imperfections, it asserts that there are also truly malevolent individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA177&quot; /&gt; Hubbard believed that approximately 80 percent of all people are what he called ''social personalities''{{spaced ndash}}people who welcome and contribute to the welfare of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA177&quot; /&gt; The remaining 20 percent of the population, Hubbard thought, were ''suppressive persons''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA177&quot; /&gt; According to Hubbard, only about 2.5 percent of this 20 percent are hopelessly antisocial personalities; these make up the small proportion of truly dangerous individuals in humanity: &quot;the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GA177&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZP146-147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Zellner|Petrowsky|1998|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists believe that any contact with suppressive or antisocial individuals has an adverse effect on one's spiritual condition, necessitating disconnection.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA177&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZP146-147&quot; /&gt;

In Scientology, defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons,&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-04-445687-5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Marshall, Gordon |title=In praise of sociology |publisher=Unwin Hyman |location=Boston |year=1990 |page=187 |isbn=0-04-445687-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;strangetimes101&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Flowers|1984|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;netwars&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Grossman, Wendy |title=Net. wars |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |year=1997 |page=73 |isbn=0-8147-3103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-691-12582-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenawalt, Kent |title=Religion and the Constitution |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2006 |page=298 |isbn=0-691-12582-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton36&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Scientologist who is actively in communication with a suppressive person and as a result shows signs of antisocial behaviour is referred to as a ''Potential Trouble Source''.&lt;ref name=&quot;newreli&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Bednarowski, Mary Farrell |title=New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America (Religion in North America) |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1995 |page=114 |isbn=0-253-20952-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;altreliny&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Timothy |title=America's alternative religions |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1995 |page=388 |isbn=0-7914-2397-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditing===
[[File:Stresstest.jpg|thumb|right|A Scientologist introduces the [[E-meter]] to a potential student.]]
{{Main|Auditing (Scientology)}}

Scientology asserts that people have hidden abilities which have not yet been fully realized.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton ''The Encyclopedia of American Religion'', p. 224, McGrath Publishing Co., 1978 ISBN 978-0-7876-9696-2&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that increased spiritual awareness and physical benefits are accomplished through counseling sessions referred to as ''[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkelman509&quot;&gt;Paul Finkelman ''Religion and American Law'', p. 509, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000 ISBN 978-0-8153-0750-1&lt;/ref&gt; Through auditing, it is said that people can solve their problems and free themselves of engrams.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot; /&gt; This restores them to their natural condition as thetans and enables them to be ''at cause'' in their daily lives, responding rationally and creatively to life events rather than reacting to them under the direction of stored engrams.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA175&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of ''Preclear'' to ''Clear'' and ''Operating Thetan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA176-177&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology's utopian aim is to &quot;clear the planet&quot;, a world in which everyone has cleared themselves of their engrams.&lt;ref name=Lewis316&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|2009|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or ''auditor.''&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230&gt;{{Harvnb|Neusner|2003|pp=229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; It bears a superficial similarity to [[Confession (religion)|confession]] or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice the way a pastor or priest might do.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Instead, the auditor's task is to help a person discover and understand engrams, and their limiting effects, for him- or herself.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Most auditing requires an [[E-meter]], a device that measures minute changes in [[electrical resistance]] through the body when a person holds electrodes (metal &quot;cans&quot;), and a small current is passed through them.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Scientology asserts that watching for changes in the E-meter's display helps locate engrams.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it, in order to help him or her eliminate the engram, and uses the E-meter to confirm that the engram's &quot;charge&quot; has been dissipated and the engram has in fact been cleared.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; As the individual progresses, the focus of auditing moves from simple engrams to engrams of increasing complexity.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; At the more advanced OT auditing levels, Scientologists perform solo auditing sessions, acting as their own auditors.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt;

===The ''Bridge to Total Freedom''===
Spiritual development within Scientology is accomplished by studying Scientology materials. Scientology materials (called ''Technology'' or ''Tech'' in [[Scientology terminology|Scientology jargon]]) are structured in sequential levels (or ''gradients''), so that easier steps are taken first and greater complexities are handled at the appropriate time. This process is sometimes referred to as moving along the ''[[Bridge to Total Freedom]]'', or simply ''the Bridge''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA176&quot; /&gt; It has two sides: ''training'' and ''processing''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner228&quot; /&gt; Training means education in the principles and practices of auditing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner228&quot; /&gt; Processing is personal development through participation in auditing sessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner228&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Neusner|2003|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology believes in the principle of reciprocity, involving give-and-take in every human transaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton59-60&quot; /&gt; Accordingly, members are required to make donations for study courses and auditing as they move up the Bridge, the amounts increasing as higher levels are reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton59-60&quot; /&gt; Participation in higher-level courses on the Bridge may cost several thousand dollars, and Scientologists usually move up the Bridge at a rate governed by their income.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton59-60&quot; /&gt;

===Space opera and confidential materials===
{{See also|Operating Thetan|Space opera in Scientology doctrine}}

The Church of Scientology holds that at the higher levels of initiation (''[[Operating Thetan|OT levels]]''), mystical teachings are imparted that may be harmful to unprepared readers. These teachings are kept secret from members who have not reached these levels. The Church states that the secrecy is warranted to keep its materials' use in context, and to protect its members from being exposed to materials they are not yet prepared for.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Freewinds starboard.jpg|thumb|right|The Scientology cruise ship ''[[Freewinds]]''.]]
These are the OT levels, the levels above ''Clear'', whose contents are guarded within Scientology. The OT level teachings include accounts of various cosmic catastrophes that befell the thetans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton33&quot; /&gt; Hubbard described these early events collectively as ''[[space opera in Scientology doctrine|space opera]]''.

In the OT levels, Hubbard explains how to reverse the effects of past-life trauma patterns that supposedly extend millions of years into the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoubleCrossed&quot;/&gt; Among these advanced teachings is the story of [[Xenu]] (sometimes Xemu), introduced as the tyrant ruler of the &quot;[[Galactic Confederacy]].&quot; According to this story, 75 million years ago Xenu brought billions of people to Earth in spacecraft resembling [[Douglas DC-8]] airliners, stacked them around volcanoes and detonated hydrogen bombs in the volcanoes. The thetans then clustered together, stuck to the bodies of the living, and continue to do this today. Scientologists at advanced levels place considerable emphasis on isolating body thetans and neutralizing their ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sappell|first=Joel|coauthors=Robert W. Welkos|title=The Scientology Story|journal=Los Angeles Times|pages=page A36:1|date=June 24, 1990|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/inland/la-scientology-sg,1,7389843.storygallery?coll=la-editions-inland-news|accessdate=2006-08-09|ref=harv |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071229092925/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/inland/la-scientology-sg,1,7389843.storygallery?coll=la-editions-inland-news |archivedate = December 29, 2007}} Another link: [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90.html Carnegie-Mellon University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The material contained in the OT levels has been characterized as bad science fiction by critics, while others claim it bears structural similarities to [[gnosticism|gnostic]] thought and ancient Hindu beliefs of creation and cosmic struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton33&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrick|first=James A. |authorlink=James A. Herrick|title=The Making of the New Spirituality|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2004|location=Downers Grove, IL|page=199|isbn=0-8308-3279-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Gordon Melton]] suggests that these elements of the OT levels may never have been intended as descriptions of historical events, and that, like other religious mythology, they may have their truth in the realities of the body and mind which they symbolize.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton33&quot; /&gt; He adds that on whatever level Scientologists might have received this mythology, they seem to have found it useful in their spiritual quest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton33&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excerpts and descriptions of OT materials were published online by a former member in 1995 and then circulated in mainstream media. This occurred after the teachings were submitted as evidence in court cases involving Scientology, thus becoming a matter of public record.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoubleCrossed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Ortega|title=Double Crossed|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/full|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|publisher=[[Village Voice Media]]|date=December 23, 1999|accessdate=2007-09-16 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120906/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/full |archivedate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loss&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Hines|title=Scientology loss keeps hyperlinks legal|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1028_3-5072581.html|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=September 8, 2003|accessdate=2007-09-16 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://news.com.com/2100-1028_3-5072581.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are eight publicly known OT levels, OT I to VIII.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavisNRMRL45-47&quot;&gt;Derek Davis ''New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America'', pp. 45–47, Baylor University Press, 2004 ISBN 978-0-918954-92-3&lt;/ref&gt; The highest level, OT VIII, is disclosed only at sea, on the Scientology cruise ship ''[[Freewinds]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavisNRMRL45-47&quot; /&gt; It has been rumored that additional OT levels, said to be based on material written by Hubbard long ago, will be released at some appropriate point in the future.&lt;ref name=LewHam36&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Hammer|2007|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] symbol carved into the ground at Scientology's [[Trementina Base]] is visible from the air.&lt;ref&gt;Coordinates of Trementina Base {{Coord|35|30|42|N|104|34|48|W|type:landmark|name=Trementina Base}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington Post reporter Richard Leiby wrote, &quot;Former Scientologists familiar with Hubbard’s teachings on reincarnation say the symbol marks a 'return point' so loyal staff members know where they can find the founder’s works when they travel here in the future from other places in the universe.&quot;&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{cite news|last=Leiby|first=Richard|title=A Place in the Desert for New Mexico's Most Exclusive Circles|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/26/AR2005112601065.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=July 13, 2011|date=November 27, 2005 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120918/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/26/AR2005112601065.html |archivedate=2012-09-18 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonies===
In Scientology, ceremonies for events such as weddings, child naming, and funerals are observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; Friday services are held to commemorate the completion of a person's religious services during the prior week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; Ordained Scientology ministers may perform such rites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neusner&quot; /&gt; However, these services and the clergy who perform them play only a minor role in Scientologists' religious lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA170&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
The general orientation of Hubbard's philosophy owes much to [[Will Durant]], author of the popular 1926 classic ''[[The Story of Philosophy]]''; ''Dianetics'' is dedicated to Durant.&lt;ref name=Willms248-9 /&gt; Hubbard's view of a mechanically functioning mind in particular finds close parallels in Durant's work on [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref name=Willms248-9&gt;{{harvnb|Willms|2009|pp=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychology, popularized in the 1930s and 1940s, was a key contributor to the Dianetics therapy model, and was acknowledged unreservedly as such by Hubbard in his early works.&lt;ref name=Willms2005-54-60 /&gt; Hubbard never forgot meeting Cmdr. [[Joseph Cheesman Thompson]], a U.S. Navy officer who studied with Freud, when he was 12 years old,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Petersen ''Controversial New Religions'', p. 238, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0-19-515682-9&lt;/ref&gt; and when writing to the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1949, he stated that he was conducting research based on the &quot;early work of Freud&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA171&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major influence was [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[General Semantics]].&lt;ref name=Willms2005-54-60 /&gt; Hubbard was friends with fellow science fiction writer [[A. E. van Vogt]], who explored the implications of Korzybski's [[non-Aristotelian logic]] in works such as ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', and Hubbard's view of the ''reactive mind'' has clear and acknowledged parallels with Korzybski's thought; in fact, Korzybski's &quot;anthropometer&quot; may have been what inspired Hubbard's invention of the E-meter.&lt;ref name=Willms2005-54-60 /&gt;

Beyond that, Hubbard himself named a great many other influences in his own writing&amp;nbsp;– in ''Scientology 8-8008'', for example, these include philosophers from [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Aristotle]] to [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Voltaire]], physicists and mathematicians like [[Euclid]] and [[Isaac Newton]], as well as founders of religions such as [[Buddha]], [[Confucius]], [[Jesus]] and [[Mohammed]]&amp;nbsp;– but there is little evidence in Hubbard's writings that he studied these figures to any great depth.&lt;ref name=Willms2005-54-60&gt;{{harvnb|Willms|2005|pp=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted, there are elements of Eastern religions evident in Scientology,&lt;ref name=&quot;GA171&quot; /&gt; in particular the concepts of [[karma]], as present [[Karma in Hinduism|in Hinduism]] and [[Karma in Jainism|in Jainism]], and [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Wilson (1995): ''{{cite web |url=http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/collection/diversity/point33.htm |title=Religious Toleration &amp; Religious Diversity |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120906/http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/collection/diversity/point33.htm |archivedate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=no}}'', The Institute for the Study of American Religion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis ''The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements'', p. 429, Oxford University Press US, 2004 ISBN 978-0-19-514986-9&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the links to Hindu texts, Hubbard tried to connect Scientology with [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Stephen A. {{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Scientology%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Eastern%20Religious%20Traditions%20.htm |title=Scientology's Relationship With Eastern Religious Traditions |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120630/http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Scientology%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Eastern%20Religious%20Traditions%20.htm |archivedate=2012-06-30 |deadurl=no}}, ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'', Vol. 11, No. 1, 1996, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology has been said to share features with [[Gnosticism]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Christensen, David Levinson (2003): ''Encyclopedia of Community'', SAGE, p. 1210: &quot;Scientology shows affinities with Buddhism and a remarkable similarity to first-century Gnosticism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Saliba]] (1996): ''Signs of the Times'', Médiaspaul, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, Hubbard was in contact with [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], a rocket scientist and member of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] then led by [[Aleister Crowley]], and there have been suggestions that this connection influenced some of the ideas and symbols of Scientology.&lt;ref name=Willms259&gt;{{harvnb|Willms|2009|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melton7-67 /&gt; Religious scholars like Gerald Willms and [[J. Gordon Melton]] have pointed out that Crowley's teachings bear little if any resemblance to Scientology doctrine.&lt;ref name=Willms259 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Melton7-67&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=7–8, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
{{Main|List of Scientology organizations}}

[[File:SPBuilding080210.jpg|thumb|The incomplete [[Super Power Building]] of the FLAG Scientology complex in [[Clearwater, Florida]].]]
There are a considerable number of Scientology organizations (or ''orgs'') which generally support one of the following three aims: enabling Scientology practice and training, promoting the wider application of Scientology technology, or campaigning for social change.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA180-184&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|pp=180–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations are supported by a three-tiered hierarchical structure comprising lay practitioners, staff and, at the top of the hierarchy, members of the so-called Sea Organization or ''[[Sea Org]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA180&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sea Org, comprising over 5,000 members, has been compared to the [[monastic order]]s found in other religions; it is composed of the most dedicated adherents, who work for nominal compensation and symbolically express their religious commitment by signing a billion-year contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA180&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton43&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal structure of Scientology organizations is strongly bureaucratic, with detailed coordination of activities and collection of ''stats''&amp;nbsp;– or statistics, to measure organizational and individual performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA180&quot; /&gt; Organizational operating budgets are performance-related and subject to frequent reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA180&quot; /&gt; Scientology has an internal justice system (the ''Ethics'' system) designed to deal with unethical or antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA180&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics officers are present in every org; they are tasked with ensuring correct application of Scientology technology and deal with violations such as non-compliance with standard procedures or any other behavior adversely affecting an org's performance, ranging from errors and misdemeanors to crimes and suppressive acts, as defined by internal documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA181&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial part of the Scientology justice system is the [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] (RPF).&lt;ref name=&quot;GA181&quot; /&gt; When a Sea Org member is accused of a violation, such as lying, sexual misconduct, dereliction of duty, or failure to comply with Church policy, a Committee of Evidence examines the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA181&quot; /&gt; If the charge is substantiated, the individual may accept expulsion from the Sea Org or participate in the RPF to become eligible to rejoin the Sea Org.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA181&quot; /&gt; The RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA181&quot; /&gt; [[Douglas E. Cowan]] and [[David G. Bromley]] state that scholars and observers have come to radically different conclusions about the RPF and whether it is &quot;voluntary or coercive, therapeutic or punitive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA181&quot; /&gt;

===Practice and training organizations===
Many Scientologists' first contact with Scientology is through local informal groups and field auditors practicing Dianetics counseling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton39&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, Scientology operates hundreds of Churches and Missions around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA182&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where Scientologists receive introductory training, and it is at this local level that most Scientologists participate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA182&quot; /&gt; Churches and Missions are licensed franchises; they offer services for a fee, and return a proportion of their income to the mother church.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA182&quot; /&gt; They are also required to adhere to the standards established by the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC), which supervises the application of Scientology tech, owns the trademarks and service marks of Scientology, and collaborates with the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] to administer and control the various corporate entities within Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromley98&gt;{{harvnb|Bromley|2009|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RTC's Chairman is [[David Miscavige]], who, while not the titular head of the Church of Scientology, is believed to be the most powerful person in the Scientology movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas C.|last=Tobin|title=The Man Behind Scientology|url=http://www.sptimes.com/TampaBay/102598/scientologypart1.html|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=October 25, 1998|accessdate=2008-10-11  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120524/http://www.sptimes.com/TampaBay/102598/scientologypart1.html |archivedate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an individual has reached ''Clear'' and wishes to proceed further, he or she can take OT auditing and coursework with Advanced Organizations located in Los Angeles, Sydney, [[East Grinstead]] and [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton40&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond OT V, the [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.|Flag Service Organization]] in [[Clearwater, Florida]], offers the auditing and course work for OT levels VI and VII, while OT VIII is offered only by the [[Flag Ship Service Organization]] aboard the Scientology ship ''Freewinds''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, all of these Churches and organizations have been united under the [[Church of Scientology International]] umbrella organization, with the Sea Org providing staff for all levels above the local Churches and Missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA182&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton41&quot; /&gt;

===Technology application organizations===
[[File:Church of Scientology Tampa.jpg|thumb|Church of Scientology of [[Tampa, Florida]].]]
A number of Scientology organizations specialize in promoting the use of Scientology technology as a means to solve social problems.
*[[Narconon]] is a drug education and rehabilitation program. The program is founded on Hubbard's belief that drugs and poisons stored in the body impede spiritual growth, and was originally conceived by William Benitez, a prison inmate who applied Hubbard's ideas to rid himself of his drug habit.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA182&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton45-46&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narconon is offered in the United States, Canada and a number of European countries; its ''Purification Program'' uses a regimen composed of [[sauna]], physical exercise, vitamins and diet management, combined with auditing and study.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA182&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton45-46&quot; /&gt;
*[[Criminon]] is a program designed to rehabilitate criminal offenders by teaching them study and communication methods and helping them reform their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA182&quot; /&gt; The program originally grew out of the Narconon effort and today is available in over 200 prisons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton45-46&quot; /&gt; It has experienced steady growth, based on a good success rate, with low [[recidivism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton45-46&quot; /&gt;
*[[Applied Scholastics]] promotes the use of Hubbard's educational methodology, known as ''[[study tech]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA183&quot; /&gt; Originally developed to help Scientologists study course materials, Hubbard's study tech is now used in some private and public schools as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton47&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Scholastics is active across Europe and North America as well as in Australia, [[Malaysia]], China and South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton47&quot; /&gt; It supports literacy efforts in American cities and [[Third World]] countries, and its methodology is sometimes included in [[management training]] programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton47-48&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Way to Happiness|The Way to Happiness Foundation]] promotes a moral code written by Hubbard, to date translated into more than 40 languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA183&quot; /&gt;

===Social reform organizations===
[[File:Scientology psychiatry kills.jpg|right|thumb|Scientologists on an anti-[[psychiatry]] demonstration.]]
{{See|Scientology and psychiatry|Citizens Commission on Human Rights|Psychiatry: An Industry of Death}}
Some Scientology organizations are focused on bringing about social change.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA183&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is the [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]] (CCHR). Founded in 1969, it has a long history of opposing [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] practices such as [[lobotomy]], [[electric shock treatment]] and the use of [[mood-altering drug]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton49&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GA184&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatric establishment rejected Hubbard's theories in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA184&quot; /&gt; Ever since, Scientology has argued that psychiatry suffers from the fundamental flaw of ignoring humanity's spiritual dimension, and that it fails to take into account Hubbard's insights about the nature of the mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton49&quot;/&gt; Scientology holds psychiatry responsible for a great many wrongs in the world, saying it has at various times offered itself as a tool of political suppression and &quot;that psychiatry spawned the ideology which fired Hitler's mania, turned the Nazis into mass murderers, and created the Holocaust.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton49&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GA184&quot; /&gt; In recent years, the CCHR has conducted high-profile campaigns against [[Ritalin]], given to children to control [[hyperactivity]], and [[Prozac]], a commonly used [[antidepressant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GA184&quot; /&gt; Neither drug was taken off the market as a result of the campaign, but Ritalin sales decreased, and Prozac suffered bad press.&lt;ref name=&quot;GA184&quot; /&gt;

The main other organization in this field is the National Commission on Law Enforcement and Social Justice, devoted to combating what it describes as abusive practices by government and police agencies, especially [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GA184&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton50-51&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other entities===
Other prominent Scientology-related organizations include:
*[[International Association of Scientologists]], the official Scientology membership organization;
*[[Church of Spiritual Technology]], a non-profit organization that owns the copyrights to Scientology books.

===Free Zone and Independent Scientologists===
Although ''Scientology'' is most often used as shorthand for the [[Church of Scientology]], a number of groups practice Scientology and Dianetics outside of the official Church. These groups, collectively known as the [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] or as Independent Scientologists, consist of both former members of the official Church of Scientology, as well as entirely new members. Capt. Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the movement in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;freezone_orgintro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Free Zone Assoc. |url=http://www.freezone.org/news/intro.htm |title=Introduction |publisher=Freezone.org |date=January 30, 2002 |accessdate=2010-09-04 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.freezone.org/news/intro.htm |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church labels these groups as ''[[Squirreling|squirrels]]'' in [[Scientology terminology|Scientology jargon]], and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The meeting was an &quot;opportunity for the church to offer to end its long dispute with the agency, including the dozens of suits brought against the IRS.&quot; The committee met several times with the Scientology legal team and &quot;was persuaded that those involved in the Snow White crimes had been purged, that church money was devoted to tax-exempt purposes and that, with Mr. Hubbard's death, no one was getting rich from Scientology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times tax exempt status&quot; /&gt; In August 1993, a settlement was reached; the church would receive its tax-exempt status and end its legal assault on the IRS and its personnel.

[[David G. Bromley]] of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] characterizes Scientology as &quot;a 'quasi-religious therapy' that resembles Freudian 'depth psychology' while also drawing upon Buddhism, Hinduism and Gnosticism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William W. Zellner and Marc Petrowsky, Editors, ''Sects, Cults and Spiritual Communities: A Sociological Analysis'', pp. 141–156, Praeger Paperbacks, 1998 ISBN 0-275-96335-7; chapter 8: &quot;The Church of Scientology: A Quasi-Religion&quot; by David G. Bromley and Mitchell L. Bracey, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Frank K. Flinn, adjunct professor of religious studies at [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis]] wrote, &quot;it is abundantly clear that Scientology has both the typical forms of ceremonial and celebratory worship and its own unique form of spiritual life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Flinn/index.htm|first=Frank K.|last=Flinn|title=Scientology: The Marks of Religion|publisher=Church of Scientology|date=September 22, 1994 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120908/http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Flinn/index.htm |archivedate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flinn further states that religion requires &quot;beliefs in something transcendental or ultimate, practices (rites and codes of behavior) that re-inforce those beliefs and, a community that is sustained by both the beliefs and practices&quot;, all of which are present within Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flinn-WashingtonPost&quot;/&gt;

Using the synonym of alternative religions, Barrett (1998:237) and Hunt (2003:195) place Scientology in the sociological grouping of [[personal development]] movements together with the [[Neurolinguistic Programming]], [[The Template Network|Emin]], and [[Insight]]. According to Religious Studies professor Mary Farrell Benarowski, Scientology describes itself as drawing on science, religion, psychology and philosophy but &quot;had been claimed by none of them and repudiated, for the most part, by all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mary Farrell |last=Bednarowski |chapter=The Church of Scientology: Lightning Rod for Cultural Boundary Conflicts |editor=Timothy Miller |title=America's Alternative Religions|year=1995 |isbn=0-7914-2397-2|publisher=SUNY Press|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the variety of scholarly opinions in existence, [[David G. Bromley]] and [[Douglas E. Cowan]] stated in 2006 that &quot;Overall, however, most scholars have concluded that Scientology falls within the category of religion for the purposes of academic study, and a number have defended the Church in judicial and political proceedings on this basis.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GA170&quot;/&gt; Bromley and Cowan noted in 2008 that Scientology's attempts &quot;to gain favor with new religion scholars&quot; had often been problematic.&lt;ref name=&quot;BC17&quot; /&gt;

On the cultural significance of Scientology as a religion and providing a different scholarly perspective, [[Roland Robertson]], a sociologist and theorist of globalization says, &quot;New Religious Movements such as Scientology are contributing to globalization at the level or focal point of the self and the newly thematized extra societal aspect of self, humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | title = The Cultural Significance of New Religious Movements and Globalization: A Theoretical Prolegomenon | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | date = January 1, 1998 | first = Roland | last = Robertson | volume = 37 | issue = 4| id = | accessdate = 2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]] asserts, &quot;The Church of Scientology is very much a religion in the fullest sense of the word.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/melton/page01.htm |title=&quot;A Short Study of the Scientology Religion&quot; |publisher=Neuereligion.de |date=1981-05-10 |accessdate=2012-09-20 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/melton/page01.htm |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jacob Neusner, editor of ''World Religions in America'', &quot;Scientology contains religious practices and rituals, as well as moral principles and standards for ethical conduct, all aimed at the redemption and salvation of humanity. This religion is supported by a community of believers, including highly dedicated ordained clergy, and their activities are organized socially much like other, more traditional American religions.&quot; Neusner also argues, &quot;Scientology contains the same elements of most other religions, including myths, scriptures, doctrines, worship, sacred practices and rituals, moral and ethical expectations, a community of believers, clergy, and ecclesiastic organizations.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Neusner | first1 = Jacob | title = World Religions in America | edition = 3 | accessdate = 2012-11-02 | isbn = 9780664224752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Scientology as a business}}

While [[new religious movement|NRM]] scholars have generally accepted the religious nature of Scientology, media reports have tended to express the opinion that &quot;Scientology is a business, often given to criminal acts, and sometimes masquerading as a religion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GA170&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BH&quot; /&gt; During his lifetime, Hubbard was accused of using religion as a façade for Scientology to maintain [[tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;BH&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beit-Hallahmi|first=Benjamin|title=Scientology: Religion or racket?|journal=Marburg Journal of Religion|volume=8|issue=1|publisher=Philipps-Universität Marburg|month=September|year=2003|url=http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/beit.html|accessdate=2006-06-30|ref=harv |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120715/http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/beit.html |archivedate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS cited a statement frequently attributed to Hubbard that the way to get rich was to found a religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bare-faced Messiah&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Melton5574&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=55, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]], the supposed statement is actually unsubstantiated, although several of Hubbard's science fiction colleagues do recall Hubbard raising the topic in conversation.&lt;ref name=Melton5574 /&gt;

Hubbard grew up in a climate that was very critical of organized religion, and frequently quoted anti-religious sentiments in his early lectures.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski&gt;{{Cite journal

Hubbard did not want to found a religion: he discovered that what he was talking about in fact was religion. This mainly happened when he had to deal with apparent memories from former lives. He had to defend himself about this to his friends.&quot;&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Frenschkowski allows that there naturally were practical considerations about &quot;how to present Scientology to the outside world&quot;, but dismisses the notion that presentation as a religion was just an expedient pretense, pointing to many passages in Hubbard's works that document his struggle with this issue.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Drawing parallels to similar struggles for identity in other religious movements such as [[Theosophy]] and [[Transcendental Meditation]], Frenschkowski sees in Hubbard's lectures &quot;the case of a man whose background was non-religious and who nevertheless discovers that his ideas somehow oscillate between 'science' (in a very popular sense), 'religion' and 'philosophy', and that these ideas somehow fascinate so many people that they start to form a separate movement. As in the case of similar movements, it was quite unclear to Hubbard in the beginning what Scientology would become.&quot;&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

The Church of Scientology denounces the idea of Hubbard starting a religion for personal gain as an unfounded rumor.&lt;ref&gt;Platvoet &amp; Molendijk ''The Pragmatics of Defining Religion'', pp. 63–64, Brill, 1999 ISBN 978-90-04-11544-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Church also suggests that the origin of the rumor was a quote by [[George Orwell]] which had been misattributed to Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jentzsch|first=Heber|title=Church of Scientology FAQ: Did L. Ron Hubbard state that the way to make money was to start a religion?|month=|year=|url=http://faq.scientology.org/page44b.htm|accessdate=2010-06-09 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120717/http://faq.scientology.org/page44b.htm |archivedate=2012-07-17 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Vaughn Young]], who left the Church in 1989 after being its spokesman for twenty years, suggested that reports of Hubbard making such a statement could be explained as a misattribution of Orwell, despite having encountered three of Hubbard's associates from his science fiction days who remembered Hubbard making statements of that sort in person.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Church's War&quot; /&gt; It was Young who by a stroke of luck came up with the &quot;Orwell quote&quot;: &quot;but I have always thought there might be a lot of cash in starting a new religion, and we'll talk it over some time&quot; It appears in a letter by George Orwell (signed [[Eric Blair]]) to a friend Jack Common, dated 16-February-38 (February 16, 1938), and was published in ''Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', vol. 1.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' (4 volumes), vol. 1, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1968 ASIN: B000GLJ10S&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Rolling Stone]]'s Janet Reitman writes Hubbard said the same thing to science fiction writer [[Lloyd Eshbach]], a fact quoted in Eshbach's autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Reitman ''Inside Scientology'', Rolling Stone, February 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology maintains strict control over the use of its symbols, icons, and names. It claims [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] over its &quot;Scientology cross&quot;, and its lawyers have threatened lawsuits against individuals and organizations who have published the image in books and on Web sites. Because of this, it is very difficult for individual groups to attempt to publicly practice Scientology on their own, independent of the official Church of Scientology. Scientology has filed suit against a number of individuals who have attempted to set up their own auditing practices, using copyright and trademark law to shut these groups down.&lt;ref&gt;Plotkin-Wells &amp; Wimmer ''E-Commerce Law &amp; Business'', Section 8.01[2], Aspen Publishers Online, 2003 ISBN 978-0-7355-4148-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology and its many related organizations have amassed considerable real estate holdings worldwide, likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Behar&quot; /&gt; Scientology encourages existing members to &quot;sell&quot; Scientology to others by paying a commission to those who recruit new members.&lt;ref name=Behar /&gt; Scientology franchises, or missions, must pay the Church of Scientology roughly 10% of their gross income.&lt;ref name=&quot;Man In Control&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Joel|last=Sappell|coauthors=Welkos, Robert W.|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-scientologysideb062490,1,7772622.story|title=The Man In Control|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A41:4|date=June 24, 1990|accessdate=2006-06-06  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-scientologysideb062490,1,7772622.story |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that basis, it is likened to a [[pyramid selling scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Louis Jolyon|title=Psychiatry and Scientology|month=July|year=1990|url=http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/psyscn.htm|accessdate=2007-05-16  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120911/http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/psyscn.htm |archivedate=2012-09-11 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While introductory courses do not cost much, courses at the higher levels may cost several thousand dollars each.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton59&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a rule, the great majority of members proceeds up the bridge in a steady rate commensurate with their income.

In conjunction with the Church of Scientology's request to be officially recognized as a religion in Germany, around 1996 the German state [[Baden-Württemberg]] conducted a thorough investigation regarding the group's activities within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.im.nrw.de/inn/doks/vs/blagsc.pdf Zur Frage der Beobachtung der Scientology-Organisation durch die Verfassungsschutzbehörden]{{dead link|date=August 2011}} (in German) (PDF format)&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this investigation indicated that at the time of publication, Scientology's main sources of revenue (&quot;Haupteinnahmequellen der SO&quot;) were from course offerings and sales of their various publications. Course offerings ranged from (German Marks) DM 182.50 to about DM 30,000{{spaced ndash}}the equivalent today of approximately $119 to $19,560 USD. Revenue from monthly, bi-monthly, and other membership offerings could not be estimated in the report, but was nevertheless placed in the millions. Defending its practices against accusations of [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]], the Church has countered critics by drawing analogies to other religious groups who have established practices such as [[tithing]], or require members to make donations for specific religious services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melton60&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States defended the practice by noting their responsibility to respond to citizens' requests for information about Scientology as well as other subjects. While many of the pamphlets were factual and relatively unbiased, some warned of alleged dangers posed by Scientology to the political order, to the free market economic system, and to the mental and financial well being of individuals. Beyond the Government's actions, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church have been public opponents of Scientology. Evangelical 'Commissioners for Religious and Ideological Issues' have been particularly active in this regard.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Of the many [[new religious movement]]s to appear during the 20th century, the [[Church of Scientology]] has, from its inception, been one of the most [[controversy|controversial]], coming into conflict with the governments and police forces of several countries (including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy|last=Morgan|title=Abroad: Critics public and private keep pressure on Scientology|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/Abroad__Critics_publi.html|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=March 29, 1999|accessdate=2007-09-07|quote=Canada's highest court in 1997 upheld the criminal conviction of the Church of Scientology of Toronto and one of its officers for a breach of trust stemming from covert operations in Canadian government offices during the 1970s and 1980s. |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120530/http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/Abroad__Critics_publi.html |archivedate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; France&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pierre-Antoine|last=Souchard|title=Scientology Fraud Conviction Upheld |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/02/scientology-fraud-conviction_n_1249314.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=2012-02-03|quote=A French appeals court on Thursday upheld the Church of Scientology's 2009 fraud conviction on charges it pressured members into paying large sums for questionable remedies. |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/02/scientology-fraud-conviction_n_1249314.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany).&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeVenus&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Remember Venus?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889564,00.html|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=December 22, 1952|accessdate=2007-07-20 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120530/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889564,00.html |archivedate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Behar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Church's War&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Leiby|author=Richard Leiby|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/06/AR2005070601351.html|title=Scientology Fiction: The Church's War Against Its Critics – and Truth|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=C1|date=December 25, 1994|accessdate=2006-06-21 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120530/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/06/AR2005070601351.html |archivedate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET - Goodin Scientology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=June 3, 1999|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1023-226676.html|title=Scientology subpoenas Worldnet|publisher=CNET News.com|accessdate=2006-05-04 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120524/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-226676.html |archivedate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/pdf/2001/schoen2001.pdf |title=Marburg Journal of Religion: Framing Effects in the Coverage of Scientology versus Germany: Some Thoughts on the Role of Press and Scholars |publisher=Web.uni-marburg.de |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been one of the most litigious religious movements in history, filing countless lawsuits against governments, organizations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richardson|2009|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports and allegations have been made, by journalists, courts, and governmental bodies of several countries, that the Church of Scientology is an unscrupulous commercial enterprise that harasses its critics and brutally exploits its members.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Church's War&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET - Goodin Scientology&quot;/&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published an [[The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power|article]] in 1991 which described Scientology as &quot;a hugely profitable global racket that survives by intimidating members and critics in a Mafia-like manner.&quot;&lt;ref name=Behar /&gt;

The controversies involving the Church and its critics, some of them ongoing, include:
* Scientology's [[disconnection]] policy, in which members are encouraged to cut off all contact with friends or family members who are &quot;antagonistic&quot; to Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;unperson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Farley|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml|title=The unperson|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=June 24, 2006|pages=1A,14A|accessdate=2007-06-24 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120914/http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-14 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The death of a Scientologist [[Lisa McPherson]] while in the care of the Church.

* In October 2009, a French court found the Church of Scientology guilty of organized fraud. Four officers of the organization were fined and given suspended prison sentences of up to 2 years. The Church of Scientology said it would appeal the judgment. Prosecutors had hoped to achieve a ban of Scientology in France, but due to a temporary change in French law, which &quot;made it impossible to dissolve a legal entity on the grounds of fraud&quot;, no ban was pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE59Q1HD20091027 |title=&quot;Scientology convicted for fraud in France, escapes ban&quot; |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120530/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE59Q1HD20091027 |archivedate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=no}}, ''Reuters'', October 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence was confirmed by appeal court in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gwtWz_83MU3nuVdXSNrURSz_aveA?docId=CNG.fb962feea373c177fa8b0366a1e124f3.291 |title=French court upholds Scientology fraud conviction |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gwtWz_83MU3nuVdXSNrURSz_aveA?docId=CNG.fb962feea373c177fa8b0366a1e124f3.291 |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}, ''AFP'', February 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2009, Australian [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Nick Xenophon]] used a speech in Federal Parliament to allege that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organization. Based on letters from former followers of the religion, he said that there were &quot;allegations of forced imprisonment, coerced abortions, and embezzlement of church funds, of physical violence and intimidation, blackmail and the widespread and deliberate abuse of information obtained by the organization&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Rudd's concerns about Scientology (quoted from embedded video, &quot;Xenophon attacks Scientology{{spaced ndash}}Independent Senator Nick Xenophon attacks Scientology as a 'criminal organisation{{'&quot;}}).|date=November 18, 2009|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/senator-attacks--criminal-church-of-scientology-20091118-ikla.html?autostart=1|publisher=[[The Age]]|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientology and the Internet===
{{See also|Scientology and the Internet|Project Chanology}}
In the 1990s, Scientology representatives began to take action against increased criticism of Scientology on the Internet. The organization says that the actions taken were to prevent distribution of [[copyright]]ed Scientology documents and publications online, fighting what it refers to as &quot;copyright terrorists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grossman|first=Wendy|title=Net.Wars|url=http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/|accessdate=2006-06-11|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-3103-1|pages=77–78|chapter=Copyright Terrorists|chapterurl=http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/textonly/pages/chapter06/ch06_.html|year=1997|month=October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1995, Church lawyer [[Helena Kobrin]] attempted to shut down the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.religion.scientology]] by sending a control message instructing [[Usenet]] servers to delete the group.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Grossman ''[[Net.wars]]'', p. 77, NYU Press, 1997 ISBN 978-0-8147-3103-1&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this [[rmgroup message]] had little effect, since most Usenet servers are configured to disregard such messages when sent to groups that receive substantial traffic, and [[newgroup message]]s were quickly issued to recreate the group on those servers that did not do so. However, the issuance of the message led to a great deal of public criticism by free-speech advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Vedro ''Digital Dharma'', p. 190, Quest Books, 2007 ISBN 978-0-8356-0859-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Godwin ''[[Cyber Rights]]'', p. 219, Massachusett Institute of Technology Press, 2003 ISBN 978-0-262-57168-5&lt;/ref&gt; Among the criticism raised, one suggestion is that Scientology's true motive is to suppress the free speech of its critics.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Cookson ''Encyclopedia of Religious Freedom'', p. 432, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003 ISBN 978-0-415-94181-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Grossman ''[[Net.wars]]'', p. 90, New York University Press, 1997 ISBN 978-0-8147-3103-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anonymous Protest.jpg|thumb|An Internet-based group which refers to itself as '[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]' held [[Project Chanology|protests]] outside Scientology centers in cities around the world in February 2008 as part of [[Project Chanology]].

The Church also began filing lawsuits against those who posted copyrighted texts on the newsgroup and the [[World Wide Web]], and lobbied for tighter restrictions on copyrights in general. The Church supported the controversial [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] as well as the even more controversial [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Some of the [[DMCA]]'s provisions (notably the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]]) were heavily influenced by Church litigation against US [[Internet service providers]] over copyrighted Scientology materials that had been posted or uploaded through their servers.

Beginning in the middle of 1996 and ensuing for several years, the newsgroup was attacked by anonymous parties using a tactic dubbed ''[[sporgery]]'' by some, in the form of hundreds of thousands of forged spam messages posted on the group.
