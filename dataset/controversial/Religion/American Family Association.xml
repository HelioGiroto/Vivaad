==Campaigns and issues==
The AFA has a history of activism by organizing its members in boycotts and letter-writing campaigns aimed at promoting socially conservative values in the United States. The AFA has promoted boycotts of a number of television shows, movies, and businesses that the group considers to have promoted [[indecency]], [[obscenity]], or homosexuality. In addition to promoting activism via mail to AFA members, 3.4 million subscribers receive AFA &quot;Action Alerts&quot; via email.&lt;ref name=mediatrans/&gt;

=== Boycotts ===
The AFA has boycotted companies for various reasons, most often relating to [[Christmas controversy|Christmas controversies]], pornography, support of [[pro-choice]] activism, support of violence or sexual content in entertainment, and support of [[LGBT]] activism, including same-sex partner employee benefits. These organizations include: [[7-Eleven]], [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], [[American Airlines]], [[American Girl (company)|American Girl]], [[Blockbuster Video]], [[Burger King]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Carl's Jr.]], [[Clorox]], [[Comcast]], [[Crest (toothpaste)|Crest]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Hallmark Cards]], [[Kmart]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[S. C. Johnson &amp; Son]], [[Movie Gallery]], [[Microsoft]], MTV, [[Mary Kay Cosmetics|Mary Kay]], [[Nutrisystems Diet|NutriSystem]], [[Old Navy]], [[IKEA]], [[Sears]], [[Pampers]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Tide]], [[Walt Disney Company]], and [[PepsiCo]].  The AFA has criticized the People's Republic of China for its persecution of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Update: CHINA: Executed for Distributing Bibles'' AFA Action Alert May 26, 2005&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''China: Executed for Distributing Bibles'' AFA Action Alert Dec 14, 2004&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Would you go to prison for your faith?''

In 1986, 7-Eleven stopped selling ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazines after a two-year boycott by the AFA.&lt;ref name=liebeck&gt;Liebeck, Laura. &quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_n9_v29/ai_9076835 K mart, Waldenbooks to face AFA pickets]&quot;. ''Discount Store News''. 1990-05-07 Retrieved on July 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the AFA boycotted [[Waldenbooks|WaldenBooks]] in an attempt to persuade the company to stop selling those same magazines. As a result, WaldenBooks launched an advertisement campaign against censorship, asserting [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights. WaldenBooks, [[American Booksellers Association]], the Council for Periodical Distributors Association, the International Periodical Distributors Association, and Duval Bibb Services launched a lawsuit against the AFA in October 1989, under the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) and the [[Florida|Florida State]] RICO Acts, which protect an organization's right to conduct business without harassment or threats.&lt;ref name=liebeck&gt;Cohen, Roger. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDD1431F930A15757C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print With Boycott and Ads, A Battle Over Selling]&quot;.

Christian Leaders for Responsible Television (CLeaR-TV), affiliated with the AFA, has approached sponsors of programs that it considered immoral. In 1989, CLeaR-TV successfully persuaded [[General Mills]], [[Ralston Purina]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Mazda]], and [[Noxell]] to withdraw advertising from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunter|1991|pp=228, 236}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFA also boycotted [[PepsiCo]] that year also for supporting [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], whose video for &quot;[[Like a Prayer]]&quot; Wildmon felt was sacrilegious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,957949,00.html|title=Interview with Rev.

During the summer of 1993 the AFA purchased full-page ads in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' denouncing the sexual and violent content of the upcoming [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] police drama ''[[NYPD Blue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=Police Drama Under Fire for Sex and Violence|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DF133FF931A15755C0A965958260|work=The New York Times|date=June 22, 1993|accessdate=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also urged ABC affiliates not to broadcast the program and citizens to boycott sponsors of ''Blue''. About a quarter of the 225 existing ABC stations followed suit, but such affiliates were mostly in rural areas of the US. The AFA campaign increased hype for the show in larger American media markets, and ''Blue'' became one of the most popular shows of the [[1993–94 United States network television schedule|1993–1994 television season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Streible|first=Daniel G.|title=NYPD Blue|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/nypdblue/nypdblue.htm|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1996, the AFA launched a boycott against [[Walt Disney Company]] when the company began giving benefits to  same-sex employees in domestic partnerships. The AFA has claimed that [[Michael Eisner]], the CEO of The Disney Company,  &quot;was involved in a media group that actively promoted the homosexual agenda&quot; and was pushing the &quot;gay agenda&quot;. The AFA ended the unsuccessful nine-year boycott in spring 2005 after Eisner left the company.&lt;ref name=MSNBCford2&gt;Johnson, Alex&quot;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8119504/ns/business-us_business Christian group suspends Ford boycott]&quot;.

On October 19, 1998, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led by Leslie Katz, wrote a letter to the AFA in response to an advertisement placed in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' by the AFA regarding homosexuality and Christianity. The letter stated:&lt;ref name=AFAvSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/277/277.F3d.1114.00-16415.html|title=AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION, INC.; DONALD WILDMON; KERUSSO MINISTRIES; FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL V.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against gays, lesbians and transgendered people. What happened to [[Matthew Shepard]] is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the same time, the [[San Francisco, California|City and County of San Francisco]] passed two resolutions. Resolution No. 234-99 &quot;calls for the Religious Right to take accountability for the impact of their long-standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians, which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against Mr. Gaither.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;On February 19, 1999, in [[Coosa County, Alabama]], Billy Jack Gaither was beaten to death with an axe handle and his body was burned because he was homosexual.&lt;/ref&gt; and Resolution No. 873-98 was specifically directed at &quot;anti-gay&quot; television advertisements. AFA unsuccessfully challenged these actions as violating the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in ''[[American Family Association v. City and County of San Francisco]]''.&lt;ref name=AFAvSF/&gt;

In 1998, multiple organizations voiced criticism of a series of AFA sponsored full-page newspaper advertisements that promoted religious ministries involved in the [[ex-gay]] movement. In response to the advertisements, the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|Religious Leadership Roundtable]] said the ads employed &quot;language of violence and hatred to denounce other people.&quot; [[IntegrityUSA]] criticized the ads, calling them &quot;evil&quot; disregarding Christian teachings about the &quot;dignity of every human being.&quot; [[DignityUSA]] also criticized the advertisements, which they said were &quot;misleading and destructive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tooley, Mark. &quot;Homosexual Radicals Demonize Religious Beliefs of Opponents&quot;.

In July 2000, the AFA sent out emails and letters calling for [[Coming out|openly gay]] [[Arizona]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives]] member [[Jim Kolbe]] to be barred from speaking at the Republican National Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last= Sumner |first= David |coauthors= William Chambliss |title= The Blackwell companion to criminology, p.312 |publisher= [[Blackwell Publishing]] |year= 2003 |month= October |isbn= 0-631-22092-5 |ref= harv |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFA also said that Kolbe should be arrested when he returned to his home state, as because Kolbe is gay, he was violating an Arizona [[Sodomy law|law that banned sodomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Calls for Arrest of Openly-Gay GOP Convention Speaker Reveal Danger of Sodomy Laws Nationwide, ACLU Says |url= http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/discrim/12294prs20000731.html|date= July 31, 2000|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Equality Mississippi]], a statewide [[LGBT social movements|LGBT civil rights]] organization which has voiced opposition and criticism towards the AFA's activism regarding homosexuality, felt that AFA's action was constituting and encouraging violence towards the [[gay community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jody |last=Renaldo |title=Mississippi Gay Lobby calls for an investigation into the Mississippi based American Family Association and Donald Wildmon. |url=http://www.equalityms.org/newsreleases/afa.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070730034424/http://www.equalityms.org/newsreleases/afa.pdf |archivedate=July 30, 2007 |work=Equality Mississippi originally as Mississippi Gay Lobby |date=August 2, 2000 |accessdate=June 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern Poverty Law Center, through its Teaching Tolerance program, had encouraged schools across the U.S. to hold a &quot;Mix It Up&quot; day in order to encourage children in schools to break up the cliques that tend to dominate children's school lives and to prevent bullying. The program, started 11 years ago, has been held in more than 2,500 schools. But in the autumn of 2012, the AFA falsely branded the project &quot;a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools,&quot; even though the program makes no mention of homosexuality, and urged parents to keep their children home from school on October 30, 2012, and to call their children's schools to protest the event. &quot;I was surprised that they completely lied about what Mix It Up Day is,&quot; Maureen Costello, the director of the center's Teaching Tolerance project, which organizes the program, told The New York Times. &quot;It was a cycnical, fear-mongering tactic.&quot;

Texas]]'', in which the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] struck down Texas's anti-sodomy laws. After that, the Christian right spent millions on advertisements,&lt;ref name=Hall2005/&gt; and on pastor briefings organized by activists such as born-again Christian [[David Lane (activist)|David Lane]].&lt;ref name=Besen2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcnp.com/commentary/national/8923-extremism-flying-beneath-the-radar.html |title=Extremism Flying Beneath The Radar |date=April 6, 2011 |last=Besen |first=Wayne |work=Falls Church News Press |publisher=Falls Church News-Press Online |accessdate=April 22, 2011 |quote=Indeed, the AFA's noxious views were on full display this week, when the group's star radio personality, Bryan Fischer, insulted African Americans.

The statement, whose signatories included House Speaker-Designate John Boehner and the governors of Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia, ran under the headline, 'Start Debating/Stop Hating.' It accused 'elements of the radical Left' of trying to 'shut down informed discussion of policy issues' and decried those who attempt to suppress debate 'through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent’s character.'
