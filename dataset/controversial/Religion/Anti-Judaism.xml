{{Judaism}}

'''Anti-Judaism''' has been called &quot;a total or partial opposition to [[Judaism]]&amp;mdash;and to [[Jews]] as adherents of it&amp;mdash;by persons who accept a competing system of beliefs and practices and consider certain genuine Judaic beliefs and practices as inferior.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir (1971, 383),&lt;sup&gt;[http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;res_dat=xri:paous:&amp;rft_dat=xri:pao:article:d441-1971-002-00-000021]&lt;/sup&gt; cited by Abulafia (1998, part II, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Judaism--based on religious beliefs and practices--is often distinguished from anti-semitism, which is based upon racial or ethnic prejudice.

==Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire==
{{see also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
In Rome and throughout the [[Roman Empire]], religion was an integral part of the civil government, see [[Religion in ancient Rome]]. [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Emperors proclaimed themselves as gods on Earth]], and demanded to be worshiped accordingly.&lt;ref name=lazare63&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; This created religious difficulties for [[Jew]]s and worshipers of [[Mithras]], [[Sabazius]] and [[Early Christians]].&lt;ref name=lazare64&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were prohibited by their [[613 Mitzvot|biblical commandments]] from worshiping any other god than that of the [[Torah]] (see [[Shema]], [[God in Judaism]], [[Idolatry in Judaism]]). 

The ''Crisis under [[Caligula]]'' (37-41) has been proposed as the &quot;first open break between Rome and the Jews&quot;, even though problems were already evident during the [[Census of Quirinius]] in 6 and under [[Sejanus]] (before 31).&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, ISBN 0674397312, ''The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula'', pages 254-256: &quot;The reign of Gaius Caligula (37-41) witnessed the first open break between the Jews and the [[Julio-Claudian]] empire. Until then &amp;mdash; if one accepts [[Sejanus]]' heyday and the trouble caused by the [[Census of Quirinius|census after Archelaus' banishment]] &amp;mdash; there was usually an atmosphere of understanding between the Jews and the empire ... These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re-established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides. ... Caligula ordered that a golden statue of himself be set up in the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]]. ... Only Caligula's death, at the hands of Roman conspirators (41), prevented the outbreak of a Jewish-Roman war that might well have spread to the entire [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[Jewish-Roman wars]] (66-135), [[Hadrian#Hadrian in Judea|Hadrian]] changed the name of [[Iudaea province]] to ''[[Syria Palaestina]]'' and [[Jerusalem in Judaism|Jerusalem]] to ''[[Aelia Capitolina]]'' in an attempt to erase the [[Pre-Roman history of ancient Israel and Judah|historical ties of the Jewish people to the region]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H.H. Ben-Sasson, 1976, page 334&quot;&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, ISBN 0674397312, page 334: &quot;In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria-Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, after 70, Jews and Jewish [[Proselytes]] were only allowed to practice their religion if they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus|Jewish tax]], and after 135 were barred from Jerusalem except for the day of [[Tisha B'Av]].

[[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Flavius Clemens]] was put to death for &quot;living a Jewish life&quot; or &quot;drifting into Jewish ways&quot; in the year 95 CE, which may well have been related to the administration of the Jewish tax under [[Domitian]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 67.14.1–2, 68.1.2; ''History of the Jewish People'', H.H. Ben-Sasson editor, page 322: &quot;...Domitian ordered the execution of Flavius Clemens ... for [[Judaizing]] tendencies...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Empire adopted Christianity as its [[state religion]] with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] on 27 February 380, see [[State church of the Roman Empire]].

==History of Christian anti-Judaism==

===Early Christianity and the Judaizers===
{{See also|List of events in early Christianity|Biblical law in Christianity|Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Antisemitism in early Christianity}}

Christianity commenced its existence in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] as a sect within [[Judaism]], so-called [[Jewish Christianity]]. It was seen as such by the [[early Christian]]s, as well as [[Jew]]s in general. The wider Roman administration most likely would not have understood any distinction. Historians debate whether or not the Roman government distinguished between [[Christianity and Judaism|Christians and Jews]] prior to [[Nerva]]'s modification of the [[Fiscus Judaicus|Jewish Tax]] in 96. From then on, practising Jews paid the tax; Christians did not.&lt;ref&gt;Wylen, Stephen M., ''The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction'', Paulist Press (1995), ISBN 0809136104, Pp 190-192.; Dunn, James D.G., ''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing (1999), ISBN 0802844987, Pp 33-34.; Boatwright, Mary Taliaferro &amp; Gargola, Daniel J &amp; Talbert, Richard John Alexander, ''The Romans: From Village to Empire'', Oxford University Press (2004), ISBN 0195118758, p. 426.;&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity is based on Jewish [[monotheism]], [[Development of the Old Testament canon|scriptures]] (generally the [[Septuagint]] or [[Targum]] translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]]), [[liturgy]], and [[Noahide Law|morality]]. 

The main point of divergence by the Early Christian community from its Jewish roots was the Christian belief that [[Jesus]] was the long awaited [[Messiah]] (see [[Rejection of Jesus]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[McGrath, Alister E.]], ''Christianity: An Introduction'', Blackwell Publishing,(2006), ISBN 1405108991, Page 174: &quot;In effect, they [Jewish Christians] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief &amp;mdash; that Jesus was the Messiah. Unless males were [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]], they could not be [[Salvation|saved]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|15:1}}).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Another point of divergence was the [[Biblical law in Christianity#Historical background|questioning by the Christian community of the continuing applicability of the Law of Moses]] (the [[Torah]]),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''op cit'', p. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Apostolic Decree]] of the [[Apostolic Age]] of Christianity appears to parallel the [[Noahide Law]] of Judaism. The two issues came to be linked in a theological discussion within the Christian community as to whether the coming of the Messiah ([[Ministry of Jesus|First]] or [[Second Coming]]) could or did annul some (see [[Cafeteria Christianity]]) or all (see [[Antinomianism]]) biblical law in what came to be called a [[New Covenant]].

The [[circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy]] was probably the second issue (after the issue of Jesus as messiah) during which the theological argument was conducted in terms of anti-Judaism, with those who argued for the view that biblical law continued to be applicable being labelled &quot;[[Judaizers]]&quot; or &quot;[[Pharisees]]&quot; (e.g. {{bibleverse||Acts|15:5|NIV}}).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Council of Jerusalem]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elshtain&gt;{{cite web

A World Full of Gods. Great Britain: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 CE would lead Christians to &quot;doubt the efficacy of the ancient law&quot;,&lt;ref name=lazare50&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; see also [[Supersessionism]], though [[Ebionism]] would linger on until the [[Christianity in the 5th century|fifth century]]. However, [[Marcion of Sinope]], who [[Marcionism|advocated]] rejecting the entirety of Judaic influence on the Christian faith,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''op cit'', p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; would be [[excommunicate]]d by the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Church in Rome]] in 144 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Adversus Marcionem''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Judaic polemic===
Anti-Judaic works of this period include ''[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/An Answer to the Jews|De Adversus Iudeaos]]'' by [[Tertullian]], ''[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Minucius Felix/The Octavius of Minucius Felix|Octavius]]'' by [[Minucius Felix]], ''[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Cyprian/The Treatises of Cyprian/Three Books of Testimonies Against the Jews|De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate]]''&lt;ref&gt;n.b. source likely means Cyprian's later treatise, ''Three Books of Testimonies Against the Jews'' bound under the title of his [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Cyprian/The Treatises of Cyprian/On the Unity of the Church|first treatise]]; so linked here&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Cyprian of Carthage]], and ''[[Instructiones Adversus Gentium Deos]]'' by [[Lactantius]].&lt;ref name=lazare61&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hypothesis holds that the anti-Judaism of these early [[fathers of the Church]] &quot;were inherited from the Christian tradition of [[Biblical exegesis]]&quot; though a second hypothesis holds that early Christian anti-Judaism was inherited from the pagan world.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''op cit'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor has observed that theological Christian anti-Judaism &quot;emerge[d] from the church's efforts to resolve the contradictions inherent in its simultaneous appropriation and rejection of different elements of the Jewish tradition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''op cit'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern scholars believe that Judaism may have been a [[missionary]] religion in the early centuries of the common era, converting so-called [[proselyte]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

To [[Tarfon]] (d. 135 CE) is attributed a statement about whether scrolls could be left to burn in a fire on the Sabbath.

''op cit''. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin Martyr|Saint Justin Martyr]] (d. 165 CE) wrote the apologetic ''[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/JUSTIN MARTYR/Dialogue with Trypho|Dialogue with Trypho]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/fathers/ANF-01/just/justtryindex.html ''Dialogue of Justin, Philosopher and Martyr, with Trypho, a Jew.'']&lt;/ref&gt; a polemical debate giving the Christian assertions for the Messiahship of Jesus by making use of the [[Old Testament]] contrasted with counter-arguments from a fictionalized version of Tarphon.&lt;ref name=lazare57&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;For centuries defenders of Christ and the enemies of the Jews employed no other method&quot; than these apologetics.&lt;ref name=lazare56/&gt; Apologetics were difficult as gentile converts could not be expected to understand Hebrew; translations of the [[Septuagint]] into [[Greek language|Greek]] prior to [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]] would serve as a flawed basis for such cross-cultural arguments,&lt;ref name=lazare60&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; as demonstrated by [[Origen]]'s difficulties debating Rabbi [[Simlai]].&lt;ref name=lazare60/&gt;

Though Emperor [[Hadrian]] was an &quot;enemy of the [[synagogue]]&quot;, the reign of [[Antoninus Pius|Antonius]] began a period of Roman benevolence toward the Jewish faith.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''op cit'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, imperial hostility toward Christianity continued to crystallize; after [[Decius]], the empire was at war with it.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''op cit'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; An unequal power relationship between Jews and Christians in the context of the [[Greco-Roman]] world &quot;generated anti-Jewish feelings among the early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''op cit'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings of mutual hatred arose, driven in part by Judaism's legality in the [[Roman Empire]]; in [[Antioch]], where the rivalry was most bitter, Jews most likely demanded the execution of [[Polycarp]].&lt;ref name=lazare59&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Constantine to the eighth century===
{{see also|Constantine I and Judaism|State church of the Roman Empire}}

When [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and [[Licinius]] were issuing the [[Edict of Milan]], the influence of Judaism was fading in the [[Land of Israel]] (in favor of [[Christianity]]) and seeing a rebirth outside the Roman Empire in [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=lazare63/&gt; By the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|third century]] the [[Judaizing]] heresies were nearly extinct in Christianity. The [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] ended [[Passover (Christian holiday)|Passover celebrations for Christians]].&lt;ref name=lazare65&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

After his defeat of Licinius in 323 CE, Constantine showed Christians marked political preference. He repressed Jewish proselytism and forbade Jews from [[circumcision|circumcising]] their slaves.&lt;ref name=lazare72&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were barred from [[Jerusalem]] except on the anniversary of the [[Second Temple]]'s destruction ([[Tisha B'Av]]) and then only after paying a special tax (probably the [[Fiscus Judaicus]]) in silver.&lt;ref name=lazare72/&gt; He also promulgated a law which condemned to the stake Jews who persecuted their apostates by stoning.&lt;ref name=lazare73&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] became the [[state religion]] of the Roman Empire (see [[Christendom]]). &quot;No sooner was [the Church] armed than it forgot its most [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|elementary principles]], and directed the secular arm against its enemies.&quot;&lt;ref name=lazare73&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 73-5&lt;/ref&gt;

From the middle of the 5th century, apologetics ceased with [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=lazare66&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; This form of anti-Judaism had proven futile and often served to strengthen Jewish faith.&lt;ref name=lazare66/&gt; With Christianity ascendant in the Empire, the &quot;Fathers, the bishops, and the priest who had to contend against the Jews treated them very badly. [[Hosius of Córdoba|Hosius]] in [[Spain]]; [[Pope Sylvester I]]; [[Eusebius]] of Caesaria call them 'a perverse, dangerous, and criminal sect.'&quot;&lt;ref name=lazare67&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 67-8&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Gregory of Nyssa]] merely reproaches Jews as [[infidel]]s, other teachers are more vehement.&lt;ref name=lazare67/&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] labels the [[Talmudist]]s as falsifiers; [[St. Ambrose]] recycled the earlier [[anti-Christian]] trope and accuses Jews of despising Roman law. [[St. Jerome]] claims Jews were possessed by an impure spirit.&lt;ref name=lazare67/&gt; [[Cyril of Jerusalem|St. Cyril]] of [[Jerusalem]] claimed the [[Nasi|Jewish Patriarchs]], or Nasi, were a low race.&lt;ref name=lazare67/&gt;

All these theological and polemical attacks combined in [[John Chrysostom|St. John Chrysostom]]'s six sermons delivered at [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name=lazare67/&gt; Chrysostom, an [[archbishop of Constantinople]], (d. 407 CE) is very negative in his treatment of Judaism, though much more [[Hyperbole|hyperbolic]] in expression.&lt;ref&gt;Saint John Chrysostom: [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/chrysostom-jews6.html ''Eight Homilies Against the Jews'']&lt;/ref&gt; While St. Justin's ''Dialogue'' is a philosophical treatise, St. Chrysostom's [[homily|homilies]] ''Against the Jews'' are a more informal and rhetorically forceful set of sermons preached in church.  Delivered while Chrysostom was still a [[priest]] in [[Antioch]], his homilies deliver a scathing critique of Jewish religious and civil life, warning Christians not to have any contact with Judaism or the [[synagogue]] and to keep away from the rival religion's festivals.

&quot;There are legions of theologians, historians and writers who write about the Jews the same as Chrysostom: [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], [[Diodorus of Tarsus]], [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], [[Theodoret|Theodoret of Cyprus]], [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], [[Anastasius Sinaita|Athanasius the Sinaite]] among the Greeks; [[Hilarius of Poitiers]], [[Prudentius]], [[Paulus Orosius]], [[Sulpicius Severus]], [[Gennadius of Massilia|Gennadius]], [[Venantius Fortunatus]], [[Isidore of Seville]], among the Latins.&quot;&lt;ref name=lazare71&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 70-1&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 4th to 7th centuries, while the bishops opposed Judaism in writing,  the Empire enacted a variety of civil laws against Jews, such as forbidding them from holding public office, and an oppressive curial tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;lazare73&quot;/&gt; Laws were enacted to harass their free observance of religion; [[Justinian]] went so far as to [[Corpus Juris Civilis|enact a law]] against Jewish daily prayers.&lt;ref name=lazare73/&gt; Both Christians and Jews engaged in recorded mob violence in the waning days of the Empire.&lt;ref name=lazare76&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 76-80&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern wherein Jews were relatively free under pagan rulers until the Christian conversion of the leadership, as seen with Constantine, would be repeated in the lands beyond the now collapsed Roman Empire. [[Sigismund of Burgundy]] enacted laws against Jews after coming to the throne after his conversion in 514;&lt;ref name=lazare87&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; likewise after the conversion of [[Reccared]], king of the [[Visigoths]] in 589, which would have lasting effect when codified by [[Reccesuinth]] in the [[Visigothic Code]] of Law.&lt;ref name=lazare86&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; This code inspired Jews to aid [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] (a Muslim) in his overthrow of [[Roderic]]k, and under the Moors (also Muslims), Jews regained their usurped religious freedoms.&lt;ref name=lazare87/&gt;

===After the 8th century===
Beginning with the [[Christianity in the 8th century|eighth century]], legislation against heresies grew more severe. The Church, once confining itself to only the powers of [[canon law]], increasingly appealed to secular powers. Heretics such as the [[Waldensians|Vaudois]], [[Albigenses]], [[Beghard]]s, [[Apostolic Brothers]], and [[Luciferian]]s were thus &quot;treated with cruelty&quot;&lt;ref name=lazare116&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 116-7&lt;/ref&gt; which culminated in the [[Christianity in the 13th century|13th century]] establishment of the [[Inquisition]] by [[Pope Innocent III]].&lt;ref name=lazare116/&gt; Jews were not ignored by such legislation, either, as they allegedly instigated Christians to [[judaization]]s, either directly or unconsciously, by their existence. They sent forth [[metaphysician]]s such as [[Amaury de Béne]] and [[David de Dinan]]; the [[Pasagian]]s followed [[613 Mitzvot|Mosaic Law]]; the [[Orleans heresy]] was a Jewish heresy; the [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigens]] taught Jewish doctrine as superior to Christian; the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s preached against both the [[Hussites]] and their Jewish supporters, and thus the imperial army sent to advance on [[Jan Ziska]] massacred Jews along the way.&lt;ref name=lazare116/&gt; In Spain, where [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] custom ([[fuero]]s) had granted equal rights to Muslims, Christians, and Jews, [[Gregory XI]] instituted the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to spy on Jews and Moors wherever &quot;by words or writings they urged the  Catholics to embrace their faith&quot;.&lt;ref name=lazare116/&gt;

[[Usury]] became a proximate cause of much anti-Jewish sentiment during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=lazare111&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 111-4&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy and later Poland and Germany, [[John of Capistrano]] stirred up the poor against the usury of the Jews; [[Bernardinus of Feltre]], aided by the practical notion of establishing [[mont-de-piétés]], called for the expulsion of Jews all over Italy and [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and caused the massacre of the Jews at [[Trento|Trent]].&lt;ref name=lazare114&gt;Lazare, Bernard. ''op cit''. p. 114-5&lt;/ref&gt; Kings, nobles, and bishops discouraged this behavior, protecting Jews from the monk [[Radulphe]] in Germany and countering the preachings of Bernardinus in Italy.&lt;ref name=lazare114/&gt; These reactions were from knowing the history of mobs, incited against Jews, continuing attacks against their rich co-religionists.&lt;ref name=lazare114/&gt;  Anti-Judaism was a dynamic in the early Spanish colonies in the Americas, where Europeans used anti-Judaic [[meme]]s and forms of thinking against Native and African peoples, in effect transferring anti-Judaism onto other peoples.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth.  “[http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=div2facpubs   The Jew in the Haitian Imagination: A Popular History of Anti-Judaism and Proto-Racism.

The Church kept to its theological anti-Judaism and, favoring the mighty and rich, was careful not to encourage the passions of the people.&lt;ref name=lazare114/&gt; But while it sometimes interfered on behalf of the Jews when they were the objects of mob fury, it was at the same time fueled the fury by combating Judaism.&lt;ref name=lazare114/&gt;

===In the Reformation===
{{See also|Martin Luther and the Jews}}
[[Martin Luther]] has been accused of antisemitism, primarily in relation to his statements about [[Jew]]s in his book ''[[On the Jews and their Lies]]'', which describes the Jews in extremely harsh terms, excoriating them, and providing detailed recommendation for a [[pogrom]] against them and their permanent oppression and/or expulsion.  According to [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], it &quot;may be termed the first work of modern anti-Semitism, and a giant step forward on the road to [[the Holocaust]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul: ''A History of the Jews'' (1987), p.242&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Roland Bainton]], noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote &quot;One could wish that Luther had died before ever this tract was written. His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bainton, Roland: ''Here I Stand'', (Nashville: Abingdon Press, New American Library, 1983), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], a shaper of [[Reformed Protestant]]ism, took pains to maintain the contradiction, going back to [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Paul of Tarsus]], of Jews being both enemy and friend, writing: &quot;The Jews are not odious to God for the very reason they are Jews; for how could this have happened since they were embellished with so many great gifts....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Contrasted with antisemitism==
{{Main|Religious antisemitism}}

&quot;The question of the relation of traditional Christian anti-Judaism and modern [[antisemitism]]&quot; has &quot;ignite[d] explosive debates&quot; among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Whereas, according to historian [[Gavin Langmuir]], anti-Judaism is concerned with exaggerated accusations against Jews which nonetheless contain a particle of truth or evidence, [[antisemitism]] (which dates back in Europe to the 12th and 13th centuries) reaches beyond unusual general inferences and is concerned with false suppositions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abu77&quot;&gt;Abulafia (1998, part II, 77), referring to Langmuir (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Langmuir considers the labelling of Jews as '[[Christ-killer]]s' is anti-Judaic; accusations of [[well-poisoning]], on the other hand, he regards as antisemitic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abu77&quot;/&gt; In his view, anti-Judaism and antisemitism have existed side by side from the 12th century onwards and have strengthened each other ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Abulafia (1998, part II, 77), citing Langmuir (1971, 383&amp;ndash;389).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] is another example of antisemitism, though it is based in distorted notions of Judaism.

Anti-Judaism is also often distinguished from [[antisemitism]] based upon [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds ([[racial antisemitism]]). &quot;The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion . . . a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.&quot; However, with racial antisemitism, &quot;Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p.314&lt;/ref&gt; 

At several points in the history of Christianity, Chrysostom's and [[Luther and antisemitism|Luther's writings]] have been used to justify antisemitism.

==Islamic anti-Judaism==
A prominent place in the [[Qur'an]]ic polemic against the Jews is given to the conception of the religion of [[Abraham]]. The Qur'an presents Muslims as neither Jews nor Christians but followers of Abraham who was in a physical sense the father of the Jews and the Arabs and lived before the revelation of [[Torah]]. In order to show that the religion practiced by the Jews is not the pure religion of Abraham, the Qur'an mentions the incident of worshiping of the calf, argues that Jews do not believe in part of the revelation given to them, and that their taking of usury shows their worldliness and disobedience of God. Furthermore, the Quran claim they attribute to God what he has not revealed. In his polemic against Judaism, [[Ibn Hazm]] provided a polemical list of what he considered &quot;chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; theological impossibilities (anthropomorphic expressions, stories of fornication and whoredom, and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as lack of reliable transmission ([[tawatur]]) of the text&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, Uzayr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI-Tahrif&quot;&gt;Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, ''Tahrif'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;
