{{Protestantism}}
The '''Protestant Reformation''' was the 16th-century [[schism (religion)|schism]] within [[Western Christianity]] initiated by [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] and other early [[Protestants]]. It was sparked by the 1517 posting of Luther's [[Ninety-Five Theses]]. The efforts of the self-described &quot;reformers&quot;, who objected to (&quot;protested&quot;) the doctrines, rituals, and ecclesiastical structure of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], led to the creation of new national [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches. The Reformation was precipitated by earlier events within [[Europe]], such as the [[Black Death]] and the [[Western Schism]], which eroded people's faith in the Catholic Church and the [[Papacy]] that governed it. This, as well as many other factors, such as the mid 15th-century invention of the [[printing press]], and the fall of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], contributed to the creation of Protestantism.&lt;ref name=&quot;EuanCameron&quot;&gt;Euan Cameron, ''The European Reformation'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church responded with a [[Counter-Reformation]] initiated by the [[Council of Trent]]—the most important ecumenical council since [[Nicaea II]] 800 years earlier&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt; (at the time, there had not been an ecumenical council since [[Lateran IV]] over 300 years earlier, a length only to be matched by the interval between Trent and [[Vatican I]] &lt;ref name=kelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Joseph F|title=The Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church: A History|year=2009|publisher=Michael Glazier/Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, MN|isbn=978-0-8146-5376-0|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;)—and spearheaded by the [[Society of Jesus]]. In general, [[Northern Europe]], with the exception of [[Ireland]] and pockets of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]], turned Protestant. [[Southern Europe]] remained Roman Catholic, while fierce battles which turned into warfare took place in [[central Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EuanCameron&quot; /&gt;

The largest of the new churches were the [[Lutherans]] (mostly in [[Germany]], the [[Baltics]] and [[Scandinavia]]) and the [[Reformed churches]] (mostly in Germany, [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scotland]]). There were many smaller bodies as well. The most common dating of the Protestant Reformation begins in 1517, when Luther published ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', and concludes in 1648 with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] that ended years of [[European wars of religion|European religious wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EuanCameron&quot; /&gt;

==Religious situation in Europe==
[[File:ReformantionWindowSMLC.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Reformation window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina depicts key events in the Protestant Reformation.]]
The Reformation began as an attempt to reform the [[Roman Catholic Church]], by priests who opposed what they perceived as false doctrines and ecclesiastic malpractice—especially the teaching and the sale of [[indulgence]]s or the abuses thereof, and [[simony]], the selling and buying of clerical offices—that the reformers saw as evidence of the [[systemic corruption]] of the Church's Roman [[Catholic Church hierarchy|hierarchy]], which included the [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomsett|first=Michael C.|title=Heresy in the Roman Catholic Church : a history|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-4448-9|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Germany, reformation ideals developed in 1520 when Martin Luther expressed doubts over the legitimacy of indulgences and the ''[[plenitudo potestatis]]'' of the pope. Martin Luther's excommunication on January 3, 1521, from the Catholic Church, was a main cause for the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spalding|first=Martin|title=The History of the Protestant Reformation; In Germany and Switzerland, and in [[England]], [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], the Netherlands, France, and Northern{{what?|date=August 2012}}|year=2010|publisher=General Books LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]]'s spiritual predecessors included [[John Wycliffe]] and [[Jan Hus]], who likewise had attempted to reform the Roman Catholic Church. The Protestant Reformation began on 31 October 1517, in [[Wittenberg]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], where Martin Luther nailed his ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences]]'' to the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Castle Church]], in Wittenberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon-120-121&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120–121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theses debated and criticized the Church and the Pope, but concentrated upon the selling of indulgences and doctrinal policies about [[Purgatory#Protestantism|purgatory]], [[Particular judgment#Reformation concepts|particular judgment]], Catholic devotion to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], &quot;The Mother of God&quot;, the intercession of and devotion to the [[saint]]s, most of the [[sacraments]], the mandatory clerical [[celibacy]], including [[monasticism]], and the authority of the [[Pope]]. In the event, other religious reformers, such as [[Ulrich Zwingli]], soon followed Martin Luther’s example.

The reformers soon disagreed among themselves and divided their movement according to [[doctrine|doctrinal]] differences—first between Luther and Zwingli, later between Luther and [[John Calvin]]—consequently resulting in the establishment of different and rival Protestant Churches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brakke|first=Mary Jo Weaver, David|title=Introduction to Christianity|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, Calif.|isbn=978-0-495-09726-6|pages=92–93|edition=4th ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Christian denomination|denominations]]), such as the [[Lutheran]], the [[Reformed]], the [[Puritans]], and the [[Presbyterian]]. Elsewhere, the religious reformation causes, processes, and effects were different; [[Anglicanism]] arose in England with the [[English Reformation]], and most Protestant denominations derive from the Germanic denominations. The reformers also accelerated the development of the [[Counter-Reformation]] by the [[Catholic Church]].

== History and origins ==
[[File:Reformation.gif|thumb|Reformation and Counter Reformation in Europe. Protestant lands in blue (with gains and the losses due to the Counter Reformation), [[Roman Catholic]] in olive]]
All mainstream Protestants generally date their doctrinal separation from the Roman Catholic Church to the 16th century, occasionally called the &quot;[[Magisterial Reformation]]&quot; because the ruling magistrates supported them; unlike the &quot;[[Radical Reformation]]&quot;, which the State did not support. Older Protestant churches, such as the [[Unitas Fratrum]] ([[Unity of the Brethren]]), [[Moravian Church|Moravian Brethren]] (Bohemian Brethren) date their origins to [[Jan Hus]] in the early 15th century. As it was led by a Bohemian noble majority, and recognized, for a time, by the Basel Compacts, the Hussite Reformation was Europe’s first Magisterial Reformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=European History for Smartphones and Mobile Devices|publisher=MobileReference}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One hundred years later, in Germany the protests erupted simultaneously, whilst under threat of [[Islamic]] [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman wars in Europe|invasion]] [[#Footnotes|¹]], which especially distracted the German princes responsible for military defense.

===Corruption===
Unrest due to the [[Western Schism|Great Schism of Western Christianity]] (1378–1416) excited wars between princes, uprisings among the peasants, and widespread concern over corruption in the church. The first of a series of disruptive and new perspectives came from [[John Wycliffe]] at [[Oxford University]], then from [[Jan Hus]] at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. The Roman Catholic Church officially concluded this debate at the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1417). The conclave condemned Jan Hus, who was executed by burning in spite of a promise of safe-conduct. Wycliffe was posthumously burned as a heretic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=vuES0JdltfcC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Luther: man between God and the Devil]''&quot;. Heiko Augustinus Oberman, Eileen Walliser-Schwarzbart (2006). [[Yale University Press]]. p.54–55. ISBN 0-300-10313-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Constance confirmed and strengthened the traditional medieval conception of church and empire. It did not address the national tensions, or the theological tensions stirred up during the previous century. The council could not prevent [[Schism (religion)|schism]] and the [[Hussite Wars]] in [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Hussites Hussites]&quot;. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sixtus IV]] (1471–1484) established the practice of selling indulgences to be applied to the dead, thereby establishing a new stream of revenue with agents across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;James Patrick, ''Renaissance and Reformation'' (2007) p 1231&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492–1503) was one of the most controversial of the [[Renaissance]] Popes. He fathered seven children, including [[Lucrezia Borgia|Lucrezia]] and [[Cesare Borgia]], by at least two mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6909589.stm Fresco fragment revives Papal scandal]&quot;. BBC News. July 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen years after his death, the corruption of the papacy that Pope Alexander VI exemplified—particularly the sale of indulgences—prompted Luther to write the ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', which he nailed to the door of a church at [[Wittenberg]] in [[Saxony]].

=== 16th century ===
[[File:95Thesen.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Luther's 95 Theses]]
The protests against the corruption emanating from Rome began in earnest when [[Martin Luther]], an Augustinian monk at the university of [[Wittenberg]], called in 1517 for a reopening of the debate on the sale of [[indulgence]]s and the authority to absolve sin and remit one from purgatory. Luther's dissent marked a sudden outbreak of a new and irresistible force of discontent. The Reformers made heavy use of inexpensive pamphlets (using the relatively new [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]) so there was swift movement of both ideas and documents, including ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]''.

Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] under the leadership of [[Ulrich Zwingli]]. These two movements quickly agreed on most issues, but some unresolved differences kept them separate. Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative, and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day [[Anabaptist]]s. Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of mysticism or humanism, sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants, or forming outside of the churches.

After this first stage of the Reformation, following the [[excommunication]] of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope, the work and writings of [[John Calvin]] were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, [[History of Scotland|Scotland]], Hungary, Germany and elsewhere.

The Reformation foundations engaged with [[Augustinians|Augustinianism]]. Both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Augustinianism of the Reformers struggled against [[Pelagianism]], a heresy that they perceived in the Roman Catholic Church of their day. In the course of this religious upheaval, the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524–1525 swept through the [[Bavaria]]n, [[Thuringia]]n and [[Swabia]]n principalities, including the [[Black Company]] of [[Florian Geier]], a knight from [[Giebelstadt]] who joined the peasants in the general outrage against the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Martin Luther, however, condemned the revolt, thus contributing to its eventual defeat. Some 100,000 peasants were killed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448217/Peasants-War Peasants’ War (German History)]&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Luther and Calvin had very similar theological teachings, the relationship between their followers turned quickly to conflict. Frenchman [[Michel de Montaigne]] told a story of a Lutheran pastor who declared over dinner that he would rather hear a hundred masses than take part in one of Calvin's sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=iRBEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA571#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Complete Works of Michel de Montaigne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The journal of Montaigne's travels in Italy by way of Switzerland and Germany in 1580 and 1581; translated by W.G. Waters, John Murray, London, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

The political separation of the [[Church of England]] from Rome under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], beginning in 1529 and completed in 1536, brought England alongside this broad Reformed movement. However, religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe. Reformers in the Church of England accepted Protestant doctrine but the structure of the church ministry remained, and the Church alternated, for centuries, between sympathies for older traditions and radical Protestantism represented by the puritans, progressively forging a compromise between adherence to ancient tradition and Protestantism.  In the Victorian period [[John Henry Newman|John Newman]] reinterpreted this as the establishment of a ''[[via media]]''.

====Magisterial Reformers====
Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli are considered Magisterial Reformers because their reform movements were supported by ruling authorities or &quot;magistrates&quot;. [[Frederick the Wise]] did not support Luther, who was a professor at the university he founded, but he protected him by hiding Luther in [[Wartburg Castle]] in [[Eisenach]]. [[Frederick the Wise]] was a very devout Roman Catholic, but only protected Luther in hopes of obtaining greater political autonomy from the Church. Zwingli and Calvin were supported by the city councils in [[Zurich]] and [[Geneva]].

[[File:Main title page.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Loci Communes (Latin for &quot;Common Points&quot;) were summaries of Luther's theological points and were widely distributed.]]
Since the term &quot;magister&quot; also means &quot;teacher,&quot; the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher. This is made evident in the prominence of Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry. Because of their authority, they were often criticized by [[Radical Reformation|Radical Reformers]] as being too much like the Roman Popes. For example, Radical Reformer [[Andreas Karlstadt]] referred to the Wittenberg theologians as the &quot;new papists&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gstohl&quot;&gt;{{cite web

====Literacy====
[[File:AdamEveParadiseCranach.jpg|thumb|left|Adam &amp; Eve woodcut by Lucas Cranach the Elder]]
The Reformation was a triumph of literacy and the new printing press. Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark&quot;&gt;Mark U. Edwards, Jr., ''Printing, Propaganda, and Martin Luther'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1530 over 10,000 publications are known, with a total of ten million copies. The Reformation was thus a media revolution. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a &quot;good&quot; against &quot;bad&quot; church. From there, it became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clichés, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark&quot; /&gt;  Especially effective were writings in German, including Luther's translation of the Bible, his ''Small Catechism'' for parents teaching their children,  and his ''Larger Catechism,'' for pastors.&lt;ref&gt;See texts at [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language.  Illustrations in the German Bible and in many tracts popularized Luther's ideas. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472–1553), the great painter patronized by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and illustrated Luther's theology for a popular audience. He dramatized Luther's views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther's careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Weimer, &quot;Luther and Cranach on Justification in Word and Image.&quot; ''Lutheran Quarterly'' 2004 18(4): 387-405. Issn: 0024-7499&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Humanism to Protestantism ====

The frustrated reformism of the humanists, ushered in by the [[Renaissance]], contributed to a growing impatience among reformers. [[Erasmus]] and later figures like Martin Luther and Zwingli would emerge from this debate and eventually contribute to another major schism of Christendom. The crisis of theology beginning with [[William of Ockham]] in the 14th century was occurring in conjunction with the new [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] discontent. Since the breakdown of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] foundations of [[scholasticism]], the new [[nominalism]] did not bode well for an institutional church legitimized as an intermediary between man and [[God in Christianity|God]]. New thinking favored the notion that no religious [[doctrine]] can be supported by philosophical arguments, eroding the old alliance between [[reason]] and [[faith]] of the medieval period laid out by [[Thomas Aquinas]].

[[File:Hans Holbein d. J. 047.jpg|thumb|[[Erasmus]]]]

The major individualistic reform movements that revolted against medieval scholasticism and the institutions that underpinned it were [[humanism]], devotionalism, (see for example, the [[Brothers of the Common Life]] and [[Jan Standonck]]) and the [[observantine]] tradition. In [[Germany]], &quot;the modern way&quot; or devotionalism caught on in the universities, requiring a redefinition of God, who was no longer a rational governing principle but an arbitrary, unknowable will that cannot be limited. God was now a ruler, and religion would be more fervent and emotional. Thus, the ensuing revival of Augustinian theology, stating that man cannot be saved by his own efforts but only by the grace of God would erode the legitimacy of the rigid institutions of the church meant to provide a channel for man to do good works and get into heaven. Humanism, however, was more of an educational reform movement with origins in the [[Renaissance]]'s revival of [[Classical education movement|classical learning]] and thought. A revolt against [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] logic, it placed great emphasis on reforming individuals through eloquence as opposed to reason. The European Renaissance laid the foundation for the Northern humanists in its reinforcement of the traditional use of [[Latin]] as the great unifying language of European culture.

The polarization of the scholarly community in Germany over the [[Johannes Reuchlin|Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) affair, attacked by the elite clergy for his study of [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and Jewish texts, brought Luther fully in line with the humanist educational reforms who favored [[academic freedom]]. At the same time, the impact of the Renaissance would soon backfire against traditional Roman Catholicism, ushering in an age of reform and a repudiation of much of medieval Latin tradition. Led by Erasmus, the humanists condemned various forms of corruption within the church, forms of corruption that might not have been any more prevalent than during the medieval zenith of the church. [[Erasmus]] held that true religion was a matter of inward devotion rather than outward symbols of ceremony and ritual. Going back to ancient texts, scriptures, from this viewpoint the greatest culmination of the ancient tradition, are the guides to life. Favoring [[morality|moral]] reforms and de-emphasizing [[didactic literature|didactic]] ritual, Erasmus laid the groundwork for Luther.

Humanism's intellectual [[anti-clericalism]] would profoundly influence Luther. The increasingly well-educated [[middle class|middle]] sectors of Northern Germany, namely the educated community and city dwellers would turn to Luther's rethinking of religion to conceptualize their discontent according to the cultural medium of the era. The great rise of the burghers, the desire to run their new businesses free of institutional barriers or outmoded cultural practices, contributed to the appeal of humanist [[individualism]]. To many, [[pope|papal]] institutions were rigid, especially regarding their views on just price and [[usury]]. In the North, burghers and monarchs were united in their frustration for not paying any [[tax]]es to the nation, but collecting taxes from [[Citizenship|subjects]] and sending the revenues disproportionately to the Pope in [[Italy]].

These trends heightened demands for significant reform and revitalization along with anticlericalism. New thinkers began noticing the divide between the priests and the flock. The clergy, for instance, were not always well-educated. Parish priests often did not know [[Latin]] and rural parishes often did not have great opportunities for theological education for many at the time. Due to its large landholdings and institutional rigidity, a rigidity the excessively large ranks of the clergy contributed to, many [[bishop]]s studied [[law]], not theology, being relegated to the role of property managers trained in administration. While priests emphasized works of religiosity, the respectability of the church began diminishing, especially among well educated urbanites, and especially considering the recent strings of political humiliation, such as the apprehension of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] by [[Philip IV of France]], the &quot;Babylonian Captivity.&quot; the Great Schism, and the failure of conciliar reformism. In a sense, the campaign by [[Pope Leo X]] to raise funds to rebuild [[Saint Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]] was too much of an excess by the secular [[Renaissance]] church, prompting high-pressure indulgences that rendered the clergy establishments even more disliked in the cities.

Luther borrowed from the humanists the sense of individualism, that each man can be his own priest (an attitude likely to find popular support considering the rapid rise of an educated urban middle class in the North), and that the only true authority is the [[Bible]], echoing the reformist zeal of the [[conciliar movement]] and opening up the debate once again on limiting the authority of the Pope. While his ideas called for the sharp redefinition of the dividing lines between the [[laity]] and the clergy, his ideas were still, by this point, reformist in nature. Luther's contention that the human will was incapable of following good, however, resulted in his rift with Erasmus finally distinguishing Lutheran reformism from [[humanism]].

=== Lutheranism adopted by the German princes ===
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|300px|Martin Luther's 1534 bible]]
Luther affirmed a theology of the [[Eucharist]] called [[Real Presence]], a doctrine of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist that affirms the real presence, yet holds that the bread and wine are not &quot;changed&quot; into the body and blood; rather the divine elements adhere &quot;in, with, and under&quot; the earthly elements. He took this understanding of Christ's presence in the Eucharist to be more harmonious with the Church's teaching on the Incarnation. Just as Christ is the union of the fully human and the fully divine (cf. Council of Chalcedon) so too the Eucharist is a union of Bread and Body, Wine and Blood. According to the doctrine of real presence, the substances of the body and the blood of Christ and of the bread and the wine were held to coexist together in the consecrated Host during the communion service. While Luther seemed to maintain the perpetual consecration of the elements, other Lutherans argued that any consecrated bread or wine left over would revert to its former state the moment the service ended. Most Lutherans accept the latter.

[[File:PhilippMelanchthon.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Philipp Melanchthon]], by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. Oil on panel.]]A Lutheran understanding of the Eucharist is distinct from the Reformed doctrine of the Eucharist in that Lutherans affirm a real, physical presence of Christ in the Eucharist (as opposed to either a &quot;spiritual presence&quot; or a &quot;memorial&quot;) and Lutherans affirm that the presence of Christ does not depend on the faith of the recipient; the repentant receive Christ in the Eucharist worthily, the unrepentant who receive the Eucharist risk the wrath of Christ.

Luther, along with his colleague [[Philipp Melanchthon]], emphasized this point in his plea for the Reformation at the ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' in 1529 amid charges of [[heresy]]. But the changes he proposed were of such a fundamental nature that by their own logic they would automatically overthrow the old order; neither the Emperor nor the Roman Church could possibly accept them, as Luther well knew. As was only to be expected, the edict by the [[Diet of Worms]] (1521) prohibited all innovations. Meanwhile, in these efforts to retain the guise of a Roman  Catholic reformer as opposed to a heretical revolutionary, and to appeal to German princes with his religious condemnation of the peasant revolts backed up by the [[Doctrine of the Two Kingdoms]], Luther's growing conservatism would provoke more radical reformers.
{{Lutheranism}}

At a religious conference with the Zwinglians in 1529, Melanchthon joined with Luther in opposing a union with [[Zwingli]]. There would finally be a schism in the reform movement due to Luther's belief in [[real presence]]—the real (as opposed to symbolic) presence of Christ at the Eucharist. His original intention was not schism, but with the ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' of Augsburg (1530) and its rejection of the Lutheran ''Augsburg Confession'', a separate Lutheran church finally emerged. In a sense, Luther would take theology further in its deviation from established Roman Catholic dogma, forcing a rift between the humanist Erasmus and Luther. Similarly, Zwingli would further repudiate ritualism, and break with the increasingly conservative Luther.

Aside from the enclosing of the lower classes, the middle sectors of northern Germany, namely the educated community and city dwellers, would turn to religion to conceptualize their discontent according to the cultural medium of the era. &lt;!-- The great rise of the burghers, the desire to run their new businesses free of institutional barriers or outmoded cultural practices contributed to the appeal of individualism. To many, papal institutions were rigid, especially regarding their views on just price and [[usury]]. In the North, burghers and monarchs were united in their frustration for not paying any taxes to the nation, but collecting taxes from subjects and sending the revenues disproportionately to Italy.--&gt; In northern Europe, Luther appealed to the growing national consciousness of the German states because he denounced the Pope for involvement in politics as well as religion. Moreover, he backed the nobility, which was now justified to crush the Great Peasant Revolt of 1525 and to confiscate church property by Luther's [[Doctrine of the Two Kingdoms]]. This explains the attraction of some territorial princes to Lutheranism, especially its Doctrine of the Two Kingdoms. However, the Elector of Brandenburg, [[Joachim I]], blamed Lutheranism for the revolt and so did others. In Brandenburg, it was only under his successor Joachim II that Lutheranism was established, and the old religion was not formally extinct in Brandenburg until the death of the last Catholic bishop there, [[von Blumenthal#Georg I|Georg von Blumenthal]], who was [[Bishop of Lebus]] and sovereign [[Prince-Bishop of Ratzeburg]].

With the church subordinate to and the agent of civil authority and peasant rebellions condemned on strict religious terms, Lutheranism and German nationalist sentiment were ideally suited to coincide.

Though [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] fought the Reformation, it is no coincidence either that the reign of his nationalistic predecessor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] saw the beginning of the movement. While the centralized states of western Europe had reached accords with the Vatican permitting them to draw on the rich property of the church for government expenditures, enabling them to form state churches that were greatly autonomous of Rome, similar moves on behalf of the Reich were unsuccessful so long as princes and prince bishops fought reforms to drop the pretension of the secular universal

==== Zwingli ====

Parallel to events in Germany, a movement began in the [[Swiss Confederation]] under the leadership of [[Huldrych Zwingli]]. Zwingli was a scholar and preacher who moved to [[Zurich]] - the then leading city state - in 1518, a year after Martin Luther began the Reformation in Germany with his [[95 Theses]]. Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, as the recently introduced [[printing press]] spread ideas rapidly from place to place, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. Although [[Zwinglianism]] does hold uncanny resemblance to Lutheranism (it even had its own equivalent of the [[95 Theses]], called the [[67 Conclusions]]) historians have been unable to prove that Zwingli had any contact with Luther's publications before 1520, and Zwingli himself maintained that he had prevented himself from reading them. The German Prince [[Philip of Hesse]] saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther, seeing strength in a united Protestant front. A meeting was held in his castle in 1529, now known as the [[Colloquy of Marburg]], which has become infamous for its complete failure. The two men could not come to any agreement due to their disputation over one key doctrine. Although Luther preached [[consubstantiation]] in the [[Eucharist]] over [[transubstantiation]], he believed in the spiritual presence of Christ at the mass. Zwingli believed that the mass was only representative and memorial - Christ was not present. Luther became so angry that he famously carved into the meeting table '[[Hoc Est Corpus Meum]]' - a Biblical quotation from the [[Last Supper]] meaning 'this is my body'. Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative, and moved independently toward more radical positions, some of which survive among modern day [[Anabaptist]]s. One famous incident illustrating this was when radical Zwinglians fried and ate sausages during Lent in Zurich city square by way of protest against the Church teaching of [[good works]].  Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of mysticism or humanism ([[cf.]] [[Erasmus]]), sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants, or forming outside of the churches.

==== John Calvin ====
{{main|John Calvin}}

Following the [[excommunication]] of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope, the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland, [[Scotland]], Hungary, Germany and elsewhere. After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the Berne reformer Guillaume (William) Farel, Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the 'fallen city' of Geneva. His 'Ordinances' of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory in order to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. These missionaries dispersed Calvinism widely, and formed the French Huguenots in Calvin's own lifetime, as well as causing the conversion of Scotland under the leadership of the cantankerous John Knox in 1560. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1564 and reached as far as Constantinople by the start of the 17th century.   
The Reformation foundations engaged with [[Augustinians|Augustinianism]]. Both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Augustinianism of the Reformers struggled against [[Pelagianism]], a heresy that they perceived in the Roman Catholic Church of their day. Ironically, even though both Luther and Calvin had very similar theological teachings, the relationship between Lutherans and Calvinists evolved into one of conflict.

=== Scandinavia ===

All of [[Scandinavia]] ultimately adopted Lutheranism over the course of the 16th century, as the monarchs of [[Denmark]] (who also ruled [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and [[Sweden]] (who also ruled [[Finland]]) converted to that faith.

In Sweden, the Reformation was spearheaded by [[Gustav Vasa]], elected king in 1523. Friction with the pope over the latter's interference in Swedish ecclesiastical affairs led to the discontinuance of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy from 1523.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert-12&quot;&gt;[http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html Chapter 12 The Reformation In Germany And Scandinavia], Renaissance and Reformation by William Gilbert.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, at the Diet of Västerås, the king succeeded in forcing the diet to accept his dominion over the national church. The king was given possession of all church property, church appointments required royal approval, the clergy were subject to the civil law, and the &quot;pure Word of God&quot; was to be preached in the churches and taught in the schools—effectively granting official sanction to Lutheran ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert-12&quot; /&gt;

Under the reign of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] (1523–33), Denmark remained officially Roman Catholic. But though Frederick initially pledged to persecute Lutherans, he soon adopted a policy of protecting Lutheran preachers and reformers, of whom the most famous was [[Hans Tausen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert-12&quot; /&gt; During his reign, Lutheranism made significant inroads among the Danish population. Frederick's son, Christian, was openly Lutheran, which prevented his election to the throne upon his father's death. In 1536, the authority of the Roman Catholic bishops was terminated by national assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldrbarry.net/heidel/scanref.pdf|title=The Scandinavian Reformers|accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, following his victory in the [[Count's War]], he became king as [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] and continued the [[Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein|reformation of the state church]] with assistance of [[Johannes Bugenhagen]].

=== England ===
{{main|English Reformation}}

[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], Queen of England and Ireland.]]

==== Church of England ====

The separation of the [[Church of England]] (or Anglican Church) from Rome under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], beginning in 1529 and completed in 1537, brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement; however, religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe. Reformers in the Church of England alternated, for centuries, between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing into a tradition considered a middle way (''[[via media]]'') between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions.

The [[English Reformation]] followed a different course from the Reformation in continental Europe. There had long been a strong strain of anti-clericalism and England had already given rise to the [[Lollard]] movement of [[John Wycliffe]], which played an important part in inspiring the [[Hussite]]s in [[Bohemia]]. Lollardy was suppressed and became an underground movement so the extent of its influence in the 1520s is difficult to assess. The different character of the English Reformation came rather from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII.

Henry had once been a sincere Roman Catholic and had even authored a book strongly criticizing Luther, but he later found it expedient and profitable to break with the Papacy. His wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], bore him only a single child that survived infancy, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. As England had recently gone through a lengthy dynastic conflict (''see [[Wars of the Roses]]''), Henry feared that his lack of a male heir might jeopardize his descendants' claim to the throne. However, Pope [[Clement VII]], concentrating more on Charles V's sack of Rome, denied his request for an annulment. Had Clement granted the annulment and therefore admitted that his predecessor, [[Julius II]], had erred, Clement would have given support to the Lutheran assertion that Popes replaced their own judgement for the will of God.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome. In 1534, the [[Act of Supremacy]] made Henry the [[Supreme Head]] of the Church of England. Between 1535 and 1540, under [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], the policy known as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] was put into effect. The veneration of some [[saint]]s, certain pilgrimages and some pilgrim shrines were also attacked. Huge amounts of church land and property passed into the hands of the Crown and ultimately into those of the nobility and gentry. The vested interest thus created made for a powerful force in support of the dissolutions.

There were some notable opponents to the [[Henrician Reformation]], such as [[St. Thomas More]] and Bishop [[John Fisher]], who were executed for their opposition. There was also a growing party of reformers who were imbued with the Zwinglian and Calvinistic doctrines now current on the Continent. When Henry died he was succeeded by his Protestant son [[Edward VI]], who, through his empowered councillors (with the King being only nine years old at his succession and not yet sixteen at his death) the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Northumberland, ordered the destruction of images in churches, and the closing of the [[chantry|chantries]]. Under Edward VI the reform of the [[Church of England]] was established unequivocally in doctrinal terms.

Yet, at a popular level, religion in England was still in a state of flux. Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary]] 1553–1558, a loose consensus developed during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], though this point is one of considerable debate among historians. Yet it is this &quot;[[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]&quot; which largely formed [[Anglicanism]] into a distinctive church tradition. The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme [[Calvinism]] on the one hand and Roman Catholicism on the other, but compared to the bloody and chaotic state of affairs in contemporary France, it was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.

==== Puritan movement ====
{{main|Puritan|English Civil War}}

The success of the [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritan]] party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarized the [[Elizabethan Age]], although it was not until the40s that England underwent religious strife comparable to what its neighbours had suffered some generations before.

The early ''Puritan movement'' (late 16th–17th centuries) was [[Reformed]] or [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and was a movement for reform in the [[Church of England]]. Its origins lay in the discontent with the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially [[Geneva]]. The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as [[idolatry|idolatrous]] (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as &quot;[[Papist|popish]] pomp and rags&quot;. (See [[Vestments controversy]].) They also objected to ecclesiastical courts. They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.

The later Puritan movement were often referred to as [[dissenters]] and [[nonconformist]]s and eventually led to the formation of various [[reformed]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]].

The most famous and well-known emigration to [[United States|America]] was the migration of the Puritan separatists from the Anglican Church of England, who fled first to [[Holland]], and then later to America, to establish the English colony of [[Massachusetts]] in [[New England]], which later became one of the original [[United States]].

These Puritan separatists were also known as &quot;the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]]&quot;. After establishing a colony at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] (which became part of the colony of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts]]) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the [[King of England]] that legitimized their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of [[mercantilism]]. This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Roman Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and [[economic freedom]], to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity. The Pilgrims of [[New England]] disapproved of [[Christmas]] and celebration was outlawed in [[Boston]] from 1659 to 1681. The ban was revoked in 1681 by [[Sir Edmund Andros]], who also revoked a Puritan ban against festivities on Saturday night. Despite the removal of the ban, it wouldn't be until the middle of the 19th century that Christmas would become a popular holiday in the Boston region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Danko|first=C|title=Once Upon A Time, When Christmas Was Banned...|url=http://www.apuritansmind.com/puritan-worship/christmas-and-the-regulative-principle/once-upon-a-time-when-christmas-was-banned-by-c-danko/|work=A Puritan's mind|accessdate=1 October 2012|quote=In fact, it wasn’t until the mid-1800s that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism, which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe, to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the native [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], and to Christianize the peoples of the [[Americas]].

=== Scotland ===
{{main|Scottish Reformation}}
{{see also|John Knox}}
[[File:John Knox preaching.JPG|thumb|Knox preaching. Detail from a stained glass window in [[St. Giles' Cathedral|St. Giles]], Edinburgh]]
The Reformation in Scotland's case culminated ecclesiastically in the establishment of a church along [[Reformed theology|reformed]] lines, and politically in the triumph of [[England|English]] influence over that of [[France]]. [[John Knox]] is regarded as the leader of the Scottish reformation

The [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] of 1560 repudiated the pope's authority by the [[Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560]], forbade the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and approved a [[Protestant]] [[Confession of Faith]]. It was made possible by a revolution against [[France|French]] hegemony under the regime of the [[regent]] [[Mary of Guise]], who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (then also [[Queen consort|Queen]] of France).

The Scottish reformation decisively shaped the [[Church of Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 1, of the [[Articles Declaratory of the Constitution of the Church of Scotland]] 1921 states 'The Church of Scotland adheres to the Scottish reformation'.&lt;/ref&gt; and, through it, all other [[Presbyterian]] churches worldwide.

A spiritual revival also broke out among Roman Catholics soon after Martin Luther's actions, and led to the [[Covenanter|Scottish Covenanters' movement]], the precursor to [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Presbyterianism]]. This movement spread, and greatly influenced the formation of [[Puritan]]ism among the [[Anglican Church]] in [[England]]. The Scottish covenanters were persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church. This persecution by the Catholics drove some of the Protestant covenanter leadership out of Scotland, and into [[France]] and later, [[Switzerland]].

=== France ===
{{main|Huguenot|Reformed Church of France|French Wars of Religion}}
[[File:Cardinal Richelieu (Champaigne).jpg|thumb|170px|Although a Roman Catholic clergyman himself, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] allied France with Protestant states.]]
Protestantism also spread into France, where the Protestants were [[nickname]]d ''[[Huguenots]]'', and this eventually led to decades of civil warfare.

Though he was not personally interested in religious reform, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515–47) initially maintained an attitude of tolerance, arising from his interest in the [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] movement. This changed in 1534 with the [[Affair of the Placards]]. In this act, Protestants denounced the Catholic [[Catholic Mass|Mass]]] in placards that appeared across France, even reaching the royal apartments. The issue of religious faith having been thrown into the arena of politics, Francis was prompted to view the movement as a threat to the kingdom's stability. This led to the first major phase of anti-Protestant persecution in France, in which the ''[[Chambre Ardente]]'' (&quot;Burning Chamber&quot;) was established within the [[Parlement of Paris]] to deal with the rise in prosecutions for heresy. Several thousand French Protestants fled the country during this time, most notably [[John Calvin]], who settled in [[Geneva]].

Calvin continued to take an interest in the religious affairs of his native land and, from his base in Geneva, beyond the reach of the French king, regularly trained pastors to lead congregations in France. Despite heavy persecution by [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], the [[Reformed Church of France]], largely [[Calvinist]] in direction, made steady progress across large sections of the nation, in the urban [[bourgeoisie]] and parts of the [[aristocracy]], appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment.
[[File:Francois Dubois 001.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Bartholomew]]'s Day massacre, Painting by [[François Dubois]] (born about 1529, Amiens, Picardy)]]
French Protestantism, though its appeal increased under persecution, came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the noble conversions of the 1550s. This had the effect of creating the preconditions for a series of destructive and intermittent conflicts, known as the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. The civil wars were helped along by the sudden death of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] in 1559, which began a prolonged period of weakness for the French crown. [[Wiktionary:atrocity|Atrocity]] and outrage became the defining characteristic of the time, illustrated at its most intense in the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.eckerd.edu/~oberhot/paris-siege-stbarth.htm Paris and the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre: August 24, 1572]&lt;/ref&gt; The wars only concluded when [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], himself a former Huguenot, issued the [[Edict of Nantes]], promising official toleration of the Protestant minority, but under highly restricted conditions. Roman Catholicism remained the official state religion, and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century, culminating in Louis XIV's [[Edict of Fontainebleau]]—which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Roman Catholicism the sole legal religion of France. In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg]] declared the [[Edict of Potsdam]], giving free passage to Huguenot refugees, and tax-free status to them for ten years.

In the late 17th century, many Huguenots fled to England, the Netherlands, Prussia, Switzerland, and the English and Dutch overseas colonies. A significant community in France remained in the [[Cévennes]] region. A separate Protestant community, of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith, existed in the newly conquered province of [[Alsace]], its status not affected by the Edict of Fontainebleau.

=== Netherlands ===
{{main|History of religion in the Netherlands}}

The Reformation in the Netherlands, unlike in many other countries, was not initiated by the rulers of the [[Seventeen Provinces]], but instead by multiple popular movements, which in turn were bolstered by the arrival of Protestant refugees from other parts of the continent. While the [[Anabaptist]] movement enjoyed popularity in the region in the early decades of the Reformation, Calvinism, in the form of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], became the dominant Protestant faith in the country from the 1560s onward.

Harsh persecution of Protestants by the Spanish government of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] contributed to a desire for independence in the provinces, which led to the [[Eighty Years' War]] and eventually, the separation of the largely Protestant [[Dutch Republic]] from the Roman Catholic-dominated [[Southern Netherlands]] (present-day [[Belgium]]).

=== Hungary ===

Much of the population of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] adopted Protestantism during the 16th century. After the 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]] the Hungarian people were disillusioned by the ability of the government to protect them and turned to the faith they felt would infuse them with the strength necessary to resist the invader.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} They found this in the teaching of the Protestant reformers such as [[Martin Luther]]. The spread of Protestantism in the country was aided by its large ethnic German minority, which could understand and translate the [[Martin Luther (resources)|writings of Martin Luther]]. While Lutheranism gained a foothold among the German- and Slovak-speaking populations, [[Calvinism]] became widely accepted among ethnic Hungarians.&lt;ref&gt;Revesz, Imre, History of the Hungarian Reformed Church, Knight, George A.F. ed., [[Hungarian Reformed Federation of America]] (Washington, D.C.: 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the more independent northwest the rulers and priests, protected now by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], which had taken the field to fight the Turks, defended the old Roman Catholic faith. They dragged the Protestants to prison and the stake wherever they could. Such strong measures only fanned the flames of protest, however.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Leaders of the Protestants included Matthias Biro Devai, Michael Sztarai, and Stephen Kis Szegedi.

Protestants likely formed a majority of Hungary's population at the close of the 16th century, but [[Counter-Reformation]] efforts in the 17th century reconverted a majority of the kingdom to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldrbarry.net/heidel/eeurorsc.htm The Forgotten Reformations in Eastern Europe – Resources&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A significant Protestant minority remained, most of it adhering to the Calvinist faith.

In 1558 the [[Transylvania]]n [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of [[Turda]] declared free practice of both the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] religions, but prohibited [[Calvinism]]. Ten years later, in 1568, the Diet extended this freedom, declaring that &quot;It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion&quot;. Four religions ([[Unitarism]] became official in 1583, following the faith of the only Unitarian King [[John II Sigismund Zápolya]] 1541-1571) were declared as accepted (recepta) religions, while [[Orthodox Christianity]] was &quot;tolerated&quot; (though the building of stone Orthodox churches was forbidden).
During the [[Thirty Years' War]], Royal (Habsburg) Hungary joined the Roman Catholic side, until Transylvania joined the Protestant side.

There were a series of other successful and unsuccessful anti-Habsburg (requiring equal rights and freedom for all Christian religions) uprisings between 1604 and 1711; the uprisings were usually organized from Transylvania. The constrained Habsburg Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to Roman Catholicism.

===Ireland===
{{main|Reformation in Ireland}}
The Reformation in Ireland was a movement for the reform of religious life and institutions that was introduced into Ireland by the English administration at the behest of King Henry VIII of England. His desire for an annulment of his marriage was known as the [[Henry VIII#5 The King's Great Matter: 1525–1533|King's Great Matter]]. Ultimately [[Pope Clement VII]] refused the petition; consequently it became necessary for the King to assert his lordship over the Roman Catholic Church in his realm in order to give legal effect to his wishes.  The [[English Parliament]] confirmed the King's supremacy over the Church in the Kingdom of England. This challenge to [[Papal supremacy]] resulted in a breach with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1541, the [[Irish Parliament]] had agreed to the change in status of the country from that of a [[Lordship of Ireland|Lordship]] to that of [[Kingdom of Ireland]].

Unlike similar movements for religious reform on the continent of Europe, the various phases of the English Reformation as it developed in Ireland were largely driven by changes in government policy, to which public opinion in England gradually accommodated itself. However, a number of factors complicated the adoption of the religious innovations in Ireland; the majority of the population there adhered to the Roman Catholic Church.

=== Italy ===
{{main|Reformation in Italy}}
The Reformation spread to the [[Italy|Italian states]] in the 1520s, and quickly collapsed at the beginning of the 17th century. Its development was hindered by the Inquisition and also popular disdain.&lt;ref name=riforma1&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.riforma.net/storia/storia41-riformainitalia.htm La Riforma in Italia] (accessed 21.06.2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the Reformation exerted almost no lasting influence, except for strengthening the Roman Catholic Church, unlike the essential impact it had on other European countries ([[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[Bohemia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Transylvania]] among others).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Many Italians were outstanding activists of the European Reformation, mainly in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (e.g. [[Giorgio Biandrata]], [[Bernardino Ochino]], [[Giovanni Alciato]], [[Giovanni Battista Cetis]], [[Fausto Sozzini]], [[Francesco Stancaro]] and [[Giovanni Valentino Gentile]]) who propagated [[Nontrinitarianism]] there and were chief instigators of the movement of [[Polish Brethren]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 1532 the [[Waldensians]] adhered to the Reformation, adopting the Calvinist theology. So, their [[Waldensian Church|Church]], survived in the [[Western Alps]] through many persecutions, has been for centuries the only Protestant Church in Italy.

In Italy the Biblical Unitarian Movement powered by the ideas of Sozzini and others is represented today by the churches associated with the [[Christian Church in Italy]]. {{Citation needed| date=July 2012}}

=== Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth ===
In the first half of the 16th century, the enormous [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was a country of many creeds, but Roman Catholic Church remained the dominating religion. Reformation reached Poland in the 1520s, and quickly gained popularity among mostly German-speaking inhabitants of such major cities, as [[Gdańsk]], [[Toruń]] and [[Elbląg]]. In [[Koenigsberg]], in 1530, Polish-language edition of [[Luther's Small Catechism]] was published. The [[Duchy of Prussia]], which was a Polish [[fief]], emerged as key center of the movement, with numerous publishing houses issuing not only Bibles, but also catechisms, in German, Polish and Lithuanian.

[[Lutheranism]] gained popularity in northern part of the country, while [[Calvinism]] caught the interest of [[szlachta]], mainly in [[Lesser Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].  Several publishing houses were opened in Lesser Poland in mid-16th century, in such locations, as [[Słomniki]] and [[Raków, Kielce County|Raków]]. At that time, [[Mennonite]]s and [[Unity of the Brethren|Czech Brothers]] came to Poland, with the latter ones settling mostly in [[Greater Poland]], around [[Leszno]]. In 1565, [[Polish Brethren]] appeared as yet another reformation movement.

The 16th century Commonwealth was unique in Europe, because of widespread tolerance, confirmed by the [[Warsaw Confederation]]. In 1563, the [[Brest Bible]] was published (see also [[Bible translations into Polish]]). The period of tolerance ended during the reign of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], who was under strong influence of [[Piotr Skarga]] and other [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. After the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]], and other wars of the mid-17th century, in which all enemies of Poland were either Protestant or Orthodox Christians, the attitude of Poles changed. [[Counter-Reformation]] prevailed, in 1658 Polish Brethren were forced to leave the country, and in 1666, the [[Sejm]] banned [[apostasy]] from Catholicism to any other religion, under punishment of death. Finally, in 1717, the [[Silent Sejm]] banned non-Catholics from becoming deputies of the Parliament.

Among most important Protestants of the Commonwealth, there are such names, as [[Mikołaj Rej]], [[Marcin Czechowic]], [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] and [[Symon Budny]].

[[Primož Trubar]] was the key figure of the Protestant Church of the [[Slovene Lands]], as he was its founder and its first superintendent. In 1547 he was expelled from [[Ljubljana]]. While a Protestant preacher in [[Rothenburg, Bavaria|Rothenburg]], Germany, he wrote first two books in Slovene, ''[[Katekizem|Catechismus]]'' and ''[[Abecedarium (Trubar)|Abecedarium]]'', which were published in 1550 in [[Tübingen]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primus-truber.de/primus-truber/werke/&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, 8 June is commemorated in Slovenia as the [[Primož Trubar Day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;STA Trubar Day&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&amp;t=0&amp;id=1524945 |title=Slovenia Gets Primoz Trubar Day |publisher=Slovenia Press Agency |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is notable for consolidating the [[Slovene language]] and is considered to be the key figure of Slovenian cultural history and in many aspects a major Slovene historical personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voglar I&quot;&gt;{{cite article |url=http://www.locutio.si/index.php?no=42&amp;clanek=990 |title=Primož Trubar v enciklopedijah in leksikonih I |language=Slovene |trans_title=Primož Trubar in Encyclopedias and Lexicons I |journal=Locutio |volume=11 |issue=42 |date=30 May 2008 |first=Dušan |last=Voglar |accessdate=7 February 2011 |publisher=Maribor Literary Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Father&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=s&amp;id=1246035&amp;pr=1 |title=Trubar Year Dedicated to Father of Slovenian Written Word (feature) |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformation led to a [[European wars of religion|series of religious wars]] that culminated in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), which devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 24.9 and 40% of its population.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics]&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1618 to 1648 the Roman Catholic [[House of Habsburg]] and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany, supported at various times by [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[France]]. The Habsburgs, who ruled [[Spain]], [[Austria]], the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and much of [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], were staunch defenders of the Roman Catholic Church. Some historians believe that the era of the Reformation came to a close when Roman Catholic France allied itself, first in secret and later on the battlefields, with Protestant states against the Habsburg dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon-120-121&quot; /&gt; For the first time since the days of Luther, political and national convictions again outweighed religious convictions in Europe.

The main tenets of the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the Thirty Years' War, were:

* All parties would now recognize the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and now Calvinism (the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'')&lt;ref name=&quot;westphal&quot;&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/westphal.htm The Avalon Project: Treaty of Westphalia]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Christians living in principalities where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.&lt;ref name=&quot;westphal&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Europe 1648 westphal 1884.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Map of Europe, 1648]]
The treaty also effectively ended the Pope's pan-European political power. Fully aware of the loss, [[Pope Innocent X]] declared the treaty &quot;null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times.&quot; European sovereigns, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon-120-121&quot; /&gt;

In ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/08/weekinreview/08FERG.html Why America Outpaces Europe (Clue: The God Factor)]&quot;. The New York Times. June 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]] first suggested that cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s could affect economic success, arguing that the Protestant Reformation led to values that drove people toward worldly achievements, a [[Protestant work ethic|hard work ethic]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism]&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; and saving to accumulate wealth for [[investment]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/479867/Protestant-ethic Protestant ethic (sociology)]&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant groups) effectively forbade wastefully using hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries a sin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o1102.htm Max Weber: The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
