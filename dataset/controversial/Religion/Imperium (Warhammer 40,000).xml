The '''Imperium of Man''' is a [[galactic empire]] in the far-future [[fictional universe]] created by [[Games Workshop]] as the [[Fluff (fiction)|background]] for its ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' series of novels and games. The Imperium rules over almost all of humanity and spans over a million worlds.

== Background ==
The Imperium is depicted as a loose empire, ruling over a million worlds, with a total population presumably in the quadrillions. It is united chiefly through religious fanaticism and threats of brutal disciplinary force. The Imperium claims dominion over all humanity and does not recognize other governments, whether human or [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]. According to the Imperium, it is humanity's &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; to rule the [[Milky Way]] alone, and therefore all aliens must be subjugated or destroyed. In the 41st millennium, the Imperium teeters on the verge of collapse due to a combination of war, technological and spiritual stagnation, and bureaucratic inefficiency. 

=={{anchor|eom}} Emperor of Mankind==
The founder of the Imperium, an enigmatic and mysterious persona known only as &quot;the Emperor of Mankind,&quot; is an [[immortal]] of immeasurable [[psychic]] power. Though the Emperor is the nominal head of state, in practice the highest tier of command is the High Lords of Terra, based on [[Earth]], who have ruled for ten millennia in the Emperor's name.

The Emperor does not actually participate in affairs of state for medical reasons. At the end of the [[Horus Heresy]] 10,000 years ago he was critically injured in battle and never recovered. Since then he survives on life support in a nearly unresponsive state. What little consciousness he has left is devoted to projecting a psychic beacon, the {{em|Astronomican,}} to help human starships navigate the {{em|Warp}} in a form of [[faster than light]] travel. From time to time, he psychically communicates vague visions of the future that trained [[psyker]]s can interpret through special tarot cards, but he cannot explicitly communicate his will.

==Stagnant society==
Imperial society is characterized by [[religious intolerance]], [[superstition]], [[xenophobia]], [[militarism]], and [[antiscience]]. Critical thinking is considered a waste of time. Ignorance of anything beyond one's place in society is common. Unquestioning obedience to authority is a virtue. The {{em|Age of the Imperium}} is not an age of reason but an age of superstition and ignorance.

==Calcified technology==
Throughout the Imperium, science has stopped. All technological knowledge is controlled by the Adeptus Mechanicus, a [[religious order]] that treats technology as a form of magic and deems scientific thinking [[Heresy|heretical]].

Mechanicus tech-priests build and maintain almost all of the Imperium's advanced technology, but they understand little of its workings and oppose any attempts to study and improve upon it. They blindly follow ancient instruction manuals as these designs are not considered the product of human inventiveness, but are revelations of a being known as &quot;the Machine God.&quot; The Mechanicus believes that in pre-Imperium days, the Machine God gifted humanity with all the knowledge there is to know. Accordingly, they believe every machine is inhabited by a &quot;machine spirit&quot; that must be appeased through proper rites, or else the device will malfunction. These rites are as likely to involve incense and prayer as they are to involve lubricants, {{em|cogitator}} (computer) repairs, or pressing buttons.

The Mechanicus refuses to innovate on the set designs, viewing mortal modifications as [[sacrilegious]]. It considers only the ancient forgotten knowledge to be pure, and regularly sends archaeologists on expeditions for ancient blueprints{{spnd}} such rare discoveries are the only occasions when Imperium technology may progress. The Imperium's most powerful war machines and ships are often ancient devices which the tech-priests do not know how to replicate, only maintain. Alien technology is viewed as corrupt, and the Mechanicus refuses to reverse-engineer and redistribute captured devices, even when such technology outclasses the Imperium's.

As a result of these superstitions, Imperium technology has progressed very little since the {{em|Great Crusade,}} over ten millennia prior. Knowledge proliferates so slowly that many Imperial worlds remain primitive, and many are in fact regressing.

==Religious extremism==
The Imperium promotes a worship of the Emperor as humankind's only true god and rightful master. He is the savior, the only one who can protect Humanity from the dangers of the cosmos. However, this was not so before the Emperor was put in life support. Before the Horus Heresy, the Emperor had imposed and promulgated the secular [[rationalist]] {{em|Imperial Truth}} and set out on a galaxy-wide Great Crusade of Enlightenment, to free humanity from the shackles of superstition and religion, while specifically forbidding worship of himself as divine. It is unclear exactly when and how the worship of the Emperor as god became common practice.

All human-inhabited worlds must be brought under the Imperium's control and all other religions must be expunged. The [[state religion]] promotes the idea that unquestioning obedience and self-sacrifice is the best way to honor the Emperor. It teaches that mutants (with a few exceptions) are vile perversions of the holy human form, and thus they are subject to the worst oppression. Rogue psykers (&quot;witches&quot;) are harbingers of doom. Heresy is the worst crime of all, and those judged as heretics are stripped of all rights and punished in the most horrific fashion.

Religion is a central theme in all ''Warhammer{{nbsp}}40,000'' fiction. Most human protagonists, from warrior-monk [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] to Witch Hunters of the [[Inquisition (Warhammer 40,000)|Inquisition]], are fanatical worshipers of the God-Emperor.

== Cruel regime ==
The Imperium's methods for enforcing order and discipline are exceedingly brutal. In source material it is described as &quot;the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable&quot;. The Inquisition makes liberal use of torture, and it cares more about crushing the guilty than protecting the innocent, thus many innocents are killed in their witch-hunts. Witches and heretics are publicly flogged or burned at the stake. [[Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army)|Imperial Guard]] units often have [[Political officer (military)|political officer]]s ({{em|Imperial Commissars}}) attached to them, who have the authority to execute out-of-hand any soldier who displays cowardice or disobedience. Occasionally, the Imperium resorts to destroying entire worlds with [[weapons of mass destruction]] in order to suppress heresy, rebellion, or alien encroachment.
