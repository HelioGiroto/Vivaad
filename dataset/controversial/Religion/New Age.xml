The '''New Age movement''' is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[spirituality|spiritual]] movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as &quot;drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] traditions and infusing them with influences from [[self-help]] and motivational [[psychology]], [[holistic health]], [[parapsychology]], consciousness research and [[quantum physics]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It aims to create &quot;a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas&quot; that is inclusive and [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Drury 2004 8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds to &quot;a holistic worldview&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasising that the [[dialectical monism|Mind, Body and Spirit]] are interrelated&lt;ref name=&quot;JGMelton&quot;&gt;Melton, J.

The origins of the movement can be found in Medieval [[astrology]] and [[alchemy]], such as the writings of [[Paracelsus]], in Renaissance interests in [[Hermeticism]], in 18th century [[mysticism]], such as that of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], and in beliefs in [[animal magnetism]] espoused by [[Franz Mesmer]]. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, authors such as [[Godfrey Higgins]] and the esotericists [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Helena Blavatsky]], and [[George Gurdjieff]] articulated specific histories, cosmologies, and some of the basic philosophical principles that would influence the movement. It experienced a revival as a result of the work of individuals such as [[Alice Bailey]] and organizations such as the [[Theosophical Society]]. It gained further momentum in the 1960s, taking influence from [[metaphysics]], [[perennial philosophy]], self-help [[psychology]], and the various Indian gurus who visited the West during that decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1970s, it developed a social and political component.&lt;ref name=Mayne /&gt;

The New Age movement includes elements of older spiritual and religious traditions ranging from [[monotheism]] through [[pantheism|classical pantheism]], [[naturalistic pantheism]], [[pandeism]], [[panentheism]], and [[polytheism]] combined with [[science]] and [[Gaia philosophy]]; particularly [[archaeoastronomy]], [[astronomy]], [[ecology]], [[environmentalism]], the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[psychology]] and [[physics]]. 

New Age practices and philosophies sometimes draw inspiration from major [[major religious groups|world religions]]: [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Chinese folk religion]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] (especially [[Sufism]]), [[Judaism]] (especially [[Kabbalah]]), [[Sikhism]]; with strong influences from [[East Asian religions]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Neopaganism]], [[New Thought]], [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophy]], [[Universalism]] and [[Western esotericism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''New Age'' refers to the coming [[astrological age|astrological]] [[Age of Aquarius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JGMelton&quot;/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The author [[Nevill Drury]] claimed there are &quot;four key precursors of the New Age,&quot; who had set the way for many of its widely held precepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drury 2004 8&quot;/&gt; The first of these was [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772), a Swedish scientist who after a religious experience devoted himself to [[Christian mysticism]], believing that he could travel to [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] and commune with angels, demons and spirits, and who published widely on the subject of his experiences. The second person was [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815), who had developed a form of healing using magnets, believing that there was a force known as &quot;[[animal magnetism]]&quot; that affected humans. The third figure was the Russian [[Helena Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), one of the founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], through which she propagated her religious movement of [[Theosophy]], which itself combined a number of elements from Eastern religions like [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] with Western elements. The fourth figure was [[George Gurdjieff]] (c. 1872–1949), who founded the philosophy of the [[Fourth Way]], through which he conveyed a number of spiritual teachings to his disciples. A fifth individual whom Drury identified as an important influence upon the New Age movement was the Indian [[Swami Vivekananda]] (1863–1902), an adherent of the philosophy of [[Vedanta]] who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''New Age'' was used as early as 1809 by [[William Blake]] who described a coming era of spiritual and artistic advancement in his [[preface]] to ''[[Milton a Poem]]'' by stating: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;when the New Age is at leisure to pronounce, all will be set right&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milton&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last1=Blake|first1=William|last2=Sampson|first2=John|editor=John Sampson|title=The Poetical Works of William Blake: Including the Unpublished French Revolution; Together with the Minor Prophetic Books and Selections from the Four Zoas, Milton and Jerusalem|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uWblZFfnZEsC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;dq=Milton+%22New+Age%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Milton%20%22New%20Age%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-10-05|year=2006|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|location=Whitefish, Montana, US|isbn=978-1-4286-1155-9|page=369|chapter=Selections from ''Milton''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the New Age movement's constituent elements appeared initially in the 19th-century [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] movements: [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophy]], and [[New Thought]] and also the alternative medicine movements of [[chiropractic]]s and [[naturopathy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JGMelton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Langone&quot;/&gt; These movements have roots in [[Transcendentalism]], [[Mesmerism]], [[Swedenborgianism]], and various earlier Western [[esoteric]] or [[occult]] traditions, such as the [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] arts of astrology, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[alchemy]], and [[Kabbalah]]. The term ''New Age'' was used in this context in [[Madame Blavatsky]]'s book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', published in 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Spencer|first=Neil|title=True as the Stars above: Adventures in Modern Astrology|publisher=Victor Gollancz|year=2000|pages=115–27|isbn=0-575-06769-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A weekly journal of [[Liberal Christianity|Christian liberalism]] and [[socialism]] titled ''[[The New Age]]'' was published as early as 1894;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modjourn.org/render.php?id=mjp.2005.00.001&amp;view=mjp_object General Introduction to ''The New Age'' 1907–1922], Brown University &amp; The University of Tulsa—The Modernist Journals Project, retrieved 2010-10-28&lt;/ref&gt; it was sold to a group of socialist writers headed by [[Alfred Richard Orage]] and [[Holbrook Jackson]] in 1907. Contributors included [[H. G. Wells]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[William Butler Yeats]]; the magazine became a forum for [[politics]], [[literature]], and [[the arts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Modernism In and Beyond the “Little Magazines”'', Winter 2007, Professor Ann Ardis, Brown University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057250/Alfred-Richard-Orage#143390.hook &quot;The New Age&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica article on Orage]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1908 and 1914, it was instrumental in pioneering the British [[avant-garde]] from [[Vorticism]] to [[Imagism]]. Orage met [[P. D. Ouspensky]], a follower of Gurdjieff, in 1914 and began correspondence with [[Harry Houdini]]; he became less interested in literature and art with an increased focus on [[mysticism]] and other spiritual topics; the magazine was sold in 1921. According to [[Brown University]], ''The New Age'' &quot;...&amp;nbsp;helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2006-07/06-143.html|title=Modernist Journals Project Has Grant to Digitize Rare Magazines|date=2007-04-19|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Stonehenge Distance.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Stonehenge with trimmed green grass on a partly-sunny day|[[Stonehenge]] and other ancient sites are revered by many who practice New Age spirituality.]]

Popularisation behind these ideas has roots in the work of early 20th century writers such as [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[William Butler Yeats]]. In the early- to mid-1900s, American mystic, theologian, and founder of the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]] [[Edgar Cayce]] was a seminal influence on what later would be termed the ''New Age movement''; he was known in particular for the practice some refer to as ''[[mediumship|channeling]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Emerging Network: A Sociology of the New Age and Neo-Pagan Movements|first=Michael|last=York|year=1995|page=60|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-8476-8001-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Carl Jung]] was a proponent of the concept of the Age of Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Stein|first=Murray|title=Transformation |publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|year=2005|page=138|isbn=1-58544-449-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uZK_clekR9gC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=Carl+Gustav+Jung+++Age+of+Aquarius}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his friend Peter Baynes, dated 12 August 1940, Jung wrote a passage: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;This year reminds me of the enormous earthquake in 26 B.C. that shook down the great temple of [[Karnak]].

[[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophist]] [[Alice Bailey]] published the book ''Discipleship in the New Age'' (1944), which used the term ''New Age'' in reference to the transition from the [[astrological age]] of [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] to [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]. While claims of racial bias in the writings of Rudolf Steiner and Alice Bailey were made,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shnirelman&quot;&gt;''Acta no. 13, Analysis of Current Trends in Antisemitism''.

===Contemporary usage of the term===
[[File:Barrel House.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Wooden barrel house in forest with surrounding footpaths|This barrel house was the first dwelling constructed at the [[Findhorn Ecovillage]].]]

The [[subculture]] that later became known as ''New Age'' already existed in the early 1970s, based on and adopting ideas originally present in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] of the 1960s. Two entities founded in 1962: the [[Esalen Institute]] in [[Big Sur]], [[California]] and the [[Findhorn Foundation]]—an [[intentional community]] which continues to operate the [[Findhorn Ecovillage]] near [[Findhorn]], [[Moray]], [[Scotland]]—played an instrumental role during the early growth period of the New Age movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Findhorn&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread usage of the term ''New Age'' began in the mid-1970s (reflected in the title of monthly periodical ''[[New Age Journal]]'') and probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as &quot;New Age bookstores.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms, 1941–1991|first=John|last=Algeo|coauthors=Adele S. Algeo|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=234|isbn=0-521-44971-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Modernist Alchemy: Poetry and the Occult|first=Timothy|last=Materer|year=1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=14|isbn=0-8014-3146-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the large-scale activities surrounding the [[Harmonic Convergence]] in 1987, the American mass-media further popularised the term as a label for the alternative spiritual subculture, including practices such as [[meditation]], [[Channeling (mediumistic)|channeling]], [[crystal healing]], [[astral projection]], [[psychic]] experience, [[holistic health]], [[simple living]], and [[environmentalism]]; or belief in phenomena such as [[Earth mysteries]], [[ancient astronauts]], [[extraterrestrial life]], [[unidentified flying object]]s, [[crop circle]]s, and [[reincarnation]]. Several New Age publications appeared by the late 1980s such as ''Psychic Guide'' (later renamed ''Body, Mind &amp; Spirit''), ''Yoga Journal'', ''New Age Voice'', ''New Age Retailer'', and ''NAPRA ReView'' by the New Age Publishers and Retailers Alliance.

Several key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: the production of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical]]'' (1967) with its opening song &quot;[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Aquarius]]&quot; and its memorable line &quot;''This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius''&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; publication of [[Linda Goodman]]'s best-selling astrology books ''Sun Signs'' (1968) and ''Love Signs'' (1978); the release of [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s book ''[[Out on a Limb (Shirley MacLaine book)|Out on a Limb]]'' (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the &quot;[[Harmonic Convergence]]&quot; [[planetary alignment]] on August 16 and 17, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[José Argüelles]] at [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]] in the U.S. state of [[Arizona]]. The claims of channelers [[Jane Roberts]] ([[Seth Material]]), [[Helen Schucman]] (''[[A Course in Miracles]]''), [[J. Z. Knight]] ([[Ramtha]]), [[Neale Donald Walsch]] (''[[Conversations with God]]'') (note that Walsch denies being a &quot;channeler&quot; and his books make it obvious that he is not one, though the text emerged through a dialogue with a deeper part of himself in a process comparable to automatic writing), and [[Rene Gaudette]] (The Wonders) contributed to the movement's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=133–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant New Age works include the writings of [[James Redfield]], [[Eckhart Tolle]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Christopher Hills]], [[Marianne Williamson]], [[Deepak Chopra]], [[John Holland (psychic)|John Holland]], [[Gary Zukav]], [[Wayne Dyer]], and [[Rhonda Byrne]].

While the New Age lacks any unified belief-system, many spiritual practices and philosophies feature commonly among adherents of the movement—sometimes referred to as ''New Agers''.

One version is that the individual must incarnate once under each of the twelve signs of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Language of Birthdays.

===Music===
{{See also|List of New Age music artists|List of ambient artists}}
[[New Age music]] is peaceful music of various styles intended to create inspiration, relaxation, and positive feelings while listening.

The style began in the 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label; such as Oregon, the [[Paul Winter Consort]], and other pre-ambient bands; as well as [[ambient music]] performer [[Brian Eno]] and classical avant-garde musician [[Daniel Kobialka]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In the early 1970s, it was mostly instrumental with both acoustic and electronic styles. New Age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic [[space music]] ([[Constance Demby|like Constance Demby's]]) using [[synthesizer]]s and acoustic instrumentals using [[Native American flute]]s and [[drum]]s, [[singing bowl]]s, and [[world music]] sounds to spiritual [[chant]]ing from other cultures.

The author [[Ken Wilber]] posits that most New Age thought falls into what he termed the ''[[pre/trans fallacy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilber1&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Wilber|first=Ken|title=The Collected Works of Ken Wilber|publisher=Shambhala Publications|location=Boston, MA, US|year=1999|volume=3|chapter=Introduction to the Third Volume|isbn=1-59030-321-0|url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/cowokev3_intro.cfm/|accessdate=2009-06-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilber, human [[developmental psychology]] moves from the pre-personal, through the personal, then to the transpersonal (spiritually advanced or enlightened) level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilber2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regards 80 percent of New Age spirituality as pre-rational (pre-conventional) and as relying primarily on mythic-magical thinking; this contrasts with a post-rational (including and transcending rational) genuinely [[worldcentrism|world-centric]] consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilber1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilber2&quot;/&gt; Despite his criticism of most New Age thought, Wilber has been categorized as New Age due to his emphasis on a [[transpersonal]] view,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]], ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', SUNY, 1998, pp.70 (''&quot;Ken Wilber [...] defends a transpersonal worldview which qualifies as 'New Age'&quot;'').&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, as a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Marian de Souza (ed.), ''International handbook of the religious, moral and spiritual dimensions in education.''

===Indigenous peoples of the Americas===
{{Further|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
Some adherents of traditional disciplines, such as the [[Lakota people]]—a tribe of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, reject &quot;the expropriation of [their] ceremonial ways by non-Indians.&quot; They see the New Age movement as either not fully understanding, deliberately trivializing, or distorting their disciplines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenelon1998&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Fenelon|first=James V.|title=Culturicide, resistance, and survival of the Lakota (&quot;Sioux Nation&quot;)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DYDeLzTyWQQC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;pg=PA297 |accessdate=2009-03-16|year=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=New York|isbn=0-8153-3119-3|pages=295–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have coined the term ''plastic medicine men'' to describe individuals, from within their own communities &quot;who are prostituting our spiritual ways for their own selfish gain, with no regard for the spiritual well-being of the people as a whole.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenelon1998&quot;/&gt; The term ''[[plastic shaman]]'' has been applied to outsiders who identify themselves as shamans, holy people, or other traditional spiritual leaders, but who have no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures they claim to represent. 

The academic [[Ward Churchill]] criticized the New Age movement as an instrument of [[cultural imperialism]] that is exploitative of indigenous cultures by reducing them to a commodity to be traded. In ''Fantasies of the Master Race'', he criticized the [[cultural appropriation]] of Native American culture and symbols in not only the New Age movement, but also in [[art]] and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fantasies of the Master Race: Literature, Cinema and the Colonization of American Indians|last=Churchill|first=Ward|authorlink=Ward Churchill|year=1992|publisher=Common Courage Press|location=|isbn=0-9628838-7-5|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many of Churchill's allegations and research findings have been called into question by other academics, leading to an [[Ward Churchill academic misconduct investigation|academic misconduct investigation]] and subsequent firing by the University of Colorado at Boulder.

===Goddess movement===
{{Further|Goddess movement}}
Followers of the Goddess movement have severely criticized the New Age as fundamentally [[patriarchal]], analytical rather than intuitive, and as supporting the status quo, particularly in its implicit gender roles. [[Monica Sjöö]] (1938–2005) wrote that New Age channelers were virtually all women, but the spirits they purported to channel, offering guidance to humanity, were nearly all male. Sjöö was highly critical of [[Theosophy]], the [[&quot;I AM&quot; Activity]], and particularly [[Alice Bailey]], whom she saw as promoting [[Nazi]]-like Aryan ideals. Sjöö's writings also condemn the New Age for its support of communication and information processing technologies which, she believes, may produce harmful [[Electromagnetic radiation and health|low-level electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sjöö, Monica (1998).Bristol, England: Green Leaf Bookshop.

===Academia===
In the 2003 book ''[[A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America]]'' written by [[Michael Barkun]], professor emeritus of [[political science]] at the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun 2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Barkun, Michael | title = A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America | publisher = University of California Press; 1 edition | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-520-23805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun argues New age beliefs have been greatly facilitated  by the advent of the internet which has exposed people to  beliefs once consigned to the outermost fringe of political and religious life. He identifies two trends which he terms, &quot; the rise of improvisational [[millennialism]]&quot; and &quot;the popularity of [[social stigma|stigmatized]] knowledge&quot;. He voices concern that  these tends could lead to [[mass hysteria]] and could have a devastating effect on American political life.

==Social and political movement==

While many commentators have focused on the personal aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a social and political component.   The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Kyle&gt;Kyle, Richard G. (Autumn 1995).  &quot;The Political Ideas of the New Age Movement&quot;.  ''Journal of Church and State'', pp.&amp;nbsp;831–48.  Alternate version in Kyle, Richard (1994).  ''The New Age Movement in American Culture''.  University Press of America, pp.&amp;nbsp;113–31.  ISBN 978-0-7618-0010-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, the political movement evolved in new directions.

After the political turmoil of the 1960s, many activists in North America and Europe became disillusioned with traditional reformist and revolutionary political ideologies.&lt;ref name=Cloud&gt;Cloud, Dana L.

ISBN 978-0-7619-0506-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some began searching for a new politics that gave special weight to such topics as consciousness, ecology, personal and spiritual development, community empowerment, and global unity.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb&gt;Gottlieb, Annie (1987).

All these books were issued by major publishers.  Some became international bestsellers.  By the 1980s, New Age political ideas were being discussed in big-city newspapers&lt;ref&gt;Sidenbladh, Erik (5 October 1980). &quot;Krerativ Rorelse for 'Den Nya Tidsaldern'&quot;.  ''Svenska Dagbladet'' (Stockholm), &quot;Idag&quot; section, p.&amp;nbsp;1.

In the U.S., observers pointed to ''Leading Edge Bulletin'',&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson (1980), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;426.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Whole Living|New Age Journal]]'',&lt;ref name=Annie&gt;Gottlieb (1987), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;372.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satin (1978), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;316.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''New Options Newsletter'',&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (1987), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;153–54 and 372.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Utne Reader]]''.&lt;ref name=Annie /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruson, Lindsay (1988). &quot;Utne Reader Is a New Age Digest&quot;.

As with any political movement, organizations sprang up to generate popular support for New Age political ideas and policy positions.  In the U.S., commentators identified the New Age Caucus of California,&lt;ref&gt;Satin (1978), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;339–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1981), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;383.&lt;/ref&gt; the New World Alliance,&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Jerome (1990). &quot;New Age Politics&quot;.

''AHP Newsletter'', pp.&amp;nbsp;14–16. A publication of the [[Humanistic psychology|Association for Humanistic Psychology]].  Accessed 23 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  There may have been more New Age political organizing outside the U.S.;&lt;ref name=Groothuis /&gt; writer-activists pointed to the [[Erik Dammann|Future in Our Hands]] movement in Norway (which claimed  20,000 adherents out of a population of four million),&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson (1980), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;409–10.&lt;/ref&gt; the early European [[Green party|Green]]   movements,&lt;ref&gt;Satin (1978), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Values Party]] of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1980), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;373 and 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these books, periodicals, and organizations did not speak with one voice, commentators found that many of them sounded common themes:

* Our world does not reflect who we at our best can be.&lt;ref name=Wasserman /&gt;

* All our most significant social and political problems go back at least 300 years.&lt;ref name=Slaton&gt;Slaton, Christa Daryl; Woolpert, Stephen; Schwerin, Edward W. (1998). &quot;Introduction: What Is Transformational Politics?&quot;  In Woolpert, Stephen; Slaton, Christa Daryl; and Schwerin, Edward W., eds. (1998).  ''Transformational Politics: Theory, Study, and Practice''.  State University of New York Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;xix–xxiii.  ISBN 978-0-7914-3945-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The political system therefore needs to be transformed, not just reformed,&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt; with the help of a new political theory appropriate to our time.&lt;ref name=Cloud /&gt;

* Holism – seeing everything as connected – is the first step on the way to creating that new political theory.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wasserman /&gt;

* Doing away with the categories of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; is another essential part of that task.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wasserman /&gt;
 
* Significant social change requires deep changes in consciousness; institutional change is not enough.&lt;ref name=Cloud /&gt;&lt;ref name=Boggs&gt;Boggs, Carl (2000).  ''The End of Politics''.  Guilford Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;169–73.  ISBN 978-1-57230-504-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Above all, consciousness needs to become more ecologically aware,&lt;ref name=Wasserman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt; more feminist,&lt;ref name=Wasserman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt; and more oriented to compassionate global unity.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt;

* Desirable values include nonviolence, diversity, a sense of community, and a sense of enoughness.&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt;&lt;ref name=McClaughry /&gt;

* Human growth and development, not economic growth, should be the overarching goal of New Age society.&lt;ref name=McClaughry /&gt;

* Ownership and control of institutions is important.  But the size of institutions is at least as important.  We must move away from big governments, big corporations, and other large institutions to the extent it enhances our lives.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt;&lt;ref name=McClaughry /&gt;

* We can begin this process by interlacing hierarchical structures with horizontal networks.&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipnack&gt;Lipnack, Jessica; Stamps, Jeffrey (1982).  ''Networking: The First Report and Directory''.  Doubleday and Company, Chap.&amp;nbsp;6.  ISBN 978-0-385-18121-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Global unification is a key goal, but is probably best accomplished by networking at many levels rather than establishing a centralized world state.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt;

* The agent of political change is no longer the working class, or any economic class.  Instead, it is all those who are developing themselves personally and spiritually – all who aspire to live lives of dignity and service.&lt;ref name=Cloud /&gt;

* Evolution is to be preferred to revolution.  However, the forces of evolutionary change need not be a statistical majority.  A &quot;critical mass&quot; of informed, committed, and spiritually aware people can move a nation forward.&lt;ref name=Kyle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

Over time, these themes began to cohere.  By the 1980s, observers in both North America&lt;ref name=Wasserman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Boggs /&gt; and Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001).  ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''.  Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;5.  ISBN 978-0-521-79252-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zizek, Slavoj (2000).  ''The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology''.  Verso Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2.  ISBN 978-1-85984-291-1.&lt;/ref&gt; were acknowledging the emergence of a New Age political &quot;ideology&quot;.

===Political objections at century’s end===

Toward the end of the 20th century, criticisms were being directed at the New Age political project from many quarters,&lt;ref&gt;Sessions, George (23 September 1987).  &quot;[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/bron/re/Sessions--deandnewage7(8)27(sep87).pdf Deep Ecology and the New Age]&quot;.  ''Earth First! Journal'', pp.&amp;nbsp;27–30.  [[Deep ecology|Deep ecologist]] says New Age politics is too enamored of high technology, space exploration, and computer management systems.  Accessed 15 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weigel, George (March 1989).  &quot;No Options&quot;.  ''American Purpose'', vol. 3, no. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.  [[Conservatism in the United States|Mainstream conservative]] says New Age politics is just a retooled version of leftism.&lt;/ref&gt; but especially from the liberal left and religious right.

On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics is an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison (2001), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zizek (2000), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2 and 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the &quot;realities&quot; of economic and political power;&lt;ref name=Boggs /&gt; another  faulted it for not being opposed to the capitalist system, or to liberal individualism.&lt;ref name=Cloud /&gt;  Antinuclear activist [[Harvey Wasserman]] argued that New Age politics is too averse to social conflict to be effective politically.&lt;ref name=Wasserman /&gt;

On the right, some worried that the drive to come up with a new consciousness and new values would topple time-tested old values.&lt;ref name=Groothuis /&gt;  Others worried that the celebration of diversity would leave no strong viewpoint in place to guide society.&lt;ref name=Groothuis /&gt; The passion for world unity – one humanity, one planet – was said to lead inevitably to the centralization of power.&lt;ref&gt;LaHaye, Tim; Hindson, Ed (2001).  ''Seduction of the Heart: How to Guard and Keep Your Heart from Evil''.  W Publishing Group / Thomas Nelson, Inc., p.&amp;nbsp;178.  ISBN 978-0-8499-1726-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Ron (1995).  ''New Age Movement''.  Zondervan Publishing House, p.&amp;nbsp;20.  ISBN 978-0-310-70431-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some doubted that networking could provide an effective counterweight to centralization 
and bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt;

Neither left nor right was impressed with the New Age's ability to organize itself politically.&lt;ref name=Wasserman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;  Many explanations were offered for the New Age's practical political weakness.  Some said that the New Age political thinkers and activists of the 1970s and 1980s were simply too far in advance of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Ray and Anderson  (2000), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;206–07.&lt;/ref&gt;   Others suggested that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making was at fault.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;  After it dissolved, New World Alliance co-founder Marc Sarkady told an interviewer that the Alliance was too &quot;New Age counter-cultural&quot; to appeal to a broad public.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb (1987), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New directions in the 21st century===

[[File:America Speaks event - Flickr - Knight Foundation.jpg|thumb |right |alt=Dozens of people talking at tables in a large room.  |[[AmericaSpeaks]] event, 2011. In the 21st century, organizations like AmericaSpeaks embodied the approach of listening to and learning from everyone.]]

In the 21st century, writers and activists continue to pursue a political project with New Age roots.  However, it differs from the project that had come before, in part as a result of learning from the criticisms that had been directed at the earlier wave of New Age political actors.
  
The principal difference was anticipated in texts like ''New Age Politics'' author [[Mark Satin]]'s essay &quot;Twenty-eight Ways of Looking at Terrorism&quot; (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark  (1991).  ''New Options for America: The Next American Experiment Has Begun''.  Foreword by Marilyn Ferguson.  The Press at California State University / Southern Illinois University Press,  Chap.&amp;nbsp;19.  ISBN 978-0-8093-1794-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Potential Movement|human potential movement]] historian [[Walter Truett Anderson]]'s essay &quot;Four Different Ways to Be Absolutely Right&quot; (1995),&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Walter Truett, ed. (1995). &quot;Four Different Ways to Be Absolutely Right&quot;. In Anderson, Walter Truett, ed. (1995). ''The Truth About the Truth: De-Confusing and Re-Constructing the Postmodern World''.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam’s Sons, Chap.&amp;nbsp;18.  ISBN 978-0-87477-801-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and mediator Mark Gerzon's book ''A House Divided'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;Gerzon, Mark (1996).  ''A House Divided: Six Belief Systems Struggling for America's Soul''.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam’s Sons.  ISBN 978-0-87477-823-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As shown above, the Satin text was published in a book foreworded by [[Marilyn Ferguson]], and the Anderson and Gerzon texts were published under the imprint of Ferguson's publisher, [[Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In these texts, the New Age political perspective is recognized as legitimate.  But it is presented as merely one among many, with strong points and blind spots just like all the rest.  The result was to alter the nature of the New Age political project.  If every political perspective had unique strengths and significant weaknesses, then it no longer made sense to try to convert everyone to the New Age political perspective, as had been attempted in the 1970s and 1980s.  It made more sense to try to construct a higher political synthesis that took every poliical perspective into account, including that of the New Age.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin (1993), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;81 (quoting Satin).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerzon (1996), cited above, Chaps.&amp;nbsp;7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many 21st century books have attempted to articulate foundational aspects of this approach to politics and social change.  They include [[Ken Wilber]]'s ''A Theory of Everything'' (2001),&lt;ref name=Wilber&gt;Wilber, Ken (2000).  ''A Theory of Everything: An Integral Vision for Business, Politics, Science, and Spirituality''.  Shambhala Publications.  ISBN 978-1-57062-724-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Satin]]'s ''Radical Middle'' (2004),&lt;ref name=Mark&gt;Satin, Mark (2004).  ''Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now''.  Westview Press and Basic Books.  ISBN 978-0-8133-4190-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Korten]]'s ''The Great Turning'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Korten, David C. (2006).  ''The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community''.  Berrett-Koehler Publishers.  ISBN 978-1-887208-07-9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve McIntosh]]'s ''Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution'' (2007),&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;McIntosh, Steve (2007).  ''Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution: How the Integral Worldview Is Transforming Politics, Culture, and Spirituality''.  Paragon House.  ISBN 978-1-55778-867-2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marilyn Hamilton]]'s ''Integral City'' (2008),&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;Hamilton, Marilyn (2008).  ''Integral City: Evolutionary Intelligences for the Human Hive''.  New Society Publishers / Douglas &amp; McIntyre.  ISBN 978-0-86571-629-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and Carter Phipps's ''Evolutionaries'' (2012).&lt;ref name=Phipps&gt;Phipps, Carter (2012).  ''Evolutionaries: Unlocking the Spiritual and Cultural Potential of Science’s Greatest Idea''.  Harper Perennial.  ISBN 978-0-06-191613-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, many organizations are providing opportunities for focused political listening and learning that can contribute to the construction of a higher political synthesis.  They include [[AmericaSpeaks]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://Americaspeaks.org AmericaSpeaks].  Official website.

Another difference between the two eras of political thought is that, in the 21st century, few political actors use the term &quot;New Age&quot; or even &quot;post-New Age&quot;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;Melton, John Gordon (2012). &quot;New Age Movement&quot;.  In Encyclopedia Britannica (2012).  ''Encyclopedia Britannica Online''.  Encyclopedia Britannica Inc.  Retrieved 30 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe themselves or their work.  Some observers attribute this to the negative connotations that the term &quot;New Age&quot; had acquired.&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;  Instead, other terms are employed that connote a similar sense of personal and political development proceeding together over time.  For example, according to an anthology from three political scientists, many writers and academics use the term &quot;transformational&quot; as a substitute for such terms as New Age and new paradigm.&lt;ref name=Slaton /&gt;  [[Ken Wilber]] has popularized use of the term &quot;integral&quot;,&lt;ref name=Wilber /&gt; Carter Phipps emphasizes the term &quot;evolutionary&quot;,&lt;ref name=Phipps /&gt; and both terms can be found in some authors' book titles.&lt;ref  name=McIntosh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton /&gt;
