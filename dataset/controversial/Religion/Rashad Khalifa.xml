'''Rashad Khalifa''' ({{lang-ar|رشاد خليفة}}; November 19, 1935&amp;ndash;January 31, 1990) was an [[Egyptian American|Egyptian-American]] [[biochemist]], closely associated with the [[United Submitters International]]. He was [[Assassination|assassinated]] in 1990.

==Life==

Khalifa was born in [[Egypt]] on November 19, 1935. His father was a [[Sufi]] who is reported to have led a group with thousands of followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;submission.org&quot;&gt;http://www.submission.org/khalifa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalifa obtained an honours degree from [[Ain Shams University]], Egypt, before he emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1959, later earning a [[Master's Degree]] in [[biochemistry]] from [[Arizona State University]] and a PhD. from [[University of California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;submission.org&quot;/&gt; He became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] U.S. citizen and lived in [[Tucson, Arizona]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Khalifa worked as a science adviser for the [[Libyan government]] for about one year, after which he worked as a chemist for the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]], then became a senior chemist in Arizona's State Office of Chemistry in 1980.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Khalifa's son, [[Sam Khalifa]], played for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and was the first [[Major League Baseball|major league]] player of [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Sam_Khalifa&lt;/ref&gt;

He was central to the founding of the [[United Submitters International]], (USI), an offshoot [[Islamic]] group that usually prefers not to use the terms &quot;[[Muslim]]&quot; or &quot;[[Islam]],&quot; instead using the English equivalents &quot;Submitter&quot; and &quot;Submission.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Doctrine==
{{Main|United Submitters International}}

Khalifa said that he was a messenger (''[[rasool]]'') of God and that the [[Archangel Gabriel]] 'most assertively' told him that chapter 36, verse 3, of the Quran, 'specifically' referred to him.&lt;ref&gt;Appendex ii, (21), Authorised English Translation of the Quran, Dr. Rashad Khalifa, PhD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://submission.org/quran/app2.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Submitters International|His followers]] refer to him as God's [[Messenger of the Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;http://submission.org/messenger/&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted a strict [[monotheism]] and was a prominent [[Quran Alone|Quranist]], rejecting the ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[sunnah]]'' as fabrications attributed to [[prophet Muhammad]] by later scholars.

He is most notable for his statement that the [[Quran]] contains a mathematical structure based on the number 19 &lt;ref&gt;http://submission.org/quran/app1.html&lt;/ref&gt; and making the highly controversial claim that the last two the verses of chapter nine in the Quran were not canonical, telling his followers to reject them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.submission.org/tampering.html&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1968, Khalifa used computers to analyze the frequency of letters and words in the Quran.&lt;ref name=&quot;submission.org&quot;/&gt; In 1974, he claimed that he had discovered a mathematical code in the text of the Qur'an involving the number 19. The details of this analysis are available in his book, ''Quran, the Final Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;Khalifa, Rashad. Quran, the Final Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalifa's research did not receive much attention in the [[Western world|West]]. In 1980, [[Martin Gardner]] mentioned it in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin (1980), Mathematical Games, ''Scientific American'', September 1980, pp16–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner later wrote a more extensive and critical review of Khalifa and his work.&lt;ref&gt;The numerology of Dr. Rashad Khalifa - scientist, Martin Gardner, Skeptical Inquirer, Sept-Oct, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Khalifa's first publicized report in the [[Arab]] world appeared in the Egyptian magazine ''Akher Sa'a'', in January, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Akher Sa'a magazine, Egypt, January 24, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Updates of his research were subsequently published by the same magazine later that year and again in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Akher Sa'a magazine, Egypt, November 28, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akher Sa'a magazine, Egypt, December 31, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination==
Owing to Rashad Kahlifa's doctrine, which was contrary to some important tenets of Sunni Islam, a fatwa was issued on February 19, 1989, by the Islamic Legal Council of Saudi Arabia. The fatwa, which was jointly issued by some 38 scholars, decreed Rashad Khalifa as a heretic.

Almost a year later on January 31, 1990, Khalifa was murdered at Masjid Tucson. He was stabbed multiple times and his body drenched in [[Xylene|xylol]] but not set alight. Although nobody has been convicted of his murder, James Williams, an alleged member of the [[Jamaat ul-Fuqra]] organization, was convicted of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] in the slaying.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Anderson, Slain Islamic leader was outspoken; Khalifa's teachings from Tucson angered Muslims worldwide, ''Denver Post'', 21 October 1993, p21.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams disappeared on the day of his sentencing and could not be found.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Foster, Extremist is 'not to be found'; Little hope held of finding Al-Fuqra fugitive, ''Rocky Mountain News'', 25 February 1994, p8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Williams was apprehended attempting to re-enter the United States and sentenced to serve 69 years in prison. His convictions were upheld on appeal by the [[Colorado Court of Appeals]] except for one count of [[forgery]].&lt;ref&gt;People v. James D. Williams, (Colo. App. 01CA0781, Aug. 7, 2003) (not selected for official publication)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ago.state.co.us/press_detail.cfm?pressID=503 | title=Attorney General Announces Sentence | date=2001-03-16 | accessdate=2007-09-29 | publisher=Colorado Department of Law }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBS News]] reported that Muslim extremist [[Wadih el-Hage]] was &quot;connected to the 1990 stabbing death of... Rashad Khalifa was hated by Muslims opposed to his teachings. He is considered a false prophet by Muslims. El-Hage who was indicted for lying about the case, called the assassination 'a good thing.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/10/26/attack/main316077.shtml | title=Terrorists Take To Arizona | date=2001-10-26 | accessdate=2007-09-29 | publisher=CBS Worldwide Inc | quote=El-Hage has also been connected to the 1990 stabbing death of a Tucson mosque leader.

On Tuesday, April 28, 2009 the Calgary Police Services of Canada arrested Glen Cusford Francis, a 52-year-old citizen of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], on suspicion of killing Rashad Khalifa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary police nab suspect&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/story.html?id=1547368|title=Calgary police nab suspect in imam killing|last=Massinon|first=Stephane |date=April 30, 2009|work=National Post|publisher=The National Post Company|accessdate=2009-05-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators in Tucson learned that Francis, who was going by the name Benjamin Phillips, had begun his studies under Khalifa in January 1990. Phillips disappeared shortly after the slaying,&lt;ref name=&quot;Calgary police nab suspect&quot; /&gt; and was said to have left the country. An investigation revealed Phillips and Francis were the same man upon discovering fingerprints found in Phillips apartment. A specialty unit of the Tucson Police Department furthered in its investigation in 2006 and in December 2008 and was able to use DNA testing on forensic evidence from the crime scene to tie Francis to the assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fugitive denied bail&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Life/Fugitive+held+slaying+American+imam+denied+bail/1621967/story.html|title=Fugitive held in slaying of American imam denied bail|last=Slade|first=Daryl|date=May 22, 2009|work=The Vancouver Sun|publisher=Canwest Publishing Inc.|accessdate=2009-05-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, a Canadian judge ordered his extradition to the United States to face trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2009/10/17/11434296-sun.html|work=The Calgary Sun|last=Martin|first=Kevin|publisher=Sun Media|accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
