The '''Druze''' ({{lang-ar|درزي, ''derzī'' or ''durzī''}}, plural دروز, ''durūz'',  are a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religious community, found primarily in [[Syria]], Lebanon, [[Israel]], and [[Jordan]], which emerged during the 11th century from [[Ismailism]] school of [[Shia Islam]]. Druze beliefs incorporate several elements from [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Neoplatonism]] and other philosophies. The Druze call themselves ''Ahl al-[[Tawhid]]'' &quot;[[the People of Monotheism]]&quot; or ''al-Muwaḥḥidūn'' &quot;the Unitarians&quot;.

The Druze people reside primarily in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.&lt;ref name= druze_golan&gt;Jordanian Druze can be found in [[Amman]] and [[Zarka]]; about 50% live in the town of [[Azraq]], and a smaller number in [[Irbid]] and [[Aqaba]].  {{cite web

Large communities of expatriate Druze also live outside the Middle East in Australia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, the United States, and West Africa. They use the [[Arabic language]] and follow a social pattern very similar to those of the other peoples of the [[Levant|eastern Mediterranean region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rabah | last = Halabi | title = Citizens of equal duties—Druze identity and the Jewish State | page = 55 | language = Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin of the name===
The name Druze is derived from the name of [[Ad-Darazi|Muhammad bin Ismail Nashtakin ad-Darazī]] (from [[Persian language|Persian]], darzi, &quot;seamster&quot;) who was an early preacher. Although the Druze consider ad-Darazī a heretic&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.druze.ca/AboutDruze.html | title = About the Faith of The Mo’wa’he’doon Druze | first = Moustafa F | last = Moukarim}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the name had been used to identify them.

Before becoming public, the movement was secretive and held closed meetings in what was known as [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah#Sessions of Wisdom|Sessions of Wisdom]]. During this stage a dispute occurred between ad-Darazi and [[Hamza bin Ali]] mainly concerning ad-Darazi's [[ghulat|ghuluww]] (Arabic, &quot;exaggeration&quot;), which refers to the belief that God was [[incarnation|incarnated]] in human beings, especially [[Ali|'Ali]] and his descendants, including [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] who was the current [[Caliph]], and ad-Darazi naming himself &quot;The Sword of the Faith&quot; which led Hamza to write an epistle refuting the need for the sword to spread the faith and several epistles refuting the beliefs of the [[ghulat]].

In 1016 ad-Darazi and his followers openly proclaimed their beliefs and called people to join them, causing riots in Cairo against the Unitarian movement including Hamza bin Ali and his followers which led to the suspension of the movement for one year and the expulsion of ad-Darazi and his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/595974l | title = Al-Darazî and Ḥamza in the Origin of Druze Religion | first = MGS  | last = Hodgson | year = 1962}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Druze religious books describe ad-Darazi as the &quot;insolent one&quot; and as the &quot;Calf&quot; who is narrow minded and hasty, the name &quot;Druze&quot; is still used for identification and for historical reasons. In 1018 ad-Darazi was assassinated for his teachings; some sources claim that he was executed by Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=samy&gt;{{cite book|title= The Druzes: An Annotated Bibliography | last= Swayd| first= Samy | publisher=ISES Publications|location=Kirkland, WA, USA|year=1998|isbn=0-9662932-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authorities see in the name &quot;Druze&quot; a descriptive epithet, derived from Arabic [[dâresah]] (&quot;those who study&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/DRO_ECG/DRUSES_or_DRUZES_Arab_Druz_.html | year = 1911 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | page = 606}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have speculated that the word comes from the Arabic-Persian word ''Darazo'' ({{lang|fa|درز}} &quot;bliss&quot;) or from [[Shaykh]] Hussayn ad-Darazī, who was one of the early converts to the faith.&lt;ref name = najjar /&gt; In the early stages of the movement, the word &quot;Druze&quot; is rarely mentioned by historians, and in Druze religious texts only the word ''Muwaḥḥidūn'' (&quot;Unitarian&quot;) appears. The only early Arab historian who mentions the Druze is the 11th century Christian scholar [[Yahya of Antioch]], who clearly refers to the heretical group created by ad-Darazī rather than the followers of Hamza ibn 'Alī.&lt;ref name=najjar&gt;{{cite book  | last = Al-Najjar  | first = 'Abdullāh  | title = Madhhab ad-Durūz wa t-Tawḥīd (The Druze Sect and Unism)  | publisher = Dār al-Ma'ārif  | location = Egypt  | year = 1965  | language = Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Western sources, [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the Jewish traveler who passed through Lebanon in or about 1165, was one of the first European writers to refer to the Druzes by name. The word ''Dogziyin'' (&quot;Druzes&quot;) occurs in an early Hebrew edition of his travels, but it is clear that this is a scribal error. Be that as it may, he described the Druze as &quot;mountain dwellers, monotheists, who believe in 'soul eternity' and [[reincarnation]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Early history===
The Druze faith began as a movement in [[Ismailism]], that was mainly influenced by [[Greek philosophy]] and [[gnosticism]] and opposed certain religious and philosophical ideologies that were present during that epoch.

The faith was preached by [[Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad|Hamza ibn 'Alī ibn Ahmad]], a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Ismaili]] mystic and scholar. He came to Egypt in 1014 and assembled a group of scholars and leaders from across the world to establish the Unitarian movement. The order's meetings were held in the Raydan Mosque, near the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.druze.com/education/DruzeLuminariesAlHakim-English-level3.pdf | publisher = Druze | title = Luminaries: Al Hakim}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1017, Hamza officially revealed the Druze faith and began to preach the Unitarian doctrine. Hamza gained the support of the Fātimid Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]], who issued a decree promoting religious freedom prior to the declaration of the divine call.
{{quote |Remove ye the causes of fear and estrangement from yourselves.  Do away with the corruption of delusion and conformity.

Al-Hakim became a central figure in the Druze faith even though his own religious position was disputed among scholars. [[John Esposito]] states that al-Hakim believed that &quot;he was not only the divinely appointed religio-political leader but also the [[nous|cosmic intellect]] linking God with creation&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=lZXTFCN93kkC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=druze+hakim+John+Esposito&amp;ei=bBaDSL-ZAozaigHaxdG8DQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U1jUwRJDGMsL3BIUbiX5DzfmMcawg#PPA156,M1 | title = Melville's Clarel and the Intersympathy of Creeds | first = William | last = Potter | page = 156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while others like [[Nissim Dana]] and [[Mordechai Nisan]] state that he is perceived as the manifestation and the reincarnation of God or presumably the image of God.{{Sfn | Nisan | 2002 | p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=keD9z1XWuNwC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Mordechai+Nisan++druze&amp;ei=IJ5uSLuLMZOkiwHp99SCBg&amp;sig=ACfU3U2QHNki1phQdaWTIOKngGyVPLnTbw#PPA100,M1  95]}}{{Sfn | Dana}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Some Druze and non-Druze scholars like Samy Swayd and [[Sami Makarem]] state that this confusion is due to confusion about the role of the early preacher ad-Darazi, whose teachings the Druze rejected as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=The+Druzes:+A+New+Study+of+Their+History,+Faith+and+Society+Al-Hakim&amp;ei=bNeFSOnMGZzwigGj_ejbBQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U3BPEoV7YZP4FEgBiqD7Xflt_gLZg#PPA217,M1 | title = Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia | first1 = Josef W | last1 = Meri | first2 = Jere L | last2 = Bacharach | publisher = Routledge | year = 2006 | ISBN = 0-415-96690-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These sources assert that al-Hakim rejected ad-Darazi's claims of divinity,&lt;ref name= samy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=kY0oedX32BwC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Hamza+bin+Ali+druze&amp;ei=hxV-SLTaB4KijgHJvKXtDw&amp;sig=ACfU3U3Joonyh4sX6X3A6xx9ngHmddJ59w#PPA127,M1 | title = The Olive and the Tree: The Secret Strength of the Druze | first1 = Dr Ruth | last1 = Westheimer | first2 = Gil | last2 = Sedan}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Swayd | 2006}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}} and ordered the elimination of his movement while supporting that of Hamza ibn Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=rezD7rvuf9YC&amp;pg=PA921&amp;vq=druze&amp;dq=druze+god+hakim&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U2oOT-YmEy4ZP0xOseugnG-PP-HQg#PPA921,M1 | contribution = M. Th. Houtsma | first = EJ Brill | title = First encyclopaedia of Islam | year = 1913–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Hakim disappeared one night while out on his evening ride – presumably assassinated, perhaps at the behest of his formidable elder sister [[Sitt al-Mulk]]. The Druze believe he went into [[The Occultation|Occultation]] with Hamza ibn Ali and three other prominent preachers, leaving the care of the &quot;Unitarian missionary movement&quot; to a new leader, [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin]].

===Closing of the faith===
Al-Hakim was replaced by his underage son, [[Ali az-Zahir|'Alī az-Zahir]]. The Unitarian Druze movement, which existed in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], acknowledged az-Zahir as the Caliph, but followed Hamzah as its [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]].&lt;ref name=samy/&gt; The young Caliph's regent, [[Sitt al-Mulk]], ordered the army to destroy the movement in 1021.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; At the same time, Bahā'a ad-Dīn as-Samuki was assigned the leadership of the Unitarian Movement by Hamza Bin Ali.&lt;ref name=samy/&gt;

For the next seven years, the Druze faced extreme persecution by the new caliph, al-Zahir, who wanted to eradicate the faith.&lt;ref name= Rebecca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredtribesjournal.org/images/Encyclopedia/The_Druze.pdf  |title=The Druze |author=Rebecca Erickson |work=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the result of a power struggle inside of the Fatimid empire in which the Druze were viewed with suspicion because of their refusal to recognize the new Caliph, [[Ali az-Zahir]], as their Imam. Many spies, mainly the followers of Ad-Darazi, joined the Unitarian movement in order to infiltrate the Druze community. The spies set about agitating trouble and soiling the reputation of the Druze. This resulted in friction with the new caliph who clashed militarily with the Druze community. The clashes ranged from [[Antioch]] to [[Alexandria]], where tens of thousands of Druze were slaughtered by the Fatimid army.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The largest massacre was at Antioch, where 5,000 Druze religious leaders were killed, followed by that of [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt; As a result, the faith went underground in hope of survival, as those captured were either forced to renounce their faith or be killed. Druze survivors &quot;were found principally in southern Lebanon and Syria.&quot; In 1038, two years after the death of al-Zahir, the Druze movement was able to resume because the new leadership that replaced him had friendly political ties with at least one prominent Druze leader.&lt;ref name=Rebecca/&gt;

In 1043 [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin|Baha'uddin]] declared that the sect would no longer accept new pledges, and since that time [[proselytization]] has been prohibited.&lt;ref name=samy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rebecca/&gt;

===During the Crusades===
It was during the period of Crusader rule in Syria (1099–1291) that the Druze first emerged into the full light of history in the Gharb region of the [[Chouf]] Mountains. As powerful warriors serving the Muslim rulers of Damascus against the [[Crusades]], the Druze were given the task of keeping watch over the crusaders in the seaport of Beirut, with the aim of preventing them from making any encroachments inland. Subsequently, the Druze chiefs of the Gharb placed their considerable military experience at the disposal of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rulers of Egypt (1250–1516); first, to assist them in putting an end to what remained of Crusader rule in coastal Syria, and later to help them safeguard the Syrian coast against Crusader retaliation by sea.&lt;ref name = &quot;Druze heritage&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.druzeheritage.org/dhf/Druze_History.asp | publisher = Druze Heritage | title = History}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early period of the [[Crusades|Crusader]] era, the Druze feudal power was in the hands of two families, the [[Tanukh]]s and the [[Talal Arslan|Arslans]]. From their fortresses in the Gharb area (now in [[Aley District]]) of southern [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]], the Tanukhs led their incursions into the Phoenician coast and finally succeeded in holding Beirut and the marine plain against the [[Franks]]. Because of their fierce battles with the [[Crusaders]], the Druzes earned the respect of the [[Sunni]] Muslim Caliphs and thus gained important political powers.  After the middle of the twelfth century, the [[Ma'an]] family superseded the Tanukhs in Druze leadership. The origin of the family goes back to a [[Prince Ma'an]] who made his appearance in the Lebanon in the days of the 'Abbasid Caliph [[al-Mustarshid]] (1118–35 AD). The Ma'ans chose for their abode the [[Chouf]] District in south-western Lebanon (southern [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]]), overlooking the maritime plain between [[Beirut]] and [[Sidon]], and made their headquarters in [[Baaqlin]], which is still a leading Druze village. They were invested with feudal authority by Sultan [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] and furnished respectable contingents to the Muslim ranks in their struggle against the Crusaders.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

===Persecution during the Mamluk and Ottoman period===
Having cleared Syria of the Franks, the [[Mamluk]] Sultans of Egypt turned their attention to the schismatic Muslims of Syria. In 1305, after the issuing of a [[fatwa]] by the scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] calling for [[jihad]] against all non-[[Sunni]] Muslims like the Druze, [[Alawites]], [[Ismaili]], and [[Shia Muslim|twelver]] Shiites, [[Al-Nasir Muhammad|al-Malik al-Nasir]] inflicted a disastrous defeat on the Druze at [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]] and forced outward compliance on their part to orthodox Sunni Islam. Later, under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks, they were severely attacked at [[Ayn-Ṣawfar]] in 1585 after the Ottomans claimed that they assaulted their caravans near [[Tripoli]].{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Consequently, the 16th and 17th centuries were to witness a succession of armed Druze rebellions against the Ottomans, countered by repeated Ottoman punitive expeditions against the Chouf, in which the Druze population of the area was severely depleted and many villages destroyed. These military measures, severe as they were, did not succeed in reducing the local Druze to the required degree of subordination. This led the Ottoman government to agree to an arrangement whereby the different [[nahiyes]] (districts) of the [[Chouf]] would be granted in ''iltizam'' (&quot;fiscal concession&quot;) to one of the region's [[amir]]s, or leading chiefs, leaving the maintenance of law and order and the collection of its taxes in the area in the hands of the appointed amir. This arrangement was to provide the cornerstone for the privileged status which ultimately came to be enjoyed by the whole of Mount Lebanon in Ottoman Syria, Druze and Christian areas alike.&lt;ref name = &quot;Druze heritage&quot; /&gt;

===Ma'an dynasty===
{{Main|Maan family}}
[[File:fakhreddincastle.jpg|right|frame|Fakhreddin castle in Palmyra]]
With the advent of the Ottoman Turks and the conquest of Syria by [[Selim I|Sultan Selim I]] in 1516, the [[Ma'ans]] were acknowledged by the new rulers as the feudal lords of southern Lebanon.  Druze villages spread and prospered in that region, which under Ma'an leadership so flourished that it acquired the generic term of ''Jabal Bayt-Ma'an'' (the mountain of the Ma'an family) or ''Jabal al-Druze''. The latter title has since been usurped by the [[Hawran]] region, which since the middle of the 19th century has proven a haven of refuge to Druze emigrants from Lebanon and has become the headquarters of Druze power.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Under [[Fakhr-al-Din II|Fakhr-al-Dīn II]] (Fakhreddin II), the Druze dominion increased until it included almost all Syria, extending from the edge of the Antioch plain in the north to [[Safad]] in the south, with a part of the Syrian desert dominated by [[Fakhr-al-Din al-Maani Castle|Fakhr-al-Din's castle]] at Tadmur ([[Palmyra]]), the ancient capital of [[Zenobia]]. The ruins of this castle still stand on a steep hill overlooking the town. Fakhr-al-Din became too strong for his Turkish sovereign in [[Constantinople]].  He went so far in 1608 as to sign a commercial treaty with [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany]] containing secret military clauses. The Sultan then sent a force against him, and he was compelled to flee the land and seek refuge in the courts of [[Tuscany]] and [[Naples]] in 1614.

In 1618 political changes in the Ottoman sultanate had resulted in the removal of many enemies of Fakhr-al-Din from power, signaling the prince's triumphant return to Lebanon soon afterwards.

In 1632 Ahmad Koujak was named Lord of [[Damascus]]. Koujak was a rival of Fakhr-al-Din and a friend of the sultan [[Murad IV]], who ordered Koujak and the sultanate's navy to attack Lebanon and depose Fakhr-al-Din.

This time the prince decided to remain in Lebanon and resist the offensive, but the death of his son Ali in [[Wadi al-Taym]] was the beginning of his defeat. He later took refuge in [[Jezzine]]'s grotto, closely followed by Koujak who eventually caught up with him and his family.

Fakhr-al-Din finally traveled to [[Turkey]], appearing before the sultan, defending himself so skillfully that the sultan gave him permission to return to Lebanon.

Later, however, the Sultan changed his orders and had Fakhr-al-Din and his family killed on 13 April 1635 in [[Istanbul]], bringing an end to an era in the history of Lebanon, which would not regain its current boundaries until it was proclaimed a mandate state and republic in 1920.

Fakhr-al-Din was the first ruler in modern Lebanon to open the doors of his country to foreign Western influences. Under his auspices the French established a khān (hostel) in Sidon, the [[Florentine]]s a consulate, and Christian missionaries were admitted into the country. Beirut and Sidon, which Fakhr-al-Din beautified, still bear traces of his benign rule.

===Shihab Dynasty===
{{Main|Shihab family}}
[[File:Druzewomantantur.jpg|thumb|right|Druze woman wearing a [[tantour]], [[Chouf]], Lebanon – 1870s]]
As early as the days of [[Saladin]], and while the Ma'ans were still in complete control over southern Lebanon, the Shihab tribe, originally [[Hijaz]] Arabs but later settled in Ḥawran, advanced from Ḥawran, in 1172, and settled in [[Wadi al-Taym]] at the foot of mount [[Hermon]]. They soon made an alliance with the Ma'ans and were acknowledged as the Druze chiefs in ''Wadi al-Taym''. At the end of the 17th century (1697) the Shihabs succeeded the Ma'ans in the feudal leadership of Druze southern Lebanon, although they reportedly professed Sunni Islam, they showed sympathy with Druzism, the religion of the majority of their subjects.

The Shihab leadership continued until the middle of the 19th century and culminated in the illustrious governorship of [[Bashir Shihab II|Amir Bashir Shihab II]] (1788–1840) who, after Fakhr-al-Din, was the most powerful feudal lord Lebanon produced. Though governor of the Druze Mountain, Bashir was a crypto-Christian, and it was he whose aid [[Napoleon]] solicited in 1799 during his campaign against Syria.

Having consolidated his conquests in Syria (1831–38), [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], son of the viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]], made the fatal mistake of trying to disarm the Christians and Druzes of the Lebanon and to draft the latter into his army. This was contrary to the principles of the life of independence which these mountaineers had always lived, and resulted in a general uprising against Egyptian rule. The uprising was encouraged, for political reasons, by the British. The Druzes of Wadi al-Taym and Ḥawran, under the leadership of [[Shibli al-Aryan]], distinguished themselves in their stubborn resistance at their inaccessible headquarters, ''al-Laja'', lying southeast of Damascus.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

===Qaysites and the Yemenites===
{{Main|Battle of Ain Darra}}
[[File:DruzeOttomanHakim.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting of Druze and Ottoman leaders in [[Damascus]], about the control of Jebel Druze]]
The conquest of Syria by the Muslim Arabs in the middle of the seventh century introduced into the land two political factions later called the [[Qaysites]] and the [[Yemenites]].  The Qaysite party represented the Ḥijaz and [[Bedouin]] Arabs who were regarded as inferior by the Yemenites who were earlier and more cultured emigrants into Syria from southern Arabia.  Druzes and Christians grouped in political rather than religious parties so the party lines in Lebanon obliterated racial and religious lines and the people grouped themselves regardless of their religious affiliations, into one or the other of these two parties. The sanguinary feuds between these two factions depleted, in course of time, the manhood of the Lebanon and ended in the decisive [[battle of Ain Dara]] in 1711, which resulted in the utter defeat of the Yemenite party. Many Yemenite Druzes thereupon immigrated to the [[Hawran]] region and thus laid the foundation of Druze power there.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

===Civil War of 1860===
{{Main|1860 Lebanon conflict}}
The Druzes and their Christian [[Maronite]] neighbors, who had thus far lived as religious communities on friendly terms, entered a period of social disturbance in the year 1840, which culminated in the [[1860 Lebanon conflict|civil war of 1860]].{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

After the [[Shehab dynasty]] converted to Christianity, the Druze community and feudal leaders came under attack from the regime with the collaboration of the Catholic Church, and the Druze lost most of their political and feudal powers. Also, the Druze formed an alliance with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and allowed Protestant missionaries to enter Mount Lebanon, creating tension between them and the Catholic Maronites, who were supported by the French.

The [[Maronite]]-Druze conflict in 1840–60 was an outgrowth of the Maronite Christian independence movement{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}, directed against the Druze, Druze feudalism, and the Ottoman-Turks. The civil war was not therefore a religious war{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}, except in Damascus, where it spread and where the vastly non-Druze population was anti-Christian{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}. The movement culminated with the 1859–60 massacre and defeat of the Christians by the Druzes. The civil war of 1860 cost the Christians some ten thousand lives in [[Damascus]], [[Zahlé]], [[Deir al-Qamar]], [[Hasbaya]], and other towns of Lebanon.

The European powers then determined to intervene, and authorized the landing in Beirut of a body of French troops under [[Charles-Marie-Napoléon de Beaufort d'Hautpoul|General Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], whose inscription can still be seen on the historic rock at the mouth of [[Nahr al-Kalb]]. French intervention on behalf of the Maronites did not help the Maronite national movement, since France was restricted in 1860 by Britain, which did not want the [[Ottoman Empire]] dismembered. But European intervention pressured the Turks to treat the Maronites more justly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1478-1913.1977.tb03313.x | last1 = Abraham | first1 = Antoine | year = 1977 | title = Lebanese Communal Relations | journal = Muslim World | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 91–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the recommendations of the powers, the Ottoman Porte granted Lebanon local autonomy, guaranteed by the powers, under a Christian governor.

===Rebellion in Hauran===
{{main|Hauran Druze Rebellion}}
The Hauran rebellion was a violent Druze uprising against Ottoman authority in the Syrian province, which erupted in 1909. The rebellion was led by al-Atrash family in an aim to gain independence, but ended in brutal suppression of the Druze, significant depopulation of the Hauran region and execution of the Druze leaders in 1910.

==Modern history==
In Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, the Druze have official recognition as a separate religious community with its own religious court system. Druze are known for their loyalty to the countries they reside in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 3 October 2010 | url= http://pajamasmedia.com/michaeltotten/2010/10/03/the-tower-of-the-sun/ |title=The Tower of the Sun | first = Michael J | last = Totten | publisher = Pajamas Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they have a strong community feeling, in which they identify themselves as related even across borders of countries.&lt;ref name =lexicorient&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/druze.htm  |title=Druze | first =Tore | last = Kjeilen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their practice of blending with dominant groups to avoid persecution, and because the Druze religion does not endorse separatist sentiments but urges blending with the communities they reside in, the Druze have had a history of resistance to occupying powers, and they have at times enjoyed more freedom than most other groups living in the Levant.&lt;ref name=lexicorient /&gt;

In Syria, most Druze live in the [[Jebel al-Druze]], a rugged and mountainous region in the southwest of the country, which is more than 90 percent Druze inhabited; some 120 villages are exclusively so.&lt;ref name=landis&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/Joshua_Landis_Druze_and_Shishakli.htm |title=Shishakli and the Druzes: Integration and intransigence | first = Joshua | last = Landis |work=The Syrian Land: Processes of Integration and Fragmentation | location = Stuttgart | publisher = Franz Steiner Verlag | year = 1998 | pages = 369–96 | editor1-first =T | editor1-last = Philipp | editor2-first = B | editor2-last = Schäbler}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Flag of Druze.svg|thumb|right|Flag of [[Jabal el Druze (state)|Jabal el Druze]] representing the five Druze principles(خمس حدود); other variations of the flag exist]]
The Druze always played a far more important role in Syrian politics than its comparatively small population would suggest. With a community of little more than 100,000 in 1949, or roughly three percent of the Syrian population, the Druze of Syria's southwestern mountains constituted a potent force in Syrian politics and played a leading role in the nationalist struggle against the French. Under the military leadership of [[Sultan Pasha al-Atrash]], the Druze provided much of the military force behind the [[Great Syrian Revolt|Syrian Revolution]] of 1925–27.  In 1945, [[Amir Hasan al-Atrash]], the paramount political leader of the Jebel al-Druze, led the Druze military units in a successful revolt against the French, making the Jebel al-Druze the first and only region in Syria to liberate itself from French rule without British assistance. At independence the Druze, made confident by their successes, expected that Damascus would reward them for their many sacrifices on the battlefield. They demanded to keep their autonomous administration and many political privileges accorded them by the French and sought generous economic assistance from the newly independent government.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

[[File:SyrianDouroze.jpg|thumb|left|Druze leaders meeting in [[Jebel al-Druze]], Syria, 1926]]
Well-led by the Atrash household and jealous of their reputation as Arab nationalists and proud warriors, the Druze leaders refused to be beaten into submission by Damascus or cowed by threats. When a local paper in 1945 reported that President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] (1943–49) had called the Druzes a &quot;dangerous minority&quot;, Sultan Pasha al-Atrash flew into a rage and demanded a public retraction.  If it were not forthcoming, he announced, the Druzes would indeed become &quot;dangerous&quot; and a force of 4,000 Druze warriors would &quot;occupy the city of Damascus.&quot; Quwwatli could not dismiss Sultan Pasha's threat. The military balance of power in Syria was tilted in favor of the Druzes, at least until the military build up during the 1948 War in Palestine. One advisor to the Syrian Defense Department warned in 1946 that the Syrian army was &quot;useless&quot;, and that the Druzes could &quot;take Damascus and capture the present leaders in a breeze.&quot;&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

During the four years of [[Adib Shishakli]]'s rule in Syria (December 1949 to February 1954) (on 25 August 1952: [[Adib al-Shishakli]] created the [[Arab Liberation Movement]] (ALM), a progressive party with [[pan-Arabist]] and socialist views),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.syrianhistory.com/node/3379 | title = Syrian History}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Druze community was subjected to a heavy attack by the Syrian regime. Shishakli believed that among his many opponents in Syria, the Druzes were the most potentially dangerous, and he was determined to crush them. He frequently proclaimed: &quot;My enemies are like a serpent: the head is the Jebel al-Druze, the stomach [[Homs]], and the tail Aleppo. If I crush the head the serpent will die.&quot; Shishakli dispatched 10,000 regular troops to occupy the Jebel al-Druze.  Several towns were bombarded with heavy weapons, killing scores of civilians and destroying many houses. According to Druze accounts, Shishakli encouraged neighboring bedouin tribes to plunder the defenseless population and allowed his own troops to run amok.&lt;ref name = landis /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Shishakli launched a brutal campaign to defame the Druzes for their religion and politics. He accused the entire community of treason, at times claiming they were agents of the British and [[Hashemite|Hashimites]], at others that they were fighting for Israel against the Arabs. He even produced a cache of Israeli weapons allegedly discovered in the Jabal. Even more painful for the Druze community was his publication of &quot;falsified Druze religious texts&quot; and false testimonials ascribed to leading Druze sheikhs designed to stir up sectarian hatred. This propaganda also was broadcast in the Arab world, mainly Egypt. Shishakli was assassinated in Brazil on 27 September 1964 by a Druze seeking revenge for Shishakli's bombardment of the Jebel al-Druze.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

He forcibly integrated minorities into the national [[Syrian]] social structure, his &quot;Syrianization&quot; of [[Alawite]] and Druze territories had to be accomplished in part using violence, he declared: &quot;My enemies are like serpent. The head is the [[Jabal Druze]], if I crush the head the serpent will die&quot; (Seale 1963:132).&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;  To this end, al-Shishakli encouraged the stigmatization of minorities. He saw minority demands as tantamount to treason. His increasingly chauvinistic notions of Arab nationalism were predicated on the denial that &quot;minorities&quot; existed in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ecTTlytIjswC&amp;pg=PA41 | title = Books | publisher = Google}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

After the Shishakli's military campaign, the Druze community lost a lot of its political influence, but many Druze military officers played an important role when it comes to the [[Baath Party|Baathist]] regime currently ruling Syria.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

===In Lebanon===
[[File:Prophet Job Shrine.jpg|thumb|[[Job (Bible)|Prophet Job]] shrine in Lebanon the [[Chouf]] region]]
The Druze community played an important role in the formation of the modern state of Lebanon, and even though they are a minority they played an important role in the Lebanese political scene. Before and during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–90), the Druze were in favor of [[Pan-Arabism]] and Palestinian resistance represented by the [[PLO]]. Most of the community supported the [[Progressive Socialist Party]] formed by their leader [[Kamal Jumblatt]] and they fought alongside other leftist and Palestinian parties against the [[Lebanese Front]] that was mainly constituted of Christians. After the assassination of Kamal Jumblatt on 16 March 1977, his son [[Walid Jumblatt]] took the leadership of the party and played an important role in preserving his father's legacy and sustained the existence of the Druze community during the sectarian bloodshed that lasted until 1990.

In August 2001, [[Maronite Catholic]] [[Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir|Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir]] toured the predominantly Druze Chouf region of Mount Lebanon and visited [[Mukhtara]], the ancestral stronghold of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. The tumultuous reception that Sfeir received not only signified a historic reconciliation between Maronites and Druze, who fought a bloody war in 1983–84, but underscored the fact that the banner of Lebanese sovereignty had broad multi-confessional appeal&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Meib | url = http://www.meib.org/articles/0305_ld.htm | format = dossier | title = Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir | month = May | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a cornerstone for the [[Cedar Revolution]].  The second largest political party supported by Druze is the [[Lebanese Democratic Party]] led by [[Talal Arslan|Prince Talal Arslan]], the son of Lebanese independence hero [[Emir Majid Arslan II|Emir Majid Arslan]].

===In Israel===
{{main|Israeli Druze}}
The Druze form a religious minority in [[Israel]] of more than 100,000, mostly residing in the  north of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/druze.html | contribution = The Druze | title = Jewish virtual library | accessdate =23 January 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, a small community of Druze in the Golan Heights came under Israeli rule, now growing to about 20,000 strong - only 500 of which hold Israeli citizenship (the rest holding resident status). In 2004, there were 102,000 Druze living in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;idr&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = Identity Repertoires among Arabs in Israel | first1 = Muhammad | last1 = Amara | first2 = Izhak | last2 = Schnell | journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies | volume = 30 | year = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the population of Israeli Druze citizens grew to over 125,000.

In 1957, the Israeli government designated the Druze a distinct ethnic community at the request of its communal leaders. The Druze are [[Arabic]]-speaking citizens of Israel, who are drafted into mandatory service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Members of the community have attained top positions in Israeli politics and public service.&lt;ref name=&quot;theisraelproject1&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ewJXKcOUJlIaG&amp;b=7721235&amp;ct=11546191#.TvwjLdXLa0M | title = Religious Freedoms: Druze | publisher = The Israel project | accessdate =23 January 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Druze parliament members usually exceeds their proportion in the Israeli population, integrated within several political parties.

==Beliefs of the Druze==
The Druze are considered to be a social group as well as a religious sect, but not a distinct ethnic group. Also complicating their identity is the custom of [[Taqiya]]—concealing or disguising their beliefs when necessary—that they adopted from Shia Islam and the esoteric nature of the faith, in which many teachings are kept secretive.  Druze in different states can have radically different lifestyles.  Some claim to be Muslim, some do not.  The Druze faith is said to abide by Islamic principles, but they tend to be separatist in their treatment of Druze-hood, and their religion differs from mainstream Islam on a number of fundamental points.{{Sfn | Dana | p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=2nCWIsyZJxUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=druze+population+lebanon&amp;source=web&amp;ots=XpkTcA-TUj&amp;sig=0K6Vh-8YA-A6_CUCH619FPd5EJw#PPA18,M1  18]}}

===God in the Druze faith===
The Druze conception of the deity is declared by them to be one of strict and uncompromising unity. The main Druze doctrine states that God is both [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[Immanence|immanent]], in which he is above all attributes but at the same time he is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Druze Faith | first = Sami Nasib | last = Makarem}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their desire to maintain a rigid confession of unity, they stripped from God all attributes (''[[Tanzih|tanzīh]]'') which may lead to [[polytheism]] (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'').  In God, there are no attributes distinct from his essence. He is wise, mighty, and just, not by wisdom, might and justice, but by his own essence. God is &quot;the whole of existence&quot;, rather than &quot;above existence&quot; or on his throne, which would make him &quot;limited.&quot; There is neither &quot;how&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, nor &quot;where&quot; about him; he is incomprehensible.&lt;ref name= swayd&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eial.org/mesp/Swayd.rtf.rtf | title = Druze Spirituality and Asceticism | first = Dr. Samy | last = Swayd, SDSU | format = an abridged rough draft | publisher = Eial | format = [[RTF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

In this dogma, they are similar to the semi-philosophical, semi-religious body which flourished under [[Al-Ma'mun]] and was known by the name of [[Mu'tazila]] and the fraternal order of the [[Brethren of Purity]] ''(Ikhwan al-Ṣafa)''.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Unlike the ''Mu'tazilla'', however, and similar to some branches of [[Sufism]], the Druze believe in the concept of ''[[Tajalli]]'' (meaning &quot;[[theophany]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=swayd/&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}} ''Tajalli'', which is more often misunderstood by scholars and writers and is usually confused with the concept of [[incarnation]],

::...is the core spiritual beliefs {{sic}} in the Druze and some other intellectual and spiritual traditions....  In a mystical sense, it refers to the light of God experienced by certain mystics who have reached a high level of purity in their spiritual journey.  Thus, God is perceived as the [[Lahut]] [the divine] who manifests His Light in the Station ([[Maqaam]]) of the [[Nasut]] [material realm] without the Nasut becoming Lahut.  This is like one's image in the mirror: one is in the mirror but does not become the mirror.  The Druze manuscripts are emphatic and warn against the belief that the Nasut is God....  Neglecting this warning, individual seekers, scholars, and other spectators have considered al-Hakim and other figures divine.

::...In the Druze scriptural view, Tajalli 'takes a central stage.' One author comments that Tajalli occurs when the seeker's humanity is annihilated so that divine attributes and light are experienced by the person.&quot;&lt;ref name=swayd/&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

The concept of God incarnating either as or in a human seems &quot;to contradict with what the Druze scriptural view has to teach about the Oneness of God, while tajalli {{sic}} is at the center of the Druze and some other, often mystical, traditions.&quot;&lt;ref name = swayd /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

===Scriptures===
Druze Sacred texts include the [[Kitab Al Hikma]] (Epistles of Wisdom).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.druze.org.au/religion/ | title = Religion | publisher = Druze | place = AU}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctuaries===
The prayer-houses of the Druze are called khalwa or [[khalwat]] and are used in place of [[mosque]]s. The primary [[sanctuary]] of the Druze is at [[Khalwat al-Bayada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dānā2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Nissîm Dānā|title=The Druze in the Middle East: Their Faith, Leadership, Identity and Status|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2nCWIsyZJxUC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=11 September 2012|year=2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-903900-36-9|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esotericism===
The Druze believe that many teachings given by prophets, religious leaders and holy books have esoteric meanings preserved for those of intellect, in which some teachings are [[symbolism|symbolic]] and [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature, and divide the understanding of holy books and teachings into three layers.
These layers, according to the Druze, are:
* The obvious or [[exoteric]] ''([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]])'', accessible to anyone who can read or hear;
* The hidden or [[esoteric]] ''([[Batin (Islam)|batin]])'', accessible to those who are willing to search and learn through the concept of [[exegesis]]; and
* The hidden of the hidden, a concept known as ''[[anagoge]]'', inaccessible to all but a few really enlightened individuals who truly understand the nature of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3694809 |publisher=BBC | title = h2g2 | place = UK | contribution = The Druze}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some Islamic esoteric movements, known as the ''[[Batiniyya|batinids]]'' at that time, the Druzes don't believe that the esoteric meaning abrogates or necessarily abolishes the exoteric one. Hamza bin Ali refutes such claims by stating that if the esoteric interpretation of ''[[taharah]]'' (purity) is purity of the heart and soul, it doesn't mean that a person can discard his physical purity, as ''[[salah]]'' (prayer) is useless if a person is untruthful in his speech and that the esoteric and exoteric meanings complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = The Epistle Answering the People of Esotericism ''(batinids)'' | title = Epistles of Wisdom | volume = Second | format = a rough translation from the Arabic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precepts of the Druze faith===
{{Main|Seven pillars of Ismailism}}
The Druze follow seven precepts that are considered the core of the faith, and are perceived by them as the essence of the [[pillars of Islam]].
The Seven Druze precepts are:
#Veracity in speech and the truthfulness of the tongue.
#Protection and mutual aid to the brethren in faith.
#Renunciation of all forms of former worship ''(specifically,  invalid creeds)'' and false belief.
#Repudiation of the devil ''([[Iblis]])'', and all forces of evil (translated from Arabic ''Toghyan'' meaning ''&quot;[[despotism]]&quot;'').
#Confession of God's unity.
#Acquiescence in God's acts no matter what they be.
#Absolute submission and resignation to God's divine will in both secret and public.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924 | p = 51}}

==Religious symbol==

[[File:Druze star.svg|thumb|70px|right]] The Druze strictly avoid [[iconography]] but use five colors as a religious symbol: green, red, yellow, blue, and white. Each color pertains to a metaphysical power called ''{{unicode|Haad}}'', literally meaning a limit, as in the limits that separate humans from animals, or the powers that makes the animal body human.  Each ''{{unicode|Haad}}'' is color coded in the following manner:  green for ''{{unicode|Aql}}'' &quot;the Universal Mind/[[Nous]]&quot;, red for ''{{unicode|Nafs}}'' &quot;the Universal Soul/[[Anima mundi]]&quot;, yellow for ''{{unicode|Kalima}}'' &quot;the Word/[[Logos]]&quot;, blue for ''{{unicode|Sabiq}}'' &quot;the Potentiality/Cause/Precedent&quot;, and white for ''{{unicode|Tali}}'' &quot;the Future/Effect/[[Immanence]]&quot;. The mind generates [[qualia]] and gives consciousness. The soul embodies the mind and is responsible for transmigration and the character of oneself.  The word which is the atom of language communicates [[qualia]] between humans and represent the platonic forms in the sensible world. The ''{{unicode|Sabq}}'' and ''{{unicode|Tali}}'' is the ability to perceive and learn from the past and plan for the future and predict it.

The colors can be arranged in a vertically descending stripes or a [[five-pointed star]].  The stripes is a diagrammatic cut of the spheres in neoplatonic philosophy while the five pointed star embodies the [[golden ratio]], [[phi]], as a symbol of temperance and a life of moderation.

==ʻUqqāl and Juhhāl==
[[File:Druze man.jpg|thumb|Druze [[Sheikh]] (ʻUqqāl) wearing religious dress]]

The Druze are divided into two groups. The largely secular majority, called ''al-Juhhāl'' (جهال) (&quot;the Ignorant&quot;) are not granted access to the Druze holy literature or allowed to attend the initiated ''Uqqal'''s religious meetings.  They are around 80% of the Druze population and are not obliged to follow the ascetic traditions of the ''Uqqal''.

The initiated religious group, which includes both men and women (about 20% of the population), is called ''al-ʻUqqāl'' (عقال), (&quot;the Knowledgeable Initiates&quot;). They have a special mode of dress designed to comply with Quranic traditions. Women can opt to wear ''al-mandīl'', a loose white [[veil]], especially in the presence of other people. They wear ''al-mandīl'' on their heads to cover their hair and wrap it around their mouths and sometimes over their noses as well. They wear black shirts and long skirts covering their legs to their ankles. Male ''ʻuqqāl'' grow mustaches, and wear dark Levantine/Turkish traditional dresses, called the ''shirwal'', with white turbans that vary according to the ''Uqqal'''s hierarchy.

''Al-ʻuqqāl'' have equal rights to ''al-Juhhāl'', but establish a hierarchy of respect based on religious service.The most influential 5% of ''Al-ʻuqqāl'' become ''[[Ajawīd]]'', recognized religious leaders, and from this group the spiritual leaders of the Druze are assigned. While the ''[[Shaykh]] al-ʻAql'', which is an official position in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, is elected by the local community and serves as the head of the Druze religious council, judges from the Druze religious courts are usually elected for this position. Unlike the spiritual leaders, the ''[[Shaykh]] al-ʻAql's'' authority is local to the country he is elected in, though in some instances spiritual leaders are elected to this position.

The Druze believe in the unity of God, and are often known as the &quot;People of Monotheism&quot; or simply &quot;Monotheists&quot;. Their [[theology]] has a [[Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonic]] view about how God interacts with the world through emanations and is similar to some [[gnosticism|gnostic]] and other [[esotericism|esoteric]] sects. Druze philosophy also shows [[Sufi]] influences.

Druze principles focus on honesty, loyalty, [[filial piety]], [[altruism]], patriotic sacrifice, and [[monotheism]]. They reject [[tobacco smoking]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], and consumption of pork. Also, in contrast to most Islamic sects, the Druze reject [[polygamy]], believe in [[reincarnation]], and are not obliged to observe most of the religious rituals. The Druze believe that rituals are symbolic and have an individualistic effect on the person, for which reason Druze are free to perform them, or not. The community does celebrate [[Eid al-Adha]], however, considered their most significant holiday.

==Origins of the Druze people==

===Ethnic origins===
The Druze faith extended to many areas in the Middle East, but most of the surviving modern Druze can trace their origin to the ''Wadi al-Taymour '' in [[South Lebanon]], which is named after an Arab tribe ''Taymour-Allah  (formerly Taymour-Allat) '' which, according to Islamic historian, [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], first came from Arabia into the valley of the [[Euphrates]] where they were Christianized prior to their migration into the Lebanon. Many of the Druze feudal families whose genealogies have been preserved by the two modern Syrian chroniclers [[Haydar al-Shihabi]] and [[Ahmad Faris Shidyaq|al-Shidyaq]] seem also to point in the direction of this origin. Arabian tribes emigrated via the [[Persian Gulf]] and stopped in Iraq on the route that was later to lead them to Syria. The first feudal Druze family, the [[Tanukh]] family, which made for itself a name in fighting the Crusaders, was, according to Haydar al-Shihabi, an Arab tribe from [[Mesopotamia]] where it occupied the position of a ruling family and apparently was Christianized.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

The Tanukhs must have left [[Arabia]] as early as the second or third century A.D. The [[Ma'an]] tribe, which superseded the Tanukhs and produced the greatest Druze hero in history, [[Fakhreddin II|Fakhr-al-Din]], had the same traditional origin. The ''Talhuq'' family and '' 'Abd-al-Malik'', who supplied the later Druze leadership, have the same record as the Tanukhs. The [[Imad]] family is named for ''al-Imadiyyah'' — the Kurdish town of [[Amadiya]], northeast of [[Mosul]] inside [[Kurdistan]], and, like the [[Jumblatt]]s, is thought to be of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] origin. The [[Arsalan]] family claims descent from the [[Hirah]] Arab kings, but the name ''Arsalan'' (Persian and Turkish for lion) suggests Persian influence, if not origin.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

The 1911 edition of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] states that the Druzes are &quot;a mixture of refugee stocks, in which the Arab largely predominates, grafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic blood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/DRO_ECG/DRUSES_or_DRUZES_Arab_Druz_.html | year = 1911
|title= Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution = DRUSES, or DRUZES (Arab. Druz)
|quote=There is good reason to regard the Druses as, racially, a mixture of refugee stocks, in which the Arab largely predominates, grafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic blood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish contemporary literature, the Druze, who were visited by Benjamin of Tudela, were described as descendants of the [[Itureans]] — an Ismaelite Arab tribe, which used to reside in the northern parts of the [[Golan Heights|Golan plateau]] through Hellenistic and Roman periods.

Nevertheless, many scholars formed their own hypotheses: for example, [[Lamartine]] (1835) discovered in the modern Druzes the remnants of the [[Samaritans]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Voyage | last = Lamartine | volume = II | year = 1835 | page = 109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon|Earl of Carnarvon]] (1860), those of the [[Cuthites]] whom [[Esarhaddon]] transplanted into [[Palestine]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Recollections of the Druses of Lebanon | place = London | year = 1860 | pages = 42–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Felix von Luschan]] (1911), according to his conclusions from [[anthropometric]] measurements, makes the Druze, [[Maronites]], and [[Alawites]] of Syria, together with the [[Bektashis]], '[[Ahl-e Haqq|Ali-Ilahis]], and [[Yezidis]] of [[Asia Minor]] and Persia, the modern representatives of the ancient [[Hittites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | place = London | year = 1911 | page = 241}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century, there were two branches of Druze living in Lebanon: the [[Yemeni Druze]], headed by the [[Hamdan]] and [[Al-Atrash]] families; and the [[Kaysi Druze]], headed by the [[Jumblat]] and [[Arsalan]] families.

The [[Al-Hamdan|Hamdan]] family was banished from [[Mount Lebanon]] following the [[battle of Ain Dara]] in 1711.  The battle was fought between two Druze factions: the Yemeni and the Kaysi.  Following their dramatic defeat, the Yemeni faction migrated to Syria in the [[Jebel-Druze]] region and its capital, [[Soueida]]. However, it has been argued that these two factions were of political nature rather than ethnic, and had both Christian and Druze supporters.

Druhyus were described in Rigveda. Sudas, the king of a vast region between rivers Saraswati, Drishadvati and Yamuna was follower of the famous vedic seers- Vasishtha and vishwamitra. Ten kings from the kingdom of the west and northwest lead by Druhyus challanged sudas. Sudas defeated these kings at the battle of kurukshetra. In another battle near Mathura, he also defeated Turvashas from the east. This war is considered a major event of Rigvedic period. Many scholars believe that the present day population of Druze in Lebanon and Syria of the Middle East migrated after the wars- mainly Mandhata's and suda's wars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Genetics===
In a 2005 study of [[ASPM (gene)|ASPM gene variants]], Mekel-Bobrov et al. found that the [[Israelis|Israeli]] Druze people of the [[Mount Carmel|Carmel region]] have among the highest rate of the newly evolved ASPM [[haplogroup D]], at 52.2% occurrence of the approximately 6,000-year-old allele.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/309/5741/1720 | title = Ongoing Adaptive Evolution of ASPM, a Brain Size Determinant in Homo sapiens | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | date = 9 September 2005 | volume = 309 | number = 5741 | pages = 1720–22 | doi=10.1126/science.1116815}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not yet known exactly what selective advantage is provided by this gene variant, the haplogroup D allele is thought to be positively selected in populations and to confer some substantial advantage that has caused its frequency to rapidly increase.

According to [[DNA]] testing, Druze are remarkable for the high frequency (35%) of males who carry the [[Y-chromosome|Y-chromosomal]] [[Haplogroup L (Y-DNA)|haplogroup L]], which is otherwise uncommon in the Mideast (Shen et al. 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2004 | format = [[PDF]] | last = Shen | url = http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Shen2004.pdf | title = Evolutsioon | publisher = UT | place = EE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This haplogroup originates from prehistoric [[South Asia]] and has spread from [[Pakistan]] into southern [[Iran]].

Cruciani in 2007 found E1b1b1a2 (E-V13) [one from Sub Clades of E1b1b1a1 (E-V12)] in high levels (&gt;10% of the male population) in Turkish Cypriot and Druze Arab lineages. Recent genetic clustering analyses of ethnic groups are consistent with the close ancestral relationship between the Druze and Cypriots, and also identified similarity to the general Syrian and Lebanese populations, as well as a variety of Jewish groups (Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Iraqi, and Moroccan) (Behar et al 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = Nature | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature09103.pdf | title = The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a new study concluded that the Druze harbor a remarkable diversity of [[human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] lineages that appear to have separated from each other thousands of years ago. But instead of dispersing throughout the world after their separation, the full range of lineages can still be found within the Druze population.&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080508182219.htm | publisher = American Technion Society | date = 12 May 2008| title = Genetics Confirm Oral Traditions of Druze In Israel | journal = ScienceDaily}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers noted that the Druze villages contained a striking range of high frequency and high diversity of the [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X haplogroup]], suggesting that this population provides a glimpse into the past genetic landscape of the [[Near East]] at a time when the X haplogroup was more prevalent.&lt;ref name=dna/&gt;

These findings are consistent with the Druze [[oral tradition]], that claims that the adherents of the faith came from diverse ancestral lineages stretching back tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref name=dna /&gt;
