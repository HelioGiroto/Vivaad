The '''Neocatechumenal Way''', also known as the '''Neocatechumenate''', '''NCW''' or, colloquially, '''The Way''', is a group within the [[Catholic Church]] that focuses on the formation of  Christian adults. It was formed in [[Madrid]] in 1964 by [[Kiko Argüello]] and [[Carmen Hernández]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Decree Statutes | url = http://www.camminoneocatecumenale.it/public/file/it_decreto2008.pdf}}([[WP:PSTS|primary source]])&lt;/ref&gt; and received approval from the [[Holy See]] in 2008.

Taking its inspiration from the [[catechumenate]] of the early Catholic Church, by which [[Religious conversion|converts]] from [[paganism]] were prepared for [[baptism]], it provides post-baptismal formation to adults who are already members of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''post-baptismal catechumenate'' is also used in the §1231 of the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church], related to the teaching of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] itself, “By its very nature infant Baptism requires a post-baptismal catechumenate.”&lt;/ref&gt; It also runs 85 seminaries in various locations, and is responsible for hundreds of &quot;[[families in mission]],&quot; living in many cities around the World.

The Neocatechumenate is implemented in small, [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parish]]-based communities of between 20-50 people. There are around 40,000 such communities throughout the World, with an estimated  million members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-19743?l=english Kiko Argüello meets with Benedict XVI] (27 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Neocatechumenal Way==

The Neocatechumenal Way arose in 1964 through the work of [[Kiko Argüello|Francisco &quot;Kiko&quot; Argüello]] and  [[Carmen Hernández]] to evangelize the slums of [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hayes, New Religious Movements in the Catholic Church 12 (2006); ''see also'' http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/pclneoca.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, their message was embodied in a catechetical synthesis, founded on what they called the &quot;[[tripod (Neocatechumanate precept)|tripod]]&quot; (&quot;[[Scripture|Word of God]]-[[Liturgy]]-[[Community]]&quot;), seeking to lead people to [[Communion (Christian)|fraternal communion]] and mature [[faith]].

This new [[Catechism|catechetical]] experience, born in the wake of the [[Second Vatican Council]], attracted the interest of Madrid's Archbishop, [[:es:Casimiro Morcillo]], who encouraged Argüello to spread it to parishes that asked for it.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.camminoneocatecumenale.it/it/statuti2a.asp Carmen Hernández speech says Morcillo visited the slums] (in Italian) June 28, 2002) ([[WP:PSTS|primary source]]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Way thus spread gradually through the [[Archdiocese of Madrid]] and to other Spanish [[dioceses]].

In 1968, Argüello and Hernández arrived in [[Rome]] and settled in the [[Borghetto Latino]]. With the permission of [[Angelo Dell'Acqua]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Clergy#Catholic clergy|Father]] Dino Torreggiani (1905-1983), wrote a presentation letter to Card. Dell'Acqua (source: ''[http://www.catechumenium.it/default.asp?cod=&amp;t=21&amp;dett=746&amp;pag=14 Kiko, Dossetti e 'le ironie della sorte' (Catechumenium.it)]'') [[WP:PSTS|primary source]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vicar#Catholic_Church|Vicar-General]] of [[Rome]], the first catechesis began in the [[parish]] of [[Nostra Signora del Santissimo Sacramento e Santi Martiri Canadesi|Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament and the Canadian Martyrs]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Since then, the Way has continued to spread to [[diocese]]s and [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_pc_laity_doc_20020701_cammino-neocatecumenale_en.html Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way], June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership and governance==

The Neocatechumenate is led by the &quot;International Responsible Team of the Way&quot;: Argüello, Hernández, and Fr. Mario Pezzi, a priest of the [[Diocese of Rome]]. Under the terms of the 2007 statute, the three members of this leadership team will remain in place for life, after which an electoral college of senior neocatechumenal catechists will elect a new team which, with the approval of the [[Pontifical Council for the Laity]], will have a mandate to lead the Way for a period of seven years until new elections are held.&lt;ref&gt;Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way, Title VI, Art. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership at national and regional levels rests in approximately seven hundred teams of &quot;itinerant catechists,&quot; comprising a [[priest]] and two or three [[Laity#Roman Catholicism|laymen]], appointed and supervised by the International Responsible Team. Depending on the number of communities in a particular area, a team of Itinerant Catechists may be responsible for the implementation of the NC Way in a country, a group of countries or a region of a country. [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] summarized the role of the itinerant catechists in December 1985:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They contribute by forming the first neocatechumenal communities of a parish, and are supposed to maintain regular contact with the Bishops of the diocese in which they work; the itinerant teams preserve a constant link with the responsibles of the Neocatechumenal Way, visiting periodically the communities they catechized and taking care of the development of the Neocatechumenal Way in the territory assigned to them, being fully faithful to the [[charism]] given to the initiators and obedient to the local [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Osservatore Romano]], 11 December 1985 (Italian edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The itinerant catechists do not make any formal commitment to their missionary role, and are free to resign at any time.

In June 2008 the Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way received final approval from the Vatican.

==Nature and mission of the Neocatechumenal communities==

The Way describes itself as a community—it resists terms such as organization or movement—“at the service of the [[Bishop]]s as a form of diocesan implementation of Christian initiation and of ongoing education in faith, in accordance with the indications of the Second Vatican Council and the [[Magisterium]] of the Church”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_pc_laity_doc_20020701_cammino-neocatecumenale_en.html Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way], Title I, Art. 1, § 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an ongoing education in faith and a service of catechesis.&lt;ref&gt;Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way, Title I, Art. 1, § 3.&lt;/ref&gt; From the initial catechesis, it typically takes several years and passing through stages of faith formation in the local communities, until a member reaches the renewal of the baptismal vows (or the baptism).

It is implemented in dioceses under the jurisdiction the bishop and the guidance of the Responsible Team of the Way “according to the lines proposed by its initiators”.&lt;ref&gt;Congregation For the Clergy, General Directory for Catechesis, 223: see c. 755 §1 CIC; c. 617 CCEO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way, Title I, Art. 2, citing John Paul II, letter ''Ogniqualvolta'', 30 August 1990, in [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] ''(AAS)'', nr. 82 (1990), page 1515.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missionary activity===

Responding to [[secularization]] the Way introduced a program called &quot;[[families in mission]]&quot;: Families serving to establish the presence of the Catholic Church in countries where there is none (this is referred as ''Implantatio Ecclesiae'') or to strengthen the presence of Catholic communities in particularly difficult areas.&lt;ref&gt;Homily of Pope John Paul II recorded in the Italian edition of ''L'Osservatore Romano'', 31 December 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2006, about 200 families met with Pope [[Benedict XVI]] asking for a missionary mandate before beginning their mission to [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and [[China]]—bringing the number Families in Mission to more than five-hundred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/january/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060112_neocatecumenali_en.html Benedict XVI speech] to Neocatechumenals (12 January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 the Way met with nine [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and 160 European [[bishops]] at the [[Domus Galilaeae|Domus Galilaeae International Center]] on the [[Mount of Beatitudes]] in [[Galilee]]. [[Cardinal Schönborn|Christoph Cardinal Schönborn]] said that during &quot;the last 40 years Europe has said ‘no’ to its future three times: in 1968 when it rejected '[[Humanae Vitae]]'; then, 20 years later, with the legalization of [[abortion]]; and today with [[Same-sex marriage|homosexual marriage]]s.&quot; He called the Neocatechumenal Way an &quot;answer of the [[Holy Spirit]] to this situation.&quot; A joint declaration from the bishops said &quot;[h]ere we have an important proposal, the proposal of the Neocatechumenal Way, which is to renew the life of the family.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-22170?l=english Neocatechumenal Way Saying &quot;Yes&quot; to Europe].&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2009, the pope met with over 10,000 people for a celebration marking the 40th anniversary of the Neocatechumenal Way in Rome. From this celebration several whole communities were sent on mission, along with itinerant catechists, mission families, and the ''Missio Ad Gentes'' (a newer form of mission that sends three to five families to a particular area at the request of the bishop).&lt;ref name=&quot;40 Years&quot;&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/january/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090110_neocatecumenali_en.html Address of his Holiness Benedict XVI to members of the Neocatechumenal Way on the occasion of the 40th Anniversary of its Origins in Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The World Youth Days===

Every three years, the [[World Youth Day]] has been organized by the Roman Catholic Church, during which the Pope summons youths from all over the world to a chosen city. The Way has been an active supporter of these, rallying its young members to attend. For instance, during [[World Youth Day 2008]] held in [[Sydney]], [[George Pell|George Cardinal Pell]] said that of the 110,000 international visitors that attended, 40,000 were from the Neocatechumenal Way,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydney.catholic.org.au/Archbishop/Homilies/2008/2008721_1012.shtml Homily of Cardinal Pell]&lt;/ref&gt; and some 300,000 attended Madrid World Youth Day{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

During the event, young members of the Neocatechumenal Way meet with Argüello for a &quot;vocational call.&quot; In [[Sydney]], for example, approximately 1,500 men answered the call for the priesthood and 850 young women stood up to show their willingness to a consecrated life, and in [[Bonn]] (2005) around 1,500 young men and another 900 young women answered the call. These young men and women begin a process of [[discernment]] in their own dioceses and communities, which may lead to [[priesthood]] (most of the priestly vocations go to a &quot;Redemptoris Mater&quot; seminary) or [[consecrated life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-13785?l=english Neocatechumenal Meeting Attracts 90,000] ([[Zenit News Agency]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Neocatechumenal Way in the Eastern Rites and the Holy Land===

During the Neocatechumenal Way vocational meeting held near the Sea of Galilee following [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s visit to the [[Holy Land]] in May 2009, Arguello described the Way's situation in the Holy Land, claiming thirty communities that follow several different Christian rites, and holding them up as an example of the ecumenical breakthrough.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} There are seven communities following the [[Latin Rite]], in [[Jaffa]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Nazareth]], [[Betlehem]] and [[Cana]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In March 2000, the Way opened its [[Domus Galilaeae]] formation center on the slopes of the [[Mount of Beatitudes]] in Israel. The facility is used for studies and retreat, Christian seminars and conventions.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In June 2007, [[Archbishop]] [[Elias Chacour]] proposed the establishment of a new &quot;branch&quot; of the Neocatechumenal Way &quot;to work specifically in the Eastern-rite Church.&quot; Archbp. Chacour stated in his message that he has searched for ''&quot;someone or some community to preach the Good News to my parishioners&quot;'' as an answer to [[proselytism]] of the sects, and that the Neocatechumenal Way is an answer. A spokesman for the Way reported the letter to [[Zenit News Agency|ZENIT]], saying that ''&quot;We share the sense of urgency expressed by Archbishop Chacour to evangelize 'the living stones' in the land of the Lord.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://zenit.org/article-19795?l=english Melkite Leader Invites Neocatechumenal Way] (Zenit).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Greek Catholic]] (Melchite) rite runs a [[Redemptoris Mater (seminary)|Redemptoris Mater Seminary]] within Domus Galilaeae, and has 12 neocatechumenal communities in several Palestinian villages: three each in [[Shefamer]], [[Tarshiha]] and [[Melia]], two in [[Ibilin]] and one in [[Cana]]. Additionally, there are two [[Maronite]] communities in Gish and Haifa, as well as two Hebrew-speaking communities in Haifa and Tel Aviv.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===The Redemptoris Mater Seminaries===
[[Image:Redemptoris Mater seminaries.png|thumb|The seal of Redemptoris Mater seminaries]]

The Way also operates several seminaries dubbed [[Redemptoris Mater (seminary)|''Redemptoris Mater'' seminaries]] which combines the priestly formation found in a [[seminary]] with the Christian formation received in a neocatechumenal community. Potential candidates often undergo a time of &quot;Pre Vocational Center&quot; before entering the seminary, which operates somewhat in the manner of a [[pre-med]] course, designed to prepare and awaken their vocations. 

The intent was to establish a seminary that was both ''international'', i.e. with vocations coming from different nations, and ''missionary'', i.e. upon ordination, the priests are available to go wherever their ordinary sends them,&lt;ref name=&quot;PBO&quot;&gt;(cfr. chapter 10 of [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19651207_presbyterorum-ordinis_en.html Presbyterorum Ordinis])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the first [[Redemptoris Mater (seminary)|Redemptoris Mater]] Seminary was established in Rome by [[Ugo Poletti|Ugo Cardinal Poletti]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mullaney, Incardination and the universal dimension of the priestly ministry 216 n.259 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and today there are Redemptoris Mater Seminaries all over the world in  places such as Managua (Nicaragua), Rome (Italy), Newark (NJ, USA), Madrid (Spain), Berlin (Germany), Guam, [[Sarajevo]] ([[Bosnia and Hercegovina]]), Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic), and [[Warsaw]] ([[Poland]]).

==The Statutes and the Catechetical Directory==
In 1997, [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] &quot;encouraged [Argüello and Hernández] to examine their thirty-year experience of the Way, and to formalize it with a written statute,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Leahy, Ecclesial Movements and Communities 68 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]] urged the drafting of the Statutes as &quot;a very important step that will open the way to the formal juridical recognition by the Church, and giving you a further guarantee of the authenticity of your charism&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camminoneocatecumenale.it/new/default.asp?lang=en&amp;page=statuto02_02] (citing Address to the Neocatechumenal Way, 25 January 1997, p. 4; ORE, 5 February 1997, p.9) ([[WP:PSTS|primary source]])&lt;/ref&gt; The Statutes drafted in response were approved ''ad experimentum'' for five years in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;During the process, Card. Ratzinger was elected [[Pope]], and at a Q&amp;A section in February 2007, responded to a question of how pastors should integrate movements in order to develop a real ministry of unity in the universal Church by talking about the Way:&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;For example, we ask ourselves whether, after five years of experience, it is possible to confirm definitively the Statutes for the Neocatechumenal Way, whether a trial period is necessary or whether, perhaps, certain elements of this structure need perfecting. In any case, I knew the Neocatechumenals from the very outset. It was a long Way, with many complications that still exist today, but we have found an ecclesial form that has already vastly improved the relationship between the Pastor and the Way. We are going ahead like this! The same can be said for other Movements.&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2007/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20070222_clergy-rome_en.html Lenten meeting with the clergy of Rome: Address of his Holiness Benedict XVI]&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 13, 2008, after review by five [[dicasteries]] and the [[Pontifical Council for the Laity]],{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Stanisław Ryłko|Stanislaw Cardinal Rylko]] published a decree containing the definitive approval of the statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way.&lt;ref name=&quot;final approval sources&quot;&gt;Multiple sources report this 
[http://www.zenit.org/article-22886?l=english Zenit], [http://www.oecumene.radiovaticana.org/en1/Articolo.asp?c=211963 Radio Vaticana] and [http://www.cbcpnews.com/?q=node/3226 CBC news]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Statutes'' describe the nature of the Way and regulate its charism and specific tasks within the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.camminoneocatecumenale.it/new/default.asp?lang=en| title = From the Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way - Nature of the Neocatechumenal Way| accessdate = October 21, 2011}} ([[WP:PSTS|primary source]])&lt;/ref&gt; Through them the Neocatechumenal Way was endowed with &quot;public juridical personality&quot; status.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/laity/documents/rc_pc_laity_doc_20051107_notiziario-2004-pc-laici_en.html#Juridical%20recognition%20and%20approval%20of%20statutes Pontifical Council for the Laity, Decree]&lt;/ref&gt; The Way is thus closely governed by an ecclesiastical authority, performs entrusted functions &quot;in the name of the church,&quot; and that it has no material goods of its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camminoneocatecumenale.it/new/default.asp?lang=en&amp;page=statuto08 Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way] Title 1 Art. 4 ([[WP:PSTS|primary source]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter alia, in article 13, the Statutes stated that the Masses of the communities must be &quot;open also to other faithful&quot;; that communion must be received &quot;standing&quot;; that for the biblical readings, only &quot;brief monitions&quot; of introduction are permitted, apart from the homily.

The Statutes refer to a ''Catechetical Directory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camminoneocatecumenale.it/new/default.asp?lang=es&amp;page=statuti]&lt;/ref&gt;'', which received Vatican approval at the end of 2010.

This originated with thirteen volumes of materials published by Argüello in 1972, based on his and Hernández's preaching, and titled the ''Orientations for the Teams of Catechists''. The ''Orientations'' were held in secret until 1997 when Cardinal Ratzinger ordered that they be handed over to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] for a doctrinal examination. The examination lasted until 2003, during which the Congregation made corrections and introduced about 2,000 references to parallel passages in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]].

After thorough examination by various Vatican dicasteries, on December  26, 2010 the Pontifical Council for the Laity approved the text of the catecheses which are handed on to neo-[[catechumen]]s during their itinerary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Decreto | url =

The world Seen from Rome| accessdate = October  20, 20110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgy==
The way regards [[liturgy]] as one of its three fundamental elements (''tripod''), along with the word of God and Christian community.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Statutes Art. 8 § 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paschal Mystery, celebrated in the ''Sacred Triduum'', is seen as a liturgical axis and source of Christian life and a fulcrum of the Neocatechumenate which leads to &quot;rediscovery&quot; of Christian initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Statutes Art. 12 § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Easter liturgical celebrations, the most important place is given to the Eucharist, which completes Christian initiation and builds a small community in which catechumens follow their &quot;itinerary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Statutes Art. 13 § 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four features of the Masses of the communities have been observed.

* They are celebrated in small groups, corresponding to the different stages of advancement on the catechetical journey.

* Each of the biblical readings of the Mass is preceded by an &quot;admonition&quot; by a member of the community and is followed, especially after the Gospel, by &quot;echoes,&quot; or personal reflections by many of those present. The priest's homily follows

* Communion also takes place in banquet form. The consecrated bread – a large unleavened loaf is broken and distributed to those present, who remain in their places. The priest then goes from one person to the next with the chalice of consecrated wine, which everyone drinks.

The [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] has watched the Way's liturgical practices from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Notice of the Congregation for the Divine Worship on the celebrations in the groups of the Neocatechumenal Way'', in L’Oss. Rom. (Italian), 24 December  1988&lt;/ref&gt; Pope John Paul II celebrated the Eucharist at the meeting with the communities in [[Porto San Giorgio]] in 1989, exactly as the communities do it, including the communion rite in a sitting position.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Cardinal]] [[Francis Arinze]], however, the Prefect of the Congregation from 2002 until 2008, was unwilling to accept the differences in the liturgy of the neocatechumenal Eucharist. In December 2005, he wrote a private letter to Arguello, Hernández and Pezzi on behalf of Pope Benedict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-15304?l=english On Liturgical Norms for the Neocatechumenal Way] (Zenit).&lt;/ref&gt; He warned that &quot;[i]n the celebration of the Holy Mass, the Neocatechumenal Way shall accept and follow the liturgical books approved by the Church, without omitting or adding anything.&quot; The letter directed members of the Way to adopt the prescribed method of receiving Holy Communion, to participate in parish life, and to celebrate Mass with the rest of the parish community on at least one Sunday each month.

The Way argues that Card. Arinze's letter has been superseded by the Final Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way insofar as it says that “the celebrations of the Eucharist of the neocatechumenal communities on Saturday evening are part of the Sunday liturgical pastoral work of the parish and are open also to other faithful.”&lt;ref&gt;Final Statute of the Neocatechumenal Way, Art. 13, § 3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Way argues that this means that by participating in the Saturday evening Eucharistic celebration with their communities, members of the Neocatechumenal Way are already partaking in the Holy Mass of the parish community.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In his ''Canonical Observations on the Definitive Approval of the Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way'', Msgr. [[Juan Arrieta]], Secretary of the [[Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts]], summarizes the liturgical concessions of the Neocatechumenal Way as follows: 

:“First, that the neocatechumens celebrate the Eucharist in the small community, after the First Vespers of Sunday. Second, that this celebration, after First Vespers takes place according to the disposition of the diocesan bishop. Third, that these celebrations [...] are part of the pastoral work and consequently are open to all the faithful. Fourth, that in these celebrations the liturgical books approved by the Roman Rite are followed, 'with the exception of the explicit concessions from the Holy See'  (always with unleavened bread), moving the rite of peace before the consecration, communion under both species, brief admonitions and echoes and, finally, a new way for the distribution of Communion: 'Regarding the distribution of Holy Communion under the two species, the neocatechumens receive standing, remaining at their place.'&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, Secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Legislative Texts, Canonical Observations of the Definitive Approval of the Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way, 2008, http://www.camminoneocatecumenale.it/new/default.asp?lang=en&amp;page=statuto08_4 ([[WP:PSTS|primary source]])&lt;/ref&gt; The faithful receive the precious body while standing, take seat and wait until all have received. Then the celebrant says 'Body of Christ, bring us everlasting life!' and the whole congregation consumes immediately after the priest consumes the host. The ''ecce Agnus Dei'' along with the ''Domine non sum dignus'' are typically recited but is sometimes omitted due to error on the part of the celebrant.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Sharing the cup takes place afterward, individually, while the faithful are standing at their seats and a priest or [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion]] carries the chalice around.

In an interview with the Spanish newspaper ''La Razón'', [[Antonio Cañizares Llovera|Antonio Cardinal Cañizares]], current Prefect of the [[Congregation for Divine Worship]], expressed his view on the Eucharistic celebration of the Neocatechumenal Way: 

:&quot;There are no liturgical anomalies [in the Eucharist]; everything is in full compliance of the guidelines of the ‘Ordo Missae.’ What I have really seen there are Eucharists celebrated without any hurry, with a great faith, and where you can perceive the joy and the thanksgiving for the gift which is being bestowed in the Eucharist.” &lt;ref&gt;Interview with Cardinal Antonio Cañizares, Prefect of the Congregation of Divine Worship, December 14, 2008 {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Statutes also mention the sacrament of Penance celebrated according to the rite of reconciliation for multiple penitents, with individual [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and [[absolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Statutes of the Neocatechumenal Way, Title II, Art. 14 § 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

The Neocatechumenal Way has encountered resistance and criticism from both clergy and theologians. After the Neocatechumenate was introduced into the parish of [[St Germain-des-Prés]] in Paris, for example, the [[Archbishop of Paris]], [[François Marty|François Cardinal Marty]], blocked any further expansion before his retirement in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Urquhart, The Pope's Armada: Unlocking the Secrets of Mysterious and Powerful New Sects in the Catholic Church, Bantam, 1995 p.109&lt;/ref&gt; and similar controversy in 1992 prompted the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nancy|Bishop of Nancy]] to transfer the neocatechumenals to a different.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McGrade, &quot;The Last Trojan Horse&quot;, Christian Order, October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the East, bishops suspended the Way's activities in Nepal in 2011, and in the Philippines in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/2011/08/08/bishop-bars-neo-cat-group-activities/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingayen-dagupan.org/ArchBishop/neocat.html Neocatechumenal Way in Lingayen-Dagupan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The orthodoxy of the Way's teachings and the validity of its liturgical practices has also drawn criticism. In 1995, the Italian [[Passionist]] priest and theologian [[Enrico Zoffoli]] published a critique of the Way that accused the movement of [[heresy]]: “Their doctrine is seriously compromised with errors against fundamental dogmatics of the Church, the Popes and the Councils. They negate the [[Redemption (theology)|Redemption]], the sacrificial character of the Eucharist, the [[transubstantiation]], etc... they misunderstand the [[sin]] and the [[Grace (Christianity)|Grace]] concepts... their doctrinal statements are fundamentally wrong.” Zoffoli warned that &quot;the building of Neocatechumenal seminaries, where candidates are prepared for the priesthood educated in accordance with the doctrinal errors of Kiko, could be one of the worst threats for the Church of tomorrow.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Zoffoli, &quot;The Neocatechumenals: Who they are, What their creed is, What we should think of them&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Way has not officially responded to the accusations of heresy, relying on declarations by the Holy See. They maintain that the Holy See's decisions to approve the Statutes and the ''Orientations for the Teams of Catechists'' speak for themselves, indicating that the Church approves not only of the Way's structure by also its teachings.
  
Another area for concern has been the allegations that the Way could have a divisive impact on parishes into which it moves. The Neocatechumenal communities are made up of people from the parish however they do not celebrate their Masses on Sunday with the community but on Saturday evening with a Vigil Mass, with their respective communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/44140?&amp;eng=y Liturgy: Benedict XVI Brings the Neocatechumenals Back to the Right Way] (Chiesa).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton|Diocese of Clifton]] undertook an extensive investigation of the communities, and concluded that the movement was &quot;a form of spiritual enslavement&quot; and that its presence in parishes was &quot;completely divisive and destructive.&quot; Bishop [[Mervyn Alexander]] issued a decree the next year banning the Neocatechumenal Way from further activity in the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcnsarticles.blogspot.com/2003_08_24_archive.html Madeleine Bunting, '''An Elite of the Damned''']. ''The Guardian'', March 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Peter Takeo Okada]] has described the Way's presence in Japan’s small Catholic community as &quot;a serious problem&quot; and &quot;divisive and confrontational&quot;.  Staff and students of the Takamatsu Redemptoris Mater seminary relocated to Rome in 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/2011/02/17/problems-with-the-neocatechumenal-way Neo-cats go off on their own way] UCA News&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010, the Japanese episcopal conference asked the Way to suspend its activities in Japan for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/japans-bishops-want-neocatechumenal-way-to-leave-for-five-years Japan's bishops want Neocatechumenal Way to leave for five years] (CNA).&lt;/ref&gt;
