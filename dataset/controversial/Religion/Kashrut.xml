{{Judaism}}

'''''Kashrut''''' (also '''''kashruth''''' or '''''kashrus''''', {{Hebrew|כַּשְׁרוּת}}) is the set of Jewish [[Taboo food and drink|dietary laws]]. Food that may be consumed according to ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) is termed '''kosher''' in English, from the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''kashér'' ({{Hebrew|כָּשֵׁר}}), meaning &quot;fit&quot; (in this context, fit for consumption). Food that is not in accordance with Jewish law is called ''[[treif]]'' ({{lang-yi|טרײף}} or ''treyf'', derived from Hebrew {{Hebrew|טְרֵפָה}} ''trēfáh''). Kosher can also refer to anything that is fit for use or correct according to ''halakha'', such as a ''[[hanukiyah]]'' (candelabra for [[Hannukah]]), or a ''[[sukkah]]'' (a [[Sukkot]] booth). The word ''kosher'' has become English vernacular, a [[colloquialism]] meaning ''proper'', ''legitimate'', ''genuine'', ''fair'', or ''acceptable''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partridge&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor | title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: Volume 2, J-Z | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2006 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7UIjVGcSe8MC&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;pg=PA388 | pages=388 | isbn=0-415-25938-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phythian&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=B.A. Phythian |title=A concise dictionary of English slang and colloquialisms|publisher=The Writer, Inc|year=1976|page=110|isbn=0-87116-099-4 |quote=Kosher Genuine. Fair. Acceptable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the numerous laws that form part of ''kashrut'' are the prohibitions on the consumption of [[unclean animals]] (such as [[pork]], [[shellfish]] (both [[Mollusca]] and [[Crustacea]]) and most [[insect]]s, with the exception of crickets and locusts), mixtures of meat and milk, and the commandment to [[Ritual slaughter|slaughter]] mammals and birds according to a process known as ''[[shechita]]''. Most of the basic laws of ''kashrut'' are derived from the [[Torah]]'s Books of [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]. Their details and practical application, however, is set down in the [[oral law]] (eventually codified in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. While the Torah does not state the rationale for most ''kashrut'' laws, many reasons have been suggested, including philosophical, practical and hygienic.

==Prohibited foods==
{{Main|Kosher foods}}
The laws of ''kashrut'' can be classified according to the origin of the prohibition (Biblical or rabbinical) and whether the prohibition concerns the food itself or a mixture of foods.&lt;ref name=Forst&gt;{{cite book |author=Binyomin Forst |title=The laws of kashrus: a comprehensive exposition of their underlying concepts and applications |publisher=Mesorah Publications |location=Brooklyn, N.Y |year=1994 |pages=32–49 |isbn=0-89906-103-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblically prohibited foods include:&lt;ref name=Forst/&gt;
* Non-kosher animals and birds (based on Leviticus 11:3–8 and Deuteronomy 14:3–21): mammals require certain identifying characteristics (completely [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] and being [[ruminants]]), while birds require a tradition that they can be consumed. Fish require scales and fins (thus excluding [[catfish]]). All invertebrates are non-kosher apart from a certain type of locust on which most communities lack a clear tradition. No reptiles or amphibians are kosher.
* Carrion (''neveilah''): meat from a kosher animal that has not been slaughtered according to the laws of ''shechita''.
* Injured (''tereifah''): an animal with a significant defect or injury, such as a fractured bone or particular types of lung adhesions
* Blood (''dam''): blood of kosher mammals and fowl is removed through salting, with special procedures for the [[Liver (food)|liver]] which is very rich in blood
* Particular fats (''[[Chelev|cheilev]]''): particular parts of the abdominal fat of cattle, goats and sheep must be removed by a process called ''[[nikkur]]''
* The twisted nerve (''[[gid hanasheh]]''): the [[sciatic nerve]], as according to the Bible (Genesis 32:32) the patriarch Jacob's was damaged when he fought with an angel, cannot be eaten and is removed by ''nikkur''
* Limb of a living animal (''ever min ha-chai''): according to Genesis 9:4, a limb torn from an animal that is still alive may not be consumed; this law is considered applicable even to non-Jews{{Clarify|reason=who considers this applicable to which non-Jews, and why?|date=September 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* Untithed food (''tevel''): produce of the [[Land of Israel]] requires the removal of certain tithes, which in ancient times were given to the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] (priests), [[Levite]]s and the poor (''[[Heave offering|terumah]]'', ''[[First tithe|maaser rishon]]'' and ''[[Poor tithe|maaser ani]]'' respectively)
* Fruit during the first three years (''[[Orlah prohibition|orlah]]''): according to Leviticus 19:23, fruit from a tree in the first three years after planting cannot be consumed (both in the Land of Israel and the diaspora)
* New grain (''[[chadash]]''): in Leviticus 23:14 the Bible prohibits newly grown grain (planted after Passover the previous year) until the second day of Passover; there is debate as to whether this law applies to grain grown outside the Land of Israel
* Wine of libation (''[[Kosher wine|yayin nesekh]]''): wine that may have been dedicated to idolatrous practices

Biblically prohibited mixtures include:&lt;ref name=Forst/&gt;
* Mixtures of meat and milk (''basar be-chalav''): this law derives from the broad interpretation of the commandment not to &quot;cook a kid in its mother's milk&quot; (Exodus 23:19, 34:26 and Deuteronomy 14:21); other non-kosher food may be used for other benefit (e.g. sold to non-Jews), but mixtures of meat and milk are prohibited even with regards to other benefit
* Plants grown together (''[[Kil'ayim (prohibition)|kilayim]]''): in the Land of Israel plants are to be grown separately and not in close proximity. A specific subdivision of this law is ''kil'ei ha-kerem'', the prohibition of planting any grain of vegetable near a [[grapevine]]; this law applies throughout the world, and one may not derive benefit from the produce

Rabbinically prohibited foods include:&lt;ref name=Forst/&gt;
* Non-Jewish milk (''chalav akum''): milk that may have an admixture of milk from non-kosher animals (see below for current views on this prohibition)
* Non-Jewish cheese (''gevinat akum''): cheese that may have been produced with non-kosher [[rennet]]
* Non-Jewish wine (''stam yeinam''): wine that while not produced for idolatrous purposes may otherwise have been poured for such a purpose or alternatively when consumed will lead to intermarriage
* Food cooked by a non-Jew (''bishul akum''): this law was enacted for concerns of intermarriage
* Non-Jewish bread (''pat akum''): this law was enacted for concerns of intermarriage
* Health risk (''sakanah''): certain foods and mixtures are considered a health risk, such as mixtures of fish and meat

===Permitted and forbidden animals===
Only meat from particular species is permissible.  Mammals that ''both'' chew their cud ([[Ruminant|ruminate]]) and have [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] can be kosher. Animals with one characteristic but not the other (the [[camel]], the [[hyrax]] and the [[hare]] because they have no cloven hooves, and the [[pig]] because it does not ruminate) are specifically excluded ({{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:3–8}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Yoreh De'ah]] 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive review of the issue involving the difficulty that neither the hyrax nor the hare are ruminants, see [[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin's]] &quot;The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax.&quot;
*{{Cite book |author=Nosson Slifkin |title=The Camel, the Hare &amp; the Hyrax: A Study of the Laws of Animals with One Kosher Sign in Light of Modern Zoology |edition=illustrated |publisher=Zoo Torah in association with Targum/Feldheim |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-56871-312-0 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ONrqAAAACAAJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a rabbinical ruling determined that [[giraffes]] and their [[milk]] are eligible to be considered kosher. The giraffe has both split hooves and chews its cud, characteristics of animals considered kosher.  Findings from 2008 show that giraffe milk curdles, meeting kosher standards.  Although kosher, the giraffe is not slaughtered today because the process would be very costly. Giraffes are difficult to restrain, and their use for food could cause the species to become endangered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/2084281/Giraffe-is-kosher,-Israeli-vets-have-ruled.html Giraffe is kosher, rabbis rule in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 82:1–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kashrut.com/articles/giraffe/ |title=What's the Truth About Giraffe Meat! |author=Rabbi Air Z. Zivotofki |publisher=Kashrut.com |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-kosher birds are listed outright ({{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:12–18}}) but the exact ''zoological'' references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds (24 are mentioned).  The [[Mishnah]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bavli]]'' ''[[Chullin]]'' 3:22–23&lt;/ref&gt; refers to four signs provided by the [[Chazal|sages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part2/ Kashrut.com: Are Turkeys Kosher?, part 2]&lt;/ref&gt;  First, a ''dores'' (predatory bird) is not kosher.  Additionally, kosher birds possess three physical characteristics:  an extra toe{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}, a ''zefek'' ([[crop (anatomy)|crop]]), and a ''korkoban'' (gizzard) with a peelable [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].  However, individual Jews are barred from merely applying these regulations alone; an established tradition (''masorah'') is necessary to allow birds to be consumed, even if it can be substantiated that they meet all four criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part3/ Kashrut.com: Are Turkeys Kosher?, part 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The only exception to this is turkey.  There was a time when certain authorities considered the signs enough, so Jews started eating this bird without a masorah because it possesses all the signs (simanim in Hebrew) and there is a place for this{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} in Jewish law.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In [[Karaite Judaism]], there are varying opinions on chicken. Early Karaites avoided chicken because it was not specifically listed as permitted in the Torah. Today, [[Hakham#Karaite_Judaism|Hakham]] Meir Rekhavi has argued that chicken is kosher because it is a member of the same [[order (biology)|order]] as [[quail]], [[Galliformes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rekhavi1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rekhavi.karaitejudaism.org/chicken.shtml|title=Is the Chicken a Kasher Bird?|last=Rekhavi|first=Meir|work=http://rekhavi.karaitejudaism.org|publisher=Teachings of Hakham Rekhavi|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hakham Avraham Qanai argues that it is not kosher because it is not clear if it is listed in either permitted or prohibited birds. He rebuts the argument using taxonomic arguments, saying the Torah would not give two examples of birds from the same order, [[doves]] and [[pigeons]] in [[Columbiformes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Qanai1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/Kashrut/Chicken_I.shtml|title=Chicken: The Issues|last=Qanai|first=Avraham|work=orahsaddiqim.org|publisher=Karaite Jewish Congregation Orah Saddiqim|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish must have fins and scales to be kosher ({{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:9–12}}).  [[Shellfish]] and other non-fish water [[fauna]] are not kosher.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 83 and 84&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a [[Kosher fish list|list of kosher species of fish]]. Insects are not kosher except for certain species of [[kosher locust]].&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 85&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally any animal that eats other animals, whether they kill their food or eat [[carrion]] ({{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13–31}}), is not kosher, as well as any animal that was partially eaten by other animals (Exodus 22:30/{{Bibleverse||Exodus|22:31}}).

===Separation of meat and milk===
Meat and milk (or derivatives) cannot be mixed ({{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:21}}) in the sense that meat and [[dairy product]]s are not served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together. Observant Jews have separate sets of dishes, and sometimes different kitchens, for meat and milk, and wait anywhere between one and six hours after eating meat before consuming milk products.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 87 ''et seq''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''milchig'' and ''fleishig'' utensils and dishes are the commonly referred to Yiddish delineations between ''dairy'' and ''meat'' (lit. ''milky'' and ''fleshy'') utensils and dishes respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/kashrut.html Jewish Virtual Library] Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Feetmontage.jpg|thumb|250px| Examples of [[cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] in  [[goat]]s (upper left), [[pig]]s (lower left) and [[cattle]] (lower right). But [[horse]]s lack cloven hooves (upper right).]]

===Kosher slaughter===
{{Main|shechita}}
Mammals and fowl must be slaughtered by a trained individual (a ''[[shochet]]'') using a special method of slaughter, ''[[shechita]]'' ({{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|12:21}}). Among other features, ''shechita'' slaughter severs the [[jugular vein]], [[carotid artery]], [[esophagus]] and [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] in a single continuous cutting movement with an unserrated, sharp [[Shechita#The knife|knife]]. Failure of any of these criteria renders the meat of the animal unsuitable. The body must be checked after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year, which would make the meat unsuitable.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 1–65&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions (''treifot'') include 70 different categories of injuries, diseases, and abnormalities whose presence renders the animal non-kosher.  It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal, such as certain fats (''[[chelev]]'') and the [[sciatic nerve]]s from the legs.  As much blood as possible must be removed ({{Bibleverse||Leviticus|17:10}}) through the ''kashering'' process; this is usually done through soaking and salting the meat, but organs rich in blood (the [[liver]]) are grilled over an open flame.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 66–78&lt;/ref&gt; Fish (and locusts, for those Sephardi Jews who agree that they are both kosher and edible) must be killed before being eaten, but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law.

===Kosher utensils===
Utensils used for non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even otherwise kosher food prepared with them non-kosher. Some such utensils, depending on the material they are made from, can be made suitable for preparing kosher food again by immersion in boiling water or by the application of a blowtorch.  Food prepared by Jews in a manner that violates the ''[[Shabbat]]'' (Sabbath) may not be eaten until the Shabbat is over.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 318:1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passover laws===
''[[Passover|Pesach]]'' (Passover) has special dietary rules, the most important of which is the prohibition on eating [[leavened bread]] or derivatives of this (''[[chametz]]'', {{Bibleverse||Exodus|12:15}}). Utensils used in preparing and serving ''chametz'' are also forbidden on Passover unless they have been cleansed (''kashering'').&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 431–452&lt;/ref&gt; Observant Jews keep separate sets of meat and dairy utensils for Passover use only. In addition, some groups follow various eating restrictions on [[Passover]] that go beyond the rules of ''kashrut'', such as not eating ''[[gebrochts]]'' or [[garlic]].

===Produce of the Land of Israel===
Biblical rules control the use of agriculture produce.  For produce grown in the [[Land of Israel]] a modified version of the  biblical [[tithe]]s must be applied, including [[Terumat hamaaser|Terumat HaMaaser]], [[Maaser Rishon]], [[Maaser Sheni]], and [[Maaser Ani]] (untithed produce is called ''[[tevel]]''); the fruit of the first three years of a tree's growth or replanting are forbidden for eating or any other use as ''[[orlah prohibition|orlah]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-medi-terumos.htm Star-k.org]&lt;/ref&gt; produce grown in the [[Land of Israel]] on the seventh year is [[Shviit]], and unless managed carefully is forbidden as a violation of the ''[[Shmita]]'' (Sabbatical Year). Some rules of ''kashrut'' are not universally observed:  the rule against eating ''[[yoshon|chadash]]'' (new grain) before the 16th of the month [[Nisan]]; many hold that this rule does not apply outside the Land of Israel.

===Vegetables===
Many vegetarian restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods acquire a ''[[hechsher]]'', certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps have been taken to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of ''[[bishul Yisrael]]''. Vegetables such as [[lettuce]], [[cabbage]], [[broccoli]] and [[cauliflower]] must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.

===Pareve foods===

Some processes convert a meat or dairy product into a ''pareve'' (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, [[rennet]] is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese,&lt;ref&gt;''The rennet must be kosher, either microbial or from special productions of animal rennet using kosher calf stomachs.''[http://oukosher.org/index.php/articles/single/2828/ Oukosher.org], Retrieved August 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; but such cheeses might not be acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher [[gelatin]], an animal product, supposedly derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as [[agar agar]] and [[carageenan]] are ''pareve'' by nature. ''Fish gelatin'' is derived from fish and therefore (like all kosher fish products) ''pareve''. [[egg (food)|Egg]]s are also considered ''pareve'' despite being an animal product; [[Mayonnaise]], for instance, is usually marked &quot;pareve&quot; despite by definition containing egg.

''Kashrut'' has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non-kosher use, but that might be inadequate for those with allergies, vegetarians, or adherents to other religious statutes. For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant ''pareve'' status to products manufactured with it. Nevertheless, someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the dairy residue, and that is why some products that are legitimately pareve carry &quot;milk&quot; warnings.

==Explanations==

===Philosophical explanations===
[[Jewish philosophy]] divides the [[613 mitzvot|613 ''mitzvot'']] into three groups—laws that have a rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (''mishpatim''), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (''edot''), and laws that do not have a rational explanation (''chukim''). Some Jewish scholars say that ''kashrut'' should be categorized as laws for which there is no particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority and man must obey without asking why.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080212211142/http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/documents/Clean+&amp;+Unclean+Meats.htm William H. Shea, Clean and Unclean Meats, Biblical Research Institute], December 1998 (archived from [http://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/documents/Clean%20&amp;%20Unclean%20Meats.htm the original] on 2008-02-12)&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Maimonides]] believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' ''[[Korban]]ot'', ''[[Temurah (Halacha)|Temurah]] 4:13 (in eds. Frankel; &quot;Rambam L'Am&quot;)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theologians have said that the laws of ''kashrut'' are symbolic in character: Kosher animals represent [[virtue]]s, while non-kosher animals represent [[vice]]s. The 1st century BCE [[Letter of Aristeas]] argues that the laws &quot;have been given&amp;nbsp;... to awake pious thoughts and to form the character&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Letter of Aristeas'', 145–154&lt;/ref&gt; This view reappears in the [[prolixity|prolix]] allegories of [[Philo]] of Alexandria and in the writings of early Christian [[Church Fathers]]. This symbolism hypothesis features in the work of the 19th century [[Rabbi]] [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].

The Torah prohibits &quot;seething the kid (goat, sheep, calf) in its mother's milk&quot;. While the Bible does not provide a reason, it has been suggested that the practice was perceived as cruel and insensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Ecology |last=Gottlieb |first=Roger S. |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford Handbooks Online |isbn=0195178726 |page=45 |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_LldeLvqQNsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45}} quoting [[Deuteronomy Rabbah]] 6:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The mitzvot: the commandments and their rationale |last=Chill |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Chill |year=1974 |publisher=[[Bloch Publishing Company]] |isbn=0819703761 |page=114 |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hasidism]] believes that everyday life is imbued with channels connecting with [[God|Divinity]], the ''activation'' of which it sees as helping the [[Shechinah|Divine Presence]] to be drawn into the physical world;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=73827&lt;!-- redirects to http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/73827/jewish/The-Chassidic-Masters-on-Food.htm --&gt; The Chassidic Masters on Food and Eating], chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt; Hasidism argues that the food laws are related to the way such channels, termed ''sparks of holiness'', interact with various animals.

According to the teachings of Hasidism, ''sparks of Holiness'' are released whenever a Jew manipulates any object for a ''holy reason'' (which includes eating);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=73850&lt;!-- redirects to http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/73850/jewish/Meat.htm --&gt; Meat], chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt; however, not all animal products are capable of releasing their ''sparks of holiness''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7887&lt;!-- redirects to http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/7887/jewish/Chapter-8.htm --&gt; לקוטי אמרים תניא] (Hebrew), chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt; The Hasidic argument is that  animals are imbued with signs that reveal the release of these sparks, and the signs are expressed in the biblical categorization of ritually ''clean'' and ritually ''unclean'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070829062317/http://www.rabbifriedman.org/sichaReeh.asp Re'eh], rabbifriedman.org (archived from [http://www.rabbifriedman.org/sichaReeh.asp the original] on 2007-08-29).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christian theologian [[Gordon Wenham|Gordon J. Wenham]], the purpose of ''kashrut'' was to help Jews maintain a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; he says that the effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon J. Wenham 1981, p.6-15&quot;&gt;Gordon J. Wenham, ''The Theology of Unclean Food'', ''[[The Evangelical Quarterly]]'' 53, January March 1981, pp.6–15&lt;/ref&gt; Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of the distinct status of Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon J. Wenham 1981, p.6-15&quot;/&gt;

===Health explanations===
There have been attempts to provide empirical support for the view that Jewish food laws have an overarching health benefit or purpose, one of the earliest being from [[Maimonides]] in his [[Guide for the Perplexed]].  In 1953, [[David Macht]], an Orthodox Jew and proponent of the theory of [[biblical scientific foresight]], conducted [[toxin|toxicity]] experiments on many kinds of animals and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title= An Experimental Pharmalogical Appreciation of Leviticus&amp;nbsp;XI and Deuteronomy&amp;nbsp;XIV | url=http://members.dslextreme.com/users/hollymick/Macht1953.pdf | author = Macht, Dr. David I. |last=Macht |year=1953 |month=September–October | publisher=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=XXXVII |issue=5 |pages=444–450|format=pdf| ref= harv| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; His experiment involved [[lupin]] seedlings being supplied with extracts from the meat of various animals; Macht reported that in 100% of cases, extracts from ritually ''unclean'' meat inhibited the seedling's growth more than that from ritually ''clean'' meats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Macht|1953}} op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, these explanations are controversial. Scholar Lester L. Grabbe, writing in the ''Oxford Bible Commentary'' on Leviticus, states that &quot;[a]n explanation now almost universally rejected is that the laws in this section [Leviticus 11–15] have hygiene as their basis. Although some of the laws of ritual purity roughly correspond to modern ideas of physical cleanliness, many of them have little to do with hygiene. For example, there is no evidence that the 'unclean' animals are intrinsically bad to eat or to be avoided in a Mediterranean climate, as is sometimes asserted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Bible Commentary, eds. J. Barton and J. Muddiman. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2001: 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supervision and marketing==

===Hashgacha===

Certain foods must be prepared in whole or in part by Jews. This includes [[kosher wine|grape wine]],&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 114&lt;/ref&gt; certain cooked foods (''[[Bishul Yisrael|bishul akum]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 113&lt;/ref&gt; [[cheese]] (''[[gvinat akum]]''), and according to some also butter (''chem'at akum'');&lt;ref name=YD115&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 115&lt;/ref&gt; dairy products (Hebrew: חלב ישראל [[chalav Yisrael]] &quot;milk of Israel&quot;);&lt;ref name=YD115/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many rely on lenient rulings by Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] in Teshuvot Igrot Moshe. Yoreh De'ah 1:47 and other 20th century rabbinic authorities who rule that strict government supervision prevents the admixture of non-kosher milk, making supervision unnecessary.

===Product labeling standards===
[[File:OUKosher.JPG|thumb|250px|The circled U indicates that this product is certified as kosher by the [[Orthodox Union]] (OU). The word &quot;pareve&quot; indicates that this product contains neither milk nor meat-derived ingredients]]
{{details|Hechsher}}
Although reading the label of food products can identify obviously non-kosher ingredients, some countries allow manufacturers to omit identification of certain ingredients.  Such &quot;hidden&quot; ingredients may include [[lubricant]]s and [[flavoring]]s, among other [[Food additive|additives]]; in some cases, for instance, the use of ''natural'' flavorings, these ingredients are more likely to be derived from non-kosher substances{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.  Furthermore, certain products, such as fish, have a high rate of [[Applied Food Technologies#History of Fish Species Labeling Laws (US)|mislabeling]] which may substitute a non-kosher fish into a package labeled as a species of kosher fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/science/earth/27fish.html?_r=1 See: New York Times Article on Fish Mislabeling]&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers of foods and food additives can contact Jewish religious authorities to have their products certified as ''kosher'': this would most likely involve a visit to the manufacturing facilities by a committee from a rabbinic organization, rather than by an individual rabbi, in order to inspect the production methods and contents, and if everything is sufficiently ''kosher'' a certificate would be issued.

Manufacturers sometimes identify the products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label. These symbols are known in Judaism as ''[[hechsher]]im''. Due to differences in ''kashrut'' standards held by different organizations, the ''hechsheirim'' of certain Jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}}; the [[certification mark]]s of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list, but one of the most commonly used in the United States of America is that of the [[Union of Orthodox Congregations]], who use a ''U'' inside a circle, symbolising the initials of ''Orthodox Union''. A single ''K'' is sometimes used as a symbol for ''kosher'', but since many countries do not allow letters to be [[trademark]]ed (the method by which other symbols are protected from misuse), it only indicates that the company producing the product claims that it is kosher.

Many of the certification symbols are accompanied by additional letters or words to indicate the category of the product, according to Jewish law; the categorisation may conflict with legal classifications, especially in the case of food that Jewish law regards as ''dairy'', but legal classification does not.
*D—Dairy
*M—''Meat'', including [[poultry]]
*Pareve—Food that is neither meat nor dairy
*Fish
*P—''[[Passover]]''-related (''P'' is not used for ''Pareve'')

In many cases constant supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may cease to be so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing [[tallow]], which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any ''hechsher'' or ''kashrut''. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the ''hechsher'' may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active ''[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]'' among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the ''hechsher''. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss ''kashrut'' products.

Many coffee creamers currently sold in the United States are labeled as &quot;non-dairy&quot;, yet also have a &quot;D&quot; alongside their ''hechsher'', which indicates a dairy status. This is because of an ingredient (usually [[Casein|sodium caseinate]]), which is derived from milk. The rabbis categorize it as dairy that cannot be mixed with meat, but the US government considers it to lack the nutritional value of milk.

Products labeled [[kosher-style]] are nonkosher products that have characteristics of kosher foods, such as all-beef [[hot dog]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | authorlink = Leah A.

===History of kosher marketing===
In 1911, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] was the first company to advertise that their product, Crisco, was kosher. Over the next two decades, companies such as [[Lender's Bagels]], [[Maxwell House]], [[Manischewitz]], and [[Empire Kosher|Empire]] evolved and gave the kosher market more shelf space. In the 1960s, [[Hebrew National]] hotdogs launched a &quot;we answer to a higher authority&quot; campaign to appeal to Jews and non-Jews alike. From that point on, kosher became a symbol for both quality and value. The kosher market quickly expanded, and with it more opportunities for kosher products. According to Menachem Lubinsky, founder of the Kosherfest trade fair, there may be as many as {{Nowrap|14 million}} kosher consumers and {{Nowrap|$40 billion}} in sales of kosher products in the USA.

===Legal usage===
{{Main|Civil laws regarding Kashrut}}

Advertising standards laws in many jurisdictions prohibit the use of the phrase ''kosher'' in a product's labelling, unless it can be shown that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws are often defined differently in different jurisdictions. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the ''kashrut'' nature, in others the rules of ''kosher'' are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting the use of the term ''kosher'' have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.

==Society and culture==

===Adherence===
About one-sixth of [[American Jews]] maintain the kosher diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kosher-carbon-footprint Stern, the author of How to Keep Kosher: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Jewish Dietary Laws, is one of a million or so American Jews (out of around six million total) who keeps her kitchen year-round according to the laws of kashruth, or kosher.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Jews observe ''kashrut'' partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or not drinking milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one analysis of the specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats-sea.agr.gc.ca/info/6116-eng.htm|title=The Specialty Food Market in North America|month=March|year=2012|publisher=Agri-Food Trade Service, Canada|work=Market Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sizable non-Jewish segment of the population views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Strict vegetarians, Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods, often consider the ''kosher-pareve'' designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosher-directory.com/whoeats.htm Kosher-directory.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although the products still might contain fish or eggs.

===Linguistics===
כשר in Ancient Hebrew means, be advantageous, proper, suitable, or succeed &lt;ref&gt;http://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/BDB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Brown-Driver-Briggs]] Hebrew and English Lexicon.  In Modern Hebrew, it generally refers to ''kashrut'' but can also sometimes mean &quot;proper&quot;.

By extension, ''[[wiktionary:kosher|kosher]]'' has come to mean  ''legitimate'', ''acceptable'', ''permissible'', ''genuine'', and ''authentic''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phythian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm Jewish dietary laws]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the [[Babylonian Talmud]] uses ''kosher'' in the sense of ''virtuous'', when referring to the [[Darius the Great of Persia|Dãrayavahush I]] (known in English, via [[Latin]], as ''Darius'') as a &quot;kosher king&quot;; Darius, a [[Persia]]n King, assisted in building the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Tractate Rosh Hashanah]] 3b, ''Schottenstein Edition'', [[Mesorah Publications]] Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''kosher'' is also part of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an abbreviation of ''koshering'', meaning the process for making something ''kosher''; for example, ''[[kosher salt]]'' is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of ''kashrut'', because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for ''Jewish tradition''; for example, a ''kosher dill'' [[pickled cucumber|pickle]] is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyfoodmuseum.org/_pkwhat.htm Brief note on kosher pickles in &quot;The Pickle Wing&quot; of nyfoodmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws &quot;Judaism 101&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
