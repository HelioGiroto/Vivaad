'''Menachem Mendel Schneerson''' (April 5, 1902 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]&lt;ref name=&quot;birthdate&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– June 12, 1994 [[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]), known as '''the Lubavitcher Rebbe''' or just '''the Rebbe''' among his followers,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Judaica'', Second Edition, Volume 18 page 149&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[rabbi]] who was the seventh and last [[Rebbe]] (Hasidic leader) of the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] movement. He was fifth in a direct paternal line to the third Chabad-Lubavitch Rebbe, [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn]]. In January 1951, a year after the death of his father-in-law, Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], he assumed the leadership of the Lubavitch movement.

He led the movement until his death in 1994, greatly expanding its worldwide activities and founding a worldwide network of institutions to spread [[Orthodox Judaism]] among the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0602/feature4/index.html |title=National Geographic Magazine February 2006 |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions include schools, kindergartens, synagogues, [[Chabad house]]s, and others, and are run under the auspices of [[Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch]], the educational branch of the Chabad movement. During his lifetime many of his followers had considered him to be the Jewish [[Messiah]].

== Early life ==
===Birth and early years===
The accepted date of his birth is [[11 Nissan]] 5662, which is equivalent to April 5, 1902 [[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]] or April 18, 1902 [[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]].  (Dates in March 1895 appear on his Russian passport&lt;ref name=&quot;HeilmanFriedman&quot;/&gt; and his application for French citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Schneerson was the eldest of three sons of [[Levi Yitzchak Schneerson]], an authority on [[Kabbalah]] and [[Halakha|Jewish law]]&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''Likkutei Levi Yitzchak'', Kehot Publications 1970&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the rabbi of [[Yekaterinoslav]] from 1907 to 1939. He had two younger brothers, Dov Ber and Yisroel Aryeh Leib, both of whom were reported to be of unusual character.&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC4&quot; /&gt; His younger brother Dov Ber was mentally disturbed from childhood and spent his years in an institution for the mentally disabled near Nikolaiev. He died in 1944 at the hands of Nazi collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;''Larger Than Life'', Deutsch, S. S., vol. 2, pp. 125–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The youngest, Yisrael Aryeh Leib Schneerson, was close to his brother, and often traveled with him. He was widely viewed as a genius and studied science. In the late 1920s he became a [[Communism|Communist]], later becoming a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]]. After he left the Soviet union he stopped being an observant Jew.&lt;ref&gt;''Larger Than Life'', Deutsch, S. S., vol. 1, pp. 101–103, and vol. 2, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his name to Mark Gourary and moved to Israel where he became a businessman, but later moved to England where he began doctoral studies at [[Liverpool University]] but died in 1952 before he completed them. His wife died in 1996 and his children—Schneerson's closest living relatives—currently reside in Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC4&quot; /&gt;

===Early education===
During his youth, Rabbi Schneerson received mostly private Jewish education. He was tutored by Zalman Vilenkin from 1909 through 1913. In 1977, he said of Vilenkin: “He taught me and my brothers [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]], [[Rashi]] and [[Talmud]]. He put me on my feet. He was an illustrious Jew...”&lt;ref&gt;Sichos Kodesh 5738, Volume 1, page 596&lt;/ref&gt; When Schneerson was eleven years old, Vilenkin informed the boy's father that he had nothing more to teach his son.&lt;ref&gt;Chana Vilenkin, Zalman's daughter on &quot;The Early Years Vol I&quot;. Jewish Educational Media 2006, segment Nikolaev, Russia 1902. (UPC 874780 000525)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Schneerson later studied independently under his father, who was his primary teacher. He studied [[Talmud]] and [[rabbinic literature]], as well as the Hasidic view of [[Kabbalah]]. He received separate [[Semikhah|rabbinical ordination]]s from both the [[Rogatchover Gaon]], Yosef Rosen,&lt;ref&gt;Selegson, Michoel A. Introduction to ''From Day to Day'', English translation of the [[Hayom Yom]] (ISBN 08266-06695), p. A20.&lt;/ref&gt; and from Rabbi [[Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg]] (also known as the ''Sridei Aish'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/livingtorah/player_cdo/aid/1264762/jewish/Rabbinic-Ordination.htm |title=Rabbinic Ordination - Program Three Hundred Nine - Living Torah |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Chabad}}
Rabbi Schneerson's mother said her son never attended any Soviet school, though he took the exams as an external student and did well on them&lt;ref&gt;Schneerson, Chana, ''A Mother in Israel'' Kehot Publications 1983 (ISBN 08266-00999)page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avrum Ehrlich, he immersed himself in Jewish studies while simultaneously qualifying for Russian secondary school.&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC4&quot;&gt;Ehrlich 2004, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his childhood Rabbi Schneerson was involved in the affairs of his father's office, where his secular education and knowledge of the [[Russian language]] were useful in assisting his father's public administrative work. He was also said to have acted as an interpreter between the Jewish community and the Russian authorities on a number of occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC4&quot; /&gt;

===Early travels and marriage===
{{main|Chaya Mushka Schneerson}}

In 1923 Rabbi Schneerson visited [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]] for the first time. It was presumably at that time that he met Schneersohn's middle daughter, [[Chaya Mushka Schneerson|Chaya Mushka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC4&quot; /&gt; He became engaged to her in [[Riga]] in 1923 and married her five years later in 1928, after being away in [[Berlin]]. He returned to [[Warsaw]] for his wedding, and in an article about his wedding in a Warsaw newspaper, &quot;a number of academic degrees&quot; were attributed to him. Following the marriage, the newlyweds went to live in Berlin. The marriage was long and happy (60 years), but childless.

Schneerson and [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]] are related through [[Tzemach Tzedek]], the third Rebbe of [[Chabad Lubavitch]].

== Berlin ==
===Studies===
Schneerson studied mathematics, physics and philosophy in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] for five semesters from mid-1928 through 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volume II 1938 PC&quot;&gt;&quot;The Early Years Volume II (1931–1938)&quot; Jewish Educational Media, 2006 (UPC 74780 00058)&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Menachem Friedman]] found his records amongst the students who &quot;audited courses at the university without receiving academic credit.&quot; Whilst there, he wrote hundreds of pages of original Torah discourses, subsequently published as &quot;Reshimot,&lt;ref&gt;Reshimot, 5 Volumes, Kehot Publication Society, 1994–2003&lt;/ref&gt; &quot; and corresponded with his father on Torah matters, which were published in the 1970s in the book &quot;Likuttei Levi Yitzchak—Letters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Likkutei Levi Yitzchak Igrot Kodesh, Kehot Publication Society, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  During his stay in Berlin, R. Schneerson was assigned specific communal tasks by his father-in-law, Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], who also requested that he write scholarly annotations to the responsa of [[Tzemach Tzedek]]. [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]] also sought his annotations to various hasidic discourses. It was during this period, between 1928 and 1932, that there took place a serious interchange of [[halachic]] correspondence between R. Schneerson and the famed talmudic genius known as the [[Rogachover Gaon]]. This correspondence is indicative of Schneerson's talmudic erudition at the time. In 1933 he also met with Rabbi [[Chaim Elazar Shapiro]], as well as with famed talmudist Rabbi [[Shimon Shkop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Educational Teachings of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson |author=Aryeh Solomon |page=310 |year=2000 |month=May |isbn=0-7657-6092-4 |publisher=Jason Aronson Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With his brother===
His brother, Yisroel Aryeh Leib (known to Lubavitchers as 'Leibel' and to others by his secular name, 'Liova'), joined him in Berlin in 1931, traveling with false papers under the name 'Mark Gurary' to escape the Soviets. He arrived and was cared for by his brother and sister-in-law as he was seriously ill with [[typhoid fever]]. Leibel attended classes at the University of Berlin from 1931 to 1933. In 1933, after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] took over Germany and began instituting anti-Semitic policies, Mendel and his wife helped Leibel escape from Berlin, before themselves fleeing to Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volume II 1938 PC&quot;/&gt; Leibel escaped to [[Mandate Palestine]] in 1939 with his fiancee Regina Milgram, where they later married.&lt;ref&gt;(ISBN 0-9647243-0-8) Vol. II, p.134)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Leibel's secularism, the two brothers maintained a relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC4&quot; /&gt;

===Encounters with Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik===
Some students of Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], have asserted that Rabbi Schneerson met Soloveitchik while they were studying in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebbe-Rav&quot;&gt;

Soloveitchik's daughter Dr. [[Atarah Twersky]] recalls Soloveitchik saying that Rabbi Schneerson visited her father in his apartment and the former asked the latter why he was studying in Berlin if his father-in-law was opposed to it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Other sources deny this. According to Soloveitchik's son Rabbi Dr. [[Haym Soloveitchik]], Rabbi Soloveitchik only saw Rabbi Schneerson pass by in Berlin and they did not meet while there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:83Y4vflk7UYJ:www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/4_2_Kimelman.pdf+heschel+soloveitchik&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4&amp;gl=us &quot;Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and Abraham Joshua Heschel on Jewish-Christian Relations&quot; by Rabbi Reuven Kimelman] {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=BlevintronBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1964, Soloveitchik paid a lengthy visit while Rabbi Schneerson was mourning the death of his mother. Their conversation during this visit lasted approximately two hours. Soloveitchik later visited again following the death of Rabbi Schneerson's mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;/www.chabad.org/therebbe/article.htm/aid/529444/jewish/The-Rebbe-and-the-Rav&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1980, Soloveitchik attended a celebration marking 30 years of Rabbi Schneerson's leadership at the Lubavitch headquarters in Brooklyn New York. This visit lasted almost two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0uF44xLM-k&amp;feature=relmfu |title=Excerpt: The Rebbe and the Rav |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-02-05 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==
In 1933,Rabbi Schneerson moved to [[Paris]], [[France]]. He studied [[mechanics]] and [[electrical engineering]] at the ''[[École spéciale des travaux publics|École spéciale des travaux publics, du bâtiment et de l'industrie]]'' (ESTP), a [[Grandes écoles]] in the [[Montparnasse]] district. He graduated in July 1937 and received a license to practice as an [[electrical engineering|electrical engineer]]. In November 1937, he enrolled at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he studied [[mathematics]] until [[World War II]] broke out in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Early Years Volume III (1938–1940)&quot;, Jewish Educational Media, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson lived most of the time in Paris at 9 ''Rue Boulard'' in the [[14th arrondissement]], in the same building as his wife's sister, Shaina, and her husband, Mendel Hornstein, who was also studying at ESTP. Mendel Hornstein failed the final exams and he and his wife returned to Poland; they were murdered at [[Treblinka]] in late 1942. On June 11, 1940, three days before [[German occupation of France during World War II|Paris fell to the Nazis]], the Schneersons fled to [[Vichy]], and later to [[Nice]], where they stayed until their final escape from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;The Early Years Volume IV, JEM 2008 (ASIN: B001M1Z62I)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Schneerson learned to speak [[French language|French]], which he put to use in establishing his movement there after the war. The Chabad movement in France later  attracted many Jewish immigrants from [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Tunisia]].

== America and leadership ==
===Escape from Europe===
In 1941, Rabbi Schneerson escaped from Europe on the Serpa Pinto, which embarked from Lisbon, Portugal. It was one of the last boats to cross the Atlantic before the [[U-boat]] blockade began,&lt;ref&gt;''Last Sea Route From Lisbon to U.S. Stops Ticket Sale to Refugees'', ''New York Times'', March 15, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; and joined his father-in-law, Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], in the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] section of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Seeking to contribute to the war effort, he went to work in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], drawing wiring for the battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)]],&lt;ref name=&quot;army&quot;&gt;Fishkoff, Sue. ''The Rebbe's Army'', Schoken, 2003 (08052 11381). Page 73. Milton Fechtor, [http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article.asp?AID=141185 Wiring the Missouri], Jewish Educational Media.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Living Torah'' Vol 53 Episode 210, &quot;Rabbi Engineer, Part 1: The Brooklyn Navy Yard&quot;, Jewish Educational Media&lt;/ref&gt; and other classified military work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/nyregion/15rooms.html No One There, but This Place Is Far From Empty] NY Times January 14, 2009 By ALAN FEUER&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise in America===
In 1942, his father-in-law appointed him director of the Chabad movement's newly-founded central organizations, placing him at the helm of building the movement's Jewish educational, social services, and publishing networks across the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]]. However, Schneerson kept a low public profile within the movement. He would speak publicly only once a month, delivering talks to his father-in-law's followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC4&quot; /&gt;

During the 1940s, Rabbi Schneerson became a naturalized US citizen. For many years to come, he would speak about America's special place in the world, and would argue that the bedrock of the United States' power and uniqueness came from its foundational values, which were, according to Rabbi Schneerson, '&quot;[[E pluribus unum]]'—from many one&quot;, and &quot;In God we trust.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Address, January 15, 1981 http://www.chabad.org/1180692/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, his father-in-law would become a U.S. citizen, with the Rebbe assisting to coordinate the event. A special dispensation was arranged wherein the federal judge came to &quot;770&quot; to officiate at Rabbi Yoseph Yitzchak's citizenship proceedings, rather than the wheelchair-bound Rebbe travel to a courthouse for the proceedings. Uniquely, the event was recorded on color motion film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/471239/ |title=The Previous Rebbe Accepts US Citizenship - Program One Hundred Twenty Eight - Living Torah |publisher=Chabad.org |date=1949-03-17 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidate for Rebbe===
Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn died in 1950. The two main candidates for leadership were Rabbi M. Schneerson and Rabbi [[Shemaryahu Gurary]], Rabbi Y. Schneersohn's elder son-in-law. Rabbi M. Schneerson actively refused to accept leadership of the movement for the entire year after Rabbi Y. Schneersohn's death, but was eventually cajoled into accepting the post by his wife and followers.&lt;ref&gt;''Leadership in the HaBaD Movement'', Avrum M. Ehrlich, Jason Aronson, January 6, 2000, ISBN 0-7657-6055-X&lt;/ref&gt; On the first anniversary of his father-in-law's passing, 10 [[Shevat]] 1951, he delivered a Hasidic discourse, ''(Ma'amar)'', and formally became the Rebbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=108303 |title=Shevat 10: A Day of Two Rebbes |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jewish outreach ===
Rabbi Schneerson believed that the American public was seeking to learn more about their Jewish heritage. He stated, &quot;America is not lost, you are not different. You Americans sincerely crave to know, to learn. Americans are inquisitive. It is Chabad's point of view that the American mind is simple, honest, direct—good, tillable soil for Hassidism, or just plain Judaism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Raddock, Charles, ''The Jewish Forum'', April, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Schneerson believed that Jews need not be on the defensive, but need to be on the ground building Jewish institutions, [[Jewish day school|day schools]] and [[synagogue]]s. Rabbi Schneerson said that we need &quot;to discharge ourselves of our duty and we must take the initiative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kranzler, Gershon, ''Jewish Life'', Sept.–Oct. 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Schneerson placed a tremendous emphasis on [[Orthodox Judaism outreach|outreach]]. He made great efforts to intensify this program of the Chabad movement, bringing Jews from all walks of life to adopt Torah-observant Judaism, and aggressively sought the expansion of the [[baal teshuva]] movement. His work included organizing the training of thousands of young Chabad rabbis and their wives, who were sent all over the world by him as ''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]]'' (emissaries) to promote Jewish observance and education.

He oversaw the building of schools, community centers, youth camps, and &quot;Chabad Houses&quot;, and established contacts with wealthy Jews and government officials around the world. Rabbi Schneerson also instituted a system of &quot;[[Chabad mitzvah campaigns]]&quot; called ''mivtzoim'' to encourage Jews to follow [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] practices. They commonly centered on practices such as keeping [[kosher]], lighting [[Shabbat]] candles, studying [[Torah]], putting on [[tefillin]], helping to write [[Sefer Torah|sifrei Torah]], and teaching women to observe the laws of [[niddah|Jewish family purity]]. He also launched a global [[Noahide campaign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asknoah.org/ |title=asknoah.org |publisher=asknoah.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote observance of the [[Noahide Laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/62221/jewish/Universal-Morality.htm |title=Universal Morality - Action |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; among [[gentile]]s, and argued that involvement in this campaign is an obligation for every Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sichosinenglish.org/essays/01.htm |title=Essays: Educating Mankind |publisher=Sichosinenglish.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political activities ===
==== Israel ====
Rabbi Schneerson never visited the State of Israel, where he had many admirers. However, many among Israel's top leadership made it a point to visit him. One of Israel's presidents, [[Zalman Shazar]], who was of Lubavitch ancestry, would visit Schneerson and corresponded extensively with him. [[Menachem Begin]], [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Moshe Katzav]], and later, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] - who was present at his funeral - also paid visits and sought advice, along with numerous other less famous politicians, diplomats, military officials, and media producers. In the elections that brought [[Yitzhak Shamir]] to power, Schneerson publicly lobbied his followers and the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] members in the [[Knesset]] to vote against the [[Labour (Israel)|Labor]] alignment. It attracted the media's attention and led to articles in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and many newspapers and [[Television|TV]] programs, and led to considerable controversy within Israeli politics.

He lobbied Israeli politicians to pass legislation in accordance with Jewish religious law on the question &quot;[[Who is a Jew?]]&quot; and declare that &quot;only one who is born of a Jewish mother or converted according to [[Halakha]] is Jewish.&quot; This caused a furor in the United States. Some American Jewish philanthropies stopped financially supporting Chabad-Lubavitch since most of their members were connected to [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism]]. These unpopular ideas were toned down by his aides, according to Avrum Erlich. &quot;The issue was eventually quietened so as to protect Chabad fund-raising interests. Controversial issues such as territorial compromise in Israel that might have estranged benefactors from giving much-needed funds to Chabad, were often moderated, particularly by...Krinsky.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC14n&quot;&gt;Ehrlich 2004, Chapter 14 notes&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Immanuel Jakobovits]] argued that Chabad moderated its presentation of anti-Zionist ideology and right-wing politics in England and downplayed its messianic fervor so as not to antagonize large parts of the English Jewish community.&lt;ref name=&quot;EhrlichC14n&quot; /&gt;

==== Iran ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Beginning in the winter of 1979, during the tumultuous days of the [[Islamic Revolution]] in [[Iran]], Rabbi Schneerson directed his emissaries to make arrangements to rescue Jewish teenagers from [[Iran]] and place them in foster homes within the Lubavitcher community in [[Brooklyn]]. This mission, while not political in nature, was originally started as a secretive quest in order not to jeopardize the safety of the Iranian Jewish community at large. Many of Rabbi Schneerson's followers in Brooklyn were asked to open their homes to these Jewish children and help save their lives from another potential Holocaust in the making. The new Islamic government in Iran was vocally opposed to the existence of [[Israel]] and created a genuine concern in world Jewish circles by accusing many in the Jewish community of being [[Zionist]]s. The execution of the leader of the Iranian Jewish community, [[Habib Elghanian]], had made this a tangible threat to the very existence of the community. Ultimately, while more than a dozen members of the Jewish community were executed by the new Iranian government, Jews were allowed to continue to live in Iran and there would be no Holocaust. Hundreds of Jewish children from [[Tehran]] and other major cities in [[Iran]] were flown from Tehran to [[New York]] with the help of Schneerson's emissaries, placed in foster homes in Crown Heights and educated in [[Chabad]] schools. Many would adopt the Lubavitcher lifestyle and later, some even served as Chabad emissaries and religious leaders. Many others would later reunite with their biological parents after their parents and other family members emigrated to the United States.

=== Scholarship ===
Rabbi Schneerson is known for his scholarship both in the Talmud and hidden parts of the Torah (both Kabbalah and Chasidus). He is especially renowned for his insights on, and analysis of [[Rashi]]'s Torah commentary. In halachic matters, he normally deferred to members of the [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] ''[[Beth Din]]'' headed by Rabbi Zalman Shimon Dvorkin, and advised the movement to do likewise in the event of his death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 15, (also see note 10 Ibid.) KTAV Publishing, ISBN 0-88125-836-9&lt;/ref&gt; While Rabbi Schneerson rarely chose to involve himself with questions of ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), some notable exceptions were with regard to the use of electrical appliances on Shabbat, sailing on Israeli boats staffed by Jews, and [[halakhic]] dilemmas related to certain religious observances which may arise when crossing the [[International Date Line]].

====Public addresses====
Rabbi Schneerson was known for delivering regular lengthy addresses to his followers at public gatherings, &quot;in precise Yiddish without a text or even any notes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Despite All Odds: The Story of Lubavitch |author=Edward Hoffman |page=32 |year=1991 |month=May |isbn=0-671-67703-9 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He sang with his hassidim. [http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/140800/jewish/Tzomo-Lecho-Nafshi.htm Tzomo Lecho Nafshi].&lt;/ref&gt;  These talks usually centered on the [[weekly Torah portion]] and were then transcribed by followers known as ''[[choizer]]im'' and distributed widely. Many of them were later edited by him and distributed worldwide in small booklets, later to be compiled in the ''[[Likkutei Sichot]]'' set. He also penned tens of thousands of replies to requests and questions. The majority of his correspondence is printed in ''[[Igrot Kodesh]]'', partly translated as &quot;Letters from the Rebbe&quot;. His correspondence fills more than two hundred published volumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;army&quot; /&gt;

=== &quot;770&quot; ===
{{main|770 Eastern Parkway}}
[[File:770Lubavitch.JPG|thumb|right|770 Eastern Parkway.]]

Rabbi Schneerson rarely left Crown Heights in Brooklyn except for frequent lengthy visits to his father-in-law's gravesite in [[Queens, New York]]. A year after the death of his wife, Chaya Mushka, in 1988, when the traditional year of Jewish mourning had passed, he moved into his study above the central Lubavitch synagogue at [[770 Eastern Parkway]].

It was from this location that Rabbi Schneerson directed his emissaries' work and managed the movement's development. His public roles included celebrations called ''[[farbrengen]]s'' (gatherings) on Shabbats, [[Jewish holiday|Jewish holy days]], and special days on the Chabad calendar, when he would give lengthy sermons to crowds. In later years, these would often be broadcast on cable television and via satellite to Lubavitch branches around the world.

== Later life ==
===Illness===
In 1977, Rabbi Schneerson suffered a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while celebrating the ''hakafot'' ceremony on [[Shemini Atzeret]]. Despite the best efforts of his doctors to convince him to change his mind, he refused to be hospitalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoff46&quot;&gt;Hoffman 1991, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; This necessitated building a mini-hospital in his headquarters at &quot;770.&quot; Although he did not appear again in public for many weeks, Rabbi Schneerson continued to deliver talks and discourses from his study via intercom. His chief cardiologist, Dr. Ira Weiss, later stated that despite his own protestations against the Rebbe's being treated in 770, in retrospect, it had turned out to be the correct decision, and &quot;the Rebbe, in fact received better medical care in 770 than he would have had we taken him to the hospital.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/livingtorah/default.asp?searchword=weiss&amp;LocalSearchImg.x=0&amp;LocalSearchImg.y=0 |title=Living Torah Archive - Living Torah |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Kislev]], he left his study for the first time in more than a month to go home. His followers celebrate this day as a holiday each year.

===Honors===
On March 25, 1983, on the occasion of his 80th birthday, the [[United States Congress]] proclaimed Rabbi Schneerson's birthday as &quot;Education Day, USA,&quot; and awarded him the National Scroll of Honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Compiled by Dovid Zaklikowski |url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/142535/jewish/The-Rebbe-and-President-Reagan.htm |title=The Rebbe and President Ronald Reagan - Historical Correspondence |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Sunday Dollars&quot;===
As the Chabad movement grew and more demands were placed on Rabbi Schneerson's time, he limited his practice of meeting followers individually in his office. After his heart attack in 1977, he reduced the frequency of his twice-weekly practice of all-night ''Yechidut''—private audiences with whomever would request an appointment, and from then until 1982 only foreign visitors, and families with a momentous occasion such as a wedding or bar-mitzva were allowed private meetings —though community leaders and Israeli government officials would also still occasionally meet with the Rebbe in private for lengthy discussions. These private audiences had generally taken place on Sundays and Thursdays, starting at 8pm and often continuing until 8am. At such private audiences he would meet over three thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The World of Hasidism |author=H. Rabinowicz|page=237 |year=1970 |isbn=87677-005-7 |publisher=Hartmore House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986,Rabbi Schneerson again began to regularly greet people individually. This time, the personal meetings took the form of a weekly receiving line in &quot;770&quot;. Almost every Sunday, thousands of people would line up to meet briefly with Schneerson and receive a one-dollar bill, which was to be donated to charity. People filing past Schneerson would often take this opportunity to ask him for advice or to request a blessing. This event is usually referred to as &quot;Sunday Dollars.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoff47&quot;&gt;Hoffman 1991, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1989, these events were recorded on videotape. Posthumously, hundreds of thousands these encounters have been posted online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymomentwiththerebbe.com |title=mymomentwiththerebbe.com |publisher=mymomentwiththerebbe.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for public access.

===Death of his wife===
{{main|Chaya Mushka Schneerson}}

Following the death of his wife in 1988, Schneerson withdrew from some public functions. For example, he stopped delivering addresses during weekdays, instead holding gatherings every Shabbat.&lt;ref&gt;Lipkin, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; He later edited these addresses, which have since been released in the ''Sefer HaSichos'' set.

According to Ehrlich, towards the end of his life, particularly after his heart attack in 1977, Schneerson's scholarship began to fade. He writes that one of Schneerson's editors, David Olidort, &quot;told how most of Rabbi Schneerson’s aides and editors adored him and saw him as virtually infallible, despite their numerous corrections of his failing scholarship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 8, p. 80, note 35. KTAV Publishing, ISBN 0-88125-836-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years ==
=== &quot;Moshiach&quot; (Messiah) fervor ===

Some of Rabbi Schneerson's followers believed he was the [[Jewish messianism|Jewish Messiah]], the &quot;Moshiach,&quot; and have persisted in that belief since his death. The reverence with which he was treated by followers led many Jewish critics from both the Conservative and Reform communities to allege that a cult of personality had grown up around him. His obituary in the New York Times said he &quot;was attacked by Jews both to the right and the left of him,&quot; for different reasons. But the New York Times said &quot;from both sides, Rabbi Schneerson was attacked for allowing a cult of personality to grow around him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/13/nyregion/rabbi-schneerson-led-a-small-hasidic-sect-to-world-prominence.html?pagewanted=all Rabbi Schneerson Led a Small Hasidic Sect to World Prominence] ''New York Times'' Obit, Aril Goldman, June 13, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moshe D. Sherman]], an associate professor at [[Touro College]] wrote that &quot;as Schneerson's empire grew, a personality cult developed around him... portraits of Rabbi Schneerson were placed in all Lubavitch homes, shops, and synagogues, and devoted followers routinely requested a blessing from him prior to their marriage, following an illness, or at other times of need.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=WpodbkQE0oMC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22cult+of+personality%22+Schneerson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NPEB_KWvV-&amp;sig=SsAmHQ8Pe_rpXdaxDuZUswdJve8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D7g-TMi6IsKMOIaO_YEH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cult%20of%20personality%22%20Schneerson&amp;f=false Orthodox Judaism in America: A Biographical Dictionary and Sourcebook, pg. 187] Moshe D. Sherman, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====His own stated goals====
From his childhood and throughout the years of his leadership, the Rebbe explained that his goal was to &quot;make the world a better place,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schneerson, Rabbi Menachem Mendel, ''Sefer Hama’amorim Melukot Al Seder Chodshei Hashana Volume 2'' Kehot Publications 2002 (ISBN 978-1-562-602-9) page 271.&lt;/ref&gt; and to eliminate suffering. In 1954, in a letter to [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi|Yitzchak Ben Tzvi]], Israel's second President, the Rebbe wrote: &quot;From the time that I was a child attending [[cheder]], and even before, the vision of the future [[Jewish eschatology|Redemption]] began to take form in my imagination – the Redemption of the Jewish People from their final [[Galut|Exile]], a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees and annihilation of Exile will be understood...&lt;ref&gt;Schneerson, Rabbi Menachem Mendel, Igros Kodesh Volume 12 Kehot Publications 1989 (ISBN 0-8266-5812-12) page 404.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;

====Final declarations====
In 1991, he declared to his followers: &quot;I have done everything I can [to bring ''[[Jewish messianism|Moshiach]]''], now I am handing over to you [the mission]; do everything you can to bring ''Moshiach''!&quot; A campaign was then started to usher in the Messianic age through &quot;acts of goodness and kindness,&quot; and some of his followers placed advertisements in the mass media, including many full-page ads in the ''[[New York Times]]'', declaring in Rabbi Schneerson's name that the ''Moshiach'''s arrival was imminent, and urging everyone to prepare for and hasten it by increasing their good deeds.

=== Crown Heights riot ===
{{see also|Crown Heights riot}}

In 1991, Schneerson was indirectly involved in the start of a [[Crown Heights riot|riot in his neighborhood of Crown Heights]]. The riot began when a car accompanying his motorcade—returning from one of his regular [[cemetery]] visits to his [[Ohel (Chabad)|father-in-law's grave]]—accidentally struck two seven-year-old [[African American]] children, killing one boy. In the rioting, Australian-born Jewish graduate student [[Yankel Rosenbaum]] was murdered, many Lubavitchers were badly beaten, and much property was destroyed; also, rioters hurled rocks and bottles at the Jews over police lines.&lt;ref&gt;Hasid Dies in Stabbing; Black Protests Flare 2d Night in a Row By JOHN KIFNER ''New York Times'' (1857-Current file); August 21, 1991; ProQuest Historical Newspapers ''The New York Times'' (1851–2003)pg. B1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final illness ===
In 1992, Schneerson suffered a serious [[stroke]] while praying at the [[Ohel (Chabad)|grave of his father-in-law]]. The stroke left him unable to speak and paralyzed on the right side of his body. Nonetheless, he continued to respond daily to thousands of queries and requests for blessings from around the world. His secretaries would read the letters to him and he would indicate his response with head and hand motions. During this time, the belief in Schneerson as the Messiah (Moshiach) became more widespread.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp06201999&quot;&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'', June 20, 1999. 5 Years After Death, Messiah Question Divides Lubavitchers. Leyden, Liz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his deteriorating health, Schneerson once again refused to leave &quot;770&quot;. Several months into his illness, a small room with tinted glass windows and an attached balcony was built overlooking the main synagogue. This allowed Rabbi Schneerson to pray with his followers, beginning with the [[Rosh Hashanah]] services, and to appear before them after services either by having the window opened or by being carried out onto the balcony.

His final illness led to a split between two groups of aides who differed in their recommendations as to how Schneerson should be treated, with the two camps led by [[Leib Groner]] and [[Yehuda Krinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez |first=David |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0D6133EF93BA35752C1A962958260 |title='&amp;#39;Lubavitchers Learn to Sustain Themselves Without the Rebbe'&amp;#39;, David Gonselez, ''New York Times'', November 8, 1994 |publisher=New York Times |date=1994-11-08 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch14&quot;&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 14, KTAV Publishing, ISBN 0-88125-836-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Aides argued over whether Schneerson had the same physical makeup as other humans, and if the illness should be allowed to run its course without interference. Krinsky argued that the latest and most suitable medical treatment available should be used in treating Schneerson, while Groner thought that &quot;outside interference in [Schneerson]’s medical situation might be just as dangerous as inaction. They saw his illness as an element in the messianic revelation; interference with Schneerson’s physical state might therefore affect the redemptive process, which should instead be permitted to run its natural course.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch14&quot; /&gt;

== Death and burial ==
{{main|Ohel (Chabad)}}
[[File:Rebbe's Tomb.JPG|thumb|The Rebbe's Tomb: Schneerson's burial place next to his [[Ohel (Chabad)|father-in-law]] and predecessor in [[Queens, NY]].]]

Schneerson died at the [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] on June 12, 1994 ([[3 Tammuz]] 5754) and was buried at the [[Ohel (Chabad)|Ohel]] next to his teacher and father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, at [[Montefiore Cemetery]] in [[Queens, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Hasidism, by Tzvi Rabinowicz p. 432 ISBN 1-56821-123-6.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', June 13, 1994, p.

===Ohel Chabad-Lubavitch Center===
Soon after Schneerson's death, philanthropist [[Joseph Gutnick]] of [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] established the Ohel Chabad-Lubavitch Center on Francis Lewis Boulevard, Queens, New York, which is located adjacent to the Rebbe's Ohel. Following the age-old Jewish tradition of turning the resting place of a ''tzadik'' into a place of prayer, thousands of people flock to the Rebbe's resting place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohelchabad.org |title=ohelchabad.org |publisher=ohelchabad.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; every week.&lt;ref&gt;David M.

=== U.S. Government awards ===
Starting with President Carter in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/1167666/ |title=chabad.org |publisher=chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Congress and [[President]] have issued proclamations each year, declaring that Rabbi Schneerson's birthday — usually a day in March or April that coincides with his recognized [[Hebrew calendar]] birthdate of [[11 Nissan]] — be observed as [[Education and Sharing Day]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/04/20030411-2.html Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2003]&quot; by George W.

====Honored by Congress====
After Schneerson's death, a bill was introduced in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]—sponsored by Congressman [[Charles Schumer]] and cosponsored by [[John Lewis (U.S. politician)|John Lewis]], [[Newt Gingrich]], and [[Jerry Lewis (California politician)|Jerry Lewis]], as well as 220 other Congressmen—to posthumously bestow upon Schneerson the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].

On November 2, 1994 the bill passed both Houses by unanimous consent, honoring Schneerson for his &quot;outstanding and enduring contributions toward world education, morality, and acts of charity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:HR04497:%7CTOM:/bss/d103query.html |title=Public Law 103-457 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Bill Clinton]] spoke these words at the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony:

{{cquote|The late Rebbe's eminence as a moral leader for our country was recognized by every president since [[Richard Nixon]]. For over two decades, the Rabbi's movement now has some 2000 institutions; educational, social, medical, all across the globe.

=== Other posthumous commendations ===
In 2009, the  National Museum of American Jewish History&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmajh.org/ |title=nmajh.org |publisher=nmajh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; selected Schneerson as one of eighteen [[American Jews]] to be included in their [[National Museum of American Jewish History|&quot;Only in America&quot; Hall of Fame]].

== Controversy ==
{{Main|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies#Menachem Mendel Schneerson}}

=== Wills ===
There is considerable controversy within Chabad about Schneerson's will. It is widely accepted that two wills exist, the first will was signed by Schneerson and transferred stewardship of all the major Chabad institutions to Rabbi [[Yehuda Krinsky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;willis&quot; /&gt; This will is indisputable as it was officially filed and a record of its signing exists in the archives of [[New York State]].

The second will gave the bulk of control to three senior Chabad rabbis, Rabbis Mindel, Pikarski and Hodakov (contemporary of Rabbi Schneerson) and gave Krinsky only a minor role. The only copy of this will, that was drafted by others, is unsigned. Supporters of Krinsky argue that the will was merely presented to Schneerson, who chose not to sign it.&lt;ref name=&quot;willis&quot; /&gt; Supporters of the messianist camp, led by [[Leib Groner]] argue that the will was signed but that interested parties destroyed or hid the signed copy to gain power.&lt;ref name=&quot;willis&quot;&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, Chapter 20, KTAV Publishing, ISBN 0-88125-836-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The first will, signed and dated February 14, 1988, transferred power over all Schneerson’s property and personal effects to [[Agudas Chasidei Chabad]] (AGUCH) (directed by Krinsky), naming Krinsky as sole executor.&lt;ref name=&quot;willis&quot; /&gt; Avrum Erlich, a Chabad chronicler and scholar summarises the dispute:

{{cquote|After the [second] will was prepared, Rabbi Schneerson said he would look it over before signing it, and that is apparently the last that was seen of it. Some Habad members believe that Rabbi Schneerson never signed this will... others believe that even if the will was not signed, it is nevertheless indicative of his general view. There are still others who believe that a signed copy of the will exists, but was stolen from Rabbi Schneerson’s drawer and hidden by an interested party who hopes to gain by its destruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;willis&quot; /&gt;}}
Krinsky was called to testify before the Chabad ''[[Beit Din]]'' on the authenticity or otherwise of the disputed second will, but he refused to do so, contending that a local Crown Heights rabbinic body had no authority over international Lubavitch institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;willis&quot; /&gt; Krinsky's stewardship of the movement has been a bone of contention amongst Chabad followers and emissaries who see him as trying to control the movement by subsuming it under the umbrella of the AGUCH.&lt;ref name=&quot;willis&quot; /&gt;

=== Rabbi Schneerson as the Jewish Messiah ===
[[File:Chabad Mashiach Flag.svg|thumb|right|The [[Chabad messianism|Chabad messianist]] flag. The Hebrew word is &quot;''Moshiach''&quot;, meaning &quot;[[Messiah]]&quot;.]]

Before Schneerson's death in 1994 many Chabad Hasidim believed that he was soon to become manifest as the Messiah (moshiach) — an event that would herald the [[Messianic Age]] and the construction of the [[Third Temple]]. Books and pamphlets were written arguing that the Rabbi was the Messiah (moshiach).

In Schneerson's later years a movement arose believing that it was their mission to convince the world of his messiahship, and that general acceptance of this claim would lead to his revelation. Adherents to this belief were termed Meshichist. In the early '90s, his followers sang the song ''&quot;Yechi Adoneinu Moreinu v'Rabbeinu Melech haMoshiach l'olom vo'ed!&quot;'' (English: &quot;[Long] Live our Master, our Teacher, and our Rabbi, King Moshiach, for ever and ever!&quot;), and Rabbi Schneerson encouraged them with hand motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbFjzXFpkIs |title=29/04/1991 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his stroke the singing and the encouragement became routine.

A spectrum of beliefs exists today within the [[Chabad]] movement regarding Schneerson and his purported position as the [[Jewish messianism|Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Another 'Second Coming'? The Jewish Community at Odds Over a New Form of Lubavitch Messianism, George Wilkes (2002). ''Reviews in Religion &amp; Theology'' 9 (4), 285–289.&lt;/ref&gt; While some believe that he died but will return as the Messiah, others believe that he is merely &quot;hidden.&quot; Other groups believe that he has God-like powers, while a few negate the idea that he is the messiah entirely. The prevalence of these views within the movement is disputed,&lt;ref name=&quot;berber&quot;&gt;''Messianic Excess, David Berger, The Jewish Week, June 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitch'' by Sue Fishkoff, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=7839 |title=THE LATEST NEWS &amp;#124; The Jewish Week (BETA) |publisher=The Jewish Week |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though very few will openly say that Schneerson cannot be the Messiah.&lt;ref name=&quot;berber&quot; /&gt;

====Beginnings====
The belief that Schneerson is the Messiah (Moshiach) can be traced to the 1950s; it picked up momentum during the decade preceding Schneerson's death in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;See section &quot;Before Rabbi Schneerson's Death&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued to develop since his death.&lt;ref&gt;See: &quot;After Rabbi Schneerson's Death&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The response of the wider Haredi and [[Modern Orthodox]] communities to this belief has been antagonistic; the issue remains controversial within the Jewish world.&lt;ref&gt;Tomer Persico, [http://azure.org.il/article.php?id=519|title= Chabad's Lost Messiah], [[Azure (magazine)|''Azure'']], Autumn 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/lawsuit-over-chabad-building-puts-rebbe-s-living/ |title=Lawsuit Over Chabad Building Puts Rebbe's Living Legacy on Trial, The Forward, Nathaniel Popper, Mar 16, 2007 |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiajournalist.org/rw1_dinges/2005/article.asp?subj=city&amp;course=rw1_dinges&amp;id=718 |title=After Rebbe's Death, Lubavitchers Continue to Spread His Word |author=Matthew Hirshberg |work=The Columbia Journalist |publisher=ColumbiaJournalist.org |date=2006-02-21 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=AT8GF9EciLEC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Toward+the+Millennium:+Messianic+Expectations+from+the+Bible+to+Waco#PPA400,M1 |title=Toward the Millennium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco |author=Peter Schäfer |coauthor=Mark R. Cohen |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12|isbn=978-90-04-11037-3|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among his followers====
Schneerson's followers continue to visit his resting place at the [[Ohel (Chabad)|Ohel]], believing, in the words of the [[Tanya]]—the seminal work of Chabad Hasidism—that &quot;The righteous, in their passing, can bless those in this world more so than during their lifetimes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaTanya, Iggeret Hakodesh chapter 28, page 290. Kehot Publication Society, 1940–2010 ISBN 978-0-8266-0235-0&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some of his followers take this belief a step further, contending that he is able to answer their questions from beyond the grave, through a process of [[bibliomancy]] using his collected letters. This practice is known as &quot;''[[Igrot Kodesh]]''&quot;, by which answers to questions are derived through consulting the published collections of Schneerson’s letters known as the ''Igrot Kodesh''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Messiah of Brooklyn: Understanding Lubavitch Hasidim Past and Present'', M. Avrum Ehrlich, ch.18, note 14, KTAV Publishing, ISBN 0-88125-836-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/945761.html ''Chabad's critic from within'' Tom Segev, Haaretz, January 17, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
