'''Falun Gong''' or '''Falun Dafa''' (literally means &quot;''[[Dharma Wheel]] Practice''&quot;) is a spiritual discipline first introduced in China in 1992 through public lectures by its founder, [[Li Hongzhi]]. It combines the practice of meditation and slow-moving [[qigong]] exercises with a moral philosophy. Falun Gong emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue in its central tenets of [[Truthfulness]], [[Compassion]], and [[Forbearance]] ({{zh|c=真、善、忍}}), and identifies as a qigong practice of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from [[Taoist]] traditions. Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to better health and, ultimately, spiritual enlightenment.

Falun Gong emerged at the end of China's &quot;''qigong'' boom&quot;—a period which saw the proliferation of similar practices of meditation, slow-moving exercises and regulated breathing. It differs from other ''qigong'' schools in its absence of fees or formal membership, lack of daily rituals of worship, its greater emphasis on morality, and the theological nature of its teachings. Western academics have described Falun Gong as a qigong discipline, a &quot;spiritual movement&quot; based on the teachings of its founder,  a &quot;cultivation system&quot; in the tradition of Chinese antiquity, and sometimes a [[religion]] or [[new religious movement]].

Although the practice initially enjoyed considerable support from Chinese officialdom, by the mid- to late-1990s, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] and public security organs increasingly viewed Falun Gong as a potential threat due to its size, independence from the state, and spiritual teachings. By 1999, some estimates placed the number of Falun Gong adherents in the tens of millions.

On 20 July 1999, after three years of mounting tensions between the group and the government, the Communist Party leadership initiated a nationwide crackdown and multifaceted propaganda campaign intended to eradicate the practice. In October 1999 it declared Falun Gong a &quot;heretical organization&quot; and blocked [[Internet]] access to websites that mention Falun Gong. Human rights groups report that Falun Gong practitioners in China are subject to a wide range of [[human rights]] abuses; hundreds of thousands are believed to have been imprisoned extrajudicially, and practitioners in detention are subject to forced labor, psychiatric abuse, torture, and other coercive methods of thought reform at the hands of Chinese authorities. In the years since the suppression campaign began, Falun Gong adherents have emerged as a prominent voice in the Chinese dissident community, advocating for greater human rights and an end to Communist Party rule.

Li Hongzhi has lived in the United States since 1996, and Falun Gong has a sizable global constituency; inside China, some sources estimate that millions may continue to practice Falun Gong in spite of suppression. Hundreds of thousands are believed to practice Falun Gong outside China across some 70 countries worldwide.

==Origins==
Falun Gong is most frequently identified with the [[qigong]] movement in China. ''Qigong'' is a modern term that refers to a variety of practices involving slow movement, meditation, and regulated breathing. Qigong-like exercises have historically been practiced by Buddhist monks, Daoist martial artists, and Confucian scholars as a means of spiritual, moral, and physical refinement.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;David Palmer, &quot;[http://books.google.com/?id=RXeuibmD2dsC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=Qigong%20fever%3A%20body%2C%20science%2C%20and%20utopia%20in%20China%E2%80%8E%20-%20Page%20241&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q= “Qigong Fever: Body, Science and Utopia in China&quot;], (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007), isbn=0-231-14066-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern qigong movement emerged in the early 1950s, when Communist [[cadres]] embraced the techniques as a way to improve health.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt; The new term was constructed to avoid association with religious practices, that were prone to being labeled as &quot;feudal superstition&quot; and persecuted during the [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] era.&lt;ref name=Ownby2000&gt;David Ownby, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~tnchina/commentary/ownby1000.html &quot;Falungong as a Cultural Revitalization Movement: An Historian Looks at Contemporary China&quot;], Talk Given at Rice University, 20 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt; Early adopters of qigong eschewed its religious overtones, and regarded qigong principally as a branch of Chinese medicine. In the late 1970s, Chinese scientists purported to have &quot;discovered&quot; the material existence of the [[qi]] energy which qigong seeks to harness, thus lending a level of scientific credibility to the movement.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture&gt;David Ownby, ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bwqkwx4SWS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ownby+falun&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Falun Gong and the Future of China],'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), ISBN 978-0-19-532905-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spiritual vacuum of the post-Mao era, tens of millions of mostly urban and elderly Chinese citizens took up the practice of qigong, &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;Qigong, Daoism and Science: some contexts for the qigong boom,&quot; in M. Lee and A.D. Syrokomla-Stefanowska (eds.), Modernisation of the Chinese Past (Sydney: Wild Peopy, 1993), pp 166-179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunde&gt;Richard Gunde,&quot;Culture and Customs of China,&quot; (Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Chen. &quot;Breathing spaces: qigong, psychiatry, and healing in China&quot;,(New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of charismatic qigong masters established practices. At one time, over 2,000 disciplines of qigong were being taught.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu Xiaoyang and Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Qigong Boom,&quot; Chinese Sociology and Anthropology, Vol. 27, No. 1 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The state-run China Qigong Science Research Society (CQRS) was established in 1985 to oversee and administer the movement.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;[http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Religion_of_Falun_Gong.html?id=P6Z6fQ7Fg3QC The Religion of Falun Gong],&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 2012), ISBN-13: 978-0-226-65501-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 1992, Li Hongzhi gave his first public seminar on Falun Gong (alternately called Falun Dafa) in the northeastern city of [[Changchun]]. In his [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] spiritual biography, Li Hongzhi is said to have been taught ways of &quot;cultivation practice&quot; by several masters of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism|Daoist]] traditions, including Quan Jue, the 10th Heir to the Great Law of the Buddha School; a Taoist master from age eight to twelve; and a master of the Great Way School with the Taoist alias of ''True Taoist'' from the [[Changbai Mountains]]. Falun Dafa is said to be the result of his reorganizing and writing down the teachings that were passed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Li Hongzhi, [http://www.falundafa.org/bul/audio-video/audiovideo_9audio.html 9-day Lectures in Guangzhou (audio), lecture 1], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Li presented Falun Gong as part of a &quot;centuries-old tradition of cultivation&quot;,&lt;ref name=Ownbyming&gt;Ownby, David, &quot;A History for Falun Gong: Popular Religion and the Chinese State Since the Ming Dynasty&quot;, Nova Religio, Vol. 2.6 (2003), pp. 223-243&lt;/ref&gt; and in effect sought to revive the religious and spiritual elements of qigong practice that had been discarded in the earlier Communist era. David Palmer writes that Li &quot;redefined his method as having entirely different objectives from qigong: the purpose of practice should neither be physical health nor the development of extraordinary powers, but to purify one's heart and attain spiritual salvation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

Falun Gong is distinct from other qigong schools in that its teachings cover a wide range of spiritual and metaphysical topics, placing emphasis on morality and virtue, and elaborating a complete cosmology.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; The practice identifies with the Buddhist School (''Fojia''), but also draws on concepts and language found in Taoism and Confucianism.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; This has led some scholars to label the practice as a [[syncretism|syncretic]] faith.&lt;ref name=irons2003/&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
{{Main|Teachings of Falun Gong}}

===Central teachings===
Falun Gong aspires to enable the practitioner to ascend spiritually through moral rectitude and the practice of a set of exercises and meditation. The three central tenets of the belief are 'Truthfulness' (眞, Zhēn), 'Compassion' (善, Shàn), and 'Forbearance' (忍, Rěn).&lt;ref name=zflprinciples&gt;Li Hongzhi, Zhuan Falun, p 7. Quote: &quot;The most fundamental characteristic of this universe, Zhen-Shan-Ren, is the highest manifestation of the Buddha Fa. It is the most fundamental Buddha Fa.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bwqkwx4SWS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ownby+falun&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Falun Gong and the Future of China],'' pp 93, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Together these principles are regarded as the fundamental nature of the cosmos, the criterion for differentiating right from wrong, and are held to be the highest manifestation of the [[Tao]], or Buddhist Dharma.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study, p 29. Quote: &quot;According to the Falun Gong belief system, there are three virtues that are also principles of the universe: Zhen, Shan, and Ren (真, 善, 忍). Zhen is truthfulness and sincerity. Shan is compassion, benevolence, and kindness. Ren is forbearance, tolerance, and endurance. These three virtues are the only criteria that truly distinguish good people and bad people. Human society has deviated from these moral standards. All matter in the universe contains Zhen- Shan-Ren. All three are equally important.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, Falun Gong and the Future of China, p 93. Quote: &quot;The very structure of the universe, according to Li Hongzhi, is made up of the moral qualities that cultivators are enjoined to practice in their own lives: truth, compassion, and forbearance.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 133. Quote: &quot;For Li, as he often repeats in Zhuan Falun, the special characteristic or particular nature of the cosmos is the moral triumvirate of zhen (truth), shan (compassion), and ren (forbearance). He does not mean this metaphorically; for him zhen, shan, and ren are the basic organizing principles of all things… it is embedded in the very essence of everything in the universe that they adhere to the principles of truth, compassion, and forbearance.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Adherence to and cultivation of these virtues is regarded as a fundamental part of Falun Gong practice.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 124. Quote: &quot;In addition, in Falun Gong cultivation adherence to the code of truth, compassion, and forbearance is not just regarded as the right and responsible course of action for practitioners; it is an essential part of the cultivation process. Lapsing from it will render any other efforts in cultivation worthless.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In Zhuan Falun (轉法輪), the foundational text published in 1995, Li Hongzhi writes &quot;It doesn't matter how mankind's moral standard changes…The nature of the cosmos doesn't change, and it is the only standard for determining who's good and who's bad. So to be a cultivator you have to take the nature of the cosmos as your guide for improving yourself.”&lt;ref name=ZF&gt;Li Hongzhi, ''[http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/lecture1.html Zhuan Falun], (New York, NY: The Universe Publishing Company, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practice of Falun Gong consists of two features: performance of the exercises, and the refinement of one’s xinxing (moral character, or temperament). In Falun Gong's central text, Li states that xinxing &quot;includes virtue (which is a type of matter), it includes forbearance, it includes awakening to things, it includes giving up things—giving up all the desires and all the attachments that are found in an ordinary person—and you also have to endure hardship, to name just a few things.&quot;&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The elevation of one's moral character, is achieved, on the one hand, by aligning one's life with truth, compassion, and tolerance; and on the other, by abandoning desires and &quot;negative thoughts and behaviors, such as greed, profit, lust, desire, killing, fighting, theft, robbery, deception, jealousy, etc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the central concepts found in the teachings of Falun Gong is the existence of 'Virtue' ('德, ''[[De (Chinese)|Dé]]'') and 'Karma' (''[[Karma#In_Falun_Gong|Ye]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, The Religion of Falun Gong, p 172. Quote: &quot;Transforming karma into virtue is fundamental in the cultivation practice of Falun Gong&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby110&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp 110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The former is generated through doing good deeds and suffering, while the latter is accumulated through doing wrong deeds. A person's ratio of karma or virtue is said to determine his or her fortunes in this life or the next; while virtue engenders good fortune and enables spiritual transformation, an accumulation of karma results in suffering, illness, and alienation from the nature of the universe.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby110/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Hongzhi, &quot;Zhuan Falun,&quot; pp 27 - 35; 362 - 365&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual elevation is achieved through the elimination of negative karma and the accumulation of virtue.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 93. Quote: &quot;The goal of cultivation, and hence of life itself, is spiritual elevation, achieved through eliminating negative karma—the built-up sins of past and present lives—and accumulating virtue.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong's teachings posit that human beings are originally and innately good—even divine—but that they descended into a realm of delusion and suffering after developing selfishness and accruing karma.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp 103-105.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to re-ascend and return to the &quot;original, true self&quot;, practitioners of Falun Gong are therefore supposed to assimilate themselves to the qualities of truthfulness, compassion and tolerance, let go of &quot;attachments and desires&quot; and suffer to repay karma.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 93. Quote: &quot;One finds few lists of do's and don'ts in Li's writings, nor are there sophisticated ethical discussions. Instead, followers are advised to rid themselves of unnecessary &quot;attachments&quot;, to do what they know is right, and hence to return to &quot;the origin&quot;, to their &quot;original self&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of the practice is enlightenment or spiritual perfection (''yuanman''), and release from the cycle of reincarnation, known in Buddhist tradition as ''samsara''.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Chinese cultural thought and modernity are two focuses of Li Hongzhi's teachings. Falun Gong echoes traditional Chinese beliefs that humans are connected to the universe through mind and body, and Li seeks to challenge &quot;conventional mentalities&quot;, concerning the nature and genesis of the universe, time-space, and the human body.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;Danny Schechter, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v20J18hL1MAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Danny+Schechter,+Falun+Gong%27s+Challenge+to+China&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice of ‘Evil Cult’?], (New York, NY:[[Akashic Books]], 2000).

ISBN 0-7734-5241-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice draws on East Asian mysticism and traditional Chinese medicine, criticizes the purportedly self-imposed limits of modern science, and views traditional Chinese science as an entirely different, yet equally valid ontological system.&lt;ref name=&quot;zhao&quot;&gt;Zhao Yuezhi, [http://books.google.com/?id=tiFY59xGHBkC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=Falun+Gong,+Identity,+and+the+Struggle+over+Meaning+Inside+and+Outside+China&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Falun%20Gong%2C%20Identity%2C%20and%20the%20Struggle%20over%20Meaning%20Inside%20and%20Outside%20China Falun Gong, Identity, and the Struggle over Meaning Inside and Outside China], in “Contesting Media Power: Alternative Media in a Networked World,” Nick Couldry and James Curran (ed.), (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003). ISBN 978-0-7425-2385-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercises===
[[File:Five Exercises of Falun Dafa.jpg|thumb|left|The five exercises of Falun Gong]]
In addition to its moral philosophy, Falun Gong consists of four standing exercises and one sitting meditation. The exercises are regarded as secondary to moral elevation, though is still an essential component of Falun Gong cultivation practice.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=flgbook&gt;Li Hongzhi, ''[http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg.htm Falun Gong]'', 4th Translation Edition, Updated April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exercises, called &quot;Buddha Stretching a Thousand Arms&quot;, are intended to facilitate the free flow of energy through the body and open up the meridians. The second exercise, &quot;Falun Standing Stance&quot;, involves holding four static poses—each of which resembles holding a wheel—for an extended period. The objective of this exercise is to &quot;enhances wisdom, increases strength, raises a person’s level, and strengthens divine powers&quot;. The third, &quot;Coursing between the Two Poles&quot;, involves three sets of movements which aim to enable the expulsion of bad energy (e.g. pathogenic or black [[qi]]) and the absorption of good energy into the body. Through practice of this exercise, the practitioner aspires to cleanse and purify the body. The fourth exercise, &quot;Falun Cosmic Orbit&quot;, seeks to circulate energy freely throughout the body. Unlike the first through fourth exercises, the fifth exercise is performed in the seated lotus position. Called &quot;Reinforcing Supernatural Powers&quot;, it is a meditation intended to be maintained as long as possible. Some of its postures correspond to the traditional meditative gestures of Buddhism, and is described by Li as more advanced than the previous four.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; pp 163-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong exercises can be practiced individually or in group settings, and can be performed for varying lengths of time in accordance with the needs and abilities of the individual practitioner.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ownby313&quot;/&gt; Porter writes that practitioners of Falun Gong are encouraged to read Falun Gong books and practice its exercises on a regular basis, preferably daily.&lt;ref name=porterthesis&gt;Noah Porter, “[http://etd.fcla.edu/SF/SFE0000113/FalunGongInTheUS-NoahPorter-Thesis.pdf Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study]&quot;. University of South Florida, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong exercises are practiced in group settings in parks, university campuses, and other public spaces in 70 countries worldwide, and are taught for free by volunteers.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html 'Find your local volunteer contact person'].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to five exercises, in 2001 another meditation activity was introduced called &quot;sending righteous thoughts,&quot; which is intended to reduce persecution on the spiritual plane.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;

===Social practices===
Falun Gong differentiates itself from Buddhist monastic traditions in that it places great importance on participation in the secular world. Falun Gong adherents are required to maintain regular jobs and family lives, to observe the laws of their respective governments, and are instructed not to distance themselves from society. An exemption is made for Buddhist monks and nuns, who are permitted to continue a monastic lifestyle while practicing Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study, p 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its emphasis on ethical behavior, Falun Gong's teachings prescribe a strict personal morality for practitioners, which includes abstention from smoking, drugs, gambling, premarital or extramarital sex, and homosexuality.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Penny102&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; pp 102; 181.&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are said to generate negative karma, and are therefore viewed as counterproductive to the goals of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23 Misconceptions: &quot;Intolerant&quot;?], 16 June 2008. Retrieved 27 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of Falun Gong are forbidden to kill living things—including animals for the purpose of obtaining food—though it does not require the adoption of a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name=Penny102/&gt; The practice teaches against the consumption of alcohol on the basis that it is a potentially addictive attachment that can interfere with the cultivation of the body and lead to &quot;irrationality&quot;.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong doctrine also counsels against participation in political or social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive interest in politics is viewed as an attachment to worldly power and influence, and Falun Gong aims for transcendence of such pursuits. According to Hu Ping, &quot;Falun Gong deals only with purifying the individual through exercise, and does not touch on social or national concerns. It has not suggested or even intimated a model for social change. Many religions ... pursue social reform to some extent ... but there is no such tendency evident in Falun Gong.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ping&gt;Hu Ping, &quot;The Falun Gong Phenomenon&quot;, in Challenging China: Struggle and Hope in an Era of Change, Sharon Hom and Stacy Mosher (ed) (New York: The New Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texts===
The first book of Falun Gong teachings was published in April 1993. Called ''China Falun Gong'', or simply ''Falun Gong'', is an introductory text that discusses ''qigong'', Falun Gong's relationship to Buddhism, the principles of cultivation practice and the improvement of moral character (xinxing). The book also and provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises and meditation.&lt;ref name=flgbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; pp 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of teachings is articulated in the core book ''Zhuan Falun'', published in Chinese in January 1995. The book is divided into nine &quot;lectures&quot;, and was based on edited transcriptions of the talks Li gave throughout China in the preceding three years.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong texts have since been translated into an additional 38 languages. In addition to these central texts, Li has published several books, lectures, articles, books of poetry, which are made available on Falun Gong websites.&lt;ref&gt;See Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/books.html “books”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; pp 100-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falun Gong teachings use numerous untranslated Chinese religious and philosophical terms, and make frequent allusion to characters and incidents in Chinese folk literature and concepts drawn from Chinese popular religion. This, coupled with the literal translation style of the texts, which imitate the colloquial style of Li’s speeches, can make Falun Gong scriptures difficult to approach for Westerners.&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;Scott Lowe, “Chinese and International Contexts for the Rise of Falun Gong,” Nova Religio April 2003, Vol. 6, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
The main symbol of the practice is the ''Falun'' (Dharma wheel, or ''[[Dharmacakra]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]). In Buddhism, the Dharmacakra represents the completeness of the doctrine. To &quot;turn the wheel of dharma&quot; (''Zhuan Falun'') means to preach the Buddhist doctrine, and is the title of Falun Gong's main text.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;Falun Gong, Buddhism, and Buddhist qigong,&quot; Asian Studies Review 29 (March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the invocation of Buddhist language and symbols, the law wheel as understood in Falun Gong has distinct connotations, and is held to represent the universe.&lt;ref name=Bruseker/&gt; It is conceptualized by an emblem consisting of one large and four small [[Swastika]] symbols, representing the Buddha, and four small [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] (yin-yang) symbols of the Daoist tradition.&lt;ref name=ZF/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruseker&gt;George Bruseker, &quot;Falun Gong: A Modern Chinese Folk Buddhist Movement in Crisis,&quot; 26 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorization==
Falun Gong is a multifaceted discipline that means different things to different people, ranging from a set of physical exercises for the attainment of better health and a praxis of self-transformation, to a moral philosophy and a new knowledge system.&lt;ref name=&quot;zhao&quot;/&gt; Scholars and journalists have adopted a variety of terms and classifications in describing Falun Gong, some of them more precise than others.

In the cultural context of China, Falun Gong is generally described either as a system of [[qigong]], or a type of &quot;cultivation practice&quot; (''xiulian''). Cultivation is a Chinese term that describes the process by which an individual seeks spiritual perfection, often through both physical and moral conditioning. Varieties of cultivation practice are found throughout Chinese history, spanning Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian traditions.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Benjamin Penny, a professor of Chinese history at the Australian National University, writes &quot;the best way to describe Falun Gong is as a cultivation system. Cultivation systems have been a feature of Chinese life for at least 2,500 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pennyharrold&quot;&gt;Benjamin Penny, [http://www.nla.gov.au/grants/haroldwhite/papers/bpenny.html The Past, Present, and Future of Falun Gong], Lecture given at the National Library of Australia, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Qigong practices can also be understood as a part of a broader tradition of &quot;cultivation practice&quot;.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

In the West, Falun Gong is frequently classified as a religion on the basis of its theological and moral teachings, &lt;ref name=Madsen/&gt; its concerns with spiritual cultivation and transformation, and its extensive body of scripture.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Human rights groups report on the suppression of Falun Gong as a violation of religious freedom, and in 2001, Falun Gong was given an International Religious Freedom Award from [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; Falun Gong practitioners themselves have sometimes disavowed this classification, however. This rejection reflects the relatively narrow definition of &quot;religion&quot; (''zongjiao'') in contemporary China. According to David Ownby, religion in China has been defined since 1912 to refer to &quot;world-historical faiths&quot; that have &quot;well-developed institutions, clergy, and textual traditions&quot;—namely, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/052305/Ownby.php &quot;Unofficial Religions in China: Beyond the Party's Rules&quot;], Testimony for the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 23 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong lacks these features, having no temples, rituals of worship, clergy or formal hierarchy. Moreover, if Falun Gong had described itself as a religion in China, it likely would have invited immediate suppression.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; These historical and cultural circumstances notwithstanding, the practice has often been described as a form of Chinese religion.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot; The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 226. Quote: &quot;Falun Gong is a new form of Chinese religion, even if its adherents themselves may not recognize it as being religion at all.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is often referred to as such in journalistic literature, Falun Gong does not satisfy the definition of a &quot;sect.&quot;&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; A sect is generally defined as a branch or denomination of an established belief system or mainstream church. Although Falun Gong draws on both Buddhist and Daoist ideas and terminology, it claims no direct relationship or lineage connection to these religions.&lt;ref name=Ownbyming/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot;  p 26. Quote: &quot;[Falun Gong] claims no immediate predecessor in the sense of asserting its position in a lineage of religions. Nonetheless, as will be clear throughout this book, many of the terms Li Hongzhi uses and the ideas that underpin Falun Gong teachings are found in Chinese religions of the past.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists{{who?|date=May 2012}} regard sects as exclusive groups that exist within clearly defined boundaries, with rigorous standards for admission and strict allegiances. However, as noted by Noah Porter, Falun Gong does not share these qualities: it does not have clearly defined boundaries, and anyone may practice it.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;

Cheris Shun-ching considers cults to be new religious movements that focus on the individual experience of the encounter with the sacred rather than collective worship, and to that end describes Falun Gong as a new religious movement “with cult-like characteristics.&quot; However, Chan defines a &quot;cult&quot; differently than as the term is usually understood; she calls it a group that does not have a &quot;prior theological tie with an established religious body,&quot; that holds &quot;beliefs and practice [that] are very often mystically and individualistically oriented,&quot; and which is &quot;loosely structured with a ﬂuctuating membership and tolerant of other organizations and faiths.&quot;&lt;ref name=chan2004&gt;Cheris Shun-ching Chan, &quot;The Falun Gong in China: A Sociological Perspective,&quot; ''The China Quarterly'', 179 (2004), pp 665–683.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars avoid the term &quot;cult&quot; altogether because &quot;of the confusion between the historic meaning of the term and current pejorative use.&quot;&lt;ref name=bainbridge97&gt;William Sims Bainbridge, The Sociology of Religious Movements, (Routledge, 1997), p 24.

==Organization==
As a matter of doctrinal significance, Falun Gong is intended to be &quot;formless&quot;, having little to no material or formal organization. Practitioners of Falun Gong cannot collect money or charge fees, conduct healings, or teach or interpret doctrine for others.&lt;ref name=Palmer241&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China,” p 241-246&lt;/ref&gt; There are no administrators or officials within the practice, no system of membership, and no churches or physical places of worship.&lt;ref name=porterprof&gt;Noah Porter, &quot;Professional Practitioners and Contact Persons Explicating Special Types of Falun Gong Practitioners&quot;, ''Nova Religio'', November 2005, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp 62–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite journal| first=James| last=Tong| title=An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing| journal=[[The China Quarterly]]| volume=171| month=September| year=2002| pages=636–660| doi=10.1017/S0009443902000402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; In the absence of membership or initiation rituals, Falun Gong practitioners can be anyone who chooses to identify themselves as such.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haar&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://website.leidenuniv.nl/~haarbjter/faluntext3.html|title=Evaluation and Further References|last=Haar|first=Barendter|accessdate=21 December 2009|quote=One difference between the Falun Gong and traditional groups is the absence of rituals of daily worship or rites of passage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are free to participate in the practice and follow its teachings as much or as little as they like, and practitioners do not instruct others on what to believe or how to behave.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ping/&gt;&lt;ref name=OwnbyCanada&gt;David Ownby, &quot;Falungong and Canada's China Policy,&quot; International Journal, Spring 2001, p 193. Quote:&quot;These people have discovered what is to them the truth of the universe. They have arrived freely at this discovery, and, if they change their mind, they are fee to go on to something else. The Falungong community seems to be supportive but not constraining – aside from the peer pressure that exists in many groups situations; there is no visible power structure to chastise a misbehaving practitioner, nor do practitioners tell one another what to do or what to believe.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Falun Gong is centralized in that spiritual authority is vested in the corpus of teachings of the founder, Li Hongzhi, but organizationally it is decentralized with local branches and assistants afforded no special privileges, authority, or titles. Volunteer &quot;assistants&quot; or &quot;contact persons&quot; do not hold authority over other practitioners, regardless of how long they have practiced Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=burgdoff&gt;Craig A. Burgdoff, “How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric,” ''Nova Religio'' April 2003, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp 332–347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chou/&gt; As such, spiritual and ideological authority in the practice is completely centralized with Li Hongzhi.&lt;ref name=Palmer241/&gt; Li's spiritual authority within the practice is absolute, yet the organization of Falun Gong works against totalistic control, and Li does not intervene in the personal lives of adherents. Practitioners of Falun Gong have little to no contact with Li, except through the study of his teachings.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; There is no hierarchy in Falun Gong to enforce orthodoxy, and little or no emphasis is given on dogmatic discipline; the only thing emphasized is the need for strict moral behavior, according to Craig Burgdoff, a professor of religious studies.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt;

To the extent that organization is achieved in Falun Gong, it is accomplished through a global, networked, and largely virtual online community. In particular, electronic communications, email lists and a collection of websites are the primary means of coordinating activities and disseminating Li Hongzhi's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lrQV2Wi1RdgC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=Kevin+McDonald,+Global+Movements:+Action+and+Culture,+chapter+7,+‘Healing+Movements,+embodied+subjects’,+Wiley-Blackwell+(2006)&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Global movements: action and culture | first=Kevin | last=McDonald | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-4051-1613-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Falun Gong's reliance on the internet as a means of organizing has led to the group's characterization as &quot;a virtual religious community.&quot;&lt;ref name=Chou/&gt;

Outside Mainland China, a network of volunteer 'contact persons', regional Falun Dafa Associations and university clubs exist in approximately 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Falundafa.org, [http://www.falundafa.org/eng/contacts/area/index.html ‘Local Contacts’].&lt;/ref&gt; Li Hongzhi's teachings are principally spread through the Internet.&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Bell, Taylor C. Boas, ''Falun Gong and the Internet: Evangelism, Community, and Struggle for Survival'', Nova Religio, April 2003, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp 277–293&lt;/ref&gt; In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read Li Hongzhi's writings. The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=fieldnotes&gt;Susan Palmer and David Ownby, ''Field Notes: Falun Dafa Practitioners: A Preliminary Research Report'', Nova Religio, 2000.4.1.133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burgdoff, “How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric,” p 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Group study sessions typically take place in the evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as &quot;the closest thing to a regular 'congregational experience'&quot; that Falun Gong offers.&lt;ref name=Ownby313&gt;David Ownby, &quot;Falun Gong in the New World&quot;, European Journal of East Asian Studies (2003), pp 313-314.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who are too busy, isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately.&lt;ref name=Ownby313/&gt; When there are expenses to be covered (such as for the rental of facilities for large-scale conferences), costs are borne by self-nominated and relatively affluent individual members of the community.&lt;ref name=Ownby313/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burgdoff, “How Falun Gong Practice Undermines Li Hongzhi's Totalistic Rhetoric,” p 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization within China===
In 1993, the Beijing-based Falun Dafa Research Society was accepted as a branch of the state-run China Qigong Research Society (CQRS), which oversaw the administration of the country's various qigong schools, and sponsored activities and seminars. As per the requirements of the CQRS, Falun Gong was organized into a nationwide network of assistance centers, &quot;main stations&quot;, &quot;branches&quot;, &quot;guidance stations&quot;, and local practice sites, mirroring the structure of the qigong society or even of the Communist Party itself.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonald&gt;Kevin McDonald, Global Movements: Action and Culture, 'Healing Movements, embodied subjects', (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 2006), pp 142 – 164&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong assistants were self-selecting volunteers who taught the exercises, organized events, and disseminated new writings from Li Hongzhi. The Falun Dafa Research Society provided advice to students on meditation techniques, translation services, and coordination for the practice nationwide.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;

Following its departure from the CQRS in 1996, Falun Gong came under increased scrutiny from authorities and responded by adopting a more decentralized and loose organizational structure.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt; In 1997, the Falun Dafa Research Society was formally dissolved, along with the regional &quot;main stations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, “An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing,”  p 641&lt;/ref&gt; Yet practitioners continued to organize themselves at local levels, being connected through electronic communications, interpersonal networks and group exercise sites.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong2009&gt;James Tong, &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PyxCVRB-De8C&amp;pg=PP6&amp;lpg=PP6&amp;dq=james+tong+revenge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PAXEUO0lAG&amp;sig=Asclwn4AMZASBTPoy1oo-DtsneA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bF-FULFdpPbSAaiUgMAM&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999-2005]&quot; (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2009), isbn 0195377281&lt;/ref&gt; Both Falun Gong sources and Chinese government sources claimed that there were some 1,900 &quot;guidance stations&quot; and 28,263 local Falun Gong exercise sites nationwide by 1999, though they disagree over the extent of vertical coordination among these organizational units.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, “An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing,”  p 642.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the suppression that began in 1999, Falun Gong was driven underground, the organizational structure grew yet more informal within China, and the internet took precedence as a means of connecting practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Thornton, &quot;Manufacturing Dissent in Transnational China&quot;, in Popular Protest in China, Kevin J. O’Brien (ed.), (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the suppression of Falun Gong in 1999, Chinese authorities sought to portray Falun Gong as a hierarchical and well-funded organization. James Tong writes that it was in the government's interest to portray Falun Gong as highly organized in order to justify its repression of the group: &quot;The more organized the Falun Gong could be shown to be, then the more justified the regime's repression in the name of social order was.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, “An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing,” p 638.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that Party's claims lacked &quot;both internal and external substantiating evidence&quot;, and that despite the arrests and scrutiny, the authorities never &quot;credibly countered Falun Gong rebuttals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, “An Organizational Analysis of the Falun Gong: Structure, Communications, Financing,” p  657.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to July 1999, official estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners as high as 60 to 70 million nationwide, rivaling membership in the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=BayFang&gt;Bay Fang, [http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/990222/archive_000322.htm &quot;An opiate of the masses?&quot; U.S. News and World Report, February 22, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faison&gt;Seth Faison, [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/042799china-protest.html &quot;In Beijing: A Roar of Silent Protestors&quot;], New York Times, 27 April 1999.

A.5. | Quote: &quot;Before the crackdown the government estimated membership at 70 million — which would make it larger than the Chinese Communist Party, with 61 million members.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the suppression on 22 July 1999, most Chinese government numbers said the population of Falun Gong was between 2 and 3 million,&lt;ref name=Tong2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zong&gt;Zong Hairen, “Zhu Rongji zai 1999” (Zhu Rongji in 1999) (Carle Place, N.Y.: Mirror Books, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; though some publications maintained an estimate of 40 million.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheris Shun-ching (2004). &quot;The Falun Gong in China: A Sociological Perspective&quot;.

Quote: &quot;In 1997, Li Hongzhi claimed to have 100 million followers, including 20 million regular practitioners.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have estimated the Falun Gong population in China to have peaked between 10 and 60 million practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Faison, [http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln270/FalunGong/16.htm Followers of Chinese Sect Defend Its Spiritual Goals], New York Times, 30 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China.” Quote: &quot;...we may very roughly and tentatively estimate that the total number of practitioners was, at its peak, between 3 and 20 million. [...] A mid-range estimate of 10 million would appear, to me, more reasonable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Falun Gong adherents still practicing in China today is difficult to confirm, though some sources estimate that millions may continue to practice privately.&lt;ref name=ReligiousFreedom2009&gt;U.S. Department of State, 2009 International Religious Freedom Report: China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Moore, “[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/5213629/Falun-Gong-growing-in-China-despite-10-year-ban.html Falun Gong 'growing' in China despite 10-year ban],” The Telegraph, 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic surveys conducted in China in 1998 found a population that was mostly female and elderly. Of 34,351 Falun Gong practitioners surveyed, 27% were male and 73% female. Only 38% were under 50 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Porter, &quot;Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study,&quot; p 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong attracted a range of other individuals, from young college students to bureaucrats, intellectuals and Party officials.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kaye, &quot;Travelers Tales,&quot; Far Eastern Economic Review, 23 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys in China from the 1990s found that between 23% - 40% of practitioners held university degrees at the college or graduate level—several times higher than the general population.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;

Falun Gong is practiced by tens, and possibly hundreds of thousands outside China,&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 126.&lt;/ref&gt; with the largest communities found in Taiwan and North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York and Toronto. Demographic surveys by Palmer and Ownby in these communities found that 90% of practitioners are ethnic Chinese. The average age was approximately 40. &lt;ref name=Ownby136&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married. The surveys found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had Masters degrees, and 24% had a Bachelors degree.&lt;ref name=Ownby136/&gt;

The most commonly reported reasons for being attracted to Falun Gong were intellectual content, cultivation exercises, and health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' pp 132-134.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Chinese adherents of Falun Gong tend to fit the profile of &quot;spiritual seekers&quot;—people who had tried a variety of qigong, yoga, or religious practices before finding Falun Gong. According to Richard Madsen, Chinese scientists with doctorates from prestigious American universities who practice Falun Gong claim that modern physics (for example, superstring theory) and biology (specifically the [[pineal gland]]'s function) provide a scientific basis for their beliefs. From their point of view, &quot;Falun Dafa is knowledge rather than religion, a new form of science rather than faith.&quot;&lt;ref name=Madsen&gt;Richard Madsen, “Understanding Falun Gong,” Current History (September 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History inside China==
{{Main|History of Falun Gong}}

===1992–1996===
[[Li Hongzhi]] introduced Falun Gong to the public in 13 May 1992, in [[Changchun]], [[Jilin]] Province.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; Several months later, in September 1992, Falun Gong was admitted as a branch of qigong under the administration of the state-run China Qigong Scientific Research Society (CQRS). Li was recognized as a qigong master, and was authorized to teach his practice nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ownby (2003)&quot;&gt;David Ownby, &quot;The Falun Gong in the New World&quot;. European Journal of East Asian Studies, Sep 2003, Vol. 2 Issue 2, p 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many ''qigong'' masters at the time, Li toured major cities in China from 1992 to 1994 to teach the practice. He was granted a number of awards by PRC governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=Zfl&gt;[http://www.trinity.edu/rnadeau/Chinese%20Religions/Li%20Hongzhi.htm A Short Biography of Mr. Li Hongzhi], PRC law and Government v. 32 no. 6 (November/December 1999) p. 14-23 ISSN: 0009-4609&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pennyharrold&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Jennifer. “Witnessing history: one Chinese woman's fight for freedom,” Soho Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

According to David Ownby, Professor of History and Director of the Center for East Asian Studies at the Université de Montréal, Li became an &quot;instant star of the qigong movement&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ownbyworld&quot;&gt;David Ownby, &quot;The Falun Gong in the New World&quot;. European Journal of East Asian Studies, Sep2003, Vol. 2 Issue 2, p 306&lt;/ref&gt; and Falun Gong was embraced by the government as an effective means of lowering health care costs, promoting Chinese culture, and improving public morality. In December 1992, for instance, Li and several Falun Gong students participated in the Asian Health Expo in Beijing, where he reportedly “received the most praise [of any qigong school] at the fair, and achieved very good therapeutic results,” according to the fair’s organizer&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; The event helped cement Li’s popularity, and journalistic reports of Falun Gong’s healing powers spread.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; In 1993, a publication of the Ministry of Public Security praised Li for &quot;promoting the traditional crime-fighting virtues of the Chinese people, in safeguarding social order and security, and in promoting rectitude in society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://faluninfo.net/topic/24/ “Falun Gong: Timeline”], 18 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falun Gong had differentiated itself from other ''qigong'' groups in its emphasis on morality, low cost, and health benefits. It rapidly spread via word-of-mouth, attracting a wide range of adherents from all walks of life, including numerous members of the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;&lt;ref name=lum&gt;Thomas Lum, [http://www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL33437.pdf Congressional Research Report #RL33437], Congressional Research Service, 11 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Li charged less than competing ''qigong'' systems for lectures, tapes, and books, and in 1994 had altogether stopped collecting fees for his lectures.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; With the publication of the books ''Falun Gong'' and ''[[Teachings of Falun Gong#Zhuan Falun, the Main Book of Falun Gong|Zhuan Falun]]'', Li made his teachings more widely accessible. ''Zhuan Falun'', published in January 1995 at an unveiling ceremony held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Public Security, became a best-seller in China.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, &quot;Falun Gong's Challenge to China: Spiritual Practice or Evil Cult?,&quot; p 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Chinese authorities began looking to Falun Gong to solidify its organizational structure and ties to the party-state.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt; Li was approached by the Chinese National Sports Committee, Ministry of Public Health, and China Qigong Science Research Association (CQRS) to jointly establish a Falun Gong association. Li declined the offer. The same year, the CQRS issued a new regulation mandating that all qigong denominations establish a Communist Party branch. Li again refused.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

Tensions continued to mount between Li and the CQRS in 1996. In the face of Falun Gong's rise in popularity—a large part of which was attributed to its low cost—competing ''qigong'' masters accused Li of undercutting them. According to Schechter, the ''qigong'' society under which Li and other ''qigong'' masters belonged asked Li to hike his tuition, but Li emphasized the need for the teachings to be free of charge.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;

In March 1996, in response to mounting disagreements, Falun Gong withdrew from the Qigong Association, after which time it operated outside the official sanction of the state. Falun Gong representatives attempted to register with other government entities, but were rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China,” p 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Li and Falun Gong were then outside the circuit of personal relations and financial exchanges through which masters and their ''qigong'' organizations could find a place within the state system, and also the protections this afforded.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China,” p 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–1999===
Falun Gong’s departure from the state-run Qigong Association corresponded to a wider shift in the government’s attitudes towards qigong practices. As qigong’s detractors in government grew more influential, authorities began attempting to rein in the growth and influence of these groups, some of which had amassed tens of millions of followers.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; In the mid-1990s the state-run media began publishing articles critical of qigong.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

Falun Gong was initially shielded from the mounting criticism, but following its withdrawal from the CQRS in March 1996, it lost this protection. On 17 June 1996, the ''Guangming Daily'', an influential state-run newspaper, published a polemic against Falun Gong in which its central text, ''Zhuan Falun'', was described as an example of &quot;feudal superstition.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; &lt;ref name=Palmer249&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China,” p 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The author wrote that the history of humanity is a &quot;struggle between science and superstition,&quot; and called on Chinese publishers not to print &quot;pseudo-scientific books of the swindlers.&quot; Until this juncture, Falun Gong had successfully negotiated the space between science and native tradition in the public representation of its teachings, avoiding any suggestion of superstition.&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;Edward L. Davis, Encyclopedia of contemporary Chinese culture, Falun Gong (by Lionel M. Jensen), pp. 251–263&lt;/ref&gt; The article was followed by at least twenty more in newspapers nationwide. Soon after, on 24 July, the Central Propaganda Department banned all publication of Falun Gong books (though the ban was not consistently enforced).&lt;ref name=Palmer249/&gt; The state-administered Buddhist Association of China also began issuing criticisms of Falun Gong, urging lay Buddhists not to take up the practice.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China,” p 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events were an important challenge to Falun Gong, and one that practitioners did not take lightly.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Falun Gong followers wrote to ''Guangming Daily'' and to the CQRS to complain against the measures, claiming that they violated [[Hu Yaobang]]'s 1982 'Triple No' directive which prohibited the media from either encouraging or criticizing qigong practices. &lt;ref&gt;Sumner B. Twiss, &quot;Religious Intolerance in Contemporary China, Including the Curious Case of Falun Gong,&quot; The World's Religions After 11 September, by Arvind Sharma (ed.) (Greenwood Publishing, 2009), pp. 227-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer249/&gt; In other instances, Falun Gong adherents staged peaceful demonstrations outside media or local government offices to request retractions of perceived unfair coverage. Li Hongzhi made statements that practitioners' response to criticism showed their hearts and &quot;would separate the false disciples from the true ones&quot;, also indicating that publicly defending the practice was a righteous act and an important aspect of Falun Gong cultivation.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

The polemics against Falun Gong were part of a larger movement opposing qigong organizations in the state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Falun Gong was not the only target of the media criticism, nor the only group to protest, theirs was the most mobilized and steadfast response.&lt;ref name=&quot;zhao&quot;/&gt; Many of Falun Gong's protests against negative media portrayals were successful, resulting in the retraction of several newspaper stories critical of the practice. This contributed to practitioners' belief that the media claims against them were false or exaggerated, and that their stance was justified.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1998, Tianjin professor [[He Zuoxiu]], an outspoken critic of qigong and member of the Communist Party’s consultative conference, appeared on a talk show on [[Beijing Television]] and openly disparaged ''qigong'' groups, making particular mention of Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China,” pp 252-256&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners responded with peaceful protests and by lobbying the station for a retraction. The reporter responsible for the program was reportedly fired, and a program favorable to Falun Gong was aired several days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jude Howell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H80YZqSj7EEC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Governance+in+China+~+Jude+Howell#v=onepage&amp;q= |work=Governance in China |editor= Jude Howell |first=Clemens Stubbe |last=Østergaard |pages=214–223 |title=Governance and the Political Challenge of Falun Gong |year=2003 |isbn=0-7425-1988-0 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |location=Lanham, Md.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dangerous&gt;{{Cite book|last=Human Right Watch|coauthors=Mickey Spiegel|title=Dangerous meditation: China's campaign against Falungong|location=New York|year=2001|page=9|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners also mounted demonstrations at 14 other media outlets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jude Howell&quot; /&gt;

In 1997, The Ministry of Public Security launched an investigation into whether Falun Gong should be deemed xie jiao (邪教, &quot;heretical teaching&quot;). The report concluded that &quot;no evidence has appeared thus far&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China,” p 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, however, on 21 July 1998, the Ministry of Public Security issued Document No. 555, &quot;Notice of the Investigation of Falun Gong&quot;. The document asserted that Falun Gong is a &quot;heretical teaching&quot;, and mandated that another investigation be launched to seek evidence in support of the conclusion.&lt;ref name=Palmer267/&gt; Falun Gong practitioners reported having phone lines tapped, homes ransacked and raided, and Falun Gong exercise sites disrupted by public security agents.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;

In this time period, even as criticism of qigong and Falun Gong mounted in some circles, the practice maintained a number of high-profile supporters in the government. In 1998, [[Qiao Shi]], the recently retired Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, initiated his own investigation into Falun Gong. After months of investigations, his group concluded that &quot;Falun Gong has hundreds of benefits for the Chinese people and China, and does not have one single bad effect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Penny, &quot;The Religion of Falun Gong,&quot; p 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, China's National Sports Commission launched its own survey of Falun Gong. Based on interviews with over 12,000 Falun Gong adherents in [[Guangdong]] province,&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; they stated that they were &quot;convinced the exercises and effects of Falun Gong are excellent. It has done an extraordinary amount to improve society's stability and ethics.&quot;

The practice’s founder, Li Hongzhi, was largely absent from the country during the period of rising tensions with the government. Li had left China to teach his practice abroad in 1996, and in 1998 obtained permanent residency in the United States.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GallagherAshcraft2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eugene V.

===Tianjin and Zhongnanhai protests===
[[Image:April25Zhognanhai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Falun Gong practitioners protest outside the [[Zhongnanhai]] compound.]]
By the late 1990s, the Communist Party's relationship to the growing Falun Gong movement had become increasingly tense. Reports of discrimination and surveillance by the Public Security Bureau were escalating, and Falun Gong adherents were routinely organizing sit-in demonstrations responding to media articles they deemed to be unfair. The conflicting investigations launched by the Ministry of the Public Security on one side and the State Sports Commission and Qiao Shi on the other spoke of the disagreements among China's elites on how to regard the growing practice.

In April 1999, an article critical of Falun Gong was published in [[Tianjin Normal University]]'s ''Youth Reader'' magazine. The article was authored by physicist He Zuoxiu who, as Porter and Gutmann note, is a relative of Politburo member and public security tsar [[Luo Gan]].&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt; The article cast qigong, and Falun Gong in particular, as superstitious and harmful for youth.&lt;ref name=hezuoxiu&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnfxj.org/Html/lgxd/2007-6/24/165513641.html#|title=I do not agree with Youth Practicing ''Qigong'' (我不赞成青少年炼气功)|author=[[He Zuoxiu]]|language=Chinese|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong practitioners responded by picketing the offices of the newspaper requesting a retraction of the article.&lt;ref name=Palmer267&gt;David Palmer, “Qigong Fever:Body, Science and Utopia in China,” p 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike past instances in which Falun Gong protests were successful, on 22 April the Tianjin demonstration was broken up by the arrival of three hundred riot police. Some of the practitioners were beaten, and forty-five arrested.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer267/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby171&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 171&lt;/ref&gt; Other Falun Gong practitioners were told that if they wished to appeal further, they needed to take the issue up with the Ministry of Public Security and go to Beijing to appeal&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou&gt;Ethan Gutmann, An Occurrence on Fuyou Street, ''National Review,'' 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownby171/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, “Falun Gong’s Challenge to China,” p 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falun Gong community quickly mobilized a response, and on the morning of 25 April, upwards of 10,000 practitioners gathered near the central appeals office to demand an end to the escalating harassment against the movement, and request the release of the Tianjin practitioners. According to Benjamin Penny, practitioners sought redress from the leadership of the country by going to them and, &quot;albeit very quietly and politely, making it clear that they would not be treated so shabbily.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pennyharrold&quot; /&gt; Journalist Ethan Gutmann wrote that security officers had been expecting them, and corralled the practitioners onto Fuyou Street in front of Zhongnanhai government compound.&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt; They sat or read quietly on the sidewalks surrounding the Zhongnanhai.&lt;ref name=Tong5&gt;James Tong, &quot;Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999-2005,&quot; p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Falun Gong representatives met with Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] and other senior officials to negotiate a resolution. The Falun Gong representatives were assured that the regime supported physical exercises for health improvements and did not consider the Falun Gong to be anti-government. &lt;ref name=Tong5/&gt; Upon reaching this resolution, the crowd of Falun Gong protesters dispersed.&lt;ref name=gutmannfuyou/&gt;

President [[Jiang Zemin]] was alerted to the demonstration by Politburo member Luo Gan,&lt;ref name=Zong/&gt; and was reportedly angered by the audacity of the demonstration—the largest since the Tiananmen Square protests ten years earlier. Jiang called for resolute action to suppress the group,&lt;ref name=Tong2009/&gt; and reportedly criticized Premier Zhu for being &quot;too soft&quot; in his handling of the situation.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; That evening, Jiang composed a letter indicating his desire to see Falun Gong &quot;defeated&quot;. In the letter, Jiang expressed concerns over the size and popularity of Falun Gong, and in particular about the large number of senior Communist Party members found among Falun Gong adherents. He also intimated that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was at odds with the [[Marxist–Leninist atheism|atheist values of Marxist-Leninism]], and therefore constituted a form of ideological competition.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Zemin, Letter to Party cadres on the evening of 25 April 1999. Published in Beijing Zhichun no. 97 (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jiang is held by Falun Gong to be personally responsible for this decision to suppress Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=peerman&gt;Dean Peerman, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_16_121/ai_n8702386/pg_4 China syndrome: the persecution of Falun Gong], Christian Century, 10 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saich&gt;Tony Saich, ''Governance and Politics in China,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition (27 February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Peerman cited reasons such as suspected personal jealousy of Li Hongzhi; Saich points to Jiang's anger at Falun Gong's widespread appeal, and ideological struggle as causes for the crackdown that followed. Willy Wo-Lap Lam suggests Jiang's decision to suppress Falun Gong was related to a desire to consolidate his power within the Politburo.&lt;ref&gt;Lam, Willy Wo-Lap. &quot;China's sect suppression carries a high price,&quot; CNN, 5 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, Communist Party leaders and ruling elite were far from unified in their support for the crackdown.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt;

[[File:Arrest of Falung Gong Practitioners in China.jpg|thumb|left|Falun Gong practitioners being arrested on Tiananmen Square.]]

On 20 July 1999, security forces abducted and detained thousands of Falun Gong adherents that they identified as leaders.&lt;ref name=Tong2009/&gt; Two days later on 22 July, the PRC Ministry of Civil Affairs outlawed the Falun Dafa Research Society as an illegal organization &quot;engaged in illegal activities, advocating superstition and spreading fallacies, hoodwinking people, inciting and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability&quot;,&lt;ref name=ban&gt;[[Xinhua]], [http://english.people.com.cn/special/fagong/1999072200A101.html China Bans Falun Gong], ''People's Daily'', 22 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ministry of Public Security issued a circular forbidding citizens from practicing Falun Gong in groups, possessing Falun Gong's teachings, displaying Falun Gong banners or symbols, or protesting the ban.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt;

The ensuing campaign aimed to &quot;eradicate&quot; the group through a combination of propaganda, imprisonment, and coercive thought reform of adherents, sometimes resulting in deaths. In October 1999, four months after the ban, legislation was created to outlaw &quot;[[heterodoxy|heterodox]] religions,&quot; and applied to sentence Falun Gong devotees to prison terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leung&quot;&gt;Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 – 784&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

In February 2001, in an attempt to show unity, the Communist Party held a Central Work Conference and discussed Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Under Jiang's leadership, the crackdown on Falun Gong became part of the Chinese political ethos of &quot;upholding stability&quot; – much the same rhetoric employed by the party during [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen in 1989]]. Jiang's message was echoed at the 2001 National People's Congress, where Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] made special mention of Falun Gong in his outline of the PRC [[Tenth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Tenth Five-Year Plan]], saying &quot;we must continue our campaign against the Falun Gong cult&quot;, effectively tying Falun Gong's eradication to China's economic progress.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Though less prominent on the national agenda, the suppression against Falun Gong has carried on during the tenure of Hu Jintao; successive, high-level &quot;strike hard&quot; campaigns against Falun Gong were initiated in both 2008 and 2009. In 2010, a three-year campaign was launched to renew attempts at the coercive &quot;transformation&quot; of Falun Gong adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=154369&amp;PHPSESSID=5fbbb671b469039d4ec2ae47774039bd &quot;Communist Party Calls for Increased Efforts To &quot;Transform&quot; Falun Gong Practitioners as Part of Three-Year Campaign&quot;], 22 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speculation on rationale===
Foreign observers have attempted to explain the Party's rationale for banning Falun Gong as stemming from a variety of factors. These include Falun Gong's popularity, China’s history of quasi-religious movements which turned into violent insurrections, its independence from the state and refusal to toe the Party line, internal power politics within the Communist Party, and Falun Gong's moral and spiritual content, which put it at odds with the atheist aspects of the official Marxist ideology.

Xinhua News Agency, the official news organization of the Communist Party, declared that Falun Gong is &quot;opposed to the Communist Party of China and the central government, preaches idealism, theism and feudal superstition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;english.peopledaily.com.cn&quot;&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/english/199908/02/enc_19990802001003_TopNews.html Xinhua Commentary on Political Nature of Falun Gong], People's Daily, 2 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Xinhua also asserted that &quot;the so-called 'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by Li has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve&quot;, and argued that it was necessary to crush Falun Gong in order to preserve the &quot;vanguard role and purity&quot; of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=hanson1999&gt;Gayle M.B.

Willy Wo-Lap Lam writes that president Jiang Zemin's campaign against Falun Gong may have been used to promote allegiance to himself; Lam quotes one party veteran as saying &quot;by unleashing a Mao-style movement [against Falun Gong], Jiang is forcing senior cadres to pledge allegiance to his line.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Willy Wo-Lap Lam, &quot;China's sect suppression carries a high price&quot;. CNN, 9 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that sources indicated not all of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|standing committee of the Politburo]] shared Jiang's view that Falun Gong should be eradicated,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReidG&quot;&gt;Reid, Graham (29 April-5 May 2006) [http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3442/features/5972/nothing_left_to_lose.html &quot;Nothing left to lose&quot;], ''New Zealand Listener''. Retrieved 6 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but James Tong suggests there was not substantial resistance from the Politburo.

Human Rights Watch notes that the crackdown on Falun Gong reflects historical efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to eradicate religion, which the government believes is inherently subversive.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; The Chinese government protects five &quot;patriotic&quot;, Communist Party-sanctioned religious groups.

Yuezhi Zhao argues that a number of factors contributed to the souring of relations between Falun Gong and the Chinese state and media.&lt;ref name=&quot;zhao&quot; /&gt; These included infighting between China's qigong establishment and Falun Gong, speculation over blackmailing and lobbying by qigong opponents and &quot;scientists-cum-ideologues with political motives and affiliations with competing central Party leaders&quot;, which caused the shift in the state's position, and the struggles from mid-1996 to mid-1999 between Falun Gong and the Chinese power elite over the status and treatment of the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;zhao&quot; /&gt; According to Zhao, Falun Gong practitioners have established a &quot;resistance identity&quot;—one that stands against prevailing pursuits of wealth, power, scientific rationality, and &quot;the entire value system associated with China's project of modernization.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;zhao&quot;/&gt; In China the practice represented an indigenous spiritual and moral tradition, a cultural revitalization movement, and drew a sharp contrast to &quot;Marxism with Chinese characteristics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;twiss&quot;&gt;Twiss, Sumner B. &quot;Religious Intolerance in Contemporary China, Including the Curious Case of Falun Gong&quot; in ''The World's Religions After September 11.''

Vivienne Shue similarly writes that Falun Gong presented a comprehensive challenge to the Communist Party's legitimacy. Shue argues that Chinese rulers historically have derived their legitimacy from a claim to possess an exclusive connection to the &quot;Truth&quot;. In imperial China, truth was based on a Confucian and Daoist cosmology, where in the case of the Communist Party, the truth is represented by Marxist-Leninism and historical materialism. Falun Gong challenged the Marxist-Leninism paradigm, reviving an understanding based on more traditionally Buddhist or Daoist conceptions.&lt;ref name=Shue&gt;Vivienne Shue, &quot;Legitimacy Crisis in China?&quot; In Peter Hays Gries and Stanley Rosen (eds.), State and Society in 21st-century China. Crisis, Contention, and Legitimation, (New York: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; David Ownby contends that Falun Gong also challenged the Communist Party's hegemony over Chinese nationalist discourse: &quot;[Falun Gong's] evocation of a different vision of Chinese tradition and its contemporary value is now so threatening to the state and party because it denies them the sole right to define the meaning of Chinese nationalism, and perhaps of Chineseness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, &quot;China's War Against Itself&quot;. New York Times, 15 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Chang noted that since the overthrow of the Qin Dynasty, &quot;millenarian movements had exerted a profound impact on the course of Chinese history&quot;, cumulating in the Chinese Revolutions of 1949 which brought the Chinese Communists to power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;&gt;Chang, Maria Hsia (2004) ''Falun Gong: The End of Days'' (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press) ISBN 0-300-10227-5&lt;/ref&gt; Patsy Rahn (2002) describes a paradigm of conflict between Chinese sectarian groups and the rulers they often challenge. According to Rahn, the history of this paradigm goes back to the collapse of the Han dynasty: &quot;The pattern of ruling power keeping a watchful eye on sectarian groups, at times threatened by them, at times raising campaigns against them, began as early as the second century and continued throughout the dynastic period, through the Mao era and into the present.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rahn2002&quot;&gt;Rahn, Patsy (2002) &quot;The Chemistry of a Conflict: The Chinese Government and the Falun Gong&quot; in ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Winter, 2002, Vol 14, No. 4 (London: Frank Cass Publishers) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/tpv/2002/00000014/00000004/art00004]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion program===
[[File:FalunDafa Burn tanyongjie.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Falun Gong practitioner Tang Yongjie was allegedly tortured by prison guards, who applied hot rods to his legs, in an attempt to force him to recant his beliefs.]] 
According to James Tong, the regime aimed at both coercive dissolution of the Falun Gong denomination and &quot;transformation&quot; of the practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, &quot;Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999-2005,&quot; p 105.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the Party upped its campaign by sentencing &quot;recidivist&quot; practitioners to &quot;[[re-education through labor]]&quot;, in an effort to have them renounce their beliefs and &quot;transform&quot; their thoughts.&lt;ref name=Dangerous/&gt; Terms were also arbitrarily extended by police, while some practitioners had ambiguous charges levied against them, such as &quot;disrupting social order&quot;, &quot;endangering national security&quot;, or &quot;subverting the socialist system&quot;.&lt;ref name=bejesky&gt;Robert Bejesky, &quot;Falun Gong &amp; reeducation through labor&quot;, ''Columbia Journal of Asian Law'', 17:2, Spring 2004, pp. 147–189&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bejesky, the majority of long-term Falun Gong detainees are processed administratively through this system instead of the criminal justice system. Upon completion of their re-education sentences, those practitioners who refused to recant were then incarcerated in &quot;legal education centers&quot; set up by provincial authorities to &quot;transform minds&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bejesky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=CECC2009/&gt;

Much of the conversion program relied on Mao-style techniques of indoctrination and [[Thought reform in the People's Republic of China|thought reform]], where Falun Gong practitioners were organized to view anti-Falun Gong television programs and enroll in Marxism and materialism study sessions.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, &quot;Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999-2005,&quot; p 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Marxism and materialism were the core content of the sessions.&lt;ref&gt;James Tong, &quot;Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999-2005,&quot; p 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government-sponsored image of the conversion process emphasizes psychological persuasion and a variety of &quot;soft-sell&quot; techniques; this is the &quot;ideal norm&quot; in regime reports, according to Tong. Falun Gong reports, on the other hand, depict &quot;disturbing and sinister&quot; forms of coercion against practitioners who fail to renounce their beliefs.&lt;ref name=tong122-128&gt;James Tong, &quot;Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999-2005,&quot; pp 122-128.&lt;/ref&gt; 14,474 cases are classified by different methods of torture, according to Tong (Falun Gong agencies document over 63,000 individual cases of torture).&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://www.faluninfo.net/topic/3/ Persecution FAQ]. Retrieved 24 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are cases of severe beatings; psychological torment, corporal punishment and forced intense, heavy-burden hard labor and stress positions; solitary confinement in squalid conditions;&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt; &quot;heat treatment&quot; including burning and freezing; electric shocks delivered to sensitive parts of the body that may result in nausea, convulsions, or fainting;&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt; &quot;devastative&quot; forced feeding; sticking bamboo strips into fingernails; deprivation of food, sleep, and use of toilet;&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt; rape and gang rape; asphyxiation; and threat, extortion, and termination of employment and student status.&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt;

The cases appear verifiable, and the great majority identify (1) the individual practitioner, often with age, occupation, and residence; (2) the time and location that the alleged abuse took place, down to the level of the district, township, village, and often the specific jail institution; and (3) the names and ranks of the alleged perpetrators. Many such reports include lists of the names of witnesses and descriptions of injuries, Tong says.&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt; The publication of &quot;persistent abusive, often brutal behavior by named individuals with their official title, place, and time of torture&quot; suggests that there is no official will to cease and desist such activities.&lt;ref name=tong122-128/&gt;

===Deaths===
Due to the difficulty in corroborating reports of torture deaths in China, estimates on the number of Falun Gong adherents killed under persecution vary widely. In 2009, the New York Times reported that, according to human rights groups, the repressions had claimed &quot;at least 2,000&quot; lives.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jacobs. [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/world/asia/28china.html 'China Still Presses Crusade Against Falun Gong'], New York Times, 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Amnesty International reported that at least 100 Falun Gong practitioners were believed to have been killed in the 2008 calendar year, either in custody or shortly after their release.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/china/report-2008 'China - Amnesty International Report 2008'].&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong sources have reported approximately 3,400 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://faluninfo.net/topic/165/all/ Individual Cases of Falun Gong Deaths], access 1 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Ethan Gutmann of the [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]] produced a median estimated death toll of 65,000 based on a refugee testimony,&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Gutmann.

Chinese authorities do not publish statistics on Falun Gong adherents killed amidst the crackdown. In individual cases, however, authorities have denied that deaths in custody were due to torture.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Johnson, [http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6468 'Paper Chase'], Wall Street Journal, 2 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged organ harvesting===
{{See|Kilgour-Matas report}}
In March 2006 the Falun Gong-affiliated ''[[Epoch Times]]'' published a number of articles alleging that the China was conducting widespread and systematic organ harvesting of living Falun Gong practitioners.&lt;ref name=epoch1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-3-10/39111.html|title=Worse Than Any Nightmare—Journalist Quits China to Expose Concentration Camp Horrors and Bird Flu Coverup|date=10 March 2006|accessdate=31 October 2009|publisher=[[Epoch Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website alleged that practitioners detained in [[labour camp]]s, hospital basements, or prisons, were being blood- and urine-tested, their information stored on computer databases, and then matched with organ recipients.&lt;ref name=epochgeneral&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.epochtimes.com/211,111,,1.html|title=Organ Harvesting in China's Labor Camps|accessdate=13 June 2008|publisher=[[Epoch Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one month, third-party investigators including representatives of the US Department of State, said that there was insufficient evidence to support the allegation.&lt;ref name=lum&gt;Congressional Research Service report, http://www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL33437.pdf, page CRS-7, paragraph 3&lt;/ref&gt; Former Canadian Secretary of State David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas were asked by the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong to investigate the allegations. In July 2006, they published &quot;Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.david-kilgour.com/2006/Kilgour-Matas-organ-harvesting-rpt-July6-eng.pdf|title=Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China|date= 6 July 2006|coauthors=David Matas and David Kilgour|accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded that large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners were victims of systematic organ harvesting throughout China.&lt;ref name=news24&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1964180,00.html|title=China 'harvests live organs'|publisher=News24.com|accessdate=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethan Gutmann]], adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, approached the allegations by conducting extensive interviews around the world with a variety of former prisoners from Chinese labor camps and prisons, including Falun Gong practitioners and non-practitioners. He calculates that the number of practitioners killed for organs could be as high as 120,000, with a low estimate of 9,000, and 65,000 being the median. Estimates have been revised downwards from earlier numbers to reflect changing estimates of the overall [[Laogai System]] population by the Laogai Research Foundation.&lt;ref name=gutmann&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/824qbcjr.asp|title=China's Gruesome Organ Harvest.

===Media campaign===
[[File:Anti-Falun Gong poster.png|thumb|left|150px|A propaganda poster by Cheng Guoying (程国英), 1999. The poster reads &quot;''Firmly support the decision of the Central Committee to deal with the illegal organization of 'Falun Gong'''&quot;.]]
The Chinese government’s campaign against Falun Gong was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspapers, radio and internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leung&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tong2009/&gt;  
Within the first month of the crackdown, 300–400 articles attacking Falun Gong appeared in each of the main state-run papers, while primetime television replayed alleged exposés on the group, with no divergent views aired in the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemish&quot;&gt;Leeshai Lemish, Media and New Religious Movements: The Case of Falun Gong, A paper presented at The 2009 CESNUR Conference, Salt Lake City, Utah, 11–13 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The propaganda campaign focused on allegations that Falun Gong jeopardized social stability, was deceiving and dangerous, was &quot;anti-science&quot; and threatened progress, and argued that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was incompatible with a Marxist social ethic.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt;

[[File:Falun Gong science.png|thumb|right|150px|A propaganda poster by Cheng Guoying (程国英), 1999. The poster reads ''&quot;Uphold science, eradicate superstition&quot;''.]]

State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong's worldview was in &quot;complete opposition to science&quot; and communism.&lt;ref name=Lu2004&gt;Lu, Xing, ''Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: the impact on Chinese thought, culture, and communication,'' University of South Carolina Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''People's Daily'' asserted on 27 July 1999, that it &quot;was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism.&quot; A polarized depiction was created where the scientific worldview represented by Marxist-Leninism was legitimized as &quot;moral and truthful,&quot; while the Falun Gong discourse was &quot;evil and deceptive.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lu2004/&gt; In a society where virtue is defined by scientific progress, obedience, and unquestioning allegiance to the government, Falun Gong was juxtaposed with Marxist-Leninist thought, depicted as scientifically incorrect, superstitious without basis in reality, and the opposite of communism.

China scholars Daniel Wright and Joseph Fewsmith assert that for several months after Falun Gong was outlawed, China Central Television's evening news contained little but anti-Falun Gong rhetoric charging that it cheats its followers, separates families, damages health, and hurts social stability. The government operation was &quot;a study in all-out demonization&quot;, they write.&lt;ref&gt;Fewsmith, Joseph and Daniel B. Wright. &quot;The promise of the Revolution: stories of fulfilment and struggle in China&quot;, 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong was compared to &quot;a rat crossing the street that everyone shouts out to squash&quot; by ''Beijing Daily'';&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;'Enemies of people' warned&quot;, 23 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; other officials said it would be a &quot;long-term, complex and serious&quot; struggle to &quot;eradicate&quot; Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;Plafker, Ted. &quot;Falun Gong Stays Locked In Struggle With Beijing,&quot; The Washington Post, 26 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Party efforts, initial charges leveled against Falun Gong failed to elicit widespread popular support for the suppression of the group. In the months following July 1999, the rhetoric in the state-run press escalated to include charges that Falun Gong was colluding with foreign, &quot;anti-China&quot; forces. In October 1999, three months after the suppression began, the Supreme People's Court issued a judicial interpretation officially classifying Falun Gong as a ''xiejiao'', (heretical religion, sometimes rendered as &quot;evil cult&quot;) under Article 300 of the criminal code.&lt;ref name=chan2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=irons2003&gt;Irons, Edward. 2003 &quot;Falun Gong and the Sectarian Religion Paradigm&quot;.

David Ownby and [[Ian Denis Johnson|Ian Johnson]] have argued that the Chinese state gave the cultic appellation to Falun Gong by borrowing arguments from [[Margaret Singer]] and the West's anti-cult movement to blunt the appeal of Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=&quot;wildgrass&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture /&gt; According to John Powers and Meg Y. M. Lee, because the Falun Gong was categorized in the popular perception as an &quot;apolitical, qigong exercise club,&quot; it was not seen as a threat to the government. The most critical strategy in the Falun Gong suppression campaign, therefore, was to convince people to reclassify the Falun Gong into a number of &quot;negatively charged religious labels&quot;,&lt;ref name=powerslee&gt;Powers, John and Meg Y.

The group's non-violent and relatively silent protests were reclassified as creating &quot;social disturbances&quot;.

Anti-Falun Gong propaganda efforts have also permeated the Chinese education system. Following Jiang Zemin's 1999 ban of Falun Gong, then-Minister of Education Chen Zhili launched an active campaign to promote the Party's line on Falun Gong within all levels of academic institutions, including graduate schools, universities and colleges, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens. Her efforts included a &quot;Cultural Revolution-like pledge&quot; in Chinese schools that required faculty members, staff, and students to publicly denounce Falun Gong.

===Falun Gong's response to suppression===
[[Image:Ny-shengjiang-01.jpg|thumb|300px|Falun Gong protests at a Manhattan Parade, holding banners calling for Jiang Zemin to be &quot;brought to justice.&quot;]]
Falun Gong's response to the suppression in China began in July 1999 with appeals to local, provincial and central petitioning offices in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Rosenthal and Erik Eckholm, &quot;Vast Numbers of Sect Members Keep Pressure on Beijing&quot; New York Times, 28 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It soon progressed to larger demonstrations, with hundreds of Falun Gong adherents traveling daily to Tiananmen Square to perform Falun Gong exercises or raise banners in defense of the practice. These demonstrations were invariably broken up by security forces, and the practitioners involved were arrested—sometimes violently—and detained. By 25 April 2000, a total of more than 30,000 practitioners were arrested on the square&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6464 |title=Defiant Falun Dafa Members Converge on Tiananmen |first=Ian |last=Johnson |date=25 April 2000 |work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Pulitzer.org |page= A21}}&lt;/ref&gt;; seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the square on 1 January 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Elizabeth J. |last=Selden |coauthor=Perry, Mark |title=Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-30170-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public protests continued well into 2001. Writing for the ''Wall Street Journal'', Ian Johnson wrote that &quot;Falun Gong faithful have mustered what is arguably the most sustained challenge to authority in 50 years of Communist rule.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ian. &quot;A Deadly Exercise: Practicing Falun Gong was a right, Ms. Chen said, to her last day&quot;, Wall Street Journal, 20 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2001, demonstrations in Tiananmen Square had become less frequent, and the practice was driven deeper underground. As public protest fell out of favor, practitioners established underground &quot;material sites&quot; which would produce literature and DVDs to counter the portrayal of Falun Gong in the official media. Practitioners then distribute these materials, often door-to-door.&lt;ref&gt;Liao Yiwu. &quot;The Corpse Walker: Real Life Stories: China from the Bottom Up.&quot; p 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong sources estimated in 2009 that over 200,000 such sites exists across China today.&lt;ref&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, &quot;2010 Annual Report: Falun Gong Beliefs and Demography of Practitioners&quot;. 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The production, possession, or distribution of these materials is frequently grounds for security agents to incarcerate or sentence Falun Gong adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China, 2009 Annual Report, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt09/CECCannRpt2009.pdf CECC report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Falun Gong activists in China tapped into television broadcasts, replacing regular state-run programming with their own content. Among the more notable instances occurred in March 2002, when Falun Gong practitioners in Changchun intercepted eight cable television networks in Jilin Province, and for nearly an hour, televised a program titled &quot;Self-Immolation or a Staged Act?&quot;. All six of the Falun Gong practitioners involved were captured over the next few months. Two were killed immediately, the other four were all dead by 2010 as a result of injuries sustained while imprisoned.&lt;ref name=mediacontrol&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fog of Censorship: Media Control in China|year=2008|publisher=Human Rights in China|isbn=978-0-9717356-2-0|pages=xii|url=http://hrichina.org/sites/default/files/oldsite/PDFs/Reports/HRIC-Fog-of-Censorship.pdf|author=He Qinglian| authorlink=He Qinglian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ws-20101206&gt;{{cite news|last=Gutmann|first=Ethan|title=Into Thin Airwaves|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/thin-airwaves_519589.html?nopager=1|newspaper=The Weekly Standard|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside China, Falun Gong practitioners established international media organizations to gain wider exposure for their cause and challenge narratives of the Chinese state-run media. These include ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' newspaper, [[NTDTV|New Tang Dynasty Television]], and [[Sound of Hope]] radio station.&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; According to Zhao, through The Epoch Times it can be discerned how Falun Gong is building a &quot;de facto media alliance&quot; with China's democracy movements in exile, as demonstrated by its frequent printing of articles by prominent overseas Chinese critics of the PRC government.&lt;ref name=&quot;zhao&quot;/&gt; In 2004, the Epoch Times published a collection of nine editorials which presented a critical history of Communist Party rule.&lt;ref name=Ping/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steel, Kevin. 'Revolution number nine', ''The Western Standard'', 11 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This catalyzed the [[Tuidang movement]], which encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including ex post facto renunciations of the [[Communist Youth League of China|Communist Youth League]] and [[Young Pioneers of China|Young Pioneers]]. The Epoch Times claims that tens of millions have renounced the Communist Party as part of the movement, though these numbers have not been independently verified.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Ethan.

==Falun Gong outside China==
{{Main|Falun Gong outside mainland China}}
[[File:Falun Dafa the second exercise, standing meditation.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Falun Gong adherents outside China hold events such as this group exercise in Los Angeles.]]
Falun Gong was first taught at the Chinese consulate in New York in 1995 as part of the Party's &quot;cultural propaganda to the West,&quot; alongside Chinese silk craft and cooking.&lt;ref name=&quot;rn&quot;/&gt; The consulate at that time also set up Falun Gong clubs at MIT and Columbia University which are active to this day. Starting in 1995, Li himself taught the practice outside of China, chairing a series of conferences in Sweden and at the Chinese embassy in Paris, upon invitation by the PRC ambassador to France.&lt;ref name=rn/&gt; Li taught in Australia and North America in August and October 1996, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ownbyfuture&quot;/&gt;

The practice's growth outside China largely corresponded to the migration of students from Mainland China to the West in the early- to mid-1990s, and in North America and Europe, the practice was taught mainly on university campuses. It is organized by regional Falun Dafa Associations and contact persons who volunteer to teach the practice.&lt;ref name=porterthesis/&gt;

Falun Gong volunteer instructors and Falun Dafa Associations are currently found in over 70 countries outside China, with the most active communities in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Falundafa.org, [http://en.falundafa.org/falun-dafa-global-contacts.html “Find your local contacts]. Retrieved 10-22-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Falun Gong adherents overseas have responded to the suppression in China through regular demonstrations, parades, and through the creation of media outlets, performing arts companies, and censorship-circumvention software mainly intended to reach Mainland Chinese audiences.

==International reception==
Since 1999, numerous Western governments and human rights organizations have expressed condemnation for the Chinese government’s suppression of Falun Gong. &lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China,'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, members of the United States Congress have made public pronouncements and introduced several resolutions in support of Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/67820.pdf | title = CRS Report for Congress: China and Falun Gong | publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] | author=Thomas Lum | date=25 May 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 605 called for &quot;an immediate end to the campaign to persecute, intimidate, imprison, and torture Falun Gong practitioners,&quot; condemned the Chinese authorities' efforts to distribute &quot;false propaganda&quot; about the practice worldwide, and expressed sympathy to persecuted Falun Gong practitioners and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hres605eh/pdf/BILLS-111hres605eh.pdf United States House Resolution 605], United States Government Printing Office, 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einhorn, Bruce, (17 March 2010). &quot;[http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/eyeonasia/archives/2010/03/congress_challe.html Congress Challenges China on Falun Gong &amp; Yuan], ''Business Week''&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1999–2001, Western media reports on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemish&quot;/&gt; By the latter half of 2001, however, the volume of media reports declined precipitously, and by 2002, major news organizations like the ''New York Times'' and ''Washington Post'' had almost completely ceased their coverage of Falun Gong from China.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemish&quot;/&gt; In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or human rights groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemish&quot;/&gt; Adam Frank writes that in reporting on the Falun Gong, the Western tradition of casting the Chinese as &quot;exotic&quot; took dominance, and that while the facts were generally correct in Western media coverage, “the normalcy that millions of Chinese practitioners associated with the practice had all but disappeared.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frank 2004, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; David Ownby noted that alongside these tactics, the &quot;cult&quot; label applied to Falun Gong by the Chinese authorities never entirely went away in the minds of some Westerners, and the stigma still plays a role in wary public perceptions of Falun Gong.&lt;ref&gt;Ownby (2000), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the support of Falun Gong in the West, the Chinese government expanded their efforts against the group internationally. This included visits to newspaper officers by diplomats to &quot;extol the virtues of Communist China and the evils of Falun Gong&quot;,&lt;ref name=jte&gt;Turley-Ewart, John, “[http://network.nationalpost.com/NP/blogs/fullcomment/pages/falun-gong-persecution-spreads-to-canada-ottawa-does-little.aspx#ixzz16dg80Lad Falun Gong persecution spreads to Canada: Ottawa does little]”, National Post, 20 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; linking support for Falun Gong with &quot;jeopardizing trade relations,&quot; and sending letters to local politicians telling them to withdraw support for the practice.&lt;ref name=jte/&gt; According to [[Perry Link]], pressure on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong could result in a denial of visa for fieldwork in China; or exclusion and discrimination from business and community groups who have connections with China and fear angering the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=jte/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry Link, ''[http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2599.html The Anaconda in the Chandelier: Chinese censorship today], 27 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ethan Gutmann, a journalist reporting on China since the early 1990s, has attempted to explain the apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, &quot;Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum&quot;, Gutmann writes. Moreover, practitioners' attempts at getting their message across carried some of the uncouthness of Communist party culture, including a perception that practitioners tended to exaggerate, create &quot;torture tableaux straight out of a Cultural Revolution opera&quot;, or &quot;spout slogans rather than facts&quot;. This is coupled with a general doubtfulness in the West of persecuted refugees.&lt;ref name=gutmann/&gt; Gutmann also notes that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC governments vehement attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.&lt;ref name=gutmann_carrytorch&gt;Gutmann, Ethan. &quot;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/print/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/986himak.asp Carrying a Torch for China]&quot;, ''Weekly Standard'', 21 April 2008, Vol. 13, No. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Madsen observes that Falun Gong also lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom: liberals are wary of Falun Gong's conservative sexual morality, while Christian conservatives don't accord the practice the same space as persecuted Christians.&lt;ref name=Madsen247&gt;Richard Madsen, “Understanding Falun Gong,” p 247.&lt;/ref&gt; He charges that the American political center does not want to push the human rights issue so hard that it would disrupt commercial and political engagement with China. Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources in responding to suppression.&lt;ref name=Madsen247/&gt;

==Controversies==
Among the most persistent controversies surrounding Falun Gong is its characterization by the PRC government as &quot;xiejiao&quot;—a &quot;heterodox organization&quot;, &quot;evil religion&quot;, or &quot;evil cult&quot;. The state-run Chinese Buddhist Association, concerned with Buddhist apostates taking up Falun Gong practice, were the first to term Falun Gong ''xiejiao'' in the latter half of 1996. A direct translation of that term is &quot;heretical teaching&quot;,&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; but during the anti-Falun Gong propaganda campaign was rendered as &quot;evil cult&quot; in English. Western media initially adopted this language after the PRC government's media reports,&lt;ref name=frank2004/&gt; but soon began using less loaded terms.&lt;ref name=kipnis2001&gt;Kipnis, Andrew B. 2001, The Flourishing of Religion in Post-Mao China and the Anthropological Category of Religion, The Australian Journal of Anthropology, 12:1, 32–46 Anthropology, Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chang, in the context of imperial China, the term &quot;xiejiao&quot; was used to refer to non-Confucian religions, though in the context of Communist China, it has been used to target religious organizations which do not submit to the authority of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Hsia Chang, &quot;Falun Gong:The End of Days,&quot; (Yale University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freedom House, [http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/Analysis_of_China_Docs_1_to_7.pdf &quot;Report Analyzing Seven Secret Chinese Government Documents&quot;], 11 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government's view that Falun Gong is a destructive cult, widely used as part of state propaganda against the practice, was later picked up by some elements of the anti-cult movement in the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Times&quot;&gt;http://www.rickross.com/reference/fa_lun_gong/falun169.html Engardio, Joel. Spiritual Cultivation. New Times, 23 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle&quot;&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/18/MNGGAG8MO31.DTL Hua, Vanessa. Critics and followers of Falun Gong. San Francisco Chronicle, 18 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, such views are largely criticized or dismissed in mainstream Western scholarship of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Substantiation may be found in: Ownby 2008, p. vii and elsewhere; Madsen 2000; Chan 2004; Richardson &amp; Edelman 2004; Hill et al 2001, pp. 34–35, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions differ on whether or not Li Hongzhi made money from the practice, and if so, how much. [[Dai Qing]] states that by 1997, Li was receiving annual income in excess of ¥10 million through sales of his books, noting that Falun Gong practitioners purchased numerous copies of Li's works, pictures, and made voluntary donations.&lt;ref&gt;Dai Qing: Members of Falungong in an Autocratic Society. Asia Quarterly, Volume IV, No.3, Summer 2000 http://asiaquarterly.com/2006/01/28/ii-45/&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Johnson disputes the theory that Li made any serious money from Falun Gong, and noted that during the period of Falun Gong's greatest book sales in China, Li did not receive royalties because all publications were bootleg—the texts having been banned by the authorities in 1996 in an attempt to curb the practice's growth.&lt;ref name=wildgrass&gt;Ian Johnson, ''Wild Grass: three stories of change in modern China,'' (New York, NY: Pantheon Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Danny Schechter]] noted that from 1992–1994, while Li did charge fees for the lectures seminars he was giving across China at the invitation of local qigong societies, his fees were considerably lower than those of competing qigong practices, and the local qigong associations received a substantial share.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt; Li justified the fees as being necessary to cover travel costs and other expenses, and on some occasions, he donated the money earned to charitable causes. In 1994, Li ceased charging fees altogether, thereafter stipulating that Falun Gong must always be taught for free.&lt;ref&gt;David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China],'' p 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice's teachings are available for free download online.

Li Hongzhi's conservative moral teachings have attracted some concern in the West, including his views on homosexuality. During a lecture in Australia, for instance, Li Hongzhi said, &quot;Things such as organized crime, homosexuality, and promiscuous sex, etc., none are the standards of being human.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sydney&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/lectures/1996L.html |title=Lecture in Sydney |author=Li Hongzhi |work=falundafa.org |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of Li's teachings on homosexuality as immoral, a nomination of Li for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by San Francisco legislators was withdrawn in 2001.&lt;ref name=tolerance&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/falungong1.htm |title=INTRODUCTION TO FALUN GONG &amp; FALUN DAFA Its terminology, symbol, texts, beliefs, web sites, &amp; books |author=Ontaria Consultants on Religious Tolerance |publisher=religioustolerance.org |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercury News&quot;&gt;Lubman, Sarah [ &quot;A Chinese Battle on U.S. Soil&quot; in San Jose Mercury News (23 December 2001)] retrieved 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Falun Dafa Information Center states that the group welcomes gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to the practice, that they are not accorded special treatment, and that while Falun Gong teaches that certain practices &quot;generate more karma&quot;, this does not equate to a position statement, social stance, or regulation.&lt;ref name=Intolerant&gt;Falun Dafa Information Center, [http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23 &quot;Misconceptions: &quot;Intolerant&quot;?&quot;], 16 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the portrayal of Falun Gong as &quot;anti-gay&quot;, Ethan Gutmann notes that Falun Gong's teachings are &quot;essentially indistinguishable&quot; from traditional religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Gutmann, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/roundtables/2010/20100618/gutmannTestimony.pdf?PHPSESSID=aa5231395d2a01528efab4f9dda13220 &quot;China's Policies Toward Spiritual Movements&quot;], Congressional-Executive Commission on China Roundtable discussion, 18 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some journalists have also expressed concern over Falun Gong's belief in different heavens for people of different races, and the implications of these teachings as they related to interracial marriages.&lt;ref name=nyt20000430&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/30/weekinreview/the-world-rooting-out-falun-gong-china-makes-war-on-mysticism.html?pagewanted=all |title=Rooting Out Falun Gong; China Makes War on Mysticism |first=Craig S. |last=Smith |work=New York Times |date=30 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/chinas-enemy-within-the-story-of-falun-gong-475128.html |title=China's enemy within: The story of Falun Gong - Asia, World - The Independent |author=Paul Vallely and Clifford Coonan |work=[[The Independent]] |date=22 April 2006 |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media|INM]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0951-9467 |oclc=185201487 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Johnson, [http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6463 A Deadly Exercise], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 20 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Concern stems from a statement of Li's identifying such children as products of &quot;a chaotic situation brought about by mankind&quot; indicative of &quot;[[Mappō|the Dharma-ending period]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sydney&quot; /&gt; The Falun Dafa Information Center responded that this aspect of the practice's cosmology &quot;in no way amounts to an endorsement of racial purity&quot;, adding that many Falun Gong practitioners have interracial children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faluninfo.net/article/654/?cid=23 |title=FalunInfo.net - Misconceptions: 'Intolerant'? |work=faluninfo.net |year=2011 [last update] |quote=practice |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions among scholars differ as to whether Falun Gong contains an apocalyptic message, and if so what the consequences of that are. Li situates his teaching of Falun Gong amidst the &quot;Dharma-ending period&quot; (''Mo Fa'', 末法), described in Buddhist scriptures as an era of moral decline when the teachings of Buddhism would need to be rectified.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ownbyfuture/&gt; The current era is described in Falun Gong teachings as the &quot;Fa rectification&quot; period (''zhengfa'', which might also be translated as &quot;to correct the dharma&quot;), a time of cosmic transition and renewal.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt; The process of Fa rectification is necessitated by the moral decline and degeneration of life in the universe, and in the post-1999 context, the persecution of Falun Gong by the Chinese government has come to be viewed as a tangible symptom of this moral decay.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; Through the process of the Fa rectification, life will be reordered according to the moral and spiritual quality of each, with good people being saved and ascending to higher spiritual planes, and bad ones being eliminated or cast down.&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt; In this paradigm, Li assumes a messianic role of offering salvation through his moral teachings.&lt;ref name=Pennyreligion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

Some scholars, such as Maria Hsia Chang and Susan Palmer, have described Li's rhetoric about the &quot;Fa rectification&quot; and providing salvation &quot;in the final period of the Last Havoc&quot;, as apocalyptic.&lt;ref name=fieldnotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang&quot;/&gt; However, Benjamin Penny argues that Li's teachings are better understood in the context of a &quot;Buddhist notion of the cycle of the Dharma or the Buddhist law&quot;.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;Chris Bullock, ''Falun Gong: Cult or Culture?'', National Radio, [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/falun-gong-cult-or-culture/3481242]. Retrieved 21 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gunde notes that unlike apocalyptic groups in the West, Falun Gong does not fixate on death or the end of the world, and instead &quot;has a simple, innocuous ethical message&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gunde/&gt; Li Hongzhi does not discuss a &quot;time of reckoning&quot;,&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; and has rejected predictions of an impending apocalypse in his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Schechter, “Falun Gong’s Challenge to China, p 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he expressed concern over Li's totalizing discourse and millennial themes, Craig Burgdoff writes that such concerns are tempered by the fact that Falun Gong practice does not require unquestioning acceptance of all of Li's teachings, and there is no overt emphasis on dogmatically enforcing orthodoxy, Instead, Burgdoff writes that he found &quot;practitioners to be engaged seriously in a highly disciplined spiritual and ethical practice.&quot;&lt;ref name=burgdoff/&gt;
