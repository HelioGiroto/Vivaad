The '''Western world''', also known as '''the West''' and the '''Occident''' (from [[Latin]]: ''occidens'' &quot;sunset, West&quot;; as contrasted with the [[Orient]]), is a term referring to different nations depending on the context. There is no agreed upon definition about what all these nations have in common&lt;ref name=&quot;Western Civilization&quot;&gt;[http://www.mmisi.org/ir/39_01_2/kurth.pdf Western Civilization], Our Tradition; James Kurth; accessed 30 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; apart from having a significant population of European descent and being heavily influenced by Europe.

The concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in [[Greco-Roman civilization]] in Europe, with the advent of [[Christianity]]. In the modern era, the Western culture has been heavily influenced by the traditions of [[Renaissance]], [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Age of Enlightenment]], and shaped by the expansive [[colonialism]] of the 15th-20th centuries. Its political usage was temporarily changed by an internal antagonism during the [[Cold War]] in the mid-to-late 20th Century (1947–1991). 

The term originally had a literal geographic meaning, contrasting [[Europe]] with the linked cultures of civilizations of the Middle East, North Africa, Near East, South Asia, South East Asia and remote Far East, which used to be [[East–West dichotomy|seen as the East]] by early-modern Europeans, but today this has little geographic relevance.

In the contemporary cultural meaning, the Western world includes Europe, as well as many countries of European colonial origin with majority European populations in [[the Americas]] and Oceania, such as the [[United States of America]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Argentina]] etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = | coauthors = Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson|location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brasembottawa1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |title=Embassy of Brazil - Ottawa |publisher=Brasembottawa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Falcoff |first=Mark |url=http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |title=Chile Moves On |publisher=AEI |date= |accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmisi.org/ir/39_01_2/kurth.pdf Western Civilization], Our Tradition; James Kurth; accessed 30 Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[Western culture]] originated in the [[Mediterranean]] basin and its vicinity; [[Greece]] and Rome are often cited as its originators. Over time, their associated [[empire]]s grew first to the east and west to include the rest of the [[Mediterranean]]an and [[Black Sea]] coastal areas, conquering, absorbing, and being influenced by many older great civilizations of the [[ancient Near East]] (i.e. Phoenicia, Phoenician rooted Carthage and also Egypt); later, they expanded to the north of the Mediterranean Sea to include Western, [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Southeastern Europe|Southeastern]], Eastern and [[Northern Europe]]. [[Christianization of Bulgaria]] (9th century), [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus; 10th century), [[Christianisation of Scandinavia]] (12th century) and [[Christianization of Lithuania]] (14th century) brought the rest of European states to the Western civilisation. 

Historians, such as Carroll Quigley (''Evolution of Civilizations''), contend that Western civilization was born around 400 AD, after the total collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], leaving a vacuum for new ideas to flourish that were impossible in Classical societies. In either view, between the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall]] of the Western Roman Empire and the Renaissance, the West experienced a period of considerable decline,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe Middle Ages] &lt;blockquote&gt;Of the three great civilizations of Western Eurasia and North Africa, that of Christian Europe began as the least developed in virtually all aspects of material and intellectual culture, well behind the Islamic states and Byzantium. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Middle Ages]], which include the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] and the [[Crusades]].
[[Image:Sanzio 01.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[The School of Athens]]'' depicts a gathering of the most prominent thinkers of classical antiquity. Fresco by [[Raphael]], 1510–1511]]
The knowledge of the ancient Western world was partly preserved during this period due to the survival of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the institutions of the [[Catholic Church]]; it was also greatly expanded by the [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|Arab importation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[H. G. Wells]], ''[[The Outline of History]]'', [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/Wells-Outline/Text/Part-II.htm Section 31.8, The Intellectual Life of Arab Islam] &lt;blockquote&gt; For some generations before Muhammad, the Arab mind had been, as it were, smouldering, it had been producing poetry and much religious discussion; under the stimulus of the national and racial successes it presently blazed out with a brilliance second only to that of the Greeks during their best period. From a new angle and with a fresh vigour it took up that systematic development of positive knowledge, which the Greeks had begun and relinquished. It revived the human pursuit of science. If the Greek was the father, then the Arab was the foster-father of the scientific method of dealing with reality, that is to say, by absolute frankness, the utmost simplicity of statement and explanation, exact record, and exhaustive criticism. Through the Arabs it was and not by the Latin route that the modern world received that gift of light and power. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=Bernard | authorlink=Bernard Lewis | year=2002 | title=What Went Wrong | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=0-06-51605-4 | page=3 }}&lt;blockquote&gt; For many centuries the Porld of Islam was in the forefront of human civilization and achievement….

Numerous times, this expansion was accompanied by [[Christian]] [[missionaries]], who attempted to proselytize Christianity.

Generally speaking, the current consensus would locate the West, at the very least, in the cultures and peoples of Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and a great part of Central and South America like Argentina and Brazil. There is debate among some as to whether [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (CEE) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europesworld.org/NewEnglish/Home_old/Article/tabid/191/ArticleType/articleview/ArticleID/21480/language/en-US/Default.aspx  BUDAPEST - Ghost of second-class status haunts central and eastern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z. Lerman, C. Csaki, and G. Feder, ''Agriculture in Transition: Land Policies and Evolving Farm Structures in Post-Soviet Countries'', Lexington Books, Lanham, MD (2004), see, e.g., Table 1.1, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Swinnen, ed., ''Political Economy of Agrarian Reform in Central and Eastern Europe'', Ashgate, Aldershot (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; is in a category of its own. An argument supporting Central and Eastern Europe being a part of the West is that Central European, Southeastern European and Baltic countries such as [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] are now part of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], which mostly comprise Western countries. These countries were both heavily influenced by and influenced the Western World, and share sociological values and culture. Greece and [[Cyprus]] are geographically not located in western Europe, are usually considered a part of the Western world. This is because Western culture has Greek roots and partly due to political and economic reasons. Russia is often not counted as a part of the Western World. However, Russian culture (particularly literature, music and painting) is classified as a part of the Western culture.

==Western culture==
{{Main|Western culture|Western literature|Western art history|Classical music}}
{{Further|History of Western civilization}}
{{histphil}}

The term &quot;Western culture&quot; is used very broadly to refer to a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] of [[social norms]], [[ethics|ethical values]], [[tradition|traditional customs]], [[religion|religious]] beliefs, [[political system]]s, and specific [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] and [[technology|technologies]].

Specifically, Western culture may imply:
:*a [[Bible|Biblical]] Christian cultural influence in spiritual thinking, customs and either ethic or moral traditions, around the [[Post-Classical Era]] and after.
:*European cultural influences concerning artistic, musical, folkloric, ethic and oral traditions, whose themes have been further developed by [[Romanticism]].
:*a [[Graeco-Roman]] [[Classics|Classical]] and Renaissance cultural influence, concerning artistic, philosophic, literary, and [[Western law|legal]] themes and traditions, the cultural social effects of [[migration period]] and the heritages of [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and other ethnic groups, as well as a tradition of [[rationalism]] in various spheres of life, developed by [[Hellenistic philosophy]], [[Scholasticism]], [[Humanism]]s, the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment.

The concept of Western culture is generally linked to the classical definition of the Western world. In this definition, Western culture is the set of literary, scientific, political, artistic and philosophical principles that set it apart from other civilizations. Much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Duran 1995, p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has come to apply to countries whose history is strongly marked by European immigration or settlement, such as the Americas, and [[Australasia]], and is not restricted to Europe.

Some tendencies that define modern Western [[societies]] are the existence of [[political pluralism]], [[laicism]], generalization of [[middle class]], prominent [[subcultures]] or [[counterculture]]s (such as [[New Age]] movements), increasing cultural [[syncretism]] resulting from [[globalization]] and [[human migration]]. The modern shape of these societies is strongly based upon the Industrial Revolution and the societies' associated social and environmental problems, such as [[class struggle]] and [[pollution]], as well as reactions to them, such as [[syndicalism]] and [[environmentalism]].

==Historical divisions==
The geopolitical divisions in Europe that created a concept of ''East'' and ''West'' originated in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A history of eastern Europe: crisis and change | author=Bideleux,Robert; Jeffries, Ian | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-16112-1 | page=48 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U39AYJm1L94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] was home to the highly urbanized cultures that had Greek as their common language (owing to the older empire of [[Alexander the Great]] and of the [[Diadochi|Hellenistic successors]].), whereas the West was much more rural in its character and more readily adopted Latin as its common language. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Western and Central Europe was substantially cut off from the East where ''[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]'' Greek culture and [[Eastern Christianity]] became founding influences in the [[Arab people|Arab]]/[[Muslim history|Muslim]] world and among the Eastern and Southern Slavic peoples. [[Roman Catholic]] Western and Central Europe, as such, maintained a distinct identity particularly as it began to redevelop during the Renaissance. Even following the Protestant Reformation, Protestant Europe continued to see itself as more tied to Roman Catholic Europe than other parts of the perceived ''civilized'' world.

Use of the term ''West'' as a specific cultural and geopolitical term developed over the course of the [[Age of Exploration]] as Europe spread its culture to other parts of the world. In the past two centuries the term ''Western world'' has sometimes been used synonymously with ''Christian world'' because of the numerical dominance of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism compared to other Christian traditions, ancient Roman ideas, and [[heresy|heresies]]. As secularism rose in Europe and elsewhere during the 19th and 20th centuries, the term ''West'' came to take on less religious connotations and more political connotations, especially during the Cold War. Additionally, closer contacts between the ''West'' and Asia and other parts of the world in recent times have continued to cloud the use and meaning of the term.

===Hellenic===

[[File:Location greek ancient.png|thumb|left|180px|The [[Greek colonies|Ancient Greek world]], c. 550 BC|right]]
The [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] division between the barbarians and the [[Greek people|Greeks]] contrasted in many societies the [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] culture of the Greek settlements around the Mediterranean to the surrounding non-Greek cultures. [[Herodotus]] considered the [[Persian Wars]] of the early 5th century BC a conflict of Europa versus Asia{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} (which he considered to be all land north and east of the [[Sea of Marmara]], respectively){{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. The terms &quot;West&quot; and &quot;East&quot; were not used by any Greek author to describe that conflict. The anachronistic application of those terms to that division entails a stark logical contradiction, given that, when the term &quot;West&quot; appeared, it was used in opposition to the Greeks and Greek-speaking culture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Western society traces its cultural origins, at least partially, to [[Greek philosophy|Greek thought]] and Christian religion, thus following an evolution that began in ancient Greece and the [[Levant]], continued through the Roman Empire, and spread throughout Europe. The inherently &quot;Greek&quot; classical ideas of history (which one might easily say they invented) and art may, however, be considered almost inviolate in the West, as their original spread of influence survived the Hellenic period of Roman classical antiquity, The Dark Ages, its resurgence during the Western Renaissance, and has managed somehow to keep and exert its pervasive influence down into the present age, with every expectation {{By whom|date=January 2010}} of it continuing to dominate any secular Western cultural developments.

[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|right|float|250px|The major [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] realms; the ''[[Ptolemaic kingdom]]'' (dark blue); the ''[[Seleucid empire]]'' (yellow); ''Macedon'' (green) and ''Epirus'' (pink).]]

However, the conquest of the Western parts of the Roman Empire by Germanic peoples and the subsequent dominance by the Western Christian [[Papacy]] (which held combined political and spiritual authority, a [[state of affairs]] absent from Greek civilization in all its stages), resulted in a rupture of the previously existing ties between the Latin West and Greek thought,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Freeman (history writer)|Charles Freeman]]. The Closing of the Western Mind. Knopf, 2003. ISBN 1-4000-4085-X&lt;/ref&gt; including Christian Greek thought. The [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] and the [[Fourth Crusade]] confirmed this deviation.

On the other hand, the Modern West, emerging after the Renaissance as a new civilization, has been greatly influenced by (its own interpretation of) Greek thought, which was preserved in the Roman Empire and the medieval Islamic world during the Medieval West's Dark Ages and transmitted from there by [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|emigration of Greek scholars]], [[Theophanu|courtly marriages]], and [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations]]. The Renaissance in the West emerged partly from currents within the Roman (Byzantine) Empire.

===Roman Empire===
[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|200px|The Roman Empire under [[Trajan]] in 117 AD.]]
[[Ancient Rome]] (510 BC-AD 476) was a civilization that grew from a [[city-state]] founded on the [[Italian Peninsula]] about the 9th century BC to a massive empire straddling the Mediterranean Sea. In its 12-century existence, Roman civilization shifted from a [[monarchy]], to a [[Roman Republic|republic]], to an [[autocracy|autocratic]] empire. It came to dominate Western, Central and Southeastern Europe and the entire area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea through conquest using the [[Roman legions]] and then through [[cultural assimilation]] by giving Roman privileges and eventually citizenship to the whole empire. Nonetheless, despite its great legacy, a number of factors led to the eventual decline of the Roman Empire.

The Western Roman Empire eventually broke into several kingdoms in the 5th century due to civil wars, corruption, and devastating Germanic invasions from such tribes as the [[Goths]], the [[Franks]] and the [[Vandals]].
[[File:Plato Seneca Aristotle medieval.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Plato]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Aristotle]] in a medieval manuscript illustration.]]
The Eastern Roman Empire, governed from [[Constantinople]], is usually referred to as the Byzantine Empire after 476, the traditional date for the &quot;fall of the Western Roman Empire&quot; and for the subsequent onset of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The Eastern Roman Empire survived the fall of the West, and protected Roman legal and cultural traditions, combining them with Greek and Christian elements, for another thousand years.

The Roman Empire succeeded the about 500 year-old Roman Republic (510 BC - 1st century BC), which had been weakened by the conflict between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Sulla]] and the civil war of [[Julius Caesar]] against [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Brutus]].  During these struggles hundreds of senators were killed, and the [[Roman Senate]] had been refilled with loyalists of the [[First Triumvirate]] and later those of the [[Second Triumvirate]].

Several dates are commonly proposed to mark the transition from Republic to Empire, including the date of Julius Caesar's appointment as perpetual [[roman dictator]] (44 BC), the victory of Caesar's heir [[Augustus|Octavian]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] (September 2, 31 BC), and the Roman Senate's granting to Octavian the [[honorific]] ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''. (January 16, 27 BC). Octavian/Augustus officially proclaimed that he had saved the Roman Republic and carefully disguised his power under republican forms: [[Consul]]s continued to be elected, [[tribune]]s of the plebeians continued to offer legislation, and senators still debated in the [[curia|Roman Curia]]. However, it was Octavian who influenced everything and controlled the final decisions, and in final analysis, had the legions to back him up, if it became necessary.

Roman expansion began long before the state was changed into an empire and reached its zenith under emperor Trajan with the conquest of [[Dacia]] in AD 106. During this territorial peak, the Roman Empire controlled about 5&amp;nbsp;900&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;km² (2,300,000 sq.mi.) of land surface and had a population of 100 million. From the time of Caesar to the Fall of the Western Empire, Rome dominated [[History of Eurasia|Western Eurasia]] and the [[Mediterranean]], comprising the majority of its population. Ancient Rome has contributed greatly to the development of law, war, art, literature, architecture, technology and language in the Western world, and its [[History of Rome|history]] continues to have a major influence on the world today.

The Roman Empire is where the idea of the &quot;West&quot; began to emerge. Due to Rome's central location at the heart of the Empire, &quot;West&quot; and &quot;East&quot; were terms used to denote provinces West and east of the capital itself. Therefore, [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] (Portugal and Spain), [[Gaul]] (France), [[Africa]] (Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco) and [[Britannia]] were all part of the &quot;West&quot;, while Greece, Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt were part of the &quot;East.&quot; Italy itself was considered central, until the reforms of [[Diocletian]], when the idea of formally dividing the Empire into true two halves: Eastern and Western.

In 395, the Roman Empire formally split into a Western Roman Empire and an Eastern one, each with their own emperors, capitals, and governments, although ostensibly they still belonged to one formal Empire. The dissolution of the Western half (nominally in 476, but in truth a long process that ended by 500) left only the Eastern Roman Empire alive. For centuries, the East continued to call themselves Eastern Romans, while the West began to think in terms of Latins (those living in the old Western Empire) and Greeks (those inside the Roman remnant to the east).

===Christian schism===
{{Main|East–West Schism}}

In the early 4th century, the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] established the city of Constantinople as the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire included lands east of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and bordering on the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and parts of the [[Black Sea]]. These two divisions of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires were reflected in the administration of the Christian Church, with Rome and Constantinople debating and arguing over whether either city was the capital of Christianity.

As the Eastern (orthodox) and Western (firstly Catholic, then Protestant as well) churches spread their influence, the line between Eastern and Western Christianity was moving towards one another until it was fully set at the time of Lithuanian Christianisation. The border of Western/Eastern Christianity was moving and its movement was defined by the existence of the Byzantine empire and the fluctuating power and influence of the church in Rome. Now its border is East of Estonian border, via the very West of Ukraine until Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, not to mention enclaves in many countries such as Romania, Northern Albania etc. From Middle Ages until late 20th century religion was decreasingly important in Europe therefore the religious division followed a [[cultural divide]] and vice versa.

Huntington argued that this cultural division still existed during the Cold War as the approximate Western boundary of those countries that were allied with the [[Soviet Union]]. Others have fiercely criticized these views arguing they confuse the Eastern Roman Empire with Russia, especially considering the fact that the country that had the most historical roots in Byzantium, Greece, expelled communists and was allied with the West during the Cold War. Still, Russia accepted Eastern Christianity from the Byzantine Empire (by the Patriarch of Constantinople: Photios I) linking Russia very close to the Eastern Roman Empire world. Later on, in 16th century Russia created own religious centre in Moscow. Religion survived in Russia beside severe persecution carrying values alternative to the communist ideology.

[[File:Religion distribution.png|thumb|left|300px|Worldwide distribution of Christianity and other religions]]
Under [[Charlemagne]], the Franks established an empire that was recognized as the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by the Pope in Rome, offending the Roman Emperor in Constantinople. The crowning of the Emperor by the [[history of the Papacy|Pope]] led to the assumption that the highest power was the papal hierarchy, establishing, until the Protestant Reformation, the civilization of [[Christendom|West Christendom]].  The [[Latin Rite]] Christian Church of western and central Europe headed by the [[Pope]] split with the eastern, Greek-speaking Patriarchates during the Great Schism. Meanwhile, the extent of each expanded, as British Isles, Germanic peoples, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, Scandinavia, Baltic peoples and the other non-Christian lands of the northwest were converted by the West Church, while Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Belarus, Serbia, Caucasus and most of Ukraine were converted by the [[Eastern Church]].

In this context, the Protestant reformation may be viewed as a schism within the Latin Church. [[Martin Luther]], in the wake of precursors, broke with the pope and with the emperor, backed by many of the German princes. These changes were adopted by the Scandinavian kings. Later, the commoner Jean Cauvin (John Calvin) assumed the religio-political leadership in Geneva, a former ecclesiastical city whose prior ruler had been the bishop. The English King later improvised on the Lutheran model, but subsequently many Calvinist doctrines were adopted by popular dissenters, leading to the [[English Civil War]].

Both royalists and dissenters colonized North America, eventually resulting in an independent United States of America.

===Colonial &quot;West&quot;===

The Reformation, and consequent dissolution of West Christendom as even a theoretical unitary political body, resulted in the [[Thirty Years War]]. The war ended in the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which enshrined the concept of the [[nation-state]] and the principle of absolute [[national sovereignty]] in [[international law]].

These concepts of a world of nation-states, coupled with the ideologies of the Enlightenment, the coming of [[modernity]], the Scientific Revolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/lect/mod07.html |title=Modern West Civ. 7: The Scientific Revolution of the 17 Cent |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Industrial Revolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc2/lectures/industrialrev.html |title=The Industrial Revolution |publisher=Mars.wnec.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced powerful political and economic institutions that have come to influence (or been imposed upon) most nations of the world today. Historians agree that the Industrial Revolution was one of the most important events in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living: The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics], Library of Economics and Liberty&lt;/ref&gt;

This process of influence (and imposition) began with the voyages of discovery, colonization, conquest, and exploitation of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]; it continued with the rise of the [[Dutch East India Company]], and the creation and expansion of the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial empires. Due to the reach of these empires, Western institutions expanded throughout the world. Even after demands for self-determination from subject peoples within Western empires were met with decolonization, these institutions persisted. One specific example was the requirement that post-colonial societies were made to form nation-states (in the Western tradition), which often created arbitrary boundaries and borders that did not necessarily represent a whole nation, people, or culture, and are often the cause of international conflicts and friction even to this day. Though the overt colonial era has passed, Western nations, as comparatively rich, well-armed, and culturally powerful states, still wield a large degree of influence throughout the world.

Although not part of Western colonization process proper, Western culture entered Japan in the so-called [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912). The traditional Japanese society was virtually overturned into an industrial and militarist power like Western countries such as the [[United Kingdom]].

===Cold War context===
During the Cold War, a new definition emerged. The [[Earth]] was divided into three &quot;worlds&quot;. The First World, analogous in this context to what was called ''the West'', was composed of NATO members and other countries aligned with the United States. The [[Second World]] was the [[Eastern bloc]] in the Soviet [[sphere of influence]], including the Soviet Union and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. It included some Central and Eastern European countries like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, East Germany (now united with Germany),  [[Czechoslovakia]] (now split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia).

The Third World consisted of countries, many of which were [[Non-Aligned Movement|unaligned with either]], and important members included India, [[Yugoslavia]], Finland ([[Finlandisation]]) and Switzerland ([[Swiss Neutrality]]); some include the [[People's Republic of China]], though this is disputed,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} as the People's Republic of China is communist, had friendly relations&amp;mdash;at certain times&amp;mdash;with the Soviet bloc, and had a significant degree of importance in global geopolitics. Some Third World countries aligned themselves with either the US-led West or the Soviet-led Eastern bloc.

|}

There were a number of countries which did not fit comfortably into this neat definition of partition, including [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], which chose to be neutral. [[Finland]] was under the ''Soviet Union's'' military sphere of influence (see [[FCMA treaty]]) but remained neutral, was not communist, nor was it a member of the Warsaw Pact or Comecon but a member of the EFTA since 1986, and was West of the [[Iron Curtain]]. In 1955, when Austria again became a fully independent republic, it did so under the condition that it remain neutral, but as a country to the West of the Iron Curtain, it was in the ''United States''' sphere of influence. Spain did not join the NATO until 1982, towards the end of the Cold War and after the death of the authoritarian [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].

==Modern definitions==

{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}

The exact scope of the Western world is somewhat subjective in nature, depending on whether cultural, economic, spiritual or political criteria are employed.

Many anthropologists, sociologists and historians oppose &quot;the West and the Rest&quot; in a categorical manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;LabyrinthofKinship&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review - Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same has been done by Malthusian demographers with a sharp distinction between European and non-European family systems. Among anthropologists, this includes [[Durkheim]], [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Dumont]] and [[Lévi-Strauss]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LabyrinthofKinship&quot;/&gt;

As the term &quot;Western world&quot; does not have a strict international definition, governments do not use the term in legislation of [[Treaty|international treaties]] and instead rely on other definitions.

===Ethnic / linguistic===
[[File:IE countries.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Indo-European]] languages]]

The Western world is also considered to be the collection of nations, where Indo-European languages and cultures (primarily of colonial origin) are practiced and dominated. Ethnically speaking, it can refer to Germanic, Greek, Latin, Celtic, Baltic and Slavic peoples and most of their territories.

Traditionally the ethnicity of the Western World has been assumed to be that of European peoples of Western European descent and the settler peoples of their respective colonies. However, more recently it is commonly perceived as including peoples of originally other ethnicities who have become westernised by living and assimilating into western countries, in some cases for centuries- such as Black and Asian Americans and Europeans. Moreover even more recently with the end of the cold war many European countries with large populations of Baltic, Slavic and many other ethnicities re-united with the rest of the West. This points to the fact that the ethnic and national definitions of the Western World, along with the phenomenon of the Western World itself, have been, and are still, subject to flux.

===Cultural===
:''See: [[Western culture]]''

[[File:Latin alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Latin alphabet]] world distribution. The dark green areas shows the countries where this alphabet is the sole main script. The light green shows the countries where the alphabet co-exists with other scripts. In addition, China's widely-used [[pinyin]] system employs the Latin alphabet.]]

From a cultural and [[sociological]] approach the Western world is defined as including all cultures that are directly derived from and influenced by [[Europe|European]] cultures, i.e. western Europe (i.e. France, the UK, Ireland), central Europe (i.e. Germany, Poland, Switzeland), northern Europe (i.e. Sweden, Denmark, Finland), eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus), southeastern Europe (i.e. Bulgaria, Greece, Romania) and  southern (or southwestern) Europe (i.e. Spain, Italy, Portugal), United States of America and Canada, ([[Latin America]] - Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and Chile), Australia and New Zealand. Together these countries constitute Western society.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brasembottawa1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

In the 20th century, Christianity declined in influence in many Western countries, mostly in the northern, central and eastern parts of Europe (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria) and elsewhere. [[Secularism]] (separating religion from politics and science) increased. However, while church attendance is in decline, some western countries (i.e. Italy, Poland and Portugal) believe that [[Importance of religion by country|religion is important]], and most Westerners nominally identify themselves as Christians (e.g. 70% in the [[UK]]) and attend church on major occasions, such as Christmas and Easter. In the Americas Christianity continues to play an important societal role (though at least Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, specially among the middle and upper classes, are experiencing processes of secularization similar to European ones).

The [[State religion|official religions]] of the United Kingdom and some Nordic countries are forms of Christianity, even though the majority of European countries have no official religion. Despite this, Christianity, in its different forms, remains the largest faith in most Western countries.

Due to the high influence of European culture in places like South Africa, it could be said that the country is Western or has achieved Westernization. Moreover, White South Africans of European origin make up about 9% of [[South Africa]]. Another 9% are of mixed race. Unlike Black South Africans who've maintained their own native languages, most mixed South Africans speak Afrikaans as a first language. Likewise, most Indian South Africans speak English natively today. Therefore, it can be argued that this collective 20% of native English and Afrikaans speakers (both European-derived) live in heavily Western influenced cultures. Similarly, whites and coloureds are over 10% of Namibia. They primarily speak Afrikaans and German as a first language. In addition to that, many Black South Africans and Namibians speak European languages, e.g. Afrikaans and English, fluently and are also considered speakers of those languages.

===Modern political===

[[File:EU27-candidate countries map.svg|thumb|250px|Enlargement of the European Union {{legend|#003399|Current members (since 2007)}}{{legend|#2782bb|Candidate countries}}{{legend|#77bbbc|Current enlargement agenda}}]]

Countries of the Western world are generally considered to share certain fundamental political ideologies, including those of [[liberal democracy]], the [[rule of law]], [[human rights]] and a high degree of [[gender equality]] (although there are notable exceptions, especially in foreign policy). All of these are prerequisites, for example, for a state to become a full member of the European Union and therefore from modern political point of view all [[Member state of the European Union|European Union member states]] from the Western, Central and Eastern Europe are considered to be part of the Western world in political terms.

===Economic===

Though the Cold War has ended, and some members of the former Eastern Bloc are making a general movement towards liberal democracy and other values held in common by the traditionally Western states, most of the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] (except [[Baltic states]]) are not considered Western because of the small presence of social and political reform, as well as their obvious cultural, economic and political differences to what is known today as described by the term &quot;The West&quot; North America (USA and Canada), Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

The term &quot;Western world&quot; is often interchangeablebly used with the term [[First World]] stressing the difference between First World and the [[Third World]] or [[Developing country|developing countries]]. This usage occurs despite the fact that many countries that may be geographically or culturally Western are [[developing countries]]. In fact, most of the Americas are developing countries, which make up a significant percentage of the West. It is also used despite many [[Developed countries]] not being Western (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Singapore).

The existence of &quot;The North&quot; implies the existence of &quot;[[North-South divide|The South]]&quot;, and the [[socio-economic]] divide between North and South. The term &quot;the North&quot; has in some contexts replaced earlier usage of the term &quot;the West&quot;, particularly in the critical sense, as a more robust demarcation than the terms &quot;West&quot; and &quot;East&quot;. The North provides some absolute geographical indicators for the location of wealthy countries, most of which are physically situated in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], although, as most countries are located in the northern hemisphere in general, some have considered this distinction to be equally unhelpful.

The thirty high-income countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which include: Australia,  Canada, [[Iceland]], Israel, Japan, New Zealand, [[Norway]], South Korea, Switzerland, the United States and the countries of the [[EU]] (except for: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, [[Malta]] and Romania), are generally included in what used to be called &quot;developed world&quot;, although the OECD includes three countries, namely Chile, Mexico and [[Turkey]], that are not yet fully industrial countries, but [[Newly-industrialized country|newly industrialised countries]]. Although [[Andorra]], Cyprus, [[Hong Kong]], Malta, [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], Singapore, Taiwan and [[Vatican City]], are not members of the OECD, they might also be regarded as [[developed]] countries, because their high living standards, high per capita incomes, and their social, economical and [[political structure]] are quite similar to those of the high income OECD countries.

==Other views==
A series of scholars of civilization, including [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Alfred Kroeber]] and [[Carroll Quigley]] have identified and analyzed &quot;Western civilization&quot; as one of the [[civilization]]s that have historically existed and still exist today. Toynbee entered into quite an expansive mode, including as candidates those countries or cultures who became so heavily influenced by the West as to adopt these borrowings into their very self-identity; carried to its limit, this would in practice include almost everyone within the West, in one way or another. In particular, Toynbee refers to the ''intelligentsia'' formed among the educated elite of countries impacted by the European expansion of centuries past. While often pointedly nationalist, these cultural and political leaders interacted within the West to such an extent as to change both themselves and the West.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Arnold J. Toynbee, ''Change and Habit. The challenge of our time'' (Oxford 1966, 1969) at 153-156; also, Toynbee, ''A Study of History'' (10 volumes, 2 supplements).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clash of Civilizations map.png|400px|right|thumb|Huntington's map of major civilizations. What constitutes Western civilization in his view is coloured dark blue.]]

Yet more recently, [[Samuel P. Huntington]] has taken a far more controversial approach, forging a [[political science]] hypothesis he labeled the &quot;[[Clash of Civilizations|The Clash of Civilizations?]]&quot; in a ''Foreign Affairs'' article and a book.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington, ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Huntington's hypothesis, what he calls &quot;conflicts between civilizations&quot; will be the primary tensions of the 21st century world. In this hypothesis, the West is based on religion, as the countries of West and Central Europe were historically influenced by the two forms of [[Western Christianity]], namely  [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholicism]]. Also, some Anglophone countries share these traits, e.g. [[Bermuda]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[British Virgin Islands]], Australia and New Zealand, as well as the more heterogeneous United States and Canada.

Huntington's thesis, while influential, was by no means universally accepted; its supporters say that it explains modern conflicts, such as those in the former Yugoslavia. The thesis's detractors fear that by equating values like [[democracy]] with the concept of &quot;Western civilization&quot;, it reinforces stereotypes that some perceive as being common within the West about non-traditionally Western societies that some may consider racist or xenophobic. Others believe that Huntington ignores the existence of non-Western democracies such as the East Asian and South-Central Asian democracies. As such, these detractors believe that it will serve to provoke and amplify conflict rather than illuminating a way to find an accommodating world order, or in particular cases a commonly agreed solution.

In Huntington's narrow thesis, the historically [[Eastern Orthodox]] nations of [[Southeastern Europe|Southeastern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] constitute a distinct &quot;Euro-Asiatic civilization&quot;; although European and mainly Christian (as well as notable [[Muslim]] influence and populations, particularly in the southeastern Europe and southern/central Russia), these nations were not, in Huntington's view, shaped by the cultural influences of the Renaissance. The Renaissance did not affect [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Eastern]] Europe due in part to the proximity of [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman domination]], despite the decisive influence of Greek émigré scholars on the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Scholars such as [[Gemistus Pletho|Georgios Gemistos Plethon]], [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], [[Theodorus Gaza|Theodorus of Gaza]], [[Marsilio Ficino|Ioannis Argyropoulos]], [[Markos Mousouros]] and [[Demetrius Chalcondyles]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other views might be made regarding (Central and) Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;The Renaissance was said to be weak in the frontier region of Hungary because Ottoman military pressure long limited Hungarian access to their fellow Roman Catholics in Austria. Yet regarding Hungary, such views depart from the consensus. Some claim the reforms of [[Peter the Great]] (1682-1725) and [[Catherine II the Great]] (1762-96) were inspired by the Enlightenment. However, they departed considerably from the Enlightenment idea of respect for the individual: Peter's projects for [[St Petersburg]] cost the lives of 30,000 workers (though such loss of life was not unknown in the rest of Europe), and under both Peter and Catherine most Russians remained [[serfdom|serfs]]. It is unclear whether these views are those of Huntington or not.&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial theory of Huntington is that he considered the possibility of South America being a separate civilization from the West, but also mused that it might become a third part (the first two being North America and Europe) of the West in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington evidently did not detail Australia and New Zealand, but see map.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theologian]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] conceived of the West as the set of civilizations descended from the [[Civilizations#Nile Valley Civilizations|Nile Valley Civilization]] of [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Teilhard de Chardin, ''Le Phenomene Humain'' (1955), translated as ''The Phenomena of Man'' (New York 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian-American literary critic [[Edward Said]] uses the term occident in his discussion of [[orientalism]]. According to his binary, the West, or Occident, created a romanticized vision of the East, or Orient, in order to justify colonial and imperialist intentions. This Occident-Orient binary is focused on the Western vision of the East instead of any truths about the East. His theories are rooted in [[Hegel]]'s [[Master-slave dialectic]]: The Occident would not exist without the Orient and vice versa. Further, Western writers created this irrational, feminine, weak &quot;Other&quot; to contrast with the rational, masculine, strong West because of a need to create a difference between the two that would justify imperialist ambitions, said influenced Indian-American theorist [[Homi K. Bhabha]].

The term the &quot;West&quot; may also be used [[pejorative]]ly by certain tendencies and especially critical of the influence of the traditional West, due to the history of most of the members of the traditional West being previously involved, at one time or another, in outright [[imperialism]] and colonialism. Some of these critics also claim that the traditional West has continued to engage in what might be viewed as modern implementations of imperialism and colonialism, such as [[neoliberalism]] and globalization. (It should be noted that many Westerners who subscribe to a positive view of the traditional West are also very critical of neoliberalism and globalization, for their allegedly negative effects on both the developed and developing world.)

Allegedly, definitions of the term &quot;Western world&quot; that some may consider &quot;[[ethnocentric]]&quot; are considered by some to be &quot;[[social construction|constructed]]&quot; around one or another Western culture. The British writer [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote about this contrast: ''East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet'', expressing his belief that somebody from the West &quot;can never understand the Asian cultures&quot; as the latter &quot;differ too much&quot; from the Western cultures. Some may view this alleged incompatibility as a precursor to Huntington's &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; theory.

Paradoxically, today Asia and Africa to varying degrees may be considered quasi-Western. Many East Asians and South Asians and Africans and others associate or even identify with the cosmopolitan cultures and international societies referred to sometimes as Western. Likewise, many in the West identify with a transcultural humanity, a notion often found in visions of the sacred.

From a very different perspective, it has also been argued that the idea of the West is, in part, a non-Western invention, deployed in the non-West to shape and define non-Western pathways through or against modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett, A. 2004. ''The Idea of the West''&lt;/ref&gt;
