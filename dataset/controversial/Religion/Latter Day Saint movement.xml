The '''Latter Day Saint movement''' (also called the '''LDS movement''' or '''LDS restorationist movement''') is the collection of independent church groups that trace their origins to a [[Christian primitivism|Christian primitivist]] movement founded by [[Joseph Smith]] in the late 1820s. Collectively, these churches have over 14 million members. The vast majority of [[Mormons]] belong to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), with their predominant theology being [[Mormonism]]. The LDS Church self-identifies as Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Stephanie (May 1998).[http://www.lds.org/new-era/1998/05/are-mormons-christians?lang=eng Are Mormons Christians?].''Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.''&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of Latter Day Saint adherents, such as members of the [[Community of Christ]], believe in traditional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] theology, and have distanced themselves from some of the distinctive doctrines of Mormonism. Other breakaway groups include the [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] which support lineal succession of leadership of Joseph Smith's descendants; and the more controversial [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]], who defend the practice of [[polygamy]].

The movement began in western New York during the [[Second Great Awakening]] when Smith said that he received visions revealing a new sacred text, the [[Book of Mormon]], which he published in 1830 as a supplement to the [[Bible]]. Based on the teachings of this book and other revelations, Smith founded a Christian primitivist church, called the ''[[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]''. The Book of Mormon brought hundreds of early followers, who later became known as &quot;Mormons&quot;, &quot;Latter Day Saints&quot;, or just &quot;Saints.&quot; In 1831 Smith moved the church headquarters to [[Kirtland, Ohio]], and in 1834 changed its name to the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.&quot;

After the church in Ohio collapsed by dissensions in 1838, Smith and the body of the church moved to Missouri, and later to Illinois. After he [[Death of Joseph Smith|was murdered]] in 1844, a [[succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] led to the organization splitting into several groups. The largest of these, the LDS Church, migrated under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] to the [[Great Basin]] (now [[Utah]]) and became most prominently known for its 19th-century practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]]. The LDS Church [[1890 Manifesto|officially renounced]] this practice in 1890, and gradually discontinued it, resulting in the [[Utah Territory]] becoming a U.S. state. This change resulted in the formation of a number of small sects who sought to maintain polygamy and other 19th-century Mormon doctrines and practices, now referred to as ''[[Mormon fundamentalism]]''. 

Other groups originating within the Latter Day Saint movement followed different paths in [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. For the most part these groups rejected plural marriage and some of Smith's later teachings. The largest of these, the Community of Christ (originally known as the ''Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints''), was formed in Illinois in 1860 by several groups uniting around Smith's son, [[Joseph Smith III]]. Most existing denominations that adhere to the teachings of Smith have some historical relationship with the movement.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}
The driving force behind and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement was [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], and to a lesser extent, during the movement's first two years, [[Oliver Cowdery]]. Throughout his life, Smith told of an experience he had as a boy having [[First Vision|seen God the Father and Jesus Christ]] as two separate beings, who told him that the true church had been lost and would be restored through him, and that he would be given the authority to organize and lead the true [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]. Smith and Cowdery also explained that the [[angels]] [[John the Baptist]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] visited them in 1829 and gave them authority to reestablish the Church of Christ.

The first [[Latter Day Saint]] church was formed in April 1830, consisting of a community of believers in the western [[New York]] towns of [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]], [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]], and [[Colesville, New York|Colesville]]. They called themselves the ''[[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]'', and on April 6, 1830, the church formally organized into a legal institution under that name. By 1834, the church was being referred to as the ''Church of the Latter Day Saints'' in early church publications,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Joseph Smith, Jr. (ed), ''Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints'' (Kirtland, OH: F.G. Williams &amp; Co., 1835).&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1838 Joseph Smith announced that he had received a revelation from God that officially changed the name to the ''[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (disambiguation)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]''.&lt;ref name = MHC&gt;''Manuscript History of the Church'', LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in [[Dean C. Jessee]] (comp.) (1989). ''The Papers of Joseph Smith: Autobiographical and Historical Writings'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) '''1''':302–303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = marquardt&gt;H. Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). ''Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, [[William Law (Mormonism)|William Law]] and several other Latter Day Saints in church leadership positions publicly denounced Smith's secret practice of [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|polygamy]] in the controversial ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'', and formed [[True Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|their own church]]. The city council of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] subsequently had the printing press of the ''Expositor'' destroyed. In spite of Smith's later offer to pay damages for destroyed property, critics of Smith and the church considered the destruction heavy-handed. Some called for the Latter Day Saints to be either expelled or destroyed. 

Following [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|Smith's assassination]] by a mob in [[Carthage, Illinois]], several prominent members of the church claimed to be Smith's legitimate successor. These various claims resulted in a [[Succession Crisis (Mormon)|succession crisis]], in which the majority of church members followed [[Brigham Young]], he being the senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] of the church; others followed [[Sidney Rigdon]] or [[James Strang]]. The crisis resulted in several permanent schisms as well as the formation of splinter groups, some of which no longer exist. These various groups are sometimes referred to under two geographical headings: &quot;Prairie Saints&quot; (those that remained in the Midwest United States) and &quot;Rocky Mountain Saints&quot; (those who followed Brigham Young to what would later become the state of [[Utah]]).

Today, there are many small [[Schism (religion)|schism]] organizations who regard themselves as a part of the Latter Day Saint movement, though in most cases they do not acknowledge the other branches as valid and regard their own tradition as the only correct and authorized version of the church Smith originally founded. The vast majority (over 98 percent) of Latter Day Saints belong to the largest denomination, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) which reports 14 million members worldwide. The second-largest denomination is the [[Community of Christ]], which reports over 250,000 members. There are also tens of thousands of adherents within small sects of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;The term &quot;Mormon fundamentalist&quot; appears to have been coined in the 1940s by [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Mark E. Petersen]]: Ken Driggs, &quot;'This Will Someday Be the Head and Not the Tail of the Church': A History of the Mormon Fundamentalists at Short Creek&quot;, ''Journal of Church and State'' '''43''':49 (2001) at p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; These sects separated from the LDS Church because they continue to practice [[plural marriage]], which the LDS Church [[1890 Manifesto|officially abandoned]] in 1890.

==Beliefs==
===''Saint''-designation of members===
{{main|Saint#Mormons (Latter-day Saints)}}

[[Latter Day Saint]]s adopt a definition of &quot;[[saint]]&quot; that all members of the church are considered &quot;Saints&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&gt;[[Quentin L. Cook]], [http://lds.org/ensign/2003/11/are-you-a-saint?lang=eng &quot;Are You a Saint?&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', Nov. 2003, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;latter day&quot; distinguishes between ''biblical saints'' and ''modern saints'' who &quot;live in the [[end time|latter days]]&quot;.

===Restoration===
{{main|Restoration (Latter Day Saints)}}
The Latter Day Saint movement classifies itself within Christianity, but as a distinct restored [[Dispensation_(period)#Latter_Day_Saint_dispensations|dispensation]]. Latter Day Saints hold that a [[Great Apostasy#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Great Apostasy]] began in Christianity not long after the [[ascension of Jesus Christ]],&lt;ref name = PMG35&gt;{{Cite book |author= Missionary Department of the LDS Church |authorlink= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |title= Preach My Gospel |publisher= [[LDS Church]], Inc |year= 2004 |pages= 35 |url= http://lds.org/languages/additionalmanuals/preachgospel/PreachMyGospel___06_03-1_TheRestoration__36617_eng_006.pdf |isbn= 0-402-36617-4 }} (see also: 2 Thessalonians 2:3)&lt;/ref&gt; marked with the corruption of Christian doctrine by [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and other philosophies,&lt;ref name = GA2&gt;{{Cite book |last= Talmage |first= James E. |authorlink= James E.

Additionally, Latter Day Saints claim the martyrdom of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] 
led to a loss of [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood authority]] to administer the church and its ordinances.&lt;ref name = GA1&gt;{{Cite book | last = Talmage | first = James E. | authorlink = James E. Talmage | title = The Great Apostasy | publisher = The Deseret News | year = 1909 | pages = 68 | url =http://www.archive.org/stream/greatapostasycon00atalm#page/68/mode/2up | isbn = 0-87579-843-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Eyring&gt;{{Citation |last= Eyring |first= Henry B. |author-link= Henry B.

According to Latter Day Saint churches, the Lord re-established the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] church as found in the [[New Testament]] through Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Smith's restoration was slightly different than other ''restorationists'' of the era (for instance, that of Alexander Campbell). Instead of analyzing the Bible, Smith claimed to write and interpret scripture as the biblical prophets did. {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Latter Day Saints believe that angels such as [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], and [[John the Baptist]] appeared to Joseph Smith and others and bestowed various [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] authorities on them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1/69-72#69 JSH 1:69,72] and [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/84 Doctrine and Covenants 84:19-21]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Smith and his successors are considered modern prophets who receive revelation from God to guide the church.

===Theology===
{{see also|Mormonism and Christianity|Christian theology}}

Most members of Latter Day Saint churches are adherents to [[Mormonism]], a theology based on Joseph Smith's later teachings and further developed by [[Brigham Young]], [[James Strang]] and others who claimed to be Smith's successors. The [[Mormon (word)|term ''Mormon'']] derives from the [[Book of Mormon]], and most of these adherents refer to themselves as [[Latter Day Saints]] or [[Mormons]]. Mormonism and Christianity have a complex theological, historical, and sociological relationship. Mormons express the doctrines of [[Mormonism]] using standard biblical terminology, and claim to have similar views about the nature of Jesus' [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], bodily resurrection, and [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]] as traditional [[Christianity]]. Nevertheless, Mormons agree with non-Mormons that their view of God is significantly different from the trinitarian view of the [[Nicene Creed]] of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shipps|1985|pp=148–49}} (arguing that &quot;Mormonism differs from traditional Christianity in much the same fashion that traditional Christianity... came to differ from Judaism.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mormons consider the Bible as scripture (insofar as it is &quot;translated correctly&quot;), and have also adopted additional scriptures. Mormons not only practice [[Baptism#Mormonism|baptism]] and celebrate the [[Eucharist#Latter-day_Saints|eucharist]] but also participate in [[Ritual#Religious_rituals|religious rituals]] not practiced in traditional Christianity. Although the various branches of Christianity have diverse views about the nature of salvation, the Mormon view is particularly distinct.

Focusing on differences, some Christians consider Mormonism &quot;non-Christian;&quot; and Mormons, focusing on similarities, are offended at being so characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Stark|Neilson|2005|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons do not accept non-Mormon baptism nor do non-Mormon Christians usually accept Mormon baptism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Mormons regularly proselytize individuals actually or nominally within the Christian tradition, and some Christians, especially [[evangelical Christianity|evangelicals]], proselytize Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;There are a number of books by evangelical Christians that explain how evangelicals can approach witnessing to Mormons: e.g., David L. Rowe (2005). ''I Love Mormons: A New Way to Share Christ with Latter-day Saints'' (Baker Books, ISBN 978-0-8010-6522-4); Ron Rhodes (2001). ''The 10 Most Important Things You Can Say to a Mormon'' (Harvest House, ISBN 978-0-7369-0534-3); Mark J. Cares (1998). ''Speaking the Truth in Love to Mormons'' (Wels Outreach Resources, ISBN 978-1-893702-06-6).&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent scholarly view is that Mormonism is a form of Christianity, but is distinct enough from traditional Christianity so as to form a new religious tradition, much as Christianity is more than just a sect of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Shipps|2000|p=338}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mormonism]] that originated with [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] in the 1820s shared strong similarities with some elements{{Which?|date=May 2011}} of 19th-century [[Protestant Christianity]].  However, beginning with his First Vision, (and then during the 1830s and 40s), Smith departed significantly from traditional Christianity, claiming all churches of his day were part of a [[Great Apostasy]] that had distorted or abandoned Biblical doctrinal truths. Mormons believe that God, through Smith and his successors, restored these truths and doctrinal clarifications, and by new heavenly dispensation, restored the original Church and Christianity taught by Jesus.  For example, Smith rejected the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] doctrine of the [[Trinity]] as of one body and substance, with no &quot;body, parts, or passions,&quot; and instead taught that the Godhead included humankind's Eternal Father, His Begotten Son, Jesus Christ (the Redeemer), and the Holy Ghost; further that all humans are co-eternal with God and have the potential to become Gods themselves, being the offspring of Eternal Parentage. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the largest Mormon denomination, while acknowledging its differences with mainstream Christianity, often focuses on its commonalities, which are many.

A small fraction of Latter Day Saints, most notably those within the [[Community of Christ]], the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination, follow a traditional Protestant theology. The [[Community of Christ]] view God in [[Trinity|trinitarian]] terms, and reject the distinctive theological developments they believe came later in Mormonism.
