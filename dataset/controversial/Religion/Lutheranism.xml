{{lutheranism}}
{{Christianity}}
'''Lutheranism''' is a major branch of [[Western Christianity]] that identifies with the theology of [[Martin Luther]], a [[Germans|German]] [[Protestant Reformers|reformer]]. Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] launched the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Beginning with the [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]], Luther's writings were disseminated internationally, spreading the ideas of the Reformation beyond the ability of governmental and churchly authorities to control it.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite&gt;MSN Encarta&lt;/cite&gt;, s.v. &quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561935/Lutheranism.html Lutheranism]&quot; by [[George Forell|George Wolfgang Forell]]; &lt;cite&gt;Christian Cyclopedia&lt;/cite&gt;, s.v. &quot;[http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=r&amp;word=REFORMATION.LUTHERAN Reformation, Lutheran]&quot; by Lueker, E. et. al. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013960118540 Archived] 31 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The split between the Lutherans and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] began with the [[Diet of Worms|Edict of Worms in 1521]], which officially excommunicated Luther and all of his followers.&lt;ref name=ENC3/&gt; The divide centered over the doctrine of [[Justification (theology)#Lutheranism|Justification]]. Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification &quot;by [[Sola gratia|grace alone]] through [[Sola fide#Justification in Lutheranism|faith alone]] because of [[Solus Christus|Christ alone]]&quot; which went against the Roman view of &quot;faith formed by love&quot;, or &quot;faith and works&quot;. Unlike the [[Reformed Churches]], Lutherans retain many of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] practices and [[Sacraments#Lutheran teaching|sacramental]] teachings of the pre-Reformation Church, with a particular emphasis on the [[Eucharist]], or Lord's Supper.  Lutheran theology significantly differs from Reformed theology in [[Scholastic Lutheran Christology|Christology]], the purpose of [[Law and Gospel#Lutheran and Reformed differences|God's Law]], divine [[Irresistible grace#Lutheran|grace]], the concept of [[Perseverance of the saints#Lutheran view|perseverance of the saints]], and [[Predestination#Lutheranism|predestination]].

==Etymology==
[[File:LutherRose.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Luther rose]], a symbol of Lutheranism.]]
The name &quot;Lutheran&quot; originated as a derogatory term used against Luther by [[Johann Eck]] during the [[Leipzig Debate]] in July 1519.&lt;ref name=OOE796&gt;Espín, Orlando O. and Nickoloff, James B. ''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies''.  Collegeville, Minnesota: Liturgical Press, p. 796.&lt;/ref&gt; Eck and other [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] followed the traditional practice of naming a heresy after its leader, thus labeling all who identified with the [[theology of Martin Luther]] as Lutherans.&lt;ref name=ENC3&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin, and Bromiley, Geoffrey William, ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 2003. p.362.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Luther always disliked the term, preferring instead to describe the reform movement with the term &quot;Evangelical&quot;, which was derived from ''euangelion'', a Greek word meaning &quot;good news&quot;, i.e. &quot;Gospel.&quot;&lt;ref name=OOE796/&gt; Lutherans themselves began to use the term in the middle of the 16th century in order to distinguish themselves from other groups, such as [[Philippists]] and [[Calvinists]]. In 1597, theologians in [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]] defined the title &quot;Lutheran&quot; as referring to the true church.&lt;ref name=ENC3/&gt;

==History==
Lutheranism has its roots in the efforts of [[Martin Luther]] who sought to reform the Western Church to a more biblical foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethanylutheranvv.org/lutherans_started.html How Lutherans Got Started]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblehistory.com/Lutheran.html Lutherans], Biblehistory.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thefamouspeople&quot;&gt;[http://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/martin-luther-92.php Martin Luther Biography – Martin Luther Childhood, Life &amp; Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reformation&quot;&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REFORM/LUTHER.HTM Reformation: Martin Luther]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread into Northern Europe===
Lutheranism spread through all of [[Scandinavia]] during the 16th century, as the monarch of [[Denmark-Norway]] (also ruling [[Religion in Iceland#The Reformation|Iceland]]) and the monarch of [[Sweden]] (also ruling [[Religion in Finland#The Reformation|Finland]]) adopted Lutheranism. Through Baltic-German and Swedish rule Lutheranism also spread into the [[Baltic countries]] of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]].

Since 1520, regular&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.no/books?id=29k9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=%22confession%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qk3QtrqJUX&amp;sig=lyUOF5_qDXMJ-inkQ9hnETLjwc8&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=S5vASsWFCIGE-QbUz9GuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=snippet&amp;q=1520&amp;f=false Historisk fremstilling af reformationens indførelse i Danmark, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheran services have been held in Copenhagen. Under the reign of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] (1523–33), Denmark-Norway remained officially Catholic. Although Frederick initially pledged to persecute Lutherans, he soon adopted a policy of protecting Lutheran preachers and reformers, the most significant being [[Hans Tausen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert-12&quot;/&gt;

During Frederick's reign, Lutheranism made significant inroads among the Danish population. At an open meeting in Copenhagen attended by the king in 1536, the people shouted; &quot;We will stand by the holy [[Good news (Christianity)|Gospel]], and do not want such bishops anymore&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.no/books?id=29k9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=%22vilde+blive+ved+det+hellige+evangelium%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qk3QtrqJUX&amp;sig=lyUOF5_qDXMJ-inkQ9hnETLjwc8&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=S5vASsWFCIGE-QbUz9GuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22vilde%20blive%20ved%20det%20hellige%20evangelium%22&amp;f=false Historisk fremstilling af reformationens indførelse i Danmark, p. 195]&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick's son Christian was openly Lutheran, which prevented his election to the throne upon his father's death. However, following his victory in the civil war that followed, in 1537 he became [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] and advanced the [[Reformation in Denmark|Reformation in Denmark-Norway]].

Instruction is still similar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=72723 (line 33–34)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Bible in Danish was Martin Luther's. It was translated by 1550 and made available in 3,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.no/books?id=Rxt3f6fbHGgC&amp;pg=PA416&amp;lpg=PA416&amp;dq=3000+1550+bible+danish&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QeTWOXb_KH&amp;sig=OmnYOz7ex-nlWUV6pK2Eq_IJs1c&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=LcbVSs-_F5PE-QaO_-HuCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=%203000%201550&amp;f=false A Dictionary Of The Bible, p. 416]&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold out 30 years later. Important differences from today's Roman Catholicism are the Lutherans' refutation of the ideas that tradition is a carrier of the &quot;Word of God&quot;, and that only the communion of the [[Bishop of Rome]] had been entrusted to interpret the &quot;Word of God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html § 13 and 16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.no/books?id=29k9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=%22vilde+blive+ved+det+hellige+evangelium%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qk3QtrqJUX&amp;sig=lyUOF5_qDXMJ-inkQ9hnETLjwc8&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=S5vASsWFCIGE-QbUz9GuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=snippet&amp;q=%22paven%20har%22&amp;f=false Historisk fremstilling af reformationens indførelse i Danmark, p. 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Religion in Sweden#Protestant Reformation|Reformation in Sweden]] began with [[Olaus Petri|Olaus]] and [[Laurentius Petri]], brothers who took the Reformation to Sweden after studying in Germany. They led [[Gustav Vasa]], elected king in 1523, to Lutheranism. The pope's refusal to allow the replacement of an archbishop that supported the invading forces opposing Gustav Vasa during the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] led to the discontinuance of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy in 1523.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert-12&quot;&gt;[http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html Chapter 12 The Reformation In Germany And Scandinavia], Renaissance and Reformation by William Gilbert.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later, at the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Diet of Västerås]], the king succeeded in forcing the diet to accept his dominion over the national church. The king was given possession of all church properties such as the church appointments and the clergy. While this effectively granted official sanction to Lutheran ideas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbert-12&quot;/&gt; Lutheranism did not become official until 1593, when the [[Uppsala Synod]] declared Holy Scripture the sole guideline for faith, with four documents accepted as faithful and authoritative explanations of it: the ''[[Apostles' Creed]]'', the ''[[Nicene Creed]]'', the ''[[Athanasian Creed]]'', and the unaltered ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' of 1530.&lt;ref&gt;N.F.

===Schmalkaldic War and the Formula of Concord===
[[File:Collegium Jenense.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[University of Jena]] around 1600. Jena was the center of Gnesio-Lutheran activity during the controversies leading up to the Formula of Concord.]]

After the death of Luther in 1546, the [[Schmalkaldic War]] started out as a conflict between two German Lutheran rulers in 1547. Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the [[Schmalkaldic League]], oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the [[Augsburg Interim]]. Religious freedom was secured for Lutherans through the [[Peace of Passau]] in 1552 and under the [[Cuius regio, eius religio]] and [[Declaratio Ferdinandei]] clauses of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555.&lt;ref&gt;Fuerbringer, L., ''[http://www.archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' [[Concordia Publishing House]]. 1927. p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious disputes between the [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinists]], [[Philippists]], [[Sacramentarians]], [[Ubiquitarians]], and [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]''. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The ''Book of Concord'' replaced earlier, incomplete [[Body of Doctrine|collections of doctrine]], unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.

===Lutheran orthodoxy===
{{Main|Lutheran Orthodoxy}}
The historical period of Lutheran Orthodoxy is divided into three sections: Early Orthodoxy (1580–1600), High Orthodoxy (1600–1685), and Late Orthodoxy (1685–1730). [[Lutheran scholasticism]] developed gradually especially for the purpose of arguing with the [[Jesuits]], and it was finally established by [[Johann Gerhard]]. [[Abraham Calovius]] represents the climax of the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[paradigm]] in orthodox Lutheranism. Other orthodox Lutheran theologians include [[Martin Chemnitz]], [[Aegidius Hunnius]], [[Leonhard Hutter]], [[Nicolaus Hunnius]], [[Jesper Rasmussen Brochmand]], [[Salomo Glassius]], [[Johann Hülsemann]], [[Johann Conrad Dannhauer]], [[Johannes Andreas Quenstedt]], [[Johann Friedrich König]], and [[Johann Wilhelm Baier]].

Near the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the compromising spirit seen in [[Philip Melanchthon]] rose up again in [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]] School and especially in theology of [[Georgius Calixtus]], causing the [[Syncretism#Syncretistic Controversy|Syncretistic Controversy]]. Another theological issue that arose was the [[Crypto-Kenotic Controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=L&amp;word=LUTHERANTHEOLOGYAFTER1580 Lutheran Theology after 1580] article in [[Christian Cyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Late orthodoxy was torn by influences from [[rationalism]], philosophy based on reason, and [[Pietism]], a revival movement in Lutheranism. After a century of vitality, the Pietist theologians [[Philipp Jakob Spener]] and [[August Hermann Francke]] warned that orthodoxy had degenerated into meaningless intellectualism and [[Formalism (philosophy)#Religion|Formalism]], while orthodox theologians found the emotional and [[Subjectivism|subjective]] focuses of Pietism to be vulnerable to Rationalist propaganda.&lt;ref name=CC426&gt;Fuerbringer, L., ''[http://www.archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

The last famous orthodox Lutheran theologian before the rationalist ''Aufklärung'', or ''Enlightenment'', was [[David Hollatz (dogmatician)|David Hollatz]]. Late orthodox theologian [[Valentin Ernst Löscher]] took part in the controversy against [[Pietism]]. Medieval [[Christian mysticism|mystical]] traditions continued in works of [[Martin Moller]], [[Johann Arndt]], and [[Joachim Lütkemann]]. [[Pietism]] became a rival of orthodoxy but adopted some orthodox devotional literature; for example, [[Johann Arndt|Arndt]]'s, [[Christian Scriver|Scriver]]'s and [[Stephan Prätorius|Prätorius]]' which were combined Pietistic literature.

===Rationalism===
[[File:Franckesche Stiftungen Waisenhaus 2009.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Historic Pietist orphanage in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], Germany, a center of Pietism.]]

Rationalist philosophers from France and England had an enormous impact during the 18th century, along with the German Rationalists [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Their work led to an increase in rationalist beliefs, &quot;at the expense of faith in God and agreement with the Bible&quot;.&lt;ref name=CC426/&gt;

In 1709, [[Valentin Ernst Löscher]] warned that this new Rationalist view of the world fundamentally changed society by drawing into question every aspect of theology. Instead of considering the authority of divine revelation, he explained, Rationalists relied solely on their personal understanding when searching for truth.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinig, Vernon P. &quot;Confessional Lutheranism in Eighteenth-Century Germany.&quot; ''[http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/kleinigconfessionallutheranism.pdf Concordia Theological Quarterly 60(1–2)]'' Jan–April 1996: Part I, Valentin Ernst Loescher p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Melchior Goeze]] (1717–1786), pastor of [[St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg]], wrote [[Christian apologetics|apologetical]] works against Rationalists, including a theological and historical defence against the [[Higher criticism|historical criticism]] of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinig, Vernon P. &quot;Confessional Lutheranism in Eighteenth-Century Germany.&quot; ''[http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/kleinigconfessionallutheranism.pdf Concordia Theological Quarterly 60(1–2)]'' Jan–April 1996: Part II, Melchior Goeze p. 109-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissenting Lutheran pastors were often reprimanded by the government bureaucracy overseeing them, for example, when they tried to correct Rationalist influences in the parish school.&lt;ref&gt;Rietschel, William C. ''An Introduction to the Foundations of Lutheran Education''. St. Louis: Concordia, 2000. p. 25 (Although this reference specifically mentions Saxony, government promoted rationalism was a trend across Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the impact of a local form of rationalism, termed [[Neology]], by the latter half of the 18th century, genuine piety was found almost solely in small Pietist [[conventicle]]s.&lt;ref name=CC426/&gt; However, some of the laity preserved Lutheran orthodoxy from both Pietism and rationalism through reusing old catechisms, hymnbooks, [[postil]]s, and devotional writings, including those written by [[Johann Gerhard]], [[Heinrich Müller (theologian)|Heinrich Müller]], and [[Christian Scriver]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stolaf.edu/people/lund/Research.htm Devotional Literature Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revivals===
{{stack|float=right|[[File:A Tidemand-Haugianerne.jpg|thumb|A nineteenth-century [[Haugean]] ''[[conventicle]]''.]][[File:Konfirmaatio Aholansaari 2009.JPG|thumb|Representing the continuation of the Finnish Awakening to the present, youth are confirmed at the site of Paavo Ruotsalainen's homestead.]]}}
A [[laity|layman]], Luther scholar [[Johann Georg Hamann]] (1730–88), became famous for countering Rationalism and striving to advance a [[Christian revival#19th century|revival]] known as the ''Erweckung'', or ''Awakening''.&lt;ref name=Gritsch180&gt;Gritsch, Eric W. [http://books.google.com/books?id=fIhb4-iBk6EC&amp;pg=PA180 A History of Lutheranism]. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806, Napoleon's [[War of the Fourth Coalition|invasion of Germany]] promoted Rationalism and angered German Lutherans, [[Counter-Enlightenment#The Counter-Enlightenment Movement vs Counter-Enlightenments|stirring up a desire among the people]] to preserve Luther's theology from the Rationalist threat.  Those associated with this ''Awakening'' held that reason was insufficient and pointed out the importance of emotional religious experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armin Sierszyn p. 155&quot;&gt;Armin Sierszyn: 2000 Jahre Kirchengeschichte, Book.4, Die Neuzeit, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suelflow, Roy A. 1967. p. 10&quot;&gt;Suelflow, Roy A. ''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Small groups sprang up, often in universities, which devoted themselves to Bible study, reading devotional writings, and revival meetings. Although the beginning of this ''Awakening'' tended heavily toward [[Romanticism]], [[patriotism]], and experience, the emphasis of the ''Awakening'' shifted around 1830 to restoring the traditional liturgy, doctrine, and confessions of the Lutheran church in the  [[Neo-Lutheranism|Neo-Lutheran]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armin Sierszyn p. 155&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suelflow, Roy A. 1967. p. 10&quot;/&gt;

This ''Awakening'' swept through all of [[Scandinavia]] except for Iceland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latourette p.165&quot;&gt;[[Kenneth Scott Latourette|Latourette, Kenneth Scott]]. ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, Volume II, The Nineteenth Century in Europe. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; It developed from both German Neo-Lutheranism and Pietism. Danish pastor and philosopher [[Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig]] reshaped church life throughout Denmark through a reform movement beginning in 1830. He also wrote about 1,500 hymns, including ''[[God's Word Is Our Great Heritage]]''.&lt;ref name = Gritsch182&gt;Gritsch, Eric W.

In Norway, [[Hans Nielsen Hauge]], a lay street preacher, emphasized spiritual discipline and sparked the [[Haugean]] movement.&lt;ref name= Gritsch183&gt;Gritsch, Eric W. [http://books.google.com/books?id=fIhb4-iBk6EC&amp;pg=PA183 A History of Lutheranism]. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, the ''Awakening'' drove the growth of foreign missions to non-Christians to a new height, which has never been reached since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latourette p.165&quot;/&gt; In Sweden, [[Lars Levi Læstadius]] began the [[Laestadianism|Laestadian]] movement that emphasized moral reform.&lt;ref name=Gritsch183 /&gt;  In Finland, a farmer, [[Paavo Ruotsalainen]], began the [[Awakening (religious movement)|Finnish Awakening]] when he took to preaching about repentance and prayer.&lt;ref name=Gritsch183/&gt;

In 1817, [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] ordered the Lutheran and [[Reformed]] churches in his territory to unite, forming the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union]]. The unification of the two branches of German Protestantism sparked the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)#Quarrels over the Union|Schism of the Old Lutherans]]. Many Lutherans, called &quot;[[Old Lutherans]]&quot;, chose to leave the state churches despite imprisonment and military force.&lt;ref name = Gritsch180 /&gt; Some formed independent church bodies, or &quot;[[free church]]es&quot;, at home while [[Old Lutherans#Emigration to Australia and America|others left for the United States, Canada, and Australia]]. A similar legislated merger in [[Silesia]] prompted thousands to join the Old Lutheran movement. The dispute over ecumenism overshadowed other controversies within German Lutheranism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=1974 | contribution=Lutheran Churches | editor-last=Benton | editor-first=William | editor-link=William Benton (senator) | title=Encyclopædia Britannica | edition=15 | place=Chicago | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-date= | volume=11 | page=198 | isbn=0-85229-290-2 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite political meddling in church life, local and national leaders sought to restore and renew Christianity. Neo-Lutheran [[Johann Konrad Wilhelm Löhe]] and Old Lutheran free church leader [[Friedrich August Brünn]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=b&amp;word=BRUNN.FRIEDRICHAUGUST Christian Cyclopedia article on Brünn]&lt;/ref&gt; both sent young men overseas to serve as pastors to [[German American]]s, while the [[Inner Mission (Germany)|Inner Mission]] focused on renewing the situation home.&lt;ref name=Gritsch184&gt;Gritsch, Eric W.

[[Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg]], though raised Reformed, became convinced of the truth of historic Lutheranism as a young man.&lt;ref name=KSL21&gt;[[Kenneth Scott Latourette|Latourette, Kenneth Scott]]. ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, Volume II, The Nineteenth Century in Europe. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1959, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; He led the Neo-Lutheran ''Repristination School'' of theology, which advocated a return to the orthodox theologians of the 17th century and opposed  modern Bible scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Repristination Theology.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 6 Apr 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498536/Repristination-Theology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; As editor of the periodical ''Evangelische Kirchenzeitung'', he developed it into a major support of Neo-Lutheran revival and used it to attack all forms of theological liberalism and rationalism. Although he received a large amount of slander and ridicule during his forty years at the head of revival, he never gave up his positions.&lt;ref name=KSL21/&gt;

The theological faculty at the University of Erlangen in Bavaria became another force for reform.&lt;ref name=KSL21/&gt; There, professor [[Gottlieb Christoph Adolf von Harless|Adolf von Harless]], though previously an adherent of rationalism and [[German idealism]], made Erlangen a magnet for revival oriented theologians.&lt;ref name=KSL22&gt;[[Kenneth Scott Latourette|Latourette, Kenneth Scott]].

[[Friedrich Julius Stahl]] led the ''[[High Church Lutheranism|High Church Lutherans]]''. Though raised a Jew, he was baptized as a Christian at the age of 19 through the influence of the Lutheran school he attended. As the leader of a [[neofeudalism|neofeudal]] Prussian political party, he campaigned for the [[divine right of kings]], the power of the [[Junker|nobility]], and [[episcopal polity]] for the church. Along with [[Theodor Kliefoth|Kliefoth]] and [[August Friedrich Christian Vilmar|Vilmar]], he promoted agreement with Roman Catholicism with regard to the [[Magisterium|authority of the institutional church]],  [[ex opere operato]] effectiveness of the sacraments, and the divine authority of clergy. Unlike Roman Catholics, however, they also urged complete agreement with the ''Book of Concord''.&lt;ref name=HJN175/&gt;

The Neo-Lutheran movement managed to slow secularism and counter atheistic [[Marxism]], but it did not fully succeed in Europe.&lt;ref name=Gritsch184/&gt; It partly succeeded in continuing the Pietist movement's drive to right social wrongs and focus on individual conversion. The Neo-Lutheran call to renewal failed to achieve widespread popular acceptance because it both began and continued with a lofty, idealistic [[Romanticism]] that did not connect with an increasingly [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] and [[Secularization|secularized]] Europe.&lt;ref name=Gritsch188&gt;Gritsch, Eric W. [http://books.google.com/books?id=fIhb4-iBk6EC&amp;pg=PA188 A History of Lutheranism]. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  At best, the work of local leaders resulted in specific areas with vibrant spiritual renewal, but people in Lutheran areas overall continued to become increasingly distant from church life.&lt;ref name=Gritsch184/&gt; By 1969, Manfried Kober complained that “unbelief is rampant” even within German Lutheran parishes.&lt;ref&gt;Detzler, Wayne A.

==Doctrine==
===The Bible===
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Luther Bible|Luther's translation]] of the Bible, from 1534]]

Traditionally, Lutherans hold the Bible of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s to be the only divinely inspired book, the only source of divinely revealed knowledge, and the only norm for Christian teaching.&lt;ref&gt;For the traditional Lutheran view of the Bible, see {{cite book |last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/bibliology.txt|title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |pages=3ff. |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910 |isbn=0-524-04891-6 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060712193848/http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/bibliology.txt |archivedate=12 July 2006}}.

The authority of the Scriptures has been challenged during the history of Lutheranism. Martin Luther taught that the Bible was the written Word of God, and the only reliable guide for faith and practice. He held that every passage of Scripture has one straightforward meaning, the literal sense as interpreted by other Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Braaten, Carl E. (1983). Principles of Lutheran Theology. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=&quot;The literal sense as interpreted by&quot; is a contradiction, and Scriptures usually don't interpret anything.|date=December 2011}} These teachings were accepted during the [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|orthodox Lutheranism]] of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Preus, Robert. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=McgOAAAAIAAJ The Inspiration of Scripture: A Study of the Theology of the 17th Century Lutheran Dogmaticians].'' London: Oliver and Boyd, 1957. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, [[Rationalism]] advocated reason rather than the authority of the Bible as the final source of knowledge, but most of the [[laity]] did not accept this Rationalist position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=1978 | contribution=Lutheran Churches | editor-last=Benton | editor-first=William | editor-link=William Benton (senator) | title=Encyclopædia Britannica | edition=15 | place=Chicago | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-date= | volume=11 | pages=197–198 | isbn=0-85229-290-2 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, a [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] [[Confessional Lutheran|revival]] reemphasized the authority of the Bible and agreement with the Lutheran Confessions.

Today, Lutherans disagree about the inspiration and authority of the Bible. Theological conservatives use the [[historical-grammatical method]] of Biblical interpretation, while [[Liberal Christianity|theological liberals]] use the [[higher criticism|higher critical]] method. The 2008 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] surveyed 1,926 adults in the United States that self-identified as Lutheran. The study found that 30% believed that the Bible was the Word of God and was to be taken literally word for word. 40% held that the Bible was the Word of God, but was not literally true word for word or were unsure if it was literally true word for word. 23% said the Bible was written by men and not the Word of God. 7% did not know, were not sure, or had other positions.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Religious Landscape Survey: Religious Beliefs and Practices, Diverse and Politically Relevant. Washington D.C.: Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. June 2008. p. 127.

====Inspiration====
Although many Lutherans today hold less specific views of inspiration, historically, Lutherans affirm that the Bible does not merely contain the Word of God, but every word of it is, because of plenary, verbal inspiration, the direct, immediate word of God.&lt;ref&gt;

A correct translation of their writings is God's Word because it has the same meaning as the original Hebrew and Greek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engelder 1934 27&quot;/&gt; A mistranslation is not God's word, and no human authority can invest it with divine authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engelder 1934 27&quot;/&gt;

====Divine authority====
Historically, Lutherans maintain that Holy Scripture, the Word of God, carries the full authority of God. For confessional Lutherans, every single statement of the Bible calls for instant and unqualified acceptance.  For Lutherans that are more aligned with mainline Protestantism, a basic claim is made that the canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the inspired Word of God and the authoritative source and norm of its proclamation, faith, and life.  This allows for historical-critical methods for interpretation.

====Clarity====
Historically, Lutherans understand the Bible to present all doctrines and commands of the Christian faith [[Clarity of scripture|clearly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalm|19:8|50}}, {{bibleverse||Psalm|119:105|50}}, {{bibleverse||Psalm|119:130|50}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|3:15|50}}, {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|30:11|50}}, {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:19|31}}, {{bibleverse||Ephesians|3:3–4|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|8:31–32|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|4:3–4|31}}, {{bibleverse||John|8:43–47|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Peter|3:15–16|31}}, {{cite book |last=Engelder |first=Theodore E.W. |url=http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 |title=Popular Symbolics: The Doctrines of the Churches of Christendom and Of Other Religious Bodies Examined in the Light of Scripture |page=29 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1934}}, {{cite book |last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/bibliology.txt |title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |pages=11–12 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910 |isbn=0-524-04891-6 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060712193848/http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/bibliology.txt |archivedate=12 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; God's Word is freely accessible to every reader or hearer of ordinary intelligence, without requiring any special education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/bibliology.txt |title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=11 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910 |isbn=0-524-04891-6 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060712193848/http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/bibliology.txt |archivedate=12 July 2006}}, {{cite book |last=Engelder |first=Theodore E.W. |url=http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 |title=Popular Symbolics: The Doctrines of the Churches of Christendom and Of Other Religious Bodies Examined in the Light of Scripture |page=28 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, one must understand the language God's Word is presented in, and not be so preoccupied by contrary thoughts so as to prevent understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/bibliology.txt |title=Outlines Of Doctrinal Theology |page=11 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1910 |isbn=0-524-04891-6 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060712193848/http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/bibliology.txt |archivedate=12 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, no one needs to wait for any clergy, [[pope]], scholar, or [[ecumenical council]] to [[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation#The Second Wall: Authority to Interpret Scripture|explain the real meaning]] of any part of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Engelder |first=Theodore E.W. |url=http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 |title=Popular Symbolics: The Doctrines of the Churches of Christendom and Of Other Religious Bodies Examined in the Light of Scripture |page=28 |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1934}}

F. W. [http://lutherantheology.com/uploads/works/walther/LG/index.html The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel]. W. H. T. Dau, trans. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheran Confessions===
The ''[[Book of Concord]]'', published in 1580, contains ten documents which some Lutherans believe are faithful and authoritative explanations of Holy Scripture. Besides the three [[Ecumenical Creeds]], which date to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, the ''Book of Concord'' contains seven [[Creed|credal]] documents articulating Lutheran theology in the Reformation era.

The doctrinal positions of Lutheran churches are not uniform because the ''Book of Concord'' does not hold the same position in all Lutheran churches. For example, the [[State religion#Lutheran|state churches]] in Scandinavia consider only the ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' as a &quot;summary of the faith&quot; in addition to the three ecumenical Creeds.&lt;ref&gt;F.E. Mayer, The Religious Bodies of America. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1954, p. 184. For further information, see [http://www.wlsessays.net/node/491 The Formula of Concord in the History of Swedish Lutheranism] by Seth Erlandsson&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheran pastors, congregations, and church bodies in Germany and the Americas usually agree to teach in harmony with the entire &lt;cite&gt;[[Book of Concord|Lutheran Confessions]]&lt;/cite&gt;. Some Lutheran church bodies require this pledge to be unconditional because they believe the confessions correctly state what the Bible teaches. Others allow their congregations to do so &quot;insofar as&quot; the Confessions are in agreement with the Bible.

===Justification===
The key doctrine, or [[Formal and material principles of theology|material principle]], of Lutheranism is the doctrine of [[Justification (theology)#Lutheranism|justification]]. Lutherans believe that humans are saved from their [[Sin#Protestant views|sin]]s by [[Sola gratia|God's grace]] alone (''[[Sola Gratia]]''), through faith alone (''[[Sola Fide]]''). Lutherans believe that this grace is granted for the sake of Christ's merit alone (''[[Solus Christus]]''). Orthodox Lutheran theology holds that God made the world, including humanity, perfect, holy and sinless. However, [[Adam and Eve]] chose to disobey God, trusting in their own strength, knowledge, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Sponheim, &quot;The Origin of Sin,&quot; in &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;, Carl E. Braaten and Robert W. Jenson, eds.

Lutherans teach that sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly &quot;good,&quot; are [[Incurvatus in se|not capable]] of doing works that satisfy God's justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7:18 Rom. 7:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:7;&amp;version=9; 8:7] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%202:14;&amp;version=31; 1 Cor. 2:14], [[Martin Chemnitz]], Examination of the Council of Trent: Vol. I.

St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 43–44, Part X. &quot;Saving Grace&quot;, paragraph 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

To this end, &quot;God sent his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord, into the world to redeem and deliver us from the power of the devil, and to bring us to Himself, and to govern us as a King of righteousness, life, and salvation against sin, death, and an evil conscience,&quot; as the [[Luther's Large Catechism|Large Catechism]] explains.&lt;ref&gt;''Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church''. St. Louis: Concordia, 1921. [http://bookofconcord.org/lc-5-ourfather.php#para51 Large Catechism], The Lord's Prayer, The Second Petition, Par. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Lutherans teach that salvation is possible only because of the [[Theology of the Cross|grace of God made manifest]] in the birth, life, suffering, death, and resurrection, and continuing presence by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal.%203:13;&amp;version=31; Gal. 3:13], Engelder, T.E.W., &lt;cite&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics]&lt;/cite&gt;.

St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. p. 42, Part X. &quot;Saving Grace&quot;, paragraph 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Christ, because he was entirely obedient to the law with respect to both his human and divine natures, &quot;is a perfect satisfaction and reconciliation of the human race,&quot; as the Formula of Concord asserts, and proceeds to summarize:&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ig5PF6Tf07UC&amp;pg=PA572&amp;dq Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord, Article III, &quot;Concerning the Righteousness of Faith before God&quot;]. par. 57–58. trans. Kolb, R., Wengert, T., and Arand, C. Minneapolis: [[Augsburg Fortress]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Christ] submitted to the law for us, bore our sin, and in going to his Father performed complete and perfect obedience for us poor sinners, from his holy birth to his death. Thereby he covered all our disobedience, which is embedded in our nature and in its thoughts, words, and deeds, so that this disobedience is not reckoned to us as condemnation but is pardoned and forgiven by sheer grace, because of Christ alone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lutherans believe that individuals receive this gift of salvation through faith alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.com/augsburgconfession.html#article4 Augsburg Confession, Article 4, &quot;Of Justification&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Saving faith is the knowledge of,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|17:3|31}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|1:77|31}},{{bibleverse||Galatians|4:9|31}}, {{bibleverse||Philippians|3:8|31}}, and {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|2:4|31}} refer to faith in terms of knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; acceptance of,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|5:46|31}} refers to acceptance of the truth of Christ's teaching, while {{bibleverse||John|3:36|31}} notes the rejection of his teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; and trust&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|3:16,36|50}}, {{bibleverse||Galatians|2:16|31}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|4:20–25|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|1:12|31}} speak of trust, confidence, and belief in Christ. {{bibleverse||John|3:18|31}} notes belief in the name of Christ, and {{bibleverse||Mark|1:15}} notes belief in the gospel.&lt;/ref&gt; in the promise of the Gospel.&lt;ref name = &quot;Engelder&quot;&gt;Engelder, T.E.W., &lt;cite&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics]&lt;/cite&gt;.

===Trinity===
Lutherans are Trinitarian; they confess in the ''[[Nicean Creed]]:'' the version in Evangelical Lutheran Worship (2006) of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC) is the 1988 ecumenical (ELLC) version. But the Lutheran Service Book(2006) of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Lutheran Church–Canada (LCC) is that of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer with modernized spelling of the words &quot;catholic&quot; and &quot;apostolic&quot;, with changes in capitalization of these and other words, and with &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; in place of &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;. Lutherans reject the idea that the Father and the Son are merely faces of the same person, stating that both the Old Testament and the New Testament show them to be two distinct persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2063:8-9;&amp;version=50; Is. 63:8–9], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 158–160, section &quot;The Doctrine of God&quot;, part 5. &quot;The Holy Trinity Revealed in the Old Testament&quot;,[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%201:5%20;&amp;version=50; Heb. 1:5], see Engelder, T.E.W., &lt;cite&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics]. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 33–36, Part VI. &quot;The Trinity&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/ny4/djw/lutherantheology.filioque.html The Nicene Creed and the Filioque: A Lutheran Approach] by Rev. David Webber for more information&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]]. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one: the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.&quot;

===Two natures of Christ===
{{Main|Scholastic Lutheran Christology}}
Lutherans believe Jesus is the [[Christ]], the savior promised in the [[Old Testament]]. They believe he is both by nature God and by nature man [[Hypostatic union|in one person]], as they confess in Luther's ''[[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]]'' that he is &quot;true God begotten of the Father from eternity and also true man born of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.html#creed Luther's Small Catechism, The Apostles' Creed, Second Article],

[T]he Son of God, did assume the human nature in the womb of the [[blessed Virgin Mary]], so that there are two natures, the divine and the human, inseparably enjoined in one Person, one Christ, true God and true man, who was born of the Virgin Mary, truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, that He might reconcile the Father unto us, and be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.

[[File:ArticleXIOfConfession.JPG|thumb|A.C. Article IX: Of Confession&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Private Absolution ought to be retained in the churches, although in confession an enumeration of all sins is not necessary.&quot; [http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article11 Article XI: Of Confession]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Lutherans are not dogmatic about the number of the sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] XIII, 2: &quot;We believe we have the duty not to neglect any of the rites and ceremonies instituted in Scripture, whatever their number. We do not think it makes much difference if, for purposes of teaching, the enumeration varies, provided what is handed down in Scripture is preserved&quot; (cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., ''The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 211).&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Luther's initial statement in his Large Catechism some speak of only two sacraments,&lt;ref&gt;[[Luther's Large Catechism]] IV, 1: &quot;We have now finished the three chief parts of the common Christian doctrine. Besides these we have yet to speak of '''our two Sacraments''' instituted by Christ, of which also every Christian ought to have at least an ordinary, brief instruction, because without them there can be no Christian; although, alas! hitherto no instruction concerning them has been given&quot; (emphasis added; cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., ''The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 733).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baptism#Protestant Reformation|Baptism]] and Holy Communion, although later in the same work he calls Confession and [[Absolution#Lutheranism|Absolution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:23;&amp;version=47; John 20:23], and Engelder, T.E.W., &lt;cite&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics]. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. pp. 112–3, Part XXVI &quot;The Ministry&quot;, paragraph 156.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the third sacrament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Luther's Large Catechism]] IV, 74–75: &quot;And here you see that Baptism, both in its power and signification, comprehends also the '''third Sacrament, which has been called repentance''', as it is really nothing else than Baptism&quot; (emphasis added; cf. Theodore G. Tappert, trans. and ed., ''The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 751).&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of sacrament in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'' lists Absolution as one of them.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'' XIII, 3, 4: &quot;If we define the sacraments as rites, which have the command of God and to which the promise of grace has been added, it is easy to determine what the sacraments are, properly speaking. For humanly instituted rites are not sacraments, properly speaking, because human beings do not have the authority to promise grace. Therefore signs instituted without the command of God are not sure signs of grace, even though they perhaps serve to teach or admonish the common folk. Therefore, the sacraments are actually baptism, the Lord's Supper, and absolution (the sacrament of repentance)&quot; (cf. Tappert, 211). [http://www.bookofconcord.com/augsburgdefense/12_sacraments.html Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article 13, Of the Number and Use of the Sacraments]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Absolution is a return to the forgiveness given in baptism, strictly speaking there are only two sacraments. [[Confession in the Lutheran Church|Confession]] is not practiced among Lutherans as often as in the Roman Church. Rather, it is expected before receiving the Eucharist for the [[First Communion|first]] time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'', article 24, paragraph 1. Retrieved 16 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some churches also allow for individual absolution on Saturdays before the Eucharistic service. A general absolution (known as the [[Penitential Rite#Usage in Lutheranism|Penitential Rite]]) is proclaimed in the Eucharistic liturgy.  Lutherans do not emphasize &quot;penance&quot; as a retribution of sin but rather the proclamation of God's forgiveness by the &quot;called and ordained&quot; minister of the Holy Gospel.

====Baptism====

Because it is faith alone that receives these divine gifts, Lutherans confess that baptism &quot;works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther |chapter=The Sacrament of Holy Baptism |chapterurl=http://www.bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.html#baptism |accessdate=24 February 2009 |title=[[Luther's Small Catechism]] |year=2009 |origyear=1529 |isbn=0-89279-043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding fast to the Scripture cited in 1 Peter 3:21 &quot;and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God.

====Eucharist====
{{Main|Eucharist in the Lutheran Church}}
[[File:RepentanceisContrition&amp;faith.jpg|thumb|A.C. Article XII: Of Repentance.]]
Lutherans hold that within the [[Eucharist#Lutherans: Sacramental union: &quot;in, with, and under the forms of bread and wine&quot;|Eucharist]], also referred to as the Sacrament of the Altar, the Mass, or the Lord's Supper, the true body and blood of Christ are truly present &quot;in, with, and under the forms&quot; of the consecrated [[Sacramental bread|bread]] and wine for all those who eat and drink it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%2010:16;&amp;version=50; 1 Cor. 10:16], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%2011:20,%2027;&amp;version=47; 11:20, 27], Engelder, T.E.W., &lt;cite&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics]. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934. p. 95, Part XXIV. &quot;The Lord's Supper&quot;, paragraph 131.&lt;/ref&gt; a doctrine that the ''[[Formula of Concord]]'' calls the [[sacramental union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-sd/supper.html The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord, Article 8, The Holy Supper]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion===
In Lutheranism, conversion or regeneration in the strict sense of the term is the work of divine grace and power by which man, born of the flesh, and [[Total depravity|void of all power]] to think, to will, or to do any good thing, and dead in sin is, through the gospel and holy baptism, taken from a state of sin and [[spiritual death]] under God's wrath into a state of spiritual life of faith and grace, rendered able to will and to do what is spiritually good and, especially, made to trust in the benefits of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Augustus Lawrence Graebner, [http://books.google.com/books?id=93ErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;vq Lutheran Cyclopedia] p. 136, &quot;Conversion&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

During conversion, one is moved from impenitence to repentance. The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' divides repentance into two parts: &quot;One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the [[Law and Gospel#Book of Concord|knowledge of sin]]; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12 Augsburg Confession, Article XII: Of Repentance]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predestination===
Lutherans adhere to [[monergism|divine monergism]], the teaching that salvation is by God's act alone, and therefore reject the idea that humans in their fallen state have a [[Free will in theology|free will]] concerning spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%202:14;&amp;version=50; 1 Cor. 2:14], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%2012:3;&amp;version=31; 12:3], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.%208:7;&amp;version=31; Rom. 8:7], [[Martin Chemnitz]], Examination of the Council of Trent: Vol. I.

According to Lutheranism, the central final hope of the Christian is &quot;the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting&quot; as confessed in the ''[[Apostles' Creed]]'' rather than predestination. Lutherans disagree with those who make predestination - rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection - the source of salvation. Unlike [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim.%202:4;&amp;version=31; 1 Tim. 2:4], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet.%203:9;&amp;version=31; 2 Pet. 3:9], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2013:9;&amp;version=9; Hos. 13:9], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;.

===Good works===
[[File:Die-Auferstahung-Christi 15.jpg|thumb|&quot;Even though I am a sinner and deserving of death and hell, this shall nonetheless be my consolation and my victory that my Lord Jesus lives and has risen so that He, in the end, might rescue me from sin, death, and hell.&quot;—'''Luther'''&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Scaer, David.

[http://www.bookofconcord.com/augsburgconfession.html#article20 Augsburg Confession, Article 20, Of Good Works]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lutherans do not believe that good works are a factor in obtaining salvation; they believe that we are saved by the grace of God - based on the merit of Christ in his suffering and death - and faith in the Triune God. Good works are the natural result of faith, not the cause of salvation.

Lutherans place great emphasis on a [[liturgy|liturgical]] approach to worship services;&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister, E. ''Christianity: An Introduction''. 2nd ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 2006. p.272.&lt;/ref&gt; although there are substantial non-liturgical minorities, for example, the [[Haugean]] Lutherans from [[Norway]]. Martin Luther was a great fan of [[Music]], and this is why it forms a large part of Lutheran services. In particular, Luther was a great fan of the composers [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Ludwig Senfl]] and wanted singing in the church to move away from the ''ars perfecta'' (Catholic Sacred Music of the late Renaissance) and towards singing as a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community).&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard. ''The Oxford History of Western Music - Volume I (Music in the Ealiest Notations to the sixteenth century, '' p. 753-8 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheran [[hymn]]s are sometimes known as [[chorale]]s. Lutheran hymnody is well known for its doctrinal, [[didactic]], and musical richness. Most Lutheran churches are active musically with choirs, handbell choirs, children's choirs, and occasionally [[carillon]] groups that ring bells in a [[bell tower]]. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], a devout Lutheran, composed music for the Lutheran church.

Lutherans also preserve a liturgical approach to the celebration of the Mass (or the Holy Eucharist/Communion), emphasizing the sacrament as the central act of Christian worship. Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called [[Real Presence]] or [[sacramental union]] and is different from [[consubstantiation]] and [[transubstantiation]]. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or [[Memorialism|memorial]]. They confess in the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'':
::&quot;...we do not abolish the [[Mass (liturgy)#Lutheranism|Mass]] but religiously keep and defend it. Among us the Mass is celebrated every Lord's Day and on other festivals, when the Sacrament is made available to those who wish to partake of it, after they have been examined and absolved. We also keep traditional liturgical forms, such as the order of readings, prayers, [[Vestment#Used by Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, and some Protestants|vestments]], and other similar things.&quot; (''Apology of the Augsburg Confession'', Article XXIV.1)

Besides the Holy Communion (Divine Service), congregations also hold offices, which are worship services without communion. They may include [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]], [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]], [[Compline]], and [[Easter Vigil#Lutheran churches|Easter Vigil]]. Private or family offices include the Morning and Evening Prayers from Luther's ''Small Catechism''.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;See [http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.php#prayers Luther's Small Catechism, Daily Prayers]&lt;/ref&gt; Meals are blessed with the ''[[Common table prayer|Common Table Prayer]]'', {{bibleverse||Psalm|145:15–16|31}}, or other prayers, and after eating the Lord is thanked, for example, with {{bibleverse||Psalm|136:1|9}}.&lt;ref name=daily/&gt; In addition, Lutherans use devotional books, from small [[daily devotional]]s, for example, ''[[Portals of Prayer]]'', to large [[breviary|breviaries]], including the ''[[Evangelisch-Lutherische Gebetsbruderschaft|Breviarium Lipsiensae]]'' and ''Treasury of Daily Prayer''.

In the 1970s, many Lutheran churches began holding [[contemporary worship]] services for the purpose of evangelistic outreach. These services were in a variety of styles, depending on the preferences of the congregation. Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred [[contemporary worship music]]. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship. Outreach is no longer given as the primary motivation; rather this form of worship is seen as more in keeping with the desires of individual congregations.&lt;ref&gt;Principle examples of this in the ELCA include [http://www.familyofgod.us Family of God, Cape Coral FL.], [http://www.the-well.org/ The Well, Charlotte NC], [http://www.hosannalc.org Hosanna! of Lakeville, Minnesota], and [http://www.apostleschurch.org/home.php Church of the Apostles, Seattle WA.].&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland, Lutherans have experimented with the St Thomas Mass or [[Metal Mass]] in which traditional hymns are adapted to heavy metal. The Lutheran World Federation, in its Nairobi Statement on Worship and Culture, recommended every effort be made to bring church services into a more sensitive position with regard to cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A given culture's values and patterns, insofar as they are consonant with the values of the Gospel, can be used to express the meaning and purpose of Christian worship. Contextualization is a necessary task for the Church's mission in the world, so that the Gospel can be ever more deeply rooted in diverse local cultures.&quot;
[http://www.worship.ca/docs/lwf_ns.html/ The Nairobe Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutheran churches use hymnals as well as electronic projection media. In 2006, both the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod, in cooperation with certain foreign English speaking church bodies within their respective fellowships, released new hymnals: [[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]] (ELCA) and [[Lutheran Service Book]] (LCMS). Along with these, the most widely used among English speaking congregations include: ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary]]'' (1996, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]]), ''The [[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' (1978, [[Lutheran Council in the United States of America|LC-USA]]), ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'' (1982, [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod|LCMS]]), ''Christian Worship'' (1993, [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]]), and ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'' (1941, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America|Synodical Conference]]). In the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], the official hymnal is the ''Lutheran Hymnal with Supplement'' of 1986, which includes a supplement to the ''Lutheran Hymnal'' of 1973, itself a replacement for the ''Australian Lutheran Hymn Book'' of 1921. Prior to this time, the two Lutheran church bodies in Australia ([[History of the Lutheran Church of Australia#Merge of UELCA and ELCA into the Lutheran Church of Australia|which merged in 1966]]) used a bewildering variety of hymnals, usually in the German language.

===Missions===
[[File:Narsapurlutheran.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Christ Lutheran Church, Narsapur]], India]]
Sizable Lutheran missions arose for the first time during the 19th century. Early missionary attempts during the century after the Reformation did not succeed. However, European traders brought Lutheranism to Africa beginning in the 17th century as they settled along the coasts. During the first half of the 19th century, missionary activity in Africa expanded, including preaching by missionaries, translation of the Bible, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Piepkorn, A.C. ''Profiles in Belief: Volume II, Protestant Denominations''. San Francisco: [[Harper and Row]], 1978. P. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutheranism came to India beginning with the work of [[Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg]], where a community totaling several thousand developed, complete with their own translation of the Bible, catechism, their own hymnal, and system of Lutheran schools. In the 1840s, this church experienced a revival through the work of the Leipzig Mission, including [[Karl Graul]].&lt;ref&gt;Piepkorn, A.C. , ''Profiles in Belief: Volume II, Protestant Denominations''. San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1978. P. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; After German missionaries were expelled in 1914, Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous, yet preserved their Lutheran character. In recent years India has relaxed its anti-religious conversion laws, allowing a resurgence in missionary work.

In Latin America, missions began to serve European immigrants of Lutheran background, both those who spoke German and those who no longer did. These churches in turn began to evangelize those in their areas who were not of European background, including indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Piepkorn, A.C. , ''Profiles in Belief: Volume II, Protestant Denominations''. San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1978. P. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan. Although work began slowly and a major setback occurred during the hardships of WWII.&lt;ref&gt;Piepkorn, A.C. , ''Profiles in Belief: Volume II, Protestant Denominations''. San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1978. P. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheranism there has survived and become self-sustaining.&lt;ref name=P34&gt;Piepkorn, A.C., ''Profiles in Belief: Volume II, Protestant Denominations''. San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1978. P. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; After missionaries to China, including those of the [[Lutheran Church of China]],  were expelled, they began ministry in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the latter which became a center of Lutheranism in Asia.&lt;ref name=P34/&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea#History|Lutheran Mission in New Guinea]], though founded only in 1953, became the largest Lutheran mission in the world in only several decades. Through the work of native lay evangelists, many tribes of diverse languages were reached with the Gospel.&lt;ref name=P34/&gt;

===Education===
[[File:HK Pui Tak Street Faith Lutheran School 1 a.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Faith Lutheran School in [[Hong Kong]].]]
[[Catechism]] is considered basic in most Lutheran churches. Almost all maintain [[Sunday School]]s, and some host or maintain [[Lutheran school]]s, at the preschool, elementary, middle, high school, [[Folk high school#Norway|folk high school]], or university level. Lifelong study of the catechism is intended for all ages so that the abuses of the pre-Reformation Church will not recur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.com/largecatechism/2_preface.html Preface] to Luther's [[Luther's Large Catechism|Large]] and [http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.html#preface preface] to Luther's ''[[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheran schools have always been a core aspect of Lutheran mission work, starting with Bartholomew Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Putschasu, who began work in India in 1706.&lt;ref name=ENC3&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin, and Bromiley, Geoffrey William, ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 2003. p.367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastors almost always have substantial theological educations, including [[Koine Greek|Greek]] and [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] so that they can refer to the Christian scriptures in the original language. Pastors usually teach in the common language of the local congregation. In the U.S., some congregations and synods historically taught in [[German language|German]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], or [[Swedish language|Swedish]], but retention of immigrant languages has been in significant decline since the early and middle 20th century.

===Church fellowship===
Lutherans were divided about the issue of church fellowship for the first thirty years after Luther's death. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] and his [[Philippists|Philippist]] party felt that Christians of different beliefs should join in union with each other without completely agreeing on doctrine. Against them stood the [[Gnesio-Lutherans]], led by [[Matthias Flacius]] and the faculty at [[University of Jena|Jena]]. They condemned the Philippist position for [[indifferentism]], describing it as a &quot;unionistic compromise&quot; of precious Reformation theology. Instead, they held that genuine unity between Christians and real theological peace was only possible with an honest agreement about every subject of doctrinal controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Klug, Eugene F. and Stahlke, Otto F. ''Getting into the Formula of Concord''. St. Louis: Concordia, 1977. p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Das Vaterunser 2 Lucas Cranach d A.jpg|thumb|left|upright| ''Hallowed be Thy Name'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] illustrates a Lutheran pastor preaching Christ crucified.]]
Complete agreement finally came about in 1577, after the death of both Melanchthon and Flacius, when a new generation of theologians resolved the doctrinal controversies on the basis of Scripture in the ''[[Formula of Concord]]'' of 1577.&lt;ref&gt;Klug, Eugene F. and Stahlke, Otto F. ''Getting into the Formula of Concord''. St. Louis: Concordia. p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Although they decried the visible division of Christians on earth, [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|orthodox Lutherans]] avoided [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] fellowship with other churches, believing that Christians should not, for example, join together for the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] or exchange [[pastor]]s if they do not completely agree about what the Bible teaches. In the 17th century, [[Georgius Calixtus]] began a rebellion against this practice, sparking the [[Syncretism#Syncretistic Controversy|Syncretistic Controversy]] with [[Abraham Calovius]] as his main opponent.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://www.blts.edu/essays/schmelingTR/Consensus%20Repetitus.pdf Lutheran Orthodoxy Under Fire: An Exploratory Study of the Syncretistic Controversy And The Consensus Repetitus Fidei Vere Lutheranae]'' and ''[http://www.blts.edu/essays/schmelingTR/Calov.pdf Strenuus Christi Athleta Abraham Calov (1612–1686): Sainted Doctor And Defender of the Church]'', both by Timothy R. Schmeling&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, there was some ecumenical interest between the [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of England]]. [[John Robinson (1650-1723)|John Robinson]], Bishop of London, planned for a union of the English and Swedish churches in 1718. The plan failed because most Swedish bishops rejected the Calvinism of the Church of England, although [[Jesper Swedberg|Swedberg]]  and [[Johannes Gezelius the younger|Gezelius]], bishops of Skara, Sweden and Turku, Finland, were in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}}[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/ArticlePages/200508/16/20050816074719_svkhjs928/20050816074719_svkhjs928.dbp.asp Svenskakyrkan.se]&lt;/ref&gt; With the encouragement of Swedberg, church fellowship was established between [[Swedish colonization of the Americas|Swedish Lutherans]] and Anglicans in the [[Middle Colonies]]. Over the course of the 1700s and the early 1800s, Swedish Lutherans were absorbed into Anglican churches, with the last original Swedish congregation completing merger into the Episcopalians in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Bente, Friedrich, 1858–1930. [http://books.google.com/books?id=A4oSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 American Lutheranism Volume 1: Early History of American Lutheranism]: Lutheran Swedes in Delaware. St. Louis: Concordia, 1919, p.13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Samuel Simon Schmucker]] attempted to lead the [[General Synod (Lutheran)|Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States]] toward unification with other American Protestants. His attempt to get the synod to reject the ''Augsburg Confession'' in favor of his compromising ''Definite Platform'' failed. Instead, it sparked a [[Neo-Lutheranism|Neo-Lutheran]] revival, prompting many to form the [[General Council (Lutheran)|General Council]], including [[Charles Porterfield Krauth]]. Their alternative approach was “Lutheran pulpits are for Lutheran ministers only, and Lutheran altars are for Lutheran communicants only.”

These elections resulted in the [[Church union|merger]] of the German state churches.]][[File:Jp2lutheran 2.jpg|thumb|[[Pope John Paul II]] preaching in the only Lutheran church in Rome]].}}
Beginning in 1867, confessional and liberal minded Lutherans in Germany joined together to form the ''Common Evangelical Lutheran Conference'' against the ever looming prospect of a state-mandated union with the Reformed.&lt;ref name=Gritsch185&gt;Gritsch, Eric W. [http://books.google.com/books?id=fIhb4-iBk6EC&amp;pg=PA185 A History of Lutheranism]. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2002. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they failed to reach a consensus among themselves on how much agreement in doctrine is necessary for church union.&lt;ref name=Gritsch184/&gt; Eventually, the fascist [[German Christians]] movement pushed the final national merger of Lutheran, [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Union]], and Reformed churches into a single [[Protestant Reich Church|Reich Church]], now the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], in 1933.

Presently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations. Some Lutherans assert that everyone must share the &quot;whole counsel of God&quot; ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:27;&amp;version=50; Acts 20:27]) in complete unity ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:10;&amp;version=50; 1 Cor. 1:10])&lt;ref&gt;For a historical example, see Robert Preus, &lt;cite&gt;To Join or Not To Join&lt;/cite&gt;. [[North Dakota District (LCMS)|North Dakota District of The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod]], 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed [[closed communion|closed (or close) communion]]. On the other hand, other Lutherans practice varying degrees of [[open communion]] and allow preachers from other Christian denominations in their pulpits.

While not an issue in the majority of Lutheran church bodies, some of them forbid membership in [[Freemasonry]]. Partly, this is because the lodge is viewed as spreading [[Unitarianism]], as the Brief Statement of the [[Missouri Synod]] reads, &quot;Hence we warn against Unitarianism, which in our country has to a great extent impenetrated the sects and is being spread particularly also through the influence of the lodges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=564 Brief Statement was adopted as Missouri Synod doctrine in 1932, and from time to time has been adopted by other Lutherans]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1958 report from the publishing house of the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] states that, &quot;Masonry is guilty of idolatry. Its worship and prayers are idol worship. The Masons may not with their hands have made an idol out of gold, silver, wood or stone, but they created one with their own mind and reason out of purely human thoughts and ideas. The latter is an idol no less than the former.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Lutheran Church, ''The Northwestern Lutheran'', page 281, 31 August 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{stack|float=left|[[File:Communion3.jpg|138px|thumb|left|LCMS pastor wearing a [[chasuble]] during communion]]&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ELCA Eucharistic recption.jpg|138px|thumb|left|ELCA pastor wearing an [[alb]] during communion]] --&gt;}}
The largest organizations of Lutheran churches around the world are the [[Lutheran World Federation]], the [[International Lutheran Council]], and the [[Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference]]. These organizations together include the great majority of Lutheran denominations around the globe. The Lutheran World Federation supports the activities of [[Lutheran World Relief]], a relief and development agency active in more than 50 countries. The [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod|LCMS]] and the [[Lutheran Church–Canada|LCC]] are members of  the International Lutheran Council (ILC). The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|WELS]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod|ELS]] are members of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference.
Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the [[Church of the Lutheran Brethren]], are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.

The Lutheran World Federation (LWF)-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. For that reason, a number of doctrinally diverse LWF denominations, now largely separated from state control, are declaring fellowship and joint statements of agreement with other Lutheran and non-Lutheran Christian denominations.

The Lutheran World Federation and the Missouri Synod engaged in a series of [[Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue|official dialogue]]s with the Roman Catholic Church since shortly after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'' (''JDDJ''), that stated that the LWF and the Roman Catholic both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Roman Catholic [[anathema]]s formerly applying to the LWF member churches. The Missouri Synod has participated in most of these talks, though not the one which produced the ''Joint Declaration'' and to which they were not invited. While some Lutheran theologians saw the ''Joint Declaration'' as a sign that the Roman Catholics were essentially adopting the Lutheran position, other Lutheran theologians disagreed, claiming that, considering the public documentation of the Roman Catholic position, this assertion does not hold up.

By contrast, the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference and International Lutheran Council as well as some unaffiliated denominations such as the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]] (CLC) maintain that the orthodox confessional Lutheran churches are the only churches with completely correct doctrine. They teach that while other Christian churches teach partially orthodox doctrine and have true Christians as members, the doctrines of those churches contain significant errors. More conservative Lutherans strive to maintain historical distinctiveness while emphasizing doctrinal purity alongside Gospel-motivated outreach. They claim that LWF Lutherans are practicing ''&quot;fake ecumenism&quot;'' by desiring church fellowship outside of actual unity of teaching.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.mtio.com/articles/aissar39.htm Ecumenism: Facts and Illusions] by Kurt E. Marquart for a short explanation of the modern ecumenism movement from a Confessional Lutheran perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not an &quot;ecumenical&quot; movement in the formal sense, in the 1990s influences from the [[megachurch]]es of American evangelicalism have become somewhat common. Many of the largest Lutheran congregations in the United States have been heavily influenced by these &quot;progressive Evangelicals.&quot; These influences are sharply criticized by some Lutherans as being foreign to orthodox Lutheran beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;See scholarly articles on the [http://www.wlsessays.net/subject/C/Church+Growth+Movement] from the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary Library and [http://www.ctsfw.edu/library/files/pb/818 Implications of the Church Growth Movement for Lutherans: Possibilities and Concerns] by Harold L. Senkbeil as examples of criticism from confessional Lutherans&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Porvoo Communion]] is a communion of episcopally led Lutheran and Anglican churches in Europe. Beside its membership in the Porvoo Communion, Church of Sweden also has declared full communion with the [[Philippine Independent Church]] and the [[United Methodist Church]].

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) has been involved in ecumenical dialogues with several denominations. Recently, the ELCA has declared [[Full communion#Other churches|full communion]] with several American Churches: the [[American Provinces of the Moravian Church|Moravian Church]], the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the [[Reformed Church in America]], the [[United Methodist Church]], and the [[United Church of Christ]].

Today, millions belong to Lutheran churches, which are present on all populated continents.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Lutheran World Federation, [http://www.lutheranworld.org/ &quot;Slight Increase Pushes LWF Global Membership to 66.2 Million&quot;], &lt;cite&gt;The Lutheran World Federation&lt;/cite&gt;, http://www.lutheranworld.org/ (accessed 18 May 2006).&lt;/span&gt; However, some Lutherans disagree with the way the Lutheran World Federation arrives at this number, as millions of them actually come from bodies that are largely Reformed, but include some Lutherans.

Lutheranism is the largest religious group in [[Denmark]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Namibia]], and [[the Dakotas]]. Lutheranism is also the dominant form of Christianity in the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation|White Mountain]] and [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos]] Apache nations.

Although Namibia is the only country outside Europe to have a Lutheran majority, there are sizable Lutheran bodies in other African countries. In the following African countries, the total number of Lutherans exceeds 100,000: [[Nigeria]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Cameroon]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Madagascar]]. In addition, the following nations also have sizable Lutheran populations: [[the Netherlands]] (within the [[Protestant Church of the Netherlands]]), [[Canada]], [[the United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[the Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[Brazil]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]], especially in the heavily [[German American|German]] and [[Scandinavian Americans|Scandinavian]] [[Upper Midwest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/religion/lutheran.gif Lutherans as a Percentage of All Residents, 2000] (Map by county).
