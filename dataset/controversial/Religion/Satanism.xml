[[File:Pentagram4.svg|thumb|right|The downward-pointing [[pentagram]] is often used to represent Satanism.]]
'''''Satanism''''' is a broad term referring to a group of [[Western religion]]s comprising diverse [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] beliefs. Their shared features include symbolic association with, or admiration for the character of, [[Satan]], or similar rebellious, [[Prometheus|promethean]], and, in their view, liberating figures.

[[Image:GustaveDoreParadiseLostSatanProfile.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Satan in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', as illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
Particularly after the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]], some works, such as ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', were taken up by [[Romanticism|Romantics]] and described as presenting the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing a [[crisis of faith]], [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. Those works actually featuring Satan as a heroic character are fewer in number, but do exist; [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[Mark Twain]] (cf. ''[[Letters from the Earth]]'') included such characterizations in their works long before religious Satanists took up the pen. From then on, Satan and Satanism started to gain a new meaning outside of Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;crsi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |author= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= Introduction: Embracing Satan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the public practice of Satanism began in 1966 with the founding of the atheistic [[Church of Satan]], some historical precedents exist: a group called the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] was founded in [[Ohio]] by Herbert Arthur Sloane in 1948. Inspired by [[Gnosticism]] and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Wicca]], the coven venerated Satan as both a [[horned god]] and [[ophites|ophite]] [[messiah]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[File:Peter's Cross.svg|thumb|right|125px|[[Cross of St. Peter|Inverted cross]], often seen as a symbol of Satanism.]]
Satanist groups that appeared after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are [[Theistic Satanism]] and [[#Atheistic/Deistic Satanism|Atheistic Satanism]]. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural [[deity]]. In contrast, Atheistic Satanists&lt;ref name = &quot;Flowers-1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Flowers |first= Stephen |authorlink= Stephen Flowers |title= Lords of the Left-hand Path |publisher= Runa-Raven Press |year= 1997 |isbn= 1-885972-08-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider themselves [[atheism|atheists]], [[agnosticism|agnostics]], [[ignoticism|ignostics]] or [[apatheism|apatheists]] and regard Satan as merely symbolic of certain human traits. This categorization of Satanism (which could be categorized in other ways, for example &quot;Traditional&quot; versus &quot;Modern&quot;), is not necessarily adopted by Satanists themselves, who usually do not specify which type of Satanism they adhere to.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Some Satanists believe in a god in the sense of a [[Primum movens|Prime Mover]] but, like Atheistic Satanists, do not worship it, due to the [[deism|deist]] belief that a god plays no part in mortal lives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Despite heavy criticism from other religious groups, there are signs that Satanistic beliefs have become more socially tolerated. Satanism is now allowed in the [[British Royal Navy|Royal Navy]] of the [[British Armed Forces]], despite much opposition from Christians,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Helen.

''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/3948329.stm Navy approves first ever Satanist] ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2005, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] debated over protecting the religious rights of prison inmates after a lawsuit challenging the issue was filed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/politics/22religion.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=|title=Inmates Who Follow Satanism and Wicca Find Unlikely Ally|author=Linda Greenhouse|publisher=New York Times|date=March 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0321/p03s02-usju.html|title=Before high court: law that allows for religious rights|publisher=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Satanism is mainly an American phenomenon, the ideas spreading with the effects of globalization and the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;crsi&quot; /&gt; The Internet promotes awareness of other Satanists, and is also the main battleground for the definitions of Satanism today.&lt;ref name=&quot;crsi&quot; /&gt; Satanism started to reach [[Eastern Europe]] in the 1990s, in time with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], and most noticeably in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]], predominantly Roman Catholic countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs8&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Alisauskiene |first= Milda |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher= Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 0-7546-5286-6 |editor= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= The Peculiarities of Lithuanian Satanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Satanism stalks Poland |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/778438.stm |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date= 2000-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satanism developed in the context of the Christian faith, as an ideological backlash to certain tenets promoted in Christianity. The character of Satan revered by Satanists, therefore, is mainly regarded as the prototypical anti-Christian figure. There have been some Satanists, however, who have shown reverence for the similar, albeit differently-characterized [[Devil (Islam)|Islamic concept of Satan]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: شيطان ''Shayṭān''), also known as Iblis (Arabic: إبليس‎ ''ʾIblīs'') although this is much more uncommon as Satanist philosophy has primarily flourished in the [[Occident]], and has likely not reached any Muslim-majority countries. As he is an antagonist in all of the major [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]], Satan is also mentioned in certain Jewish literature, although he is treated more as a nuisance than the primary enemy of God in Judaism.

== Accusations of Satanism ==
&lt;!-- Groups or individuals alleged to have practiced Satanism before the appearance of modern Satanism in the 1960s --&gt;
Historically, some people or groups have been specifically described as worshiping Satan or the Devil, or of being devoted to the work of Satan. The widespread preponderance of these groups in European cultures is in part connected with the importance and meaning of Satan within Christianity.

* [[Pagan]]s celebrating [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Athena]], [[Odin]], [[Perkunas]] or other pagan deities were often claimed by the [[Catholic Church]] to be worshiping the Devil and his minions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;&gt;Robbins, Rossell Hope, ''The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology'', 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] groups have been regarded as Satanic, with its prominent details implying Lucifer, or the serpent, as being a true god or prophet that liberated Adam and Eve while the god of the Old Testament is regarded as a [[demiurge]]. [[Hegemonius]] accused [[Mani]], founder of [[Manicheanism]], of being Satanic when Mani said that [[Jehovah]] is &quot;the devil god which created the world&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mani1&quot;&gt;[http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/m/manichaenism.html ''Manichaeism''] by Alan G.

* The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;/&gt;
* [[Gilles de Rais]] (15th century, France) was a French nobleman who was tried and executed for the murders of hundreds of children in quasi-Satanic rituals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;/&gt;
* [[Johann Georg Faust]]. (16th century, Germany)&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;/&gt; Many instructions, in German and in Latin, for making a [[deal with the Devil|pact with the Devil]] were attributed to him. These were collected and published in Germany in a few of the volumes of ''[[Das Kloster]]'' (1845–1849).
* [[Urbain Grandier]] (17th century, France). Although set up by the Catholic Church, a very famous document, in Latin, of a pact with the Devil he allegedly wrote has been preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbins&quot;/&gt;
* People involved in the [[Poison affair]], such as [[Catherine Deshayes]] and [[Etienne Guibourg]] (17th century, France). The documentation from their trial is the principal Medieval source for information on the [[Black Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;Extensively described in: Zacharias, Gerhard, ''Der dunkle Gott: Satanskult und Schwarze Messe'', München (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original sources: Ravaisson, François ''Archives de la Bastille'' (Paris, 1866-1884, volumes IV, V, VI, VII)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Marquis de Sade]] (18th century, France), described by [[Iwan Bloch]] as being a fanatic Satanist.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Iwan Bloch, ''Marquis de Sade: His Life and Work'', 1899: ''&quot;The Marquis de Sade gave evidence in his novels of being a fanatic Satanist.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; His works graphically described [[blasphemy]] against the Catholic Church, such as an [[orgy]] resembling a Black Mass conducted by [[Pope Pius VI#Pope Pius VI in fiction|Pope Pius VI]] in the [[Holy See|Vatican]] (in his novel ''[[Juliette (novel)|Juliette]]'').
* In 1865, the anti-Vatican [[Italian people|Italian]] poet [[Giosuè Carducci]], published his poem ''Inno a Satana'' (&quot;Hymn to Satan&quot;), praising Satan as the god of reason and expressing hatred towards Christianity.
* Many adherents of the [[Decadent movement]], such as the [[Polish people|Polish]] author [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]], the [[Belgian people|Belgian]] artist [[Félicien Rops]], and the [[French people|French]] poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] either called themselves Satanists, or created overtly Satanist artwork and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Jullian|Jullian, Philippe]], ''Esthétes et Magiciens'', 1969; ''Dreamers of Decadence'', 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some French movements widely described as being Satanist by French writers of the time (Late 19th to early 20th centuries). The most well-known description available in [[English language|English]] is the 1891 novel ''[[Là-Bas]]'' by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]. However, there were numerous other well-known personalities in France that were related to the circles Huysmans describes, such as [[Joseph-Antoine Boullan]], [[Stanislas de Guaita]], [[Henri Antoine Jules-Bois]], and [[Joséphin Péladan]], who either wrote about Satanism in France, or were accused of being Satanists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Antoine Jules-Bois|Bois, Jules]], ''Le Satanisme et la Magie - avec une étude de J.-K.

* At least two Satanic (or &quot;Luciferian&quot;) sects existed in France in the 1930s. One was led by Maria de Naglowska, and had rituals dedicated to Satan and Lucifer.&lt;ref&gt;Medway, Gareth (2001). ''Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism''. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Another, led by a former Catholic [[priest]], celebrated an inversion of the [[Latin Mass]] (a &quot;Luciferian Mass&quot;), which included the phrase &quot;''In nomine Domini Dei nostri Satanae Luciferi Excelsi''&quot; (a phrase that re-appeared 30 years later in Anton LaVey's ''Satanic Bible'').&lt;ref&gt;''Messe Luciférienne'', in Pierre Geyraud, ''Les Petites Églises de Paris'', 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
*The [[Yazidi]]s, a minority religion of the [[Middle East]] who worship [[Melek Taus]], are often referred to as [[Devil (Islam)|Satan]] worshipers by some [[Islam]]ic sectors.&lt;ref&gt;“The Devil Worshipers of the Middle East : Their Beliefs &amp; Sacred Books” Holmes Pub Group LLC (December 1993) ISBN 1-55818-231-4 ISBN 978-1-55818-231-8&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mandaeism]]. A branch of Gnosticism generally not referred by the Islamic sectors as Satanic, but in fact a probable example of [[Sabians]] as mentioned in the Quran. As a gnostic sect, it shares principles regarded as Satanic in the Muslim world with Yazidism.

== Atheistic/Deistic Satanism ==
=== LaVeyan Satanism ===
{{Main|LaVeyan Satanism}}
LaVeyan Satanism is a philosophy (not considered a religion by many of its followers) founded in 1966 by [[Anton Szandor LaVey]]. Its teachings are based on [[individualism]], [[hedonism|self-indulgence]], and &quot;[[eye for an eye]]&quot; morality. Unlike Theistic Satanists, LaVeyan Satanists are atheists who regard Satan as a symbol of man's [[human nature|inherent nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaVey |first=Anton |authorlink=Anton LaVey |title= The Satanic Bible |year=1969 |publisher=Avon |page=40}}: &quot;It is a common misconception that the Satanist does not believe in God...To the Satanist, &quot;God&quot; - by whatever name he is called, or by no name at all - is seen as a balancing factor...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[religioustolerance.org]], LaVeyan Satanism is a &quot;small religious group that is unrelated to any other faith, and whose members feel free to satisfy their urges responsibly, exhibit kindness to their friends, and attack their enemies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanis2.htm Satanism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its beliefs were first detailed in ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' and it is overseen by the [[Church of Satan]].

=== Symbolic Satanism ===
The Symbolic satanist views Satan as a fictional, mental/mythic [[archetype]], and admire the character as the &quot;Adversary&quot; or the &quot;Light-bringer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A'al, Jashan.

== Theistic Satanism ==

{{Main|Theistic Satanism}}

Theistic Satanism (also known as  Traditional Satanism, Spiritual Satanism or [[Devil]] Worship) is a form of Satanism with the primary belief that Satan is an actual [[deity]] or force to revere or worship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite book | last=Partridge | first=Christopher Hugh | year=2004 | title=The Re-enchantment of the West |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g05THJPH5xUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Re-enchantment+of+the+West&amp;lr=&amp;sig=BmuWhU0n3TzA3fd4NfIBDPuCFjo#PPP1,M1 | accessdate=2008-05-12 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theisticsatanism.com/rituals/prayers.html Prayers to Satan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics of Theistic Satanism may include a belief in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], which is manipulated through [[ritual]], although that is not a defining criterion, and theistic Satanists may focus solely on devotion. Unlike the [[LaVeyan Satanism]] founded by [[Anton LaVey]] in the 1960s, Theistic Satanism is [[theism|theistic]] as opposed to atheistic, believing that Satan is a real being rather than a symbol of individualism.

=== Luciferianism ===
{{Main|Luciferianism}}
Luciferianism can be understood best as a belief system or intellectual creed that venerates the essential and inherent characteristics that are affixed and commonly given to Lucifer. Luciferianism is often identified as an auxiliary creed or movement of Satanism, due to the common identification of Lucifer with Satan. Some Luciferians accept this identification and/or consider Lucifer as the &quot;light bearer&quot; and illuminated aspect of Satan, giving them the name of Satanists and the right to bear the title. Others reject it, giving the argument that Lucifer is a more positive and easy-going ideal than Satan. They are inspired by the ancient myths of [[Egyptian mythology|Egypt]], [[Roman mythology|Rome]] and [[Greek mythology|Greece]], [[Gnosticism]] and traditional Western occultism.

=== Palladists ===
{{Main|Palladists}}
Palladists are an alleged [[Theistic Satanism|Theistic Satanist]] society or member of that society. The name Palladian comes from [[Athena|Pallas]] and refers to wisdom and learning. It is of no relation to [[Palladium]] or the [[palladian style]] of [[Andrea Palladio]].

=== Our Lady of Endor Coven ===
{{Main|Our Lady of Endor Coven}}
Our Lady of Endor Coven, also known as Ophite Cultus Satanas (originally spelled &quot;Sathanas&quot;), was a satanic cult founded in 1948 by Herbert Arthur Sloane in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. The group was heavily influenced by [[gnosticism]] (especially that found in the contemporary book by [[Hans Jonas]], ''The Gnostic Religion''), and worshiped Satanas, their name for Satan (''Cultus Satanas'' is a [[Latin]] version of Cult of Satan). Satanas (or Satan) was defined in gnostic terms as the [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] who revealed the knowledge of the true God to [[Eve]]. That it called itself &quot;[[Ophites|Ophite]]&quot; is a reference to the ancient gnostic sect of the Ophites, who were said to worship the serpent.

== Casual Satanism ==
Casual satanism is the use of satanic symbols like the inverted pentagram/Sigil of Baphomet, the trappings of the [[black mass]], or [[demon]]ic imagery to provide the impression of satanism.&lt;ref&gt;Bob and Gretchen Passantino: ''Satanism'': Grand Rapids: Zondervan: 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Liminality|liminal]] experience, reserved primarily for shock value, and does not necessarily indicate actual belief, or even interest, in the rites, symbolism, and philosophies of the various forms of Satanist practice cited above.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty, Anthony (1992). ''The Psychology of Adolescent Satanism''. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to popular music ==
[[Black metal]] has often been connected with Satanism, in part for the lyrical content of several bands and their frequent use of imagery often tied to [[left hand path]] beliefs (such as the inverted [[pentagram]]). More often than not musicians associating themselves with black metal say they do not believe in legitimate Satanic ideology and often profess to being atheists, agnostics, or [[Religious skepticism|religious skeptics]]. In some instances, followers of [[right hand path]] religions use Satanic references for entertainment purposes and [[shock value]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gavin Baddeley|Baddeley, Gavin]] (1993). ''Raising Hell!: The Book of Satan and Rock 'n' Roll''.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of black metal's &quot;first wave&quot; bands only used Satanism for shock value; one of the few exceptions is [[Mercyful Fate]] singer [[King Diamond]], who follows [[LaVeyan Satanism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rhi1&quot;&gt;[[Götz Kühnemund]]: ''A History of Horror''. In: ''[[Rock Hard]]'', no. 282, November 2010, pp. 20-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and whom [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls &quot;one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic Metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for shock value&quot;.&lt;ref name=loc15f&gt;[[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], Didrik Søderlind: ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground]]'', Feral House 1998, pp. 15f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glen Benton]], vocalist and bassist of the band [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], once openly claimed to be a practitioner of [[Theistic Satanism]], and has spoken publicly on numerous occasions to profess staunch anti-Christian sentiment. The controversial [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] frontman [[Jon Nödtveidt]] openly spoke about his &quot;chaos-gnostic&quot; satanic beliefs, being a member of the [[Misanthropic Luciferian Order]], and called his band &quot;the sonic propaganda unit of the MLO&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071020061147/http://www.dissection.nu/interviews/Interview2.htm ''INTERVIEW FOR THE FANS BY THE FANS''. ''- Final Interview with Jon Nödtveidt -''].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norwegian black metal]] artists such as [[Euronymous]] from [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Infernus]] from [[Gorgoroth]] have also identified themselves as Satanists and actively promoted their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Metal: The Definitive Guide | year=2007 | author=Garry Sharpe-Young }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[Black metal#Church burnings|church burnings]] that covered parts of Norway in the early 1990s were also attributed to youths involved in the black metal movement, which included people promoting theistic Satanic beliefs and strong anti-LaVeyan attitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;vybirs&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Grude, Torstein (Director) | date=January 1, 1998 | url=http://home.no/metalra/reviews/videos/satan_rides_the_media.html | title=[[Satan rir media]] | medium=motion picture | location=Norway | publisher=Grude, Torstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legitimacy of such actions as Satanic endeavors, rather than simply rebellious actions done for publicity, is something that has been doubted by even some of those who contribute to the genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Ihsahn for Lords of Chaos.&quot;&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/emperorblackmetal/ihsahn_interview.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+21:47:41 Ihsahn Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==
=== The Church of Satan ===
{{Main|Church of Satan}}
The Church of Satan is an organization dedicated to the acceptance of the carnal self, as articulated in ''The Satanic Bible'', written in 1969 by Anton Szandor LaVey.

=== First Satanic Church ===
{{Main|First Satanic Church}}
On [[Walpurgisnacht]], April 30, 1966, Anton LaVey founded the &quot;The Satanic Church&quot; (which he would later rename &quot;Church of Satan&quot;). After his death in 1997 the Church of Satan was taken over by a new administration and its headquarters was moved to [[New York]]. LaVey's daughter, the High Priestess Karla LaVey, felt this to be a disservice to her father's legacy. The First Satanic Church was re-founded on October 31, 1999 by [[Karla LaVey]] to carry on the legacy of her father. She continues to run it out of [[San Francisco, California]].

=== Temple of Set ===
{{Main|Temple of Set}}
The Temple of Set is an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[occult]] society claiming to be the world's leading [[Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path|left-hand path]] religious organization. It was established in 1975 by Michael A.

ToS deliberately self-differentiates from CoS in several ways, most significantly in theology and sociology.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Harvey |first= Graham |title= Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology |year= 2009 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7546-5286-1 |author= Jesper Aagaard Petersen |chapter= Satanism: Performing Alterity and Othering}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of the Temple of Set may be summed up as &quot;enlightened individualism&quot; &amp;mdash; enhancement and improvement of oneself by personal education, experiment and initiation. This process is necessarily different and distinctive for each individual. The members do not all have the same view on whether Set is &quot;real&quot; or not, and they're not expected to.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs2&quot; /&gt;

Setianism, in theory, is similar to theistic Satanism. The principle deity of Setianism is the ancient Egyptian god [[Set (mythology)|Set]], or Seth, the god of adversary. Set supposedly is the [[Dark Lord]] behind the [[Hebrew]] entity Satan. Set, as the first principle of consciousness, is emulated by Setians, who symbolize the concept of individual, subjective intelligence distinct from the natural order as the &quot;Black Flame&quot;. (Some people who are not members of the Temple of Set find spiritual inspiration in the Egyptian god [[Set (mythology)|Set]], and may share some beliefs with the organization. The belief system in general is referred to as Setianism.)

Members of the Temple of Set are mostly male, between the ages of twenty and fifty.&lt;ref name=&quot;crs2&quot; /&gt;
