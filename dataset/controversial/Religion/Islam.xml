==Etymology and meaning==
{{Further|S-L-M}}
Islam is a verbal noun originating from the [[Semitic root|triliteral root]] s-l-m which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, completion and bonding/joining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyquran.co.uk/20_SIIN.htm Dictionary listing for Siin roots] derived from ''Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon'' via www.studyquran.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In a religious context it means &quot;voluntary submission to God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IVyMAvW9slYC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=surrender+to+will+of+God+islam |title=Lewis, Barnard; Churchill, Buntzie Ellis. ''Islam: The Religion and The People''. Wharton School Publishing. 2009. pp. 8 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04|isbn=9780132230858|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ What does Islam mean?] ''The Friday Journal'', Mumbai (6 Feb 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim, the word for an adherent of Islam, is the [[active participle]] of the same verb of which ''Islām'' is the [[infinitive]]. Believers demonstrate submission to God by serving God and following his commands, and rejecting [[polytheism]]. The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Qur'an. In some verses (''[[ayat]]''), there is stress on the quality of Islam as an internal conviction: &quot;Whomsoever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MULTIPLE-REFERENCES&quot;&gt;See:
* {{Cite quran|6|125|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|61|7|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|39|22|style=ref}}
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet | coauthors=J. Jomier | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other verses connect ''islām'' and ''[[dīn]]'' (usually translated as &quot;religion&quot;): &quot;Today, I have perfected your religion (''dīn'') for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|3|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|19|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|83|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.&lt;ref&gt;See:

* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet | coauthors=J. Jomier | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technical meaning in Islamic thought is as one part of a triad of ''islam'', ''[[Iman (concept)|imān]]'' (faith), and ''[[ihsan|ihsān]]'' (excellence) where it represents acts of service (''`[[ibadah|ibādah]]'') and Islamic law (''[[sharia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The mosque: the heart of submission|first=Rusmir|last=Mahmutćehajić|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=978-0-8232-2584-2|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Articles of faith==
{{Main|Aqidah|Iman (concept)|l2=Iman}}
The core beliefs of Islam are that there is only one god – unitary and beyond comprehension – and that Muhammad is the prophet of God, the last in a [[Prophets in the Quran|series of prophets]] beginning with [[Islamic views on Adam|Adam]]. The Qur'an is upheld as the eternal, literal word of God, and revelations to earlier prophets, as seen in the Jewish Torah and Christian Gospels, are believed to have become distorted by human intervention. Muslims believe that the Qur’an was revealed to Muhammad through the angel [[Gabriel in Islam|Gabriel]], and [[Islamic view of angels|belief in angels]] as God’s servants is part of the Islamic tradition. Belief in the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]], when all people will undergo [[bodily resurrection]] and be judged by God, is another core tenet. While Sunni and Shi’a Muslims adhere to these basic beliefs, Shi’a also believe in the [[Imamah (Shi'a Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]], the line of [[Ismah|infallible]] spiritual and political leaders who succeeded Muhammad, beginning with his cousin and son-in-law, [[Ali]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/traditions/islam |title=Islam |work=Knowledge Resources |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]]|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===God===
{{Allah}}
{{Main|God in Islam}}
Islam's most fundamental concept is a rigorous monotheism, called [[tawhīd]] ({{lang-ar|توحيد}}). God is described in chapter 112 of the Qur'an as:&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Cite quran|112|1|end=4|style=ref}}
* Esposito (2002b), pp.74–76
* Esposito (2004), p.22
* Griffith (2006), p.248
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Allah, Tawhid | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | author=D. Gimaret | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Say: He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.&quot; ({{cite quran|112|1-4|style=nosup|expand=no}}) Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the [[Trinity]] and divinity of [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]], comparing it to [[polytheism]], but accept Jesus as a prophet. In Islam, God is beyond all comprehension and Muslims are not expected to visualize God. God is described and referred to by certain names or attributes, the most common being ''Al-Rahmān'', meaning &quot;The Compassionate&quot; and ''Al-Rahīm'', meaning &quot;The Merciful&quot; (See [[Names of God in Islam]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bentley |first=David |coauthors= |title=The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book |publisher=William Carey Library |year=1999 |month=September |isbn=0-87808-299-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that creation of everything in the universe is brought into being by God’s sheer command “‘Be’ and so it is.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|117|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the [[purpose of life|purpose of existence]] is to love and serve God.&lt;ref name=&quot;patheos1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Islam/Beliefs/Human-Nature-and-the-Purpose-of-Existence.html |title=Human Nature and the Purpose of Existence |publisher=Patheos.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|51|56|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is viewed as a personal god who responds whenever a person in need or distress calls him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|186|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no intermediaries, such as [[clergy]], to contact God who states &quot;We are nearer to him than (his) [[jugular vein]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|50|16|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Allāh]]'' is the term with no [[plural]] or [[gender]] used by Muslims and Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews to reference God, while ''{{transl|ar|ISO|[[ʾilāh]]}}'' ({{lang-ar|إله}}) is the term used for a deity or a god in general.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/empires/islam/faithgod.html |title=God |work=Islam: Empire of Faith |publisher=PBS|accessdate=2010-12-18}}
* &quot;Islam and Christianity&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Christianity'' (2001): Arabic-speaking [[Christian]]s and [[Jew]]s also refer to God as ''Allāh''.
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Allah | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other non-Arab Muslims might use different names as much as Allah, for instance &quot;Tanrı&quot; in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or &quot;Khodā&quot; in [[Persian language|Persian]].

===Angels===
{{Main|Islamic view of angels}}

Belief in angels is fundamental to the faith of Islam. The Arabic word for angel ({{lang-ar|ملاك}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|malak}}'') means &quot;[[Courier|messenger]]&quot;, like its counterparts in [[Hebrew]] (''malakh'') and [[Greek language|Greek]] (''angelos''). According to the Qur'an, angels do not possess [[free will]], and worship God in total obedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|21|19|end=20|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|35|1|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels' duties include communicating [[revelation]]s from God, glorifying God, recording every person's actions, and taking a person's [[soul]] at the time of death. They are also thought to [[Intercession|intercede]] on man's behalf. The Qur'an describes angels as &quot;messengers with wings—two, or three, or four (pairs): He [God] adds to Creation as He pleases...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Cite quran|35|1|style=ref}}

===Revelations===
{{Main|Islamic holy books|Qur'an}}
{{See also|History of the Qur'an}}
[[File:FirstSurahKoran.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Al-Fatiha|first sura]] in a [[Qur'an]]ic manuscript by [[Hattat Aziz Efendi]]]]
The Islamic holy books are the records which most Muslims believe were dictated by God to various prophets. Muslims believe that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, the ''[[Tawrat]]'' ([[Torah]]) and the ''[[Injil]]'' ([[Gospels]]), had become [[tahrif|distorted]]—either in interpretation, in text, or both.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distorted&quot; /&gt; The [[Qur'an]] (literally, “Reading” or “Recitation”) is viewed by Muslims as the final revelation and literal word of God and is widely regarded as the finest [[Arabic literature|piece of literature]] work in the [[Arabic language]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jones, The Koran, London 1994, ISBN 1-84212-609-1, opening page.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Arberry, The Koran Interpreted, London 1956, ISBN 0-684-82507-4, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Bucaille |title=The Bible, the Qur'an and Science |year= 1978 |isbn= 81-7231-161-3 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the verses of the Qur'an were revealed to [[Muhammad]] by God through the [[Gabriel|archangel Gabriel]] (''Jibrīl'') on many occasions between 610 CE until his death on June 8, 632 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2004), pp.17,18,21&lt;/ref&gt; While Muhammad was alive, all of these revelations were written down by his companions (''[[sahabah]]''), although the prime method of transmission was orally through [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;al faruqi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al Faruqi|coauthors=Lois Ibsen|title=The Cantillation of the Qur'an|journal=Asian Music|year=1987|issue=Autumn – Winter 1987|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Muhammad, it was compiled in the time of [[Abu Bakr]], the first [[caliph]], and was [[History of the Qur'an#Compilation|standardized]] under the administration of [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman]], the third caliph.

The Qur'an is divided into 114 [[sura]]s, or chapters, which combined, contain 6,236 ''[[ayah|āyāt]]'', or verses. The chronologically earlier suras, revealed at [[Mecca]], are primarily concerned with ethical and spiritual topics. The later [[Medina]]n suras mostly discuss social and moral issues relevant to the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Qur'an | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}

&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an is more concerned with moral guidance than legal instruction, and is considered the &quot;sourcebook of Islamic principles and values&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2004), p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim jurists consult the ''[[hadith]]'', or the written record of Prophet Muhammad's life, to both supplement the Qur'an and assist with its interpretation. The science of Qur'anic commentary and exegesis is known as ''[[tafsir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Esposito (2004), pp.79–81
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Tafsir | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Muslims speak in the abstract about &quot;the Qur'an&quot;, they usually mean the scripture as recited in Arabic rather than the printed work or any translation of it. To Muslims, the Qur'an is perfect only as revealed in the original Arabic; translations are necessarily deficient because of language differences, the fallibility of translators, and the impossibility of preserving the original's inspired style. Translations are therefore regarded only as commentaries on the Qur'an, or &quot;interpretations of its meaning&quot;, not as the Qur'an itself.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Teece (2003), pp.12,13
* C. Turner (2006), p.42
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Qur'an | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | ref=harv }}: The word ''Qur'an'' was invented and first used in the Qur'an itself. There are [[Qur'an#Etymology and meaning|two different theories]] about this term and its formation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prophets===
{{Hadith collections two}}
{{Main|Prophets of Islam}}
[[Muslim]]s identify the prophets of Islam ({{lang-ar|نبي}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|nabī}}'' ) as those humans chosen by God to be his messengers. According to the Qur'an&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/koran/koran-idx?type=proximity&amp;q1=Imran&amp;operator1=Near&amp;amt1=80&amp;q2=Ibrahim&amp;operator2=Near&amp;amt2=80&amp;q3=&amp;size=First+100 |title=The Koran |publisher=Quod.lib.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the descendants of Abraham and [[Imran (father of Maryam)|Imran]] were chosen by God to bring the &quot;Will of God&quot; to the peoples of the nations. Muslims believe that prophets are human and not divine, though some are able to perform miracles to prove their claim. [[Islamic theology]] says that all of God's messengers preached the message of Islam—submission to the will of God. The Qur'an mentions the names of numerous figures considered [[prophets in Islam]], including [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Islamic view of Noah|Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Momem (1987), p.176
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that God finally sent [[Muhammad]] (''[[Seal of the prophets|Seal of the Prophets]]'') to convey the divine message to the whole world (to sum up and to finalize the word of God). In Islam, the &quot;normative&quot; example of Muhammad's life is called the [[Sunnah]] (literally &quot;trodden path&quot;). This example is preserved in traditions known as [[hadith]] (&quot;reports&quot;), which recount his words, his actions, and his personal characteristics. [[Hadith#Hadith Qudsi|Hadith Qudsi]] is a sub-category of hadith, regarded as the words of God repeated by Muhammad differing from the Quran in that they are &quot;''expressed in Muhammad's words''&quot;, whereas the quran are the &quot;''direct words of God''&quot;. The classical Muslim jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]] (d. 820) emphasized the importance of the Sunnah in Islamic law, and Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's actions in their daily lives. The Sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Qur'an. Six of these collections, compiled in the 3rd century [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] (9th century [[Common Era|CE]]), came to be regarded as especially authoritative by the largest group in Islām, the Sunnites. Another large group, the Shīʾah, has its own Ḥadīth contained in four canonical collections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

===Resurrection and judgment===
{{Main|Qiyama}}
Belief in the &quot;Day of Resurrection&quot;, ''[[Qiyamah|Yawm al-Qiyāmah]]'' ({{lang-ar|يوم القيامة}}) is also crucial for Muslims. They believe the time of ''Qiyāmah'' is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and [[tribulation]]s preceding and during the ''Qiyāmah'' are described in the Qur'an and the [[hadith]], and also in the commentaries of [[Ulama|scholars]]. The Qur'an emphasizes [[Resurrection of the Dead|bodily resurrection]], a break from the [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n understanding of death.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* &quot;Resurrection&quot;, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' (2003)
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Avicenna | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | ref=harv }}: Ibn Sīnā, Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAbd Allāh b. Sīnā is known in the West as &quot;Avicenna&quot;.
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Qiyama | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Yawm al-Qiyāmah, Muslims believe all mankind will be judged on their good and bad deeds. The Qur'an [[Islamic views of sin|lists several sins]] that can condemn a person to [[hell]], such as [[Kafir|disbelief]] ({{lang-ar|كفر}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Kufr}}''), and dishonesty; however, the Qur'an makes it clear God will forgive the [[Islamic views on sin|sins]] of those who repent if he so wills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|31|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good deeds, such as charity and prayer, will be rewarded with entry to heaven. Muslims view [[jannah|heaven]] as a place of joy and bliss, with Qur'anic references describing its features and the physical pleasures to come. Mystical traditions in Islam place these heavenly delights in the context of an ecstatic awareness of God.&lt;ref&gt;See:

''[[Qiyamah|Yawm al-Qiyāmah]]'' is also identified in the Qur'an as ''Yawm ad-Dīn'' ({{lang-ar|يوم الدين}}), &quot;Day of Religion&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|1|4|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''as-sāʿah'' ({{lang-ar|الساعة}}), &quot;the Last Hour&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|6|31|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''al-Qāriʿah'' ({{lang-ar|القارعة}}), &quot;The Clatterer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|101|1|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predestination===
{{Main|Predestination in Islam}}

In accordance with the Islamic belief in [[predestination]], or divine preordainment (''al-qadā wa'l-qadar''), God has full knowledge and control over all that occurs. This is explained in Qur'anic verses such as &quot;Say: 'Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector'...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Cite quran|9|51|style=ref}}
* D. Cohen-Mor (2001), p.4: &quot;The idea of predestination is reinforced by the frequent mention of events 'being written' or 'being in a book' before they happen: 'Say: &quot;Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us...&quot;&amp;nbsp;'&amp;nbsp;&quot;
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Fate | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | author=Ahmet T. Karamustafa | ref=harv }}: The verb ''qadara'' literally means &quot;to measure, to determine&quot;. Here it is used to mean that &quot;God measures and orders his creation&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; For Muslims, everything in the world that occurs, good or evil, has been preordained and nothing can happen unless permitted by God. According to Muslim theologians, although events are pre-ordained, man possesses free will in that he has the faculty to choose between right and wrong, and is thus responsible for his actions. According to Islamic tradition, all that has been decreed by God is written in ''al-Lawh al-Mahfūz'', the &quot;Preserved Tablet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See:

==Five pillars==
{{Main|Five Pillars of Islam}}
The Pillars of Islam (''arkan al-Islam''; also ''arkan ad-din'', &quot;pillars of religion&quot;) are five basic acts in Islam, considered obligatory for all believers. The [[Quran]] presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They are (1) the [[shahadah]] (creed), (2) daily prayers ([[salat]]), (3) almsgiving ([[zakah]]), (4) fasting during [[Ramadan]] and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca ([[hajj]]) at least once in a lifetime. The [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] sects both agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859?_hi=32&amp;_pos=3 Pillars of Islam], Oxford Islamic Studies Online&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which is the basic [[creed]] of Islam that must be recited under [[oath]] with the specific statement: &quot;''{{transl|ar|ISO|'ašhadu 'al-lā ilāha illā-llāhu wa 'ašhadu 'anna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh}}''&quot;, or &quot;I testify there are no deities other than God alone and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.&quot; This testament is a foundation for all other beliefs and practices in Islam. Muslims must repeat the ''shahadah'' in prayer, and non-Muslims wishing to [[convert to Islam]] are required to recite the creed.&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Prayer===
{{main|Salah}}
{{See also|Mosque}}
[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|180px|Muslim men [[prostration|prostrating]] during prayer in a mosque.]]
Ritual prayers, called Ṣalāh or Ṣalāt ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: [[Wikt:صلاة|صلاة]]), must be performed five times a [[day]]. Salah is intended to focus the mind on [[God]], and is seen as a personal communication with him that expresses gratitude and [[worship]]. Salah is compulsory but flexibility in the specifics is allowed depending on circumstances. The prayers are recited in the [[Arabic language]], and consist of verses from the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Esposito (2002b), pp.18,19
* Hedáyetullah (2006), pp.53–55
* Kobeisy (2004), pp.22–34
* Momen (1987), p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

A mosque is a [[places of worship|place of worship]] for Muslims, who often refer to it by its Arabic name, ''masjid''. The word ''mosque'' in English refers to all types of buildings dedicated to Islamic worship, although there is a distinction in Arabic between the smaller, privately owned mosque and the larger, &quot;collective&quot; mosque (''masjid jāmi`'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Budge's Egypt: A Classic 19th century Travel Guide |last=Budge |first=E.A.

Modern mosques have evolved greatly from the early designs of the 7th century, and contain a variety of architectural elements such as [[minaret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Alms-giving===
{{main|Zakat|Sadaqah}}
&quot;Zakāt&quot; ({{lang-ar|زكاة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|zakāh}}'' &quot;[[wikt:alms|alms]]&quot;) is giving a fixed portion of accumulated wealth by those who can afford it to help the poor or needy, and also to assist the spread of Islam. It is considered a religious obligation (as opposed to voluntary charity) that the well-off owe to the needy because their wealth is seen as a &quot;trust from God's bounty&quot;. The Qur'an and the hadith also suggest a Muslim give even more as an act of voluntary alms-giving (''[[sadaqah|{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣadaqah}}]]'').&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Fasting===
{{main|Sawm}}
{{Further|Sawm of Ramadan}}
Fasting, ({{lang-ar|صوم}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣawm}}''), from food and drink (among other things) must be performed from dawn to dusk during the month of [[Ramadhan]]. The fast is to encourage a feeling of nearness to God, and during it Muslims should express their gratitude for and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, and think of the needy. ''Sawm'' is not obligatory for several groups for whom it would constitute an undue burden. For others, flexibility is allowed depending on circumstances, but missed fasts usually must be made up quickly.&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Pilgrimage===
{{main|Hajj}}
The [[pilgrimage]], called the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥajj}}'' ({{lang-ar|حج}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥaǧǧ}}'') during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of ''[[Dhu al-Hijjah]]'' in the city of Mecca. Every [[able-bodied]] Muslim who can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime. Rituals of the Hajj include walking seven times around the Kaaba, touching the [[black stone]] if possible, walking or running seven times between [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Safa]] and [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Marwah]], and symbolically [[Stoning of the Devil|stoning the Devil]] in [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

==Law and jurisprudence==
{{Main|Sharia|Fiqh}}
{{Fiqh}}
The ''Sharia'' (literally &quot;the path leading to the watering place&quot;) is Islamic law formed by traditional Islamic scholarship, which most Muslim groups adhere to. In Islam, Sharia is the expression of the divine will, and &quot;constitutes a system of duties that are incumbent upon a Muslim by virtue of his religious belief&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaShariah&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Shari'ah | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic law covers all aspects of life, from matters of state, like governance and [[Diplomacy|foreign relations]], to issues of daily living. The Qur'an defines ''[[hudud]]'' as the punishments for five specific crimes: unlawful intercourse, false accusation of unlawful intercourse, consumption of alcohol, theft, and highway robbery. Though not in the Qur'an {{where?|date=January 2012}}, there are also [[Apostasy in Islam|laws against apostasy]] (although Muslims disagree over punishment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=48|url=http://books.google.com/?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an and Sunnah also contain laws of [[Islamic Inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]], [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|marriage]], and [[Qisas|restitution for injuries and murder]], as well as rules for [[sawm|fasting]], [[Sadaqah|charity]], and [[salat|prayer]]. However, these [[wajib|prescriptions]] and [[Haraam|prohibitions]] may be broad, so their application in practice varies. [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] (known as ''ulema'') have elaborated systems of law on the basis of these rules and their interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Menski (2006), p.290

* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Sharia | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=N. Calder | coauthors=M. B. Hooker | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years there have been changing views on [[Fiqh|Islamic law]] but many such as [[Zahiri]] and [[Jariri]]{{Clarify|date=November 2010}} have since died out.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Herbert. &quot;Islamic Law.&quot; Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History 3 (2005): 1030.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dien, Mawil Izzi. Islamic Law: From Historical Foundations To Contemporary Practice. Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fiqh]]'', or &quot;jurisprudence&quot;, is defined as the knowledge of the practical rules of the religion. Much of it has evolved to prevent innovation or alteration in the original religion, known as [[bid'ah]]. The method Islamic jurists use to derive rulings is known as ''[[usul al-fiqh]]'' (&quot;legal theory&quot;, or &quot;principles of jurisprudence&quot;). According to Islamic legal theory, law has four fundamental roots, which are given precedence in this order: the Qur'an, the Sunnah (the practice of Muhammad), the consensus of the Muslim jurists (''[[ijma]]''), and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]''). For early Islamic jurists, theory was less important than pragmatic application of the law. In the 9th century, the jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]] provided a theoretical basis for Islamic law by codifying the principles of jurisprudence (including the four fundamental roots) in his book ''ar-Risālah''.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss (2002), pp.xvii,162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jurists===
{{Main|Ulama|Sheikh|Imam}}
There are many terms in Islam to refer to religiously sanctioned positions of Islam, but &quot;jurist&quot; generally refers to the educated class of [[Muslim]] legal scholars engaged in the several fields of [[Islamic studies]]. In a broader sense, the term ''ulema'' is used to describe the body of Muslim clergy who have completed several years of training and study of Islamic sciences, such as a [[mufti]], [[qadi]], [[faqih]], or [[muhaddith]]. Some Muslims include under this term the village [[mullah]]s, [[imam]]s, and [[maulvi]]s—who have attained only the lowest rungs on the ladder of Islamic scholarship; other Muslims would say that clerics must meet higher standards to be considered ulama (singular Aalim). Some Muslims practise [[ijtihad]] whereby they do not accept the authority of clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss (2002), pp.3,161&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etiquette and diet===
{{Main|Adab (behavior)|Islamic dietary laws}}
Many practices fall in the category of ''adab'', or Islamic etiquette. This includes greeting others with &quot;''[[As-Salamu Alaykum|as-salamu `alaykum]]''&quot; (&quot;peace be unto you&quot;), saying ''[[Basmala|bismillah]]'' (&quot;in [[Names of God|the name of God]]&quot;) before meals, and using only the right hand for eating and drinking. [[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence|Islamic hygienic]] practices mainly fall into the category of personal cleanliness and health. [[Khitan (circumcision)|Circumcision of male offspring]] is also practiced in Islam. [[Islamic funeral|Islamic burial rituals]] include saying the ''[[Salat al-Janazah]]'' (&quot;funeral prayer&quot;) over the bathed and enshrouded dead body, and burying it in a [[Grave (burial)|grave]]. Muslims are restricted in their diet. Prohibited foods include pork products, blood, [[carrion]], and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. All meat must come from a [[herbivorous]] animal slaughtered in the name of God by a Muslim, Jew, or Christian, with the exception of game that one has hunted or fished for oneself. Food permissible for Muslims is known as [[halal]] food.&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Family life===
{{See also|Women in Islam}}
[[File:Nikah 003.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marriage in Islam]] requires a legal [[marriage certificate]] (''nikah nama'').]]
The basic unit of Islamic society is the [[family]], and Islam defines the obligations and legal rights of family members. The father is seen as financially responsible for his family, and is obliged to cater for their well-being. The division of [[Islamic Inheritance jurisprudence|inheritance]] is specified in the Qur'an, which states that most of it is to pass to the immediate family, while a portion is set aside for the payment of debts and the making of bequests. With some exceptions, the woman's share of inheritance is generally half of that of a man with the same rights of succession.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;al-Mar'a&quot;. ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marriage in Islam]] is a civil [[nikah|contract]] which consists of an offer and acceptance between two qualified parties in the presence of two witnesses. The groom is required to pay a bridal gift (''[[mahr]]'') to the bride, as stipulated in the contract.&lt;ref&gt;
* Waines (2003) pp. 93–96
* The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (2003), p.339
* Esposito (1998) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;
A man may have up to four wives if he believes he can treat them equally, while a woman may have only one husband. In most Muslim countries, the process of divorce in Islam is known as ''[[Talaq (Nikah)|talaq]]'', which the husband initiates by pronouncing the word &quot;divorce&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;*&quot;Talak&quot;. ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars disagree whether Islamic holy texts justify traditional Islamic practices such as [[hijab|veiling]] and seclusion ([[purdah]]).
Starting in the 20th century, Muslim social reformers argued against these and other practices such as [[polygamy in Islam]], with varying success. At the same time, many Muslim women have attempted to reconcile tradition with modernity by combining an active life with outward modesty. Certain [[Islamist]] groups like the [[Taliban]] have sought to continue traditional law as applied to women.&lt;ref&gt;

===Government===
{{Main|Political aspects of Islam|Islamic state|Islam and secularism|Caliphate}}
Mainstream Islamic law does not distinguish between &quot;matters of church&quot; and &quot;matters of state&quot;; the [[ulema|scholars]] function as both jurists and theologians. In practice, Islamic rulers frequently bypassed the Sharia courts with a parallel system of so-called &quot;Grievance courts&quot; over which they had sole control.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} As the Muslim world came into contact with European secular ideals, Muslim societies responded in different ways. [[Turkey]] has been governed as a [[secular state]] ever since the reforms of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in 1923. In contrast, the [[1979 Iranian Revolution]] replaced a mostly secular regime with an [[Islamic republic]] led by the [[Ruholla Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Military===
{{Main|Jihad|Islamic military jurisprudence|List of expeditions of Muhammad}}
Jihad means &quot;to strive or struggle&quot; (in the way of God) and is considered the &quot;[[Sixth Pillar of Islam]]&quot; by a minority of Sunni Muslim authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;jih&quot;&gt;Esposito (2003), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Jihad, in its broadest sense, is classically defined as &quot;exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of [[wikt:disapprobation|disapprobation]].&quot; Depending on the object being a visible enemy, the [[devil]], and aspects of one's own self (such as sinful desires), different categories of jihad are defined.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone (1999) pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Jihad, when used without any qualifier, is understood in its military aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Reuven Firestone (1999), The Meaning of Jihād, p. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Encyclopedia, Jihad&lt;/ref&gt; Jihad also refers to one's striving to attain religious and moral perfection.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Brockopp (2003) pp. 99–100
* Esposito (2003), p.93
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=jihad | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim authorities, especially among the Shi'a and [[Sufism|Sufis]], distinguish between the &quot;greater jihad&quot;, which pertains to spiritual [[self-improvement|self-perfection]], and the &quot;lesser jihad&quot;, defined as warfare.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Firestone (1999) p.17
* &quot;Djihad&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], jihad is usually taken to mean military exertion against non-Muslim combatants in the [[Defensive Jihad|defense]] or [[Offensive jihad|expansion]] of the [[Ummah]]. The ultimate purpose of military jihad is debated, both within the Islamic community and without, with some claiming that it only serves to protect the Ummah, with no aspiration of offensive conflict, whereas others have argued that the goal of Jihad is global conquest. Jihad is the only form of warfare permissible in Islamic law and may be declared against [[terrorism|terrorists]], criminal groups, rebels, [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]], and leaders or states who oppress Muslims or hamper proselytizing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone (1999) p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jihad&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Djihād |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Muslims today interpret Jihad as only a defensive form of warfare: the external Jihad includes a struggle to make the Islamic societies conform to the Islamic norms of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Knowing the Enemy: Jihadist Ideology and the War on Terror, Mary R. Habeck, Yale University Press, p.108–109, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Under most circumstances and for most Muslims, jihad is a collective duty (''[[fard|fard kifaya]]''): its performance by some individuals exempts the others. Only for those vested with authority, especially the sovereign ([[imam]]), does jihad become an individual duty. For the rest of the populace, this happens only in the case of a [[general mobilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jihad&quot; /&gt; For most [[Twelvers|Shias]], [[offensive jihad]] can only be declared by a [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|divinely appointed leader]] of the Muslim community, and as such is suspended since [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr

Muhammad (c. 570 – June 8, 632) was a trader later becoming a religious, political, and military leader. However, Muslims do not view Muhammad as the creator of Islam, but instead regard him as the last messenger of God, through which the [[Qur'an]] was revealed. Muslims view Muhammad as the restorer of the original, uncorrupted monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. In Muslim tradition, Muhammad is viewed as the last in a series of [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Muhammad | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the last 22 years of his life, beginning at age 40 in 610 [[Common Era|CE]], according to the earliest surviving biographies, Muhammad reported revelations that he believed to be from God. The content of these revelations, known as the Qur'an, was memorized and recorded by his [[Sahaba|companions]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{Cite quran|18|110|style=ref}}
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Muhammad | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=F. Buhl | coauthors=A. T. Welch | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this time, Muhammad preached to the people of Mecca, imploring them to abandon polytheism. Although some [[converted to Islam]], Muhammad and his followers were persecuted by the leading Meccan authorities. After 12 years of preaching, Muhammad and the Muslims performed the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'' (&quot;emigration&quot;) to the city of [[Medina]] (formerly known as ''Yathrib'') in 622, after initially trying the [[Ethiopia]]n [[Aksumite Empire]]. There, with the Medinan converts (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'') and the Meccan migrants (''[[Muhajirun]]''), Muhammad established his political and [[Theocracy|religious authority]]. Within years, two battles had been fought against Meccan forces: the [[Battle of Badr]] in 624, which was a Muslim victory, and the [[Battle of Uhud]] in 625, which ended inconclusively. Conflict with Medinan Jewish clans who opposed the Muslims led to their exile, enslavement, or death, and the Jewish enclave of [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]] was subdued. In 628, the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]] was signed between Mecca and the Muslims and was broken by Mecca two years later. At the same time, Meccan trade routes were cut off as Muhammad brought surrounding desert tribes under his control.&lt;ref&gt;See:

With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's companion and close friend. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or &quot;Wars of Apostasy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See:

His death in 634 resulted in the succession of [[Umar]] as the caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]], [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. The first caliphs are known as ''al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn'' (&quot;[[Rightly Guided Caliphs]]&quot;). Under them, the territory under Muslim rule expanded deeply into [[Sassanid Empire|Persian]] and [[Byzantine]] territories.&lt;ref&gt;See
* Holt (1977a), p.74
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet | coauthors=J. Jomier | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Umar was assassinated in 644, [[the election of Uthman]] as successor was met with increasing opposition. In 656, Uthman was also killed, and Ali assumed the position of caliph. After fighting off opposition in the [[First Fitna|first civil war]] (the &quot;First Fitna&quot;), Ali was assassinated by [[Kharijites]] in 661. Following this, [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiyah]] seized power and began the [[Umayyad dynasty]], with its capital in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Holt (1977a), pp.67–72&lt;/ref&gt;

These disputes over religious and political leadership would give rise to schism in the Muslim community. The majority accepted the legitimacy of the three rulers prior to Ali, and became known as [[Sunni]]s. A minority disagreed, and believed that Ali was the only rightful successor; they became known as the [[Shi'a]].&lt;ref&gt;Waines (2003) p.46&lt;/ref&gt; After Mu'awiyah's death in 680, conflict over succession broke out again in a civil war known as the &quot;[[Second Fitna]]&quot;. The Umayyad dynasty conquered the [[Maghreb|Maghrib]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonnese Gaul]] and [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Puchala, ‘’Theory and History in International Relations,’’ page 137. Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The local population of Jews and indigenous Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and taxed heavily, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2010), p.38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann (2007), p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

The Umayyad aristocracy viewed Islam as a religion for Arabs only;&lt;ref&gt;Hawting (2000), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; the economy of the Umayyad empire was based on the assumption that a majority of non-Muslims ([[Dhimmis]]) would pay taxes to the minority of Muslim Arabs. A non-Arab who wanted to [[convert to Islam]] was supposed to first become a client of an Arab tribe. Even after conversion, these new Muslims (''[[mawali]]'') did not achieve social and economic equality with the Arabs. The descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] rallied discontented ''mawali'', poor Arabs, and some Shi'a against the Umayyads and overthrew them with the help of the general [[Abu Muslim]], inaugurating the [[Abbasid|Abbasid dynasty]] in 750 and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus (2002), p.56; Lewis (1993), pp. 71–83&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Six major Hadith collections|major hadith collections]] were compiled. The [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] was formed from the teachings of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] while the four Sunni [[Madh'hab]]s, the [[Hanafi]], [[Hanbali]], [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi'i]], were established around the teachings of [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], [[Ahmad bin Hanbal]], [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[al-Shafi'i]] respectively. Al-Shafi'i also codified a method to establish the reliability of hadith.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus (2002), p.86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] and [[Ibn Kathir]] completed the most commonly cited commentaries on the Quran, the [[Tafsir al-Tabari]] in the 9th century and the [[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] in the 14th century, respectively. Philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) sought to incorporate Greek principles into Islamic theology, while others like [[Al-Ghazzali]] argued against them and ultimately prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Lapidus (2002), p.160
* Waines (2003) p.126,127&lt;/ref&gt;

Caliphs such as [[Mamun al Rashid]] and [[Al-Mu'tasim]] made the [[mutazilite]] philosophy an official creed and imposed it upon Muslims to follow. Mu'tazila was a Greek influenced school of speculative theology called [[kalam]], which refers to [[dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2010), p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Many orthodox Muslims rejected [[mutazilite]] doctrines and condemned their idea of the creation of the Quran. In inquisitions, Imam Hanbal refused to conform and was tortured and sent to an unlit [[Baghdad]] prison cell for nearly thirty months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Doi |first1= Abdur Rahman |title= Shariah: The Islamic Law |edition= |page=110|year=1984|publisher=Ta-Ha Publishers |location=London|isbn= 0-907461-38-7|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other branch of kalam was the [[Ash'ari]] school founded by [[Al-Ash'ari]]. Some Muslims began to question the piety of indulgence in a worldly life and emphasized poverty, humility and avoidance of [[Islamic views on sin|sin]] based on renunciation of bodily desires. Ascetics such as [[Hasan al-Basri]] would inspire a movement that would evolve into [[Sufism]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

The Qur'an and the Sunnah (the example of Muhammad's life) as recorded in hadith are the primary foundations of Sunni doctrine.

According to Sunni Islam, the &quot;[[normative]]&quot; example of Muhammad's life is called the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (literally &quot;trodden path&quot;). This example is preserved in traditions known as [[Al-Kutub Al-Sittah]] (six major books) which are [[hadith]]s (&quot;reports&quot;), recounting his words, his actions, and his personal characteristics. The classical Muslim jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]] (d. 820) emphasized the importance of the Sunnah in [[Sharia|Islamic law]], and Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's actions in their daily lives. The Sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Two major hadith collections are [[Sahih Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]. Sunnis believe that the first four [[caliph]]s were the rightful successors to Muhammad; since God did not specify any particular leaders to succeed him, those leaders had to be elected. Sunnis believe that a caliph should be chosen by the whole community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;From the article on Sunni Islam in [http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2280?_hi=2&amp;_pos=2 Oxford Islamic Studies Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four recognised [[madhhab|madh'habs]] (schools of thought): [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]]. All four accept the validity of the others and a Muslim may choose any one that he or she finds agreeable.&lt;ref&gt;See:

&lt;/ref&gt; While Sunnis believe that Muhammad did not appoint a successor, Shias believe that during [[The Farewell Pilgrimage]] the prophet appointed his son-in-law, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], as his successor as shown by the [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm]]. As a result, they believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib was the first ''Imam'' (leader), rejecting the legitimacy of the previous Muslim caliphs since they were not appointed by the prophet. Shias believe that the political and religious [[Islamic leadership|leadership]] of [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]] come from the direct descendants of Muhammad and Ali, also known as the [[Ahl al-Bayt]]. To most Shias, an Imam rules by right of divine appointment and holds &quot;absolute spiritual authority&quot; among Muslims, having final say in matters of doctrine and revelation. However, the Imams are not allowed to introduce new laws or eradicate old ones; they are simply required to interpret and reflect the will of Allah and the prophet.&lt;ref&gt;See

Shia Islam has several branches, the largest of which is the [[Twelvers]], followed by [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidis]] and [[Ismaili]]s. The Twelvers believe that there were [[12 Imams]] or caliphs after the Prophet. They often cite the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]] as evidence. Shias prefer hadiths attributed to the Ahlul Bayt and close associates. The Twelver Shi'a follow a legal tradition called [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Ahmed (1999), pp.44–45
* Nasr (1994), p.466&lt;/ref&gt; Other smaller groups, include the [[Mustaali|Bohra]], and [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;See:

* [http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/islam/shia/index.html Shia branches]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Alawites]] and [[Alevi]]. Branches of Shia Islam which deviate from mainstream Shia doctrine are described by orthodox Shias as [[Ghulat]].

===Architecture===
{{Main|Islamic architecture}}
Perhaps the most important expression of Islamic art is architecture, particularly that of the [[mosque]] (four-iwan and hypostyle).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Islam&quot;, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Through the edifices, the effect of varying cultures within Islamic civilization can be illustrated. The North African and Spanish Islamic architecture, for example, has [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Byzantine]] elements, as seen in the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] which contains marble and porphyry columns from Roman and Byzantine buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LgnhYDozENgC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=mosque+kairouan+roman+columns#v=onepage&amp;q=mosque%20kairouan%20roman%20columns&amp;f=false |title=Elizabeth Allo Isichei, ''A history of African societies to 1870'', page 175.

===Art===
{{Main|Islamic art}}
Islamic art encompasses the [[visual arts]] produced from the 7th century onwards by people (not necessarily [[Muslim]]) who lived within the territory that was inhabited by Muslim populations.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, Richard Ettinghauset and Architecture 650–1250'', Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-08869-8, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; It includes fields as varied as [[architecture]], [[calligraphy]], [[painting]], and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], among others.

Making images of human beings and animals is frowned on in many Islamic cultures and connected with laws against idolatry common to all Abrahamic religions, as 'Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood reported that Muhammad said, &quot;Those who will be most severely punished by Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see al-Fath, 10/382). However this rule has been interpreted in different ways by different scholars and in different historical periods, and there are examples of paintings of both animals and humans in Mughal, Persian and Turkish art. The existence of this aversion to creating images of animate beings has been used to explain the prevalence of calligraphy, tessellation and pattern as key aspects of Islamic artistic culture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Calendar===
{{Main|Islamic calendar}}
The formal beginning of the Muslim era was chosen to be the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] in 622 CE, which was an important turning point in Muhammad's fortunes. The assignment of this year as the year 1 AH (''Anno Hegirae'') in the Islamic calendar was reportedly made by [[Umar|Caliph Umar]]. It is a [[lunar calendar]] with days lasting from sunset to sunset.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patheos Library]] – Islam Sacred Time – [http://www.patheos.com/Library/Islam/Ritual-Worship-Devotion-Symbolism/Sacred-Time.html Patheos.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic [[Muslim holidays|holy days]] fall on fixed dates of the lunar calendar, which means that they occur in [[seasons|different seasons]] in different years in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The most important Islamic festivals are ''[[Eid al-Fitr]]'' ({{lang-ar|عيد الفطر}}) on the 1st of ''[[Shawwal]]'', marking the end of the fasting month ''[[Ramadan]]'', and ''[[Eid al-Adha]]'' ({{lang|ar|عيد الأضحى}}) on the 10th of ''[[Dhu al-Hijjah]]'', coinciding with the pilgrimage to Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Ghamidi (2001): [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/janisla2y2.html Customs and Behavioral Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Islam==
{{main|Criticism of Islam}}

Criticism of Islam has existed since Islam's formative stages. Early written criticism came from Christians, prior to the ninth century, many of whom viewed Islam as a radical Christian [[heresy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;John of Damascus2&quot;&gt;De Haeresibus by [[John of Damascus]]. See [[Migne]]. ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', vol. 94, 1864, cols 763-73. An English translation by the Reverend John W Voorhis appeared in THE MOSLEM WORLD for October 1954, pp.&amp;nbsp;392–398.&lt;/ref&gt; Later there appeared criticism from the [[Muslim world]] itself, and also from [[Judaism|Jewish]] writers and from ecclesiastical Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarraqPoetry&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last=Warraq| first=Ibn | title=Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out | publisher=Prometheus Books | year=2003 | isbn=1-59102-068-9 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibn Kammuna&quot;&gt;Ibn Kammuna, ''Examination of the Three Faiths'', trans.

Objects of criticism include the morality of the life of [[Muhammad]], the last prophet of Islam, both in his public and personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oussani&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WarraqQuest&quot;&gt;Ibn Warraq, The Quest for Historical Muhammad (Amherst, Mass.:Prometheus, 2000), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues relating to the authenticity and morality of the [[Qur'an]], the Islamic holy book, are also discussed by critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;BibleInQuran&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1032&amp;letter=B#3068 Bible in Mohammedian Literature.], by Kaufmann Kohler Duncan B.
