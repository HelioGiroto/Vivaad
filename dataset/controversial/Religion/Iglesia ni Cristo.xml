==History==
Felix Manalo, born on May 10, 1886 in [[Taguig]], [[Philippines]], was baptized a [[Roman Catholic]]. In his teenage years, Manalo became dissatisfied with [[Roman Catholic theology]]. According to the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]], the establishment of the [[Philippine Independent Church]] or the [[Aglipayan Church]] was his major turning point but Manalo remained uninterested since its doctrines were mainly Catholic. He started seeking through various denominations, including the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. In 1904, he joined the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]],&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot;/&gt; entered the Methodist seminary, and became a [[pastor]] for a while.&lt;ref name='apologetics'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ukapologetics.net/09/iglesia.htm | title = Who are the 'Iglesia ni Cristo'? | author = Robin A. Brace | date = February 2009 | accessdate = 2011-06-07 | publisher = UK Apologetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manalo left the [[Methodist]] church in 1913, and associated himself with [[atheist]] and [[agnostic]] peers.&lt;ref name='nhi'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nhi.gov.ph/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=158 | title = 122nd Birth Anniversary of Ka Felix Manalo | author = Quennie Ann J.

On November 1913, Manalo secluded himself with religious literature and unused notebooks in a friend's house in [[Pasay]], instructing everyone in the house not to disturb him. He emerged out of seclusion three days later with his new-found doctrines.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sophia&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Punta.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Iglesia ni Cristo's first congregation]]

Manalo, together with his wife, went to Punta, Santa Ana, Manila on July 1914, and started preaching. He left the congregation in the care of his first ordained minister, and returned to Taguig to evangelize. In Taguig, he was ridiculed and [[stoning|stoned]] in his meetings with locals. He was later able to baptize a few converts, including some of his persecutors. He later registered his new-found religion as the Iglesia ni Cristo ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for Church of Christ) on July 27, 1914 at the [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Bureau of Commerce]] as a [[corporation sole]] with himself as the first executive minister.&lt;ref name='senate'&gt;{{cite book | url = http://senate.gov.ph/lisdata/112339552!.pdf | title = P.S.

[[File:Holiday to Cebu and Bohol 114.jpg|thumb|The Iglesia ni Cristo congregation in Cebu]]

By 1936, the INC had 85,000 members. This figure grew to 200,000 by 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;mb&quot;/&gt; A [[Cebu]] congregation was built in 1937—the first to be established outside of [[Luzon]], and the first in the [[Visayas]].

Felix Manalo died on April 12, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;mb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nhi2&quot;/&gt;

The first overseas INC mission was sent in 1968 on its 54th anniversary. The INC started operating a [[radio station]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;mb&quot;/&gt; In 1973, the church established a congregation in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] on July 27, and in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] (both in the [[United States]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;nhi2&quot;/&gt; The Ministerial Institute of Development, currently the [[New Era University]] College of Evangelical Ministry, was founded in 1974 in [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], Manila. It moved to its current location in Quezon City in 1978. As of 1995, it had 4,500 students and five extension schools in Bulacan, [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Pampanga]] and [[Rizal]]. In 1971, the INC Central Office building was built in Quezon City. Fifteen years later, the Central Temple was added in the complex. The Tabernacle, a tent-like multipurpose building which can accommodate up to 4,000 persons, was finished in 1989. The complex also includes the New Era University, a [[tertiary education|higher-education]] institution run by the INC.&lt;ref name=&quot;reed&quot;/&gt;

In September 2011 the INC bought 59 parcels of land in [[Scenic, South Dakota]] for approximately $700,000.00.  Scenic is a ghost town in western South Dakota.  No plans for the land have been revealed by the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/filipino-church-buys-scenic-property/article_57d68e24-e7e1-11e0-8a98-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Filipino church buys Scenic property |date=September 26, 2011 |newspaper=[[Rapid City Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 28, 2012 the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) holds simultaneous Grand Evangelical Missions (GEM) nationwide as part of its campaign for the year 2012 for the intensive propagation of God’s words. One of the 19 venues for the Grand Evangelical Mission is the Quirino Grandstand, Rizal Park, Manila. The INC’s five ecclesiastical districts in Metro Manila, along with the other districts in the provinces of Bulacan and the Calabarzon participated in this event. GEM held at the following venues: Isabela Sports Complex, Isabela; Jose V.

Iglesia ni Cristo church buildings (chapels) serve as places of worship and other religious functions, are &quot;vehicles for glorifying God.&quot; These are described by ''Culture and customs of the Philippines'', a book published by [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], as structures &quot;which employ exterior neo-Gothic vertical support columns with tall narrow windows between, interlocking trapezoids, and rosette motifs, as well as tower and spires.&quot; There are multiple entrances leading to the main sanctuary, where males and females sit on either side of the aisle facing a [[dais]] where sermons are made. The choir loft is located behind the dais, and in larger churches, [[baptistry]] pools for [[immersion baptism]] are located at the back of the church.&lt;ref name='culture and customs'&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC | page = 86 | title = Culture and customs of the Philippines | author = Paul A.

The Central Temple which opened in July 1984 can accommodate up to 7,000 persons, and cost about US$2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;reformed&quot;/&gt; The Central Temple features octagonal spires, &quot;fine latticework&quot; and ribbed windows. Recent buildings are variations of [[Carlos A. Santos-Viola]]'s designs on the Central Temple. These are designed to accommodate 250 to 1,000 persons while larger churches in [[Metro Manila]] and provincial capitals can accommodate up to 3,000 persons.&lt;ref name=&quot;reed&quot;/&gt; Prominent architects, such as [[Juan Nakpil]] (a [[National Artist of the Philippines]] for [[architecture]]) and [[Carlos Raúl Villanueva]], had been involved in designing INC churches while the Engineering and Construction Department of INC, established in 1971, oversees the uniformity in design of church buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture and customs&quot;/&gt;

==Uniforms==
The uniform for deacons and deaconesses consists of a suit (outside the Philippines) or Barong (in the Philippines) and a white dress (outside the Philippines) or White Terno with Panuelo (in the Philippines) respectively. The choir uniform consists of Jade green and cream robes abroad, or plain cream robes (in the Philippines) and Cream Robes with Pine Green Linings (for Central Temple Choir use only).

Iglesia ni Cristo has had three executive ministers ({{lang-tl|Tagapamahalang Pangkahalatan}}), that lead the church administration in overseeing the faith of the brethren. Bro. Eduardo V. Manalo, as the current executive minister, serves as the church's leader, and, in this capacity, manages the administration of the church.&lt;ref name='exec'&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=501504 | title = Iglesia ni Cristo leader Manalo passes away | author = Katherine Adraneda | newspaper = The Philippine Star | accessdate = 2011-06-11 | date = 2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the deputy executive minister and other senior ministers, the executive minister forms the Central Administration of Iglesia ni Cristo.&lt;ref name='pcij'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcij.org/stories/2002/inc2.html | title = A Most Powerful Union | author = Malou Mangahas | coauthors = Avigail M.

Ministers are encouraged to [[marriage|marry]] for the purpose of obeying the command to marry and multiply.

The Central Office in Quezon City is Iglesia ni Cristo's headquarters. It was formerly located in [[Manila]] during its early years, then in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], and later in  [[Makati]] before moving to its present site. It houses the offices of INC's administration. Administration and ministerial work are delegated into ecclesiastical districts (termed divisions prior to 1990) which are led by district ministers (formerly, division ministers). Ecclesiastical districts comprise 30 to 120 congregations (referred to as locales) on average. The ecclesiastical district's range is generally a single province of the Philippines; however, populous provinces often have more than one ecclesiastical district.&lt;ref name=&quot;reed&quot;/&gt; There were about 5,000 Iglesia ni Cristo locales in 96 countries in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;mb&quot;/&gt; 200 of these congregations, including 150 in 39 [[U.S. state]]s, were outside the Philippines in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;reed&quot;/&gt; All locales were directly managed by Felix Manalo until 1924 when the first ecclesiastical district was organized in [[Pampanga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sophia&quot;/&gt;

==Beliefs==
===Church===
Adherents hold that Iglesia ni Cristo is the only true [[Christian Church|church of Jesus Christ]] as restored by [[Felix Manalo]]. The church recognizes Jesus Christ as the founder of the Church. Meanwhile, its reestablishment is seen as the signal for the [[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]].&lt;ref name='Harper 2'&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sacredtribesjournal.org/stj/images/Encyclopedia/Iglesia_Cristo.pdf | pages = 1–3 | journal = StJ's Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements | author = Anne C.

===Bible===
Manalo concluded after his three-day seclusion that &quot;that the conflicting doctrines of various Christian groups could be resolved only through a fresh examination of the Bible from a non-Western perspective.&quot; The Iglesia ni Cristo believes in the [[infallibility of the Bible]], which is its sole source of authority.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit===
The Iglesia ni Cristo believes that [[God the Father]] is the only true God. The church believes that God is [[omnipotent]], and that He created all, including Jesus Christ, the Son. Meanwhile, the [[Holy Spirit]] is the power sent by God in the name of Jesus. The Holy Spirit is in the INC ministers giving them the exclusive ability to interpret the Bible correctly.&lt;ref name='bereans'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thebereans.net/prof-inc.shtml | title = Iglesia Ni Cristo (1914) | publisher = The Bereans: Apologetics Research Ministries (Philippines) | accessdate = 2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the INC [[nontrinitarianism|rejects the trinity]] as a heresy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harper 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reed&quot;/&gt; They believe that this position is attested by Jesus Christ and the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sophia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name='pasugo november 1968'&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www4.webng.com/emanalo/Files/Pasugo%20Nov%201968.pdf | date = November 1968 | language = Tagalog | page = 19 | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | publisher = Iglesia ni Cristo | issn = 0116-1636 | location = Quezon City | title = Pasugo | accessdate = 2011-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

God [[wikt:Special:Search/sanctified|sanctified]] him to be [[Impeccability|without sin]], and bestowed him the titles &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;[[Son of God]]&quot;. The church sees Jesus as God's highest creation, and denies [[divinity of Jesus|his divinity]]. Thus, INC theology is classified as [[Arian]] by Robin A.

[[File:felixManalo.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Felix Manalo on the cover of ''Pasugo'']]

===Felix Manalo===
Felix Manalo is said to be the restorer of the church of Christ, and &quot;God's last messenger&quot;(sugo in Tagalog).&lt;ref name=&quot;apologetics&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;catholic&quot;/&gt;

INC divides time into three periods: the era of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] (from [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] to the birth of [[Moses]]), the era of the [[Prophets of Christianity|prophets]] (from the birth of Moses to the [[birth of Jesus]]), and the [[Christian era]] (from the birth of Jesus to the [[Last Judgment]]). Adherents believe him to be the last messenger of God in the Christian Era.

The INC says that Manalo is the &quot;angel from the east&quot;, mentioned in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 7:1–3 who started the INC at the same time
that [[World War I]] broke out. This period of time according to INC is referred to as the ends of the earth
(cf Is 41:9-10; 43:5-6) the time when the end of the world is near, even at the
doors (cf. Mt. 24:3, 33), which began with the outbreak of a war of global
proportions (cf. Mt. 24:6-7)&lt;ref name=&quot;Harper 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bocobo, Antonio E., JR. “On Choosing The True Religion.” October – December
1991, pp. 14,15&lt;/ref&gt;  Felix Manalo is from the Philippines, which they say is in the ‘center’ of the [[Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;INC quotes Isaiah 43:5 from a inexact paraphrase by Protestant Bible scholar [[James Moffatt]] that reads, &quot;From the far east will I bring your offspring.&quot; Citing this translation, one Iglesia work states, &quot;Is it not clear that you can read the words ‘far east’? Clear! Why does not the Tagalog Bible show them? That is not our fault, but that of those who translated the Tagalog Bible from English—the Catholics and Protestants&quot; (Isang Pagbubunyag Sa Iglesia ni Cristo, 1964:131)&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘four winds’ in Revelation 7:1-3, they say refers to World War I and the four angels are the four leaders known as the [[The Big Four (World War I)|big four]]([[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Lloyd George]], [[Georges Clemenceau]], and [[Vittorio Orlando]]) who they say worked on the prevention of the war.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-DkaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pyYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7492,4958828&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The four angels holding the winds were leaders of nations, who were also messengers, or angels, as written in I Pet. 2:13-14. The wind that they were controlling refers to war as mentioned in Jer. 4:11-13, 19. This was the war that broke out on 1914. The four leaders of nations who worked on the prevention of the war, which broke out in 1914, were Lloyd George of Great Britain, Clemenceau of France, Orlando of Italy, and Wilson of America. They were better known as the Big Four&quot; (World History, p. 494)--(Pasugo, July 1964, p. 33).&lt;/ref&gt;

Manalo is also portrayed as the fulfillment of several passages in Isaiah and other [[books of the Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reed&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sophia&quot;/&gt; Manalo's titles are &quot;ravenous bird from the east&quot; (Isa. 46:11), &quot;worm Jacob&quot; (Ps. 22:6-7), &quot;one shepherd&quot; (John 10:6)and &quot;the last Elijah&quot; (Mt.17:10-11; Mal.4:5)

As the one who established the INC, Manalo was the chief administrator, chief theologian and spiritual leader of the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;reformed&quot;/&gt; As such, he was the ultimate authority in all aspects of the church, and effectively &quot;the foremost Biblical authority for all humanity and the divinely designated leader of a reestablished church of Christ in the modern world.&quot; His influence within the church caused people from other religions to call INC and its members &quot;''Iglesia ni Manalo''&quot; (Tagalog for Church of Manalo) and &quot;''Manalistas''&quot;, respectively,&lt;ref name=&quot;reed&quot;/&gt; labels INC members consider as both pejoratives and blasphemous.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Eschatology===
{{see also|Christian eschatology}}
Members believe that when a person dies, his/her body and [[Soul in the Bible|soul]] both die and go into the grave where both would remain until the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. Upon his return, all dead members of the Iglesia ni Cristo, including Manalo, would be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected]] to join living INC members. They would be rewarded by living in the Holy City together with God the Father, Christ, and Manalo. After 1,000 years, a second resurrection would occur, and non-INC members will experience [[second death]] which is the [[Lake of Fire]] or Dagat-dagatang Apoy (in Tagalog).&lt;ref name=&quot;Harper 2&quot;/&gt;

===Worship and prayer===
The church conducts regular [[worship service]]s, one during the week, and one during the weekend. It is conducted in the local languages (for example, English, Tagalog and French). It involves singing of 2 extra hymns and 3 hymns, prayers, preaching and offering, benediction, recessional hymn{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} which some observers, including Robert R. Reed, label as tithing.&lt;ref name=&quot;reed&quot;/&gt; Both God the Father and Jesus are worshiped.&lt;ref name=&quot;bereans&quot;/&gt; The ministers of every congregation in a given worship service use the same [[sermon]] outline prepared by the executive minister. Deacons and Deaconesses guide worshipers to their seats and collect offerings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harper 1&quot;/&gt; The choir wears robes while singing in the worship service the color of the adult choir robe is green and white(abroad and central temple) and plain cream robes  in the Philippines, while children's is plain cream robes The Singing of hymns is led by the locale's choir. The first [[hymnbook]], termed as ''Himnario'', which contained about 300 songs, was published in 1937. Children's worship services are held every weekend. They use similar lessons as the standard worship services taught using the [[Socratic method]] (question and answer).&lt;ref name=&quot;sophia&quot;/&gt; The church teaches that willfully forsaking the worship service is a grievous sin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Levi M. Castro|date = May 2007|title=God's Last Work of Salvation|journal=Pasugo|publisher=Iglesia ni Cristo|location=Quezon City|volume=59|issue=5|pages=28–30|issn=0116-1636}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus members are expected to attend the congregational worship services twice a week without fail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ando 1969 334–345&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2753902 |author = Hirofumi Ando |year=1969 |title=A Study of the Iglesia Ni Cristo: A Politico-Religious Sect in the Philippines|journal= Pacific Affairs |publisher=University of British Columbia |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=334–345 | jstor = 2753902 | issn = 0030-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since former [[President of the Philippines|Philippine president]] [[Manuel L.

[[Diosdado Macapagal]] has refused INC's support during his runs for [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] in 1957, and re-election for [[President of the Philippines|President]] in 1965 – in which he lost to [[Ferdinand Marcos]].

====Karl Keating====
[[Karl Keating]], the founder of [[Catholic Answers]] accused Jose Ventilacion, an INC minister, of breaking an agreement in 1990 for a one-on-one debate made by the two organizations in [[National City, California]] ''([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2953664829520280607# part 1], [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1936905102193057313# part 2])''. Instead of a one-on-one debate, Keating says that Ventilacion had three helpers assisting him, and that &quot;they&quot; allegedly were shouting at him during the debate. The head projector at the side of Mr. Ventilacion was not also in the agreement. Keating views the church as being built on a set of ''&quot;[[anti-catholic]]&quot;'' doctrines, and that their lessons, as well as their ''God's Message'' magazine are dedicated more to debunking Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] beliefs and doctrines, although he did reveal the extent of his studies concerning the church save for his own account of the debate he had with Ventilacion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keating&quot;&gt;Keating, Karl [http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1990/9002fea1.asp 'Into the Maw of the Cult'] ''This Rock'' (San Diego: Catholic Answers, February 1990) - Retrieved May 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;debate&quot;&gt;The debate between INC's Ventilacion and Catholic apologist Karl Keating can be watched here [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2953664829520280607# part 1] and [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1936905102193057313# part 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism and Protestantism remain among the predominant religions in the Philippines especially in Luzon and Visayas islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html |title=CIA-The World Factbook-Field Listing|accessdate=2008-11-11|date=2008-11-06|work=CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keating also states that the INC began as a Protestant sect, comparing its doctrines with those of the American [[Campbellite]]s saying it &quot;heavily borrowed&quot;  from the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keating&quot; /&gt;  Keating criticized the Iglesia ni Cristo for teaching that the [[Whore of Babylon]] is the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and that the [[Beast of Revelation]] is the [[Pope]], a belief shared with some other Christian religious organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bilhartz |first=Terry D.|editor=|title=Urban Religion and the Second Great Awakening |url=http://books.google.com/?id=pK_DqHjUfg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA115,M1|year= 1986|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, New Jersey|isbn=0-8386-3227-0 |page=115|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/Issue-4_Is_the_Vatican_II_Church_the_Whore_of_Babylon.html |title=Is the Vatican II Church of Antipope John Paul II the Whore of Babylon?|accessdate=2008-11-11 |last=Dimond |first=Brother Peter, OSB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an assertion which the Catholic Church denies. Keating says the this INC position is based on a [[Latin]]-language version of [[gematria]], in which numerical values of the letters in a name or phrase are added to find a number with symbolic significance. When applied to an alleged title of the Pope, [[Vicarius Filii Dei]] (Vicar of the Son of God), the resulting number is [[666]], which is one of several alternative numbers known as the &quot;[[Number of the Beast]].&quot; Keating says the Iglesia ni Cristo also claims that &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; is engraved on the Pope's [[tiara]]{{#tag:Ref|Karl Keating writes, &quot;The argument goes like this: 'The number 666 is the sum of the letters of the beast's title. The Pope's title is Vicarius Filii Dei (Vicar of the Son of God). [Actually, it's not. His title is Vicarius Christi (Vicar of Christ).] We know this is the papal title because it appears prominently on the tiara of the popes; the letters are formed out of hundreds of jewels.

''Catholic Answers'' rejects the Iglesia ni Cristo's interpretation of certain Bible verses and use of some translations to support its doctrines. They also criticized INC's use of the [[George Lamsa]] translation of Acts 20:28 as proof that the true church is called &quot;Church of Christ&quot;. They argue that it is not based on the [[Koine Greek|original Greek]]. In Greek, the phrase is &quot;the church of God&quot; (tan ekklasian tou Theou) not &quot;the church of Christ&quot; (tan ekklasian tou Christou), in which the Church of Christ contends that the following phrase &quot;which he has purchased with his blood&quot; greatly proves that the said [[Koine Greek|original Greek]] is exposed to confusing interpretation, that if the &quot;Church of God&quot; is the correct interpretation, the following phrase directly contradict the teaching that God is immortal(1 Timothy 1:17) and that God is a spirit (John 4:24), has no flesh and bones (Lk. 24:36-39).

====Charles Caldwell Ryrie====
[[Charles Caldwell Ryrie]] has criticized the INC for misquoting his Ryrie Study Bible regarding {{bibleverse||John|1:1|!all}} in the May/June 1984 issue of the ''Pasugo''.
{{cquote|
&quot;In the annotations of his Ryrie Study Bible he had this to say about the phrase in John 1:1 and the Word was with God. In this verse the Word (Christ) is said to be with God (that is, in communion with and yet distinct from God). Therefore, when Dr. Ryrie says, that the Word is distinct from God he is saying the Word is not the same, but rather separate or different from God.&quot; (Pasugo 1984, pp. 14-15) }}

Ryrie has been quoted as saying, in a letter to Robert Elliff, the author of the book, ''Iglesia Ni Cristo: The Only True Church?'' &quot;Anyone can look in my Study Bible and see how conveniently this author [the INC] omitted the last phrase in the note of John 1:1. The
full note reads: “In this verse the Word (Christ) is said to be with God (i.e., in communion
with and yet distinct from God) and to be God (i.e., identical in essence with God).” If that is not clear enough to say that I believe in the full deity and equality of Christ, let anyone read the notes at John 10:30 and 20:28. The doctrinal summary in the back of the Bible under Trinity is also quite clear. &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliff&quot;&gt;[http://www.examineiglesianicristo.com/honesty3.html Elliff, Robert 'Iglesia Ni Cristo: The Only True Church?'

{{Main|Conflicts between Iglesia ni Cristo and Members Church of God International}}
On April 18, 2005, MCGI members headed by former INC member Marcos Mataro scuffled after a scheduled religious debate with members of INC in a Jollibee outlet in [[Apalit, Pampanga]], Philippines. Apalit Mayor Tirso Lacanilao said &quot;scores were injured&quot;, but that there were no serious injuries. The MCGI radio program ''Ang Dating Daan'' (ADD) and Iglesia Ni Cristo had been trading accusations in their respective television programs. This had even led to an exchange of lawsuits. It was reported that the clash began when an ADD follower identified only as &quot;Mataro&quot; provoked INC followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090108100626/http://dynamic.philonline.com:8080/?page=police03_apr23_2005 Religious confrontation gets physical in Apalit] Manila Standard, April 23, 2005 (archived from [http://dynamic.philonline.com:8080/?page=police03_apr23_2005 the original] on 2009-01-08)&lt;/ref&gt;

Local police, on orders of the town mayor had gone to the restaurant and tried to stop the debate for lack of a mayor's permit. The police had been instructed to transfer the venue of the debate either at the ADD convention center or at the INC chapel in an effort to prevent any trouble.  Mataro insisted on pushing through with the debate, however, assuring no trouble. Leaders of the MCGI group said they do not trust the local policemen. Mataro shouted, which reportedly provoked some INC members to a confrontation, and led to a free-for-all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20051113165306/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/04/22/PROV2005042233244.html Followers of Dating Daan and INC clash in Pampanga; cops accused of partiality] Manila Bulletin, April 22, 2005 (archived from [http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/04/22/PROV2005042233244.html the original])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2005/04/23/news/sect.hit.for.not.cooperating.in.probe.of.brawl.html Sect hit for 'not cooperating' in probe of brawl] Sun Star Pampanga, April 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The main accusation of restraint of press freedom arises from the church's seeking to stop the publication of  writer [[Ross Tipon]]'s book, ''The Power and the Glory: The Cult of Manalo''. The INC says the book contains &quot;outright blasphemy&quot; towards the late founder Felix Manalo by likening the INC to a criminal syndicate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Echeminada&quot;&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/archives.php?aid=196034&amp;type=1 Iglesia seeks TRO vs publication of blasphemous book |The Philippine Star]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robles&quot;&gt;Robles, JoJo. [http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=jojoRobles_may25_2005 'INC against free press?']{dead link|date=October 2011}, ''Manila Standard Today Online'' (May 25, 2005). Retrieved July 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tipon, represented by lawyer Fervyn Pinzon, said stopping the publication of  the book infringes on his freedom expression rights. An [[Lawyer|attorney]] representing the INC, Abraham Espejo states &quot;direct assault on freedom of religion and seeks to destroy the image of the INC&quot; and &quot;The publication of the criminal manuscript will trigger social unrest, Millions of people may come out in the streets and this may lead to violence.&quot; The Iglesia ni Cristo alleges that the book has defamed its organization and [[Felix Manalo]]. The INC seeks [[Philippine peso|PHP]]1,000,000 in damages from Tipon and the unknown publisher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Echeminada&quot; /&gt;
