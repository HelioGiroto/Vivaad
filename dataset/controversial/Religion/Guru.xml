'''Guru''' ([[Devanagari]] {{lang|sa|गुरु}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] term for &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;master&quot;, especially in [[Indian religions]]. The [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[guru-shishya tradition]] is the [[oral tradition]] or religious doctrine transmitted from teacher to student. In the United States, the meaning of &quot;guru&quot; has been used to cover anyone who acquires followers, especially by exploiting their naiveté, due to the inflationary use of the term in [[new religious movement]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forsthoefel and Humes&quot;&gt;Forsthoefel, T. and C. Humes. ''Gurus in America'' (2005) p.3. SUNY Publishers ISBN 0-7914-6574-8&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Etymology ==
{{quotation|The syllable gu means shadows&lt;br /&gt;The syllable ru, he who disperses them,&lt;br /&gt;Because of the power to disperse darkness&lt;br /&gt;the guru is thus named.|Advayataraka [[Upanishad]] 14—18, verse 5}}
The word ''{{IAST|guru}}'', a noun, means &quot;teacher&quot; in [[Sanskrit]] and in other languages derived from or borrowing words from Sanskrit, such as [[Hindi]], Punjabi,[[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The  malayalam term Acharyan or [[Asan]] are derivered from the Sanskrit word [[Acharya]]. It is transliterated in different ways such as Asaan, Ashan, [[Aasaan]] etc.

As a noun the word means the imparter of knowledge (''[[jnana|jñāna]]''; also [[Pali]]: ''ñāna''). As an adjective, it means 'heavy,' or 'weighty,' in the sense of &quot;heavy with knowledge,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tirha&quot;&gt;[[Bhakti Ballabh Tirtha Goswami Maharaj|Tirha, B.

''Yoga and the Hindu Tradition'' (1977). p.226. University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0-226-85116-8&lt;/ref&gt; The word has its roots in the Sanskrit ''gri'' (to invoke, or to praise), and may have a connection to the word ''gur'', meaning 'to raise, lift up, or to make an effort'.&lt;ref name=Lowitz&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Sanskrit Words''|first=Leza A.|last=Lowitz|pages=85|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|year=2004|id=1-880-6568-76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional etymology of the term &quot;guru&quot; is based on the interplay between darkness and light. The guru is seen as the one who &quot;dispels the darkness of ignorance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dict&quot;&gt;Grimes, John. ''A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English.'' (1996) p.133. SUNY Press. ISBN 0-7914-3067-7 &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The etymological derivation of the word guru is in this verse from [[Guru Gita]]: 'The root ''gu'' stands for darkness; ''ru'' for its removal. The removal of the darkness of ignorance in the heart is indicated by the word &quot;guru'&quot; (Note: Guru Gita is a spiritual text in the [[Markandeya Purana]], in the form of a dialog between Siva and Parvati on the nature of the guru and the guru/disciple relationship.) [...] the meanings of ''gu'' and ''ru'' can also be traced to the ''Panini-sutras gu samvarane'' and ''ru himsane'', indicating concealment and its annulment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dict2&quot;&gt;Ibid. &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Guru: remover of darkness, bestower of light'&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;krs&quot;&gt;[[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti, J.]] ''The Awakening of Intelligence.'' (1987) p.139. HarperCollins. ISBN 0-06-064834-1&lt;/ref&gt; In some texts it is described that the syllables ''gu'' ({{lang|sa|गु}}) and ''ru'' ({{lang|sa|रु}}) stand for darkness and light, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray&quot;&gt;Murray, Thomas R. ''Moral Development Theories - Secular and Religious: A Comparative Study.'' (1997). p. 231. Greenwood Press &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the term is a combination of the two words ''gu''(darkness) and ''ru'' (light), so together they mean 'divine light that dispels all darkness.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Guru is the light that disperses the darkness of ignorance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reender Kranenborg]] disagrees, stating that darkness and light have nothing to do with the word ''guru''. He describes this as a [[folk etymology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kraneborg2002&quot;&gt;Kranenborg, Reender (Dutch language) ''Neohindoeïstische bewegingen in Nederland : een encyclopedisch overzicht'' page 50 (En: ''Neo-Hindu movements in the Netherlands'', published by Kampen Kok cop.

De goeroe als geestelijk raadsman Als we naar het verschijnsel goeroe in India kijken, kunnen we constateren dat er op zijn minst vier vormen van goeroeschap te onderscheiden zijn. De eerste vorm is die van de 'geestelijk raadsman'. Voordat we dit verder uitwerken eerst iets over de etymologie. Het woord goeroe komt uit het Sanskriet, wordt geschreven als 'guru' en betekent 'zwaar zijn', 'gewichtig zijn', vooral in figuurlijk opzicht. Zo krijgt het begrip 'guru' de betekenis van 'groot', 'geweldig' of 'belangrijk', en iets verdergaand krijgt het aspecten van 'eerbiedwaardig' en 'vererenswaardig'. Al vrij snel word dit toegepast op de 'geestelijk leraar'. In allerlei populaire literatuur, ook in India zelf, wordt het woord 'guru' uiteengelegd in 'gu' en 'ru', als omschrijvingen voor licht en duister; de goeroe is dan degene die zijn leerling uit het materiële duister overbrengt naar het geestelijk licht. Misschien doe een goeroe dat ook inderdaad, maar het heeft niets met de betekenis van het woord te maken, het is volksetymologie.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;English translation &quot;a. The guru as spiritual adviser: If we look at the phenomenon of gurus in India then we can see that there are at least four forms of guruship that can be distinguished. The first form is that of the &quot;spiritual adviser.&quot; Before we will elaborate on this, first something about the etymology. The word ''guru'' comes from Sanskrit and is written as 'guru' en means 'being heavy', 'being weighty', especially metaphorically. In that way, the concept of guru gets the meaning of 'big', 'great', or 'important' and somewhat further it also gets aspects of 'respectable' and 'honorable'. Soon it is applied to the 'spiritual adviser'. In various popular literature, in India herself too, the word 'guru' is explained in the parts 'gu' and 'ru', as descriptions for light and darkness: the guru is then the person who bring the student from the material darkness into the spiritual light. A guru may indeed do that, but it has nothing to do with the meaning of the word, it is folk etymology.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another etymology of the word &quot;guru&quot; found in the [[Guru Gita]], includes ''gu'' as &quot;beyond the qualities&quot; and ''ru'' as &quot;devoid of form&quot;, stating that &quot;He who bestows that nature which transcend the qualities is said to be guru&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gurugita&quot;&gt;''Gurugita'' v. 46 ''gukāram ca gunatitam rukāram rupavarjitam gunatitasvarupam ca yo dadyātsa guruh smrtah''&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings of &quot;gu&quot; and &quot;ru&quot; can also be traced to the [[Sūtra|Sutras]] indicating concealment and its annulment.&lt;ref name=dict /&gt;

In ''Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion'', Pierre Riffard makes a distinction between &quot;occult&quot; and &quot;scientific&quot; etymologies, citing as an example of the former the etymology of 'guru' in which the derivation is presented as ''gu'' (&quot;darkness&quot;) and ''ru'' ('to push away'); the latter he exemplifies by &quot;guru&quot; with the meaning of 'heavy'.&lt;ref name=&quot;wesr&quot;&gt;Riffard, Pierre A. in ''Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion'' Faivre A. &amp; [[Wouter Hanegraaff|Hanegraaff W.]] (Eds.)

== Guru in Hinduism ==
{{see|list of Hindu gurus}}


The importance of finding a guru who can impart transcendental knowledge (''vidyā'') is emphasised in Hinduism. One of the main Hindu texts, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], is a dialogue between God in the form of [[Krishna]] and his friend [[Arjuna]], a [[Kshatriya]] prince who accepts Krishna as his guru on the battlefield, prior to a large battle. Not only does this dialogue outline many of the ideals of Hinduism, but their relationship is considered an ideal one of Guru-Shishya. In the Gita, Krishna speaks to Arjuna of the importance of finding a guru:
{{quotation|Acquire the transcendental knowledge from a Self-realized master by humble reverence, by sincere inquiry, and by service. The wise ones who have realized the Truth will impart the Knowledge to you.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavad Gītā]], c4 s34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the sentence mentioned above, ''guru'' is used more or less interchangeably with ''[[satguru]]'' (literally: ''true teacher'') and ''satpurusha.'' Compare also [[Swami]]. The disciple of a guru is called a ''[[shishya|śiṣya]]'' or ''[[Apprenticeship|chela]]''. Often a guru lives in an [[ashram]] or in a ''[[gurukula]]'' (the guru's household), together with his disciples. The lineage of a guru, spread by disciples who carry on the guru's message, is known as the guru ''[[parampara]]'', or disciplic succession.

The role of the guru continues in the original sense of the word in such Hindu traditions as the ''[[Vedānta]]'', [[yoga]], ''[[tantra]]'' and ''[[bhakti]]'' schools. Indeed, it is now a standard part of Hinduism that a guru is one's spiritual guide on earth. In some more mystical traditions it is believed that the guru could awaken dormant spiritual knowledge within the pupil. The act of doing this is known as ''[[shaktipat]]''.

In Hinduism, the guru is considered a respected person with saintly qualities who enlightens the mind of his or her disciple, an educator from whom one receives the initiatory mantra, and one who instructs in rituals and religious ceremonies. The Vishnu Smriti and [[Manu Smriti]] regard the teacher and the mother and father as the most venerable influences on an individual.

In Indian culture, a person without a guru or a teacher ([[acharya]]) was once looked down on as an orphan or unfortunate one. The word ''anatha'' in Sanskrit means &quot;the one without a teacher.&quot; An acharya is the giver of ''gyan'' (knowledge) in the form of ''shiksha'' (instruction). A guru also gives ''[[diksha]]'' ''initiation'' which is the spiritual awakening of the disciple by the grace of the guru. Diksha is also considered to be the procedure of bestowing the divine powers of a guru upon the disciple, through which the disciple progresses continuously along the path to divinity.

The concept of the &quot;guru&quot; can be traced as far back as the [[early Upanishads]], where the idea of the Divine Teacher on earth first manifested from its early [[Brahmin]] associations.

=== The guru-shishya tradition ===
{{Main|Guru-shishya tradition}}

The guru-shishya tradition is the transmission of teachings from a ''guru'' (teacher, {{lang | hi | गुरू}}) to a '{{IAST|śiṣya}}' (disciple, {{lang | hi | िशष्य}}). In this relationship, subtle and advanced knowledge is conveyed and received through the student's respect, commitment, devotion and obedience. The student eventually masters the knowledge that the guru embodies.

The dialogue between guru and disciple is a fundamental component of Hinduism, established in the oral traditions of the [[Upanishads]] (c. 2000 BC). The term Upanishad derives from the Sanskrit words ''upa'' (near), ''ni'' (down) and şad (to sit) — &quot;sitting down near&quot; a spiritual teacher to receive instruction. Examples include the relationship between [[Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]] in the [[Mahabharata]] ([[Bhagavad Gita]]), and between [[Rama]] and [[Hanuman]] in the [[Ramayana]]. In the Upanishads, the guru-disciple relationship appears in many settings (a husband answers a wife's questions about immortality; a teenage boy is taught by [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], who is Death personified, etc.) Sometimes the sages are female, and sometimes the instruction is sought by kings.

In the [[Vedas]], the ''brahmavidya'' or knowledge of [[Brahman]] is communicated from guru to shishya orally.

The word [[Sikh]] is derived from the Sanskrit ''shishya.''&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Harbans, ''Guru Nanak and the Origins of the Sikh Faith''. pp. 13, (1969), Asia Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing a disciple===

At the beginning of the ''Upadesasahasri'' [[Samkara]] provides a list of criteria by which the guru assesses prospective disciples.  It is clear that Samkara did not regard the examination of candidates as a mere formality. The guru assesses the applicant using the following criteria: the candidate is not attached to anything impermanent; he has renounced the desire for a son; he has no desire for wealth; he is at peace with himself, master of his senses and compassionate.  In addition, the guru checks the applicant's caste, behaviour, knowledge of Veda and even earlier generations of his family.

Knowledge was not regarded as a universal right, as it often is today.  Access to knowledge via the guru was the privilege of a very small minority.  It was the norm to transmit knowledge in the erudite language of [[Sanskrit]] without translation.  Mastery of Sanskrit was therefore essential. What was taught by guru was the universal reality of [[Brahman]], but access to this knowledge was highly restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Angot Michel, Samkara, la Quete de l'Etre, Editions Points, Paris 2009, ISBN 978-2-7578-1283-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimate knowledge was founded on the Veda, and the guru followed the instruction of the texts: no one belonging to the [[Shudra|sudra]] caste was allowed access.&lt;ref&gt;Brahmasutra, Brahmasutrabhasya, I.3.38, Samkara&lt;/ref&gt;  Women and foreigners were also excluded.

=== Classification of gurus ===

In his book about neo-Hindu movements in (for example Wilmer)  the Netherlands, Kranenborg distinguishes four types of gurus in India:&lt;ref name=&quot;kraneborg2002&quot; /&gt;
#the ''spiritual advisor'' for higher [[caste]] Hindus who also performs traditional rituals and who is not connected to a temple (thus not a priest);
#the ''enlightened master'' who derives his authority from his experience, such as achieving [[moksha|enlightenment]]. This type appears in [[bhakti movement]]s and in [[tantra]] and asks for unquestioning obedience, and can have Western followers. Westerners can even become one, as have, for example [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]], and [[Isaac Shapiro]].
#the ''[[Avatar]]'', a guru who considers himself to be an incarnation of God, God-like, or an instrument of God, or who is considered as such by others.
#A &quot;guru&quot; in the form of a book i.e. the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] in the [[Sikh]] religion;

=== Attributes of guru ===
{{Section OR|date=July 2009}}

Gurus of several Hindu denominations are often referred to as [[Satguru]]s.

In the Upanishads{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, five signs of satguru (true guru) are mentioned.

{{quotation|In the presence of the satguru; Knowledge flourishes (''Gyana raksha''); Sorrow diminishes (''Dukha kshaya''); Joy wells up without any reason (''Sukha aavirbhava''); Abundance dawns (''Samriddhi''); All talents manifest (''Sarva samvardhan'').}}

According to the Indologist [[Georg Feuerstein]], the preceptors were traditionally treated with great reverence, granted excessive authority, and identified with the ''[[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] Reality''. He writes that partly to counterbalance this deification, some Hindu schools began to emphasize that the real teacher is the transcendental ''[[Soul_(spirit)#Hinduism|Self]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;feuerstein1990&quot;&gt;[[Georg Feusterstein|Feuerstein, Georg]] Dr. ''Encyclopedic dictionary of yoga'' Published by Paragon House 1st edition (1990) ISBN 1-55778-244-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shiva Samhita]], a [[Middle Ages|late medieval]] text on [[Hatha yoga]], enshrines the figure of the guru as essential for [[moksha|liberation]], and asserts that the disciple should give all his or her property and livestock to the guru upon ''[[diksha]]'' (initiation).&lt;ref name=&quot;feuerstein1990&quot; /&gt;

The [[Vishnu Smriti]] and [[Manu Smriti]] regard the Acharya (teacher/guru), along with the mother and the father, as the most venerable individuals. The mother and father are the first &quot;guru,&quot; the spiritual guru is the second.

The [[Mundaka Upanishad]] says that in order to realize the supreme godhead, one should surrender one's self before the guru who knows the secrets of the [[Vedas]].

On the role of the guru, [[Swami Sivananda]] asks: &quot;Do you realize now the sacred significance and the supreme importance of the Guru's role in the evolution of man? It was not without reason that the India of the past carefully tended and kept alive the lamp of Guru-Tattva. It is therefore not without reason that India, year after year, age after age, commemorates anew this ancient concept of the Guru, adores it and pays homage to it again and again, and thereby re-affirms its belief and allegiance to it. For, the true Indian knows that the Guru is the only guarantee for the individual to transcend the bondage of sorrow and death, and experience the Consciousness of the Reality.&quot;

Some scriptures and gurus have warned against false teachers, and have recommended that the spiritual seeker test the guru before accepting him. Some have given criteria on how to distinguish false from genuine ones:

* The [[Advaya Taraka Upanishad]] states that the true teacher is well-versed in the [[Veda]]s, is a devotee of [[Vishnu]], is free from envy, knows [[yoga]] and is intent upon it, and always has the ''nature'' of yoga. Also that a person who is equipped with devotion to the teacher, has knowledge of the ''[[Soul_(spirit)#Hinduism|Self]]'' and possesses the above characteristics may be designated as a ''guru''.&lt;ref name=&quot;feuerstein1990&quot; /&gt;
* The [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]] warns against false teachers who may deceive the naive.&lt;ref name=&quot;feuerstein1990&quot; /&gt;
*The [[Kula-Arnava-Tantra]] states that there are many gurus who may rob the disciple's wealth but few who can remove the disciple's afflictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;feuerstein1990&quot; /&gt;
*[[Swami Vivekananda]] said that there are many incompetent gurus, and that a true guru should understand the spirit of the scriptures, have a pure character and be free from sin, and should be selfless, without desire for money and fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;vivekananda1937&quot;&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] ''Karma-yoga and Bhakti-yoga'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mirinalini Mata, a direct disciple of [[Yogananda]], said that a true guru should be humble ([[Self-Realization Fellowship]] 1978, Cassette No 2402)
*[[Sathya Sai Baba]] said in a discourse (Sathya Sai Speaks, vol I, p.&amp;nbsp;197) that the hunt for rich disciples who can be fleeced has become a [[tragicomedy]], and said in the booklet ''Sandeha Nivarini'' that the seeker should test the guru by assessing whether his words are full of wisdom, and whether he puts into practice what he preaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;sathyasaibaba_undated1&quot;&gt;Sathya Sai Baba ''Sandeha Nivarini: Clearance of Spiritual Doubts'' [http://laluni.helloyou.ws/askbaba/sandehanivarini/ available online] published by Sri Sathya Sai Books and Publications Trust (undated) ISBN 81-7208-010-7&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://www.divyajanani.org/saibharadwaja/books/SaibabaTM/Introduction.html Saibaba The Master] by Acharya Ekkirala Bharadwaja an in depth study of Shirdi Sai as a guru insists that one must follow the way of reading life histories of saints and it is the saints which will show us the correct guru when we are ready and capable of serving a guru. In Sufi-ism which revolves around Aulias(Saints), a disciple prays a Sufi-saint at his tomb, until the saint appears in a dream to the disciple and shows him the correct and living guru to go and serve. This is claimed as the Most secure way of entering a Guru-Shishya Parampara. [http://www.divyajanani.org/saibharadwaja/books/SreeGuruCharitra/Introduction.html Guru Charitra] by Acharya Ekkirala Bharadwaja explains it in more detail.

=== Rituals ===
''[[Guru Purnima]]'' is the day when the disciple wakes up and expresses gratitude. The purpose of the Guru Purnima (or Poornima) celebration is to review the preceding year to see how much one has progressed in life, to renew one's determination, and to focus on one's progress on the spiritual path.

''Guru [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]]'' (literally &quot;worship of the guru&quot;) the practice of worshiping the guru through the making of offerings and requesting inspiration from the guru. Vows and commitments made by the disciple or ''shishya'', which might have lost their strength, are renewed.

''Guru [[Bhakti]]'' (literally &quot;devotion to the guru&quot;) is considered important in many schools and [[sect]]s.

=== In modern Hinduism ===
{{See also|Contemporary Hindu movements}}
{{Section OR|date=July 2009}}

Some Hindu denominations like [[BAPS|BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha]] hold that a personal relationship with a living guru, revered as the embodiment of God, is essential in seeking [[moksha]]. The guru is the one who guides his or her disciple to become [[jivanmukta]], the liberated soul able to achieve salvation in his or her lifetime.

There is an understanding in some forms of Hinduism that if the devotee were presented with the guru and God, first he would pay respect to the guru, since the guru had been instrumental in leading him to God.&lt;ref&gt;Ranade, Ramchandra Dattatraya ''Mysticism in India: The Poet-Saints of Maharashtra'', pp.392, SUNNY Press, 1983.

[[Saints]] and poets in India have expressed the following views about the relationship between Guru and God:

He continues the duty of guru when the guru is relaxing or away from the place, a real follower of guru and prompting with updates. To be as a SAHAGURU wordly and worldly experience is must, he is more than a public relations officer and less to the official.

== Guru in Buddhism ==
{{Buddhism|terse=1}}

In the [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition, the teacher is a valued and honoured mentor worthy of great respect and is a source of inspiration on the path to [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|Enlightenment]], however the teacher is not generally considered to be a guru but rather a spiritual friend or [[Kalyāṇa-mittatā]].

In the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan tradition]], the guru is seen as the [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]], the very root of spiritual realization and the basis of the path. Without the teacher, it is asserted, there can be no experience or insight. In Tibetan texts, great emphasis is placed upon praising the virtues of the guru. Blessed by the guru, whom the disciple regards as a [[Bodhisattva]], or the embodiment of [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]], the disciple can continue on the way to experiencing the true nature of reality. The disciple shows great appreciation and devotion for the guru, whose blessing is the last of the four foundations of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]].

The [[Dalai Lama]], speaking of the importance of the guru, said: ''&quot;Rely on the teachings to evaluate a guru: Do not have blind faith, but also no blind criticism.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Teacher - The Guru&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/spiritual_teacher_guru.html |title=The Teacher - The Guru |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also observed that the term 'living Buddha' is a translation of the Chinese words ''huo fuo''. In Tibetan, he said, the operative word is ''lama'' which means 'guru'. A guru is someone who is not necessarily a Buddha, but is heavy with knowledge.

[[Tantra|Tantric]] teachings include the practice of [[guru yoga]], visualizing the guru and making offerings praising the guru. The guru is known as the ''[[vajra]]'' (literally &quot;diamond&quot;) guru.&lt;ref name=vajra&gt;{{cite book |author=Strong, John S. |title=The experience of Buddhism: sources and interpretations |publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co |location=Belmont, CA |year=1995 |pages= 76 |isbn=0-534-19164-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiations or ritual [[wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|empowerments]] are necessary before the student is permitted to practise a particular [[Tantras|tantra]]. The guru does not perform initiation as an individual, but as the person's own Buddha-nature reflected in the personality of the guru. The disciple is asked to make [[samaya]] or vows and commitments which preserve the spiritual link to the guru, and is told that to break this link is a serious downfall.

There are Four Kinds of [[Lama]] (Guru) or spiritual teacher&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Lama&lt;/ref&gt; (Tib. lama nampa shyi) in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]:
# gangzak gyüpé lama — the individual teacher who is the holder of the [[Parampara|lineage]]
# gyalwa ka yi lama — the teacher which is the word of the buddhas
# nangwa da yi lama — the symbolic teacher of all appearances
# rigpa dön gyi lama — the absolute teacher, which is [[rigpa]], the true nature of mind

== Guru in Sikhism ==
{{See also|Sikhism}}
{{Main|Sikh Gurus}}

The Sikh Gurus were fundamental to the [[Sikhs|Sikh]] religion, however the concept in Sikhism differs from other usages.

[[Sikhism]] is derived from the Sanskrit word ''shishya'', or disciple and is all about the relationship between the teacher and a student. The core beliefs of Sikhism are of belief in the One God and in [[The Ten Gurus of Sikhism|Ten Gurus]], enshrined in [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the Sikh holy book. The concept of Guru in [[Sikhism]] stands on two pillars i.e. Miri-Piri. 'Piri' means spiritual authority and 'Miri' means temporal authority. Therefore, Guru in Sikhism is a teacher-leader. Traditionally, the spiritual authority in Sikhism has always been the word and which is still preserved in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. And for temporal authority, as the word passed through 10 mortal bodies and finally into the collective corporate body known as the [[Khalsa]] till eternity, kept changing with finally been vested in the [[Khalsa]] when Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Guru, merged into it.

[[Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji]], the first guru of Sikhism, was opposed to the caste system prevalent in India in his time, and he accepted Hindus, Muslims and people from other religions as disciples. His followers referred to him as the Guru (teacher). Before he left the world he designated a new Guru to be his successor and to lead the Sikh community. This procedure was continued till March 30, 1699. In addition to the original ten teachers, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], their holy book, and the [[Khalsa]] was made the eleventh perpetual Guru of the [[Sikh]]s. Together they make up the eleven Gurus of Sikhism.

== Succession and lineage (parampara) ==
{{Main|Parampara}}

The word parampara (Sanskrit परम्परा) denotes a long succession of teachers and disciples in traditional [[India]]n culture. The ''Hinduism Dictionary'' defines parampara is &quot;the line of spiritual gurus in authentic succession of initiation; the chain of mystical power and authorized continuity, passed from guru to guru.&quot; In [[Sanskrit]], the word literally means: ''Uninterrupted series of succession''.

The ''Guru (teacher) Shishya (disciple) parampara'' or guru parampara, occurs where the ''knowledge'' (in any field) is passed down undiluted through the succeeding generations. It is the traditional, residential form of education, where the Shishya remains and learns with his Guru as a family member. The domains may include [[Spirituality|spiritual]], artistic (''[[Kalā]]'' कला such as [[music]] or [[dance]]) or [[educational]].

[[David C. Lane]], a professor of sociology, and, since 2005, an ex-member and critic of [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], argued in 1997 that based on his research of the [[Radha Soami]] movement that few gurus have a flawless and well-documented lineage, and that there is quite often conflict between different disciples claiming to be the only legitimate successor of their guru.[http://members.tripod.com/~dlane5/lineage.html]

==Western perspective==
As an alternative to established religions, some people in Europe and the USA who were not of [[India]]n extraction have looked up to spiritual guides and gurus from India, seeking them to provide them answers to the meaning of life, and to achieve a more direct experience free from intellectualism and philosophy. Gurus from many denominations traveled to Western Europe and the USA and established followings. One of the first to do so was [[Swami Vivekananda]] who addressed the [[World Parliament of Religions]] assembled in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1893.

In particular during the 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist [[David G. Bromley]] this was partially due to the repeal of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;bromley1989&quot;&gt;[[David G. Bromley|Bromley, David G.]], Ph.D. &amp; [[Anson Shupe]], Ph.D., ''Public Reaction against New Religious Movements'' article that appeared in ''Cults and new religious movements: a report of the Committee on Psychiatry and Religion of the American Psychiatric Association'', edited by Marc Galanter, M.D., (1989) ISBN 0-89042-212-5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values.&lt;ref name=&quot;nugteren1997&quot;&gt;[[Nugteren, Albertina (Tineke)]] Dr. (Associate professor in the phenomenology and history of Indian religions at the faculty of theology at the [[Universiteit van Tilburg|university of Tilburg]])''Tantric Influences in Western Esotericism'', article that appeared at a 1997 [[CESNUR]] conference and that was published in the book ''New Religions in a Postmodern World'' edited by [[Mikael Rothstein]] and Reender Kranenborg RENNER Studies in New religions [[Aarhus University]] press, (2003) ISBN 87-7288-748-6&lt;/ref&gt; According to the professor in [[sociology]] [[Stephen A. Kent]] at the [[University of Alberta]] and Kranenborg (1974), one of the reasons why in 1970s young people including [[hippie]]s turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get ''high'' without drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;kranenborg1974&quot;&gt;Kranenborg, Reender (Dutch language) ''Zelfverwerkelijking: oosterse religies binnen een westerse subkultuur'' (En: [[Self-realization]]: eastern religions in a Western Sub-culture'', published by Kampen Kok (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kent2001&quot;&gt;[[Stephen A. Kent|Kent, Stephen A.]] Dr. ''From slogans to mantras: social protest and [[religious conversion]] in the late [[Vietnam war]] era'' [[Syracuse University]] press ISBN 0-8156-2923-0 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-[[Vietnam War]] protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means.&lt;ref name=&quot;kent2001&quot; /&gt; Some gurus and the groups they lead [[opposition to cults and new religious movements|attracted opposition]]. One example of such group was the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement ([[ISKCON]]) founded by [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of [[bhakti yoga]] on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, D. V. The New Believers - A survey of sects, cults and alternative religions 2001 UK, Cassell &amp; Co. ISBN 0-304-35592-5 entry [[ISKCON]] page 287,288&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Devotees don't have such an easy time. They who choose to live in the temples – now a very small minority -chant the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]] mantra 1,728 time a day. […] Those living in an ashram – far fewer than in the 1970s – have to get up at 4am for worship. All members have to give up meat, fish and eggs; alcohol, tobacco, drugs, tea and coffee; gambling, sports, games and novels; and sex except for procreation with marriage […] It's a demanding lifestyle. Outsiders may wonder why people join.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kranenborg (1984), [[Jesus]] fits the Hindu definition and characteristics of a guru.&lt;ref name=&quot;kranenborg1984&quot;&gt;Kranenborg, Reender (Dutch language) Een nieuw licht op de kerk?

=== Viewpoints ===

Gurus and the [[Guru-shishya tradition]] have been criticized and assessed by secular scholars, [[theology|theologians]], [[anti-cult movement|anti-cultists]], [[Scientific skepticism|skeptics]], and religious philosophers.
*[[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], groomed to be a world spiritual teacher by the leadership of the [[Theosophical Society]] in the early part of the 20th century, publicly renounced this role in 1929 while also denouncing the concept of gurus, spiritual leaders, and teachers, advocating instead the unmediated and direct investigation of [[reality]].&lt;ref&gt;Jiddu, Krishnamurti (September 1929).

*Dr. [[David C. Lane]] proposes a checklist consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, ''Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical''.&lt;ref name=&quot;lane1984&quot;&gt;[[David C. Lane|Lane, David C.]], [http://web.archive.org/web/20091027111139/http://geocities.com/eckcult/cultexpose/crucible.html Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical] (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have high standards of moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret the behavior of a spiritual teacher by following [[Ockham's razor]] and by using [[common sense]], and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus are likely to be more unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.
*Highlighting what he sees as the difficulty in understanding the guru from [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern tradition]] in Western society, Dr. [[Georg Feuerstein]], a well-known German-American [[Indologist]], writes in the article ''[http://www.yrec.info/contentid-23.html Understanding the Guru]'' from his book ''The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and practice'':&quot;The traditional role of the guru, or spiritual teacher, is not widely understood in the West, even by those professing to practice Yoga or some other Eastern tradition entailing discipleship. [...] Spiritual teachers, by their very nature, swim against the stream of conventional values and pursuits. They are not interested in acquiring and accumulating material wealth or in competing in the marketplace, or in pleasing egos. They are not even about morality. Typically, their message is of a radical nature, asking that we live consciously, inspect our motives, transcend our egoic passions, overcome our intellectual blindness, live peacefully with our fellow humans, and, finally, realize the deepest core of human nature, the Spirit. For those wishing to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of conventional life, this kind of message is revolutionary, subversive, and profoundly disturbing.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;feuerstein2003&quot;&gt;[[Georg Feusterstein|Feuerstein, Georg]] Dr. ''The Deeper Dimension of Yoga: Theory and Practice'', Shambhala Publications, released on (2003) ISBN 1-57062-928-5&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga'' (1990), Dr. Feuerstein writes that the importation of ''yoga'' to the West has raised questions as to the appropriateness of spiritual discipleship and the legitimacy of spiritual authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;feuerstein1990&quot; /&gt;
*A British professor of psychiatry, [[Anthony Storr]], states in his book, ''Feet of Clay: A Study of Gurus'', that he confines the word guru (translated by him as &quot;revered teacher&quot;) to persons who have &quot;special knowledge&quot; who tell, referring to their special knowledge, how other people should lead their lives. He argues that gurus share common character traits (e.g. being loners) and that some suffer from a mild form of [[schizophrenia]]. He argues that gurus who are authoritarian, [[Paranoia|paranoid]], [[eloquent]], or who interfere in the private lives of their followers are the ones who are more likely to be unreliable and dangerous. Storr also refers to [[cult checklist#Eileen Barker|Eileen Barker's checklist]] to recognize false gurus. He contends that some so-called gurus claim special spiritual insights based on personal revelation, offering new ways of spiritual development and paths to salvation. Storr's criticism of gurus includes the possible risk that a guru may exploit his or her followers due to the authority that he or she may have over them, though Storr does acknowledge the existence of morally superior teachers who refrain from doing so. He holds the view that the idiosyncratic belief systems that some gurus promote were developed during a period of [[psychosis]] to make sense of their own minds and perceptions, and that these belief systems persist after the psychosis has gone. Storr applies the term &quot;guru&quot; to figures as diverse as [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Gurdjieff]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jim Jones]] and [[David Koresh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;storr1996&quot;&gt;Storr, Anthony Dr. ''Feet of clay: a study of gurus'' 1996 ISBN 0-684-83495-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian Indologist [[Koenraad Elst]] criticized Storr's book for its avoidance of the term [[prophet]] instead of guru for several people. Elst asserts that this is possibly due to Storr's pro-Western, pro-Christian cultural bias.
*[[Rob Preece]], a [[psychotherapist]] and a practicing Buddhist, writes in ''The Noble Imperfection'' that while the teacher/disciple relationship can be an invaluable and fruitful experience, the process of relating to spiritual teachers also has its hazards. He writes that these potential hazards are the result of ''naiveté'' amongst Westerners as to the nature of the guru/devotee relationship, as well as a consequence of a lack of understanding on the part of Eastern teachers as to the nature of Western psychology. Preece introduces the notion of [[transference]] to explain the manner in which the guru/disciple relationship develops from a more Western psychological perspective. He writes: &quot;''In its simplest sense transference occurs when unconsciously a person endows another with an attribute that actually is projected from within themselves.''&quot; In developing this concept, Preece writes that, when we transfer an inner quality onto another person, we may be giving that person a power over us as a consequence of the projection, carrying the potential for great insight and inspiration, but also the potential for great danger: &quot;In giving this power over to someone else they have a certain hold and influence over us it is hard to resist, while we become enthralled or spellbound by the power of the [[archetype]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref_preece&quot;&gt;Preece, Rob, &quot;The teacher-student relationship&quot; in ''The Noble Imperfection: The challenge of individuation in Buddhist life'', Mudras Publications&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to a professor of [[religious studies]] at [[Dawson College]] in [[Quebec]], [[Susan J. Palmer]], the word guru has acquired very negative connotations in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;palmer2004&quot;&gt;Palmer, Susan, article in the book ''NRMs in the 21st century: legal, political, and social challenges in global perspective'' edited by Phillip Charles Lucas and Thomas Robbins, (2004) ISBN 0-415-96577-2&lt;/ref&gt;
*The psychiatrist [[Alexander Deutsch]] performed a long-term observation of a small [[cult]], called ''The Family'' (not to be confused with [[Family International]]), founded by an American guru called ''Baba'' or ''Jeff'' in [[New York]] in 1972, who showed increasingly [[schizophrenic]] behavior. Deutsch observed that this man's mostly [[Jew]]ish followers interpreted the guru's pathological mood swings as expressions of different Hindu deities and interpreted his behavior as ''holy madness'', and his cruel deeds as punishments that they had earned. After the guru dissolved the cult in 1976, his mental condition was confirmed by Jeff's retrospective accounts to an author.&lt;ref name=&quot;deutsch1975&quot;&gt;Deutsch, Alexander [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] ''Observations on a sidewalk ashram'' Archive Gen.

*[[Jan van der Lans]] (1933–2002), a professor of the [[psychology of religion]] at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen|Catholic University of Nijmegen]], wrote, in a book commissioned by the Netherlands based [[KSGV|Catholic Study Center for Mental Health]], about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent, such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student (myth making and deification), and an increase of the chance of false [[mysticism]]. He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality, but, when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners, the distinction between the person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost, resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless, uncritical [[personality cult]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lans1981&quot;&gt;[http://www.psywww.com/psyrelig/obits/vanderlans.html Lans, Jan van der Dr.] (Dutch language) [http://www.ksgv.nl/2-18.html ''Volgelingen van de goeroe: Hedendaagse religieuze bewegingen in Nederland''], written upon request for the [http://www.ksgv.nl/KSGV_English.html KSGV] published by Ambo, Baarn, 1981 ISBN 90-263-0521-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Schnabel|Schnabel, Paul]] Dr. (Dutch language) Between stigma and charisma: new religious movements and mental health Erasmus university Rotterdam, Faculty of Medicine, Ph.D. thesis, ISBN 90-6001-746-3 (Deventer, Van Loghum Slaterus, 1982) Chapter V, page 142&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Wat [[Jan van der Lans|Van der Lans]] heir signaleert, is het gevaar dat de goeroe een instantie van absolute overgave en totale overdracht wordt. De leerling krijgt de gelegenheid om zijn grootheidsfantasieën op de goeroe te projecteren, zonder dat de goeroe daartegen als kritische instantie kan optreden. Het lijkt er zelfs vaak eerder op dat de goeroe in woord, beeld en geschrift juist geneigd is deze onkritische houding te stimuleren. Dit geldt zeker ook voor goeroe Maharaji, maar het heeft zich -gewild en ongewild ook voorgedaan bij Anandamurti en Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. [..] De vergoddelijking van de goeroe is 'een traditioneel element in de Oosterse spiritualiteit, maar, losgemaakt, uit dit cultuurmilieu en overgenomen door Westerse mensen, gaat het onderscheid vaak verloren tussen de persoon van de goeroe en dat wat hij symboliseert en verwordt tot een kritiekloze persoonlijkheidsverheerlijking' (Van der Lans 1981b, 108)&quot;&lt;br&gt;Partial literal English translation &quot;The deification of the guru is a 'traditional element in Eastern spirituality, but, detached from this cultural environment en used by Westerners, the distinction between the person of the guru and that what he symbolizes is often lost en it degenerates into an uncritical glorification of the personality.'(Van der Lans 1981b, 108)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
*In their 1993 book, ''The Guru Papers'', authors [[Diana Alstad]] and [[Joel Kramer (Author)|Joel Kramer]] reject the [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru-disciple tradition]] because of what they see as its structural defects. These defects include the authoritarian control of the guru over the disciple, which is in their view increased by the guru's encouragement of [[surrender (religion)|surrender]] to him. Alstad and Kramer assert that gurus are likely to be [[Hypocrisy|hypocrites]] because, in order to attract and maintain followers, gurus must present themselves as purer than and superior to ordinary people and other gurus.&lt;ref name=&quot;kramer1993&quot;&gt;Kramer, Joel, and Diana Alstad ''The guru papers: masks of authoritarian power'' (1993) ISBN 1-883319-00-5&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the journalist Sacha Kester, in a 2003 article in the Dutch newspaper [[De Volkskrant]], finding a guru is a precarious matter, pointing to the many holy men in India and the case of [[Sathya Sai Baba]] whom Kester considers a swindler. In this article he also quotes the book ''Karma Cola'' describing that in this book a German economist tells author [[Gita Mehta]], &quot;It is my opinion that quality control has to be introduced for gurus. Many of my friends have become crazy in India&quot;. She describes a comment by Suranya Chakraverti who said that some Westerners do not believe in spirituality and ridicule a true guru. Other westerners, Chakraverti said, on the other hand believe in spirituality but tend to put faith in a guru who is a swindler.&lt;ref&gt;Kester, Sacha &quot;Ticket naar Nirvana&quot;/&quot;Ticket to Nirvana&quot;, article in the Dutch Newspaper [[De Volkskrant]] 7 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
