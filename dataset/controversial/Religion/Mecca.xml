==Government==
Mecca is governed by the Municipality of Mecca, a municipal council of fourteen locally elected members headed by a [[mayor]] (called an ''Al-Amin'') appointed by the [[Politics of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Government]]. The current mayor of the city is Osama Al-Bar.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Mecca from Jabal Nur.JPG|thumb|left|Makkat Al Mukarrammah seen from [[Jabal al-Nour]]]]
[[File:OldmapofMecca.jpg|thumb|left|1787 Turkish artwork of the Masjid al-Haram and related religious sites (Jabal al-Nour)]]

Islamic tradition attributes the beginning of Mecca to [[Ishmael]]'s descendants. Many Muslims point to the Old Testament chapter Psalm 84:3-6 and a mention of a pilgrimage at the [[Bakkah#Valley_of_Baca|Valley of Baca]], that Muslims see as referring to the mentioning of Mecca as Bakkah in Qur'an Surah 3:96. Also the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] who lived between 60 BCE and 30 BCE writes about the isolated region of Arabia in his work [[Bibliotheca historica]] describing a holy shrine that Muslims see as referring to the Kaaba at Mecca &quot;And a temple has been set-up there, which is very holy and exceedingly revered by all Arabians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by C H Oldfather, ''Diodorus Of Sicily, Volume II'', William Heinemann Ltd., London &amp; Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MCMXXXV, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] may have called the city &quot;Macoraba&quot;, though this identification is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;P. Crone, ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'', p134-135.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some time in the 5th century CE, the Kaaba was a place of worship for the deities of [[Arabian mythology|Arabia's pagan tribes]]. Mecca's most important [[Paganism|pagan]] [[deity]] was [[Hubal]], which had been placed there by the ruling [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe&lt;ref&gt;Hawting, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic World'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and remained until the 7th century CE.

In the 5th century, the Quraysh took control of Mecca, and became skilled merchants and traders. In the 6th century they joined the lucrative [[spice trade]] as well, since battles in other parts of the world were causing [[trade route]]s to divert from the dangerous sea routes to the more secure overland routes. The [[Byzantine Empire]] had previously controlled the [[Red Sea]], but [[piracy]] had been on the increase. Another previous route that ran through the [[Persian Gulf]] via the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers, was also being threatened by exploitations from the [[Sassanid Empire]], as well as being disrupted by the [[Lakhmids]], the [[Ghassanids]], and the [[Roman–Persian Wars]]. Mecca's prominence as a trading center also surpassed the cities of [[Petra]] and [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name =EIE/&gt;&lt;ref name=lapidus-14&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Islamic Socieities|author=Ira Marvin Lapidus|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|pages=14|url=http://books.google.com/?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+Islamic+Societies#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-77933-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sassanids however did not always pose a threat to Mecca as in 575 CE they actually protected the Arabian city from invasion of the Kingdom of Axum, led by its Christian leader [[Abraha]]. The tribes of the southern Arabia, asked the Persian king [[Khosrau I]] for aid, in response to which he came south to Arabia with both foot-soldiers and a fleet of ships into Mecca. The Persian intervention prevented Christianity from spreading eastward into Arabia, and Mecca and the Islamic prophet Muhammad who was at the time a six year boy in the Quraysh tribe &quot;would not grow up under the cross.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of the medieval world: from the conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade|author=S.

By the middle of the 6th century, there were three major settlements in northern [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], all along the south-western coast that borders the Red Sea, in a habitable region between the sea and the great desert to the east. This area, known as the Hejaz, featured three settlements grown around [[oasis|oases]], where water was available. In the center of the Hijaz was Yathrib, later renamed [[Medina]], from &quot;Madinatun Nabi&quot;, or &quot;City of the Prophet.&quot; {{convert|250|mi|abbr=on}} south of Yathrib was the mountain city [[Ta’if]], north-west of which lay Mecca. Although the area around Mecca was completely barren, it was the wealthiest of the three settlements with abundant water via the renowned [[Zamzam Well]] and a position at the crossroads of major [[Camel train|caravan]] routes.&lt;ref name=world-13/&gt;

The harsh conditions and terrain of the Arabian peninsula meant a near-constant state of conflict between the [[Tribes of Arabia|local tribes]], but once a year they would declare a truce and converge upon Mecca in an annual pilgrimage. Up to the 7th century, this journey was intended for religious reasons by the pagan Arabs to pay homage to their shrine, and to drink from the Zamzam Well. However, it was also the time each year that disputes would be arbitrated, debts would be resolved, and trading would occur at Meccan fairs. These annual events gave the tribes a sense of common identity and made Mecca an important focus for the peninsula.&lt;ref name=lapidus-16&gt;Lapidus, Ira. ''History of Islamic Societies'', pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Camel caravans, said to have first been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were a major part of Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods – leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local mountains – to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=world&gt;''Islamic World'', pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through on route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia. The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the [[Bedouin]]s, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the [[Banu Tamim]]. Other regional powers such as the [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]], Ghassan, and Lakhm were in decline leaving Meccan trade to be the primary binding force in Arabia in the late 6th century.&lt;ref name=lapidus-16/&gt;

===Tradition===
According to Islamic tradition, the history of Mecca goes back to [[Abraham]] ([[Islamic view of Abraham|Ibrahim]]) who built the Kaaba with the help of his elder son Ishmael in around 2000 BCE when the inhabitants of what was then known as [[Bakkah]] had fallen away from the original [[monotheism]] of Abraham through the influence of the [[Amalek|Amelkites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Mecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muhammad and conquest of Mecca===
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}} 
{{Main|Muhammad|Conquest of Mecca|Muhammad in Mecca| List of expeditions of Muhammad}}
[[File:Jabal Nur.JPG|thumb|left||[[Jabal al-Nour]] is where Muhammad is believed to have received the first revelation of [[God in Islam|God]] through the [[Archangel]] [[Gabriel]].]]
Muhammad was born in Mecca in 570, and thus Islam has been inextricably linked with the city ever since. He was born in a minor faction, the Hashemites, of the ruling Quraysh tribe. It was in Mecca, in the nearby mountain cave of [[Hira]] on [[Jabal al-Nour]], that, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad is said to have begun receiving divine [[revelation]]s from God through the Archangel Gabriel in 610 AD, and began to preach his form of [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheism]] against Meccan paganism. After enduring persecution from the pagan tribes for 13 years, Muhammad emigrated (see [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]) in 622 with his companions, the ''[[Muhajirun]]'', to Yathrib (later called Medina). The conflict between the Quraysh and the Muslims, however, continued: the two fought in the [[Battle of Badr]], where the Muslims defeated the Quraysh army outside Medina; while the [[Battle of Uhud]] ended indecisively. Overall, however, Meccan efforts to annihilate Islam failed and proved to be very costly and ultimately unsuccessful. During the [[Battle of the Trench]] in 627, the combined armies of Arabia were unable to defeat Muhammad's forces .&lt;ref name=lapidus-32&gt;Lapidus, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In 628, Muhammad and his followers wanted to enter Mecca, for pilgrimage. Instead, however, they were blocked by the Quraysh, after which both Muslims and Meccans entered into the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], whereby the Quraysh promised to cease fighting Muslims and promised that Muslims would be allowed into the city to perform the pilgrimage the following year. It was meant to be a ceasefire for 10 years.  However, just two years later, the Quraysh violated the truce by slaughtering a group of Muslims and their allies. Muhammad and his companions, now 10,000 strong, decided to march into Mecca. However, instead of continuing their fight, the city of Mecca surrendered to Muhammad and his followers who declared peace and amnesty for the inhabitants. The native pagan imagery was destroyed by Muhammad and his followers and the location [[Islamization|Islamized]] and rededicated to the worship of God. Mecca was declared as the [[Holiest sites in Islam|holiest site in Islam]] ordaining it as the center of Muslim pilgrimage, one of the faith's [[Five Pillars of Islam|Five Pillars]]. Then, Muhammad returned to Medina, after assigning [[Akib ibn Usaid]] as governor of the city. His other activities in Arabia led to the unification of the peninsula.&lt;ref name = EIE/&gt;&lt;ref name=lapidus-32/&gt;

Muhammad died in 632, but with the sense of unity that he had passed on to his [[Ummah]] (Islamic nation), Islam began a rapid expansion, and within the next few hundred years stretched from North Africa well into Asia and parts of Europe. As the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] grew, Mecca continued to attract pilgrims not just from Arabia, but now from all across the [[Muslim world]] and beyond, as Muslims came to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage.

Mecca also attracted a year-round population of scholars, pious Muslims who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and local inhabitants who served the pilgrims. Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, pilgrims arrived by boat at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq.

===Medieval and pre-modern times===
[[File:First Saudi State Big.png|thumb|left|300px|The [[First Saudi State]]]]
Mecca was never the capital of any of the [[caliphate|Islamic states]] but Muslim rulers did contribute to its upkeep. During the reigns of [[Umar]] (634-44 CE) and [[Uthman ibn Affan]] (644–56) concerns of flooding caused the caliphs to bring in [[Christian]] engineers to build barrages in the low-lying quarters and construct dykes and embankments to protect the area round the Kaaba.&lt;ref name = EIE&gt;&quot;Makka – The pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods&quot;, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad's migration to Medina shifted the focus away from Mecca, this focus moved still more when Ali, the fourth caliph took power choosing [[Kufa]] as his capital. The [[Abbasid Caliphate]] moved the capital to [[Baghdad]], in modern-day Iraq, which remained the center of the Islamic Empire for nearly 500 years. Mecca re-entered Islamic political history briefly when it was held by [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], an early Muslim who opposed the Umayyad [[caliph]]s and again when the caliph [[Yazid I]] besieged Mecca in 683.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/itl/denise/umayyads.htm Ummayads: The First Muslim Dynasty]. Retrieved November 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time thereafter the city figured little in politics remaining a city of devotion and scholarship governed by the Hashemite [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharifs]].

In 930, Mecca was attacked and sacked by [[Qarmatians]], a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] [[Islamic schools and branches|Muslim sect]] led by [[Abū-Tāhir Al-Jannābī]] and centered in eastern Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0832430.html |title=Mecca |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] hit Mecca in 1349.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/blackDeath.html |title=The Islamic World to 1600: The Mongol Invasions (The Black Death) |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1517, the Sharif, Barakat bin Muhammed, acknowledged the supremacy of the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Ottoman Caliph]] but retained a great degree of local autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Mecca |title=Mecca – LoveToKnow 1911 |publisher=1911encyclopedia.org |date=2007-04-12 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803 the city was captured by the [[First Saudi State]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/saudi-arabia/7.htm The Saud Family and Wahhabi Islam]&quot;. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; which held Mecca until 1813. This was a massive blow to the prestige of the (Turkish) Ottoman Empire, which had exercised sovereignty over the holy city since 1517. The Ottomans assigned the task of bringing Mecca back under Ottoman control to their powerful ''[[Khedive]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]]. Muhammad Ali Pasha successfully returned Mecca to Ottoman control [[Ottoman return of Mecca 1813|in 1813]].

In 1818, followers of the [[Salafi]] juristic school were again defeated, but some of the Al Saud clan survived and founded the [[Second Saudi State]] that lasted until 1891 and lead on to the present country of Saudi Arabia.

Mecca was regularly afflicted with [[cholera]] epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/pancholera2.html Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1826–37 ]. [[UCLA School of Public Health]].&lt;/ref&gt; 27 epidemics were recorded during pilgrimages from the 1831 to 1930. More than 20,000 pilgrims died of cholera during the 1907–08 hajj.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/114078/cholera/253250/Seven-pandemics#ref=ref886683 Cholera (pathology)]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolt of Sharif of Mecca===
In [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire was at war with Britain and its allies, having sided with Germany. It had successfully repulsed an attack on Istanbul in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and on Baghdad in the [[Siege of Kut]]. The British agent [[T E Lawrence]] conspired with the Ottoman governor [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Syed Hussain bin Ali]], the Sharif of Mecca. Hussein bin Ali revolted against the Ottoman Empire from Mecca, and it was the first city captured by his forces in the [[Battle of Mecca (1916)]]. Sharif's revolt proved a turning point of the war on the eastern front. Sharif Hussein declared a new state, the [[Kingdom of Hejaz]], and declared Mecca as the capital of the new kingdom.

===Saudi Arabia===
Following the [[Battle of Mecca (1924)]], the Sharif of Mecca was overthrown by the Saud family, and Mecca was incorporated into Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name = encarta&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/5kx73ce9l &quot;Mecca&quot;] at [[Encarta]]. (Archived) 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Saudi rule, much of the historic city has been demolished as a result of construction programs - [[Mecca#Destruction of Mecca's historic and religious sites|see below]].

On November 20, 1979 two hundred armed [[Islamism|Islamist]] dissidents led by Saudi preacher [[Juhayman al-Otaibi]] [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seized the Grand Mosque]]. They claimed that the Saudi royal family no longer represented pure Islam and that the [[Masjid al-Haram]] (The Sacred Mosque) and the Kaaba, must be held by those of true faith. The rebels seized tens of thousands of pilgrims as hostages and barricaded themselves in the [[mosque]]. The siege lasted two weeks, and resulted in several hundred deaths and significant damage to the shrine, especially the [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Safa-Marwa]] gallery. [[Pakistani Armed Forces|Pakistani forces]] carried out the final assault; they were assisted with weapons, logistics and planning by an elite team of French commandos from [[Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale|The French GIGN]] [[commando]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siegeofmecca.com|title= The Siege of Mecca |publisher=Doubleday(US) |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction of historic buildings===
{{See also|Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites}}
The officially approved form of Islam in Saudi Arabia, [[Wahhabism]], is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to idolatry. As a consequence, under Saudi rule, it has been estimated that since 1985 about 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, have been demolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-destruction-of-mecca-saudi-hardliners-are-wiping-out-their-own-heritage-501647.html 'The destruction of Mecca: Saudi hardliners are wiping out their own heritage'], The Independent, 6 August 2005, retrieved 17 Jan. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot; /&gt;

Historic sites of religious importance which have been destroyed by the Saudis include five of the renowned &quot;Seven Mosques&quot; initially built by Muhammad's daughter and four of his &quot;greatest Companions&quot;: Masjid Abu Bakr, Masjid Salman al-Farsi, Masjid Umar ibn al-Khattab, Masjid Sayyida Fatima bint Rasulullah and Masjid Ali ibn Abu Talib.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/saudi_destruction_of_muslim_historical_sites/ Destruction of Islamic Architectural Heritage in Saudi Arabia: A Wake-up Call], The American Muslim, retrieved 17 Jan. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that there now are fewer than 20 structures remaining in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad. Other buildings that have been destroyed include the house of [[Khadijah]], the wife of Muhammad, demolished to make way for public lavatories; the house of [[Abu Bakr]], Muhammad's companion, now the site of the local [[Hilton hotel]]; the house of Ali-Oraid, the grandson of Muhammad, and the Mosque of abu-Qubais, now the location of the King's palace in Mecca; Muhammad's birthplace, demolished to make way for a library; and the [[Abraj Al Bait Towers]], built after demolishing the Ottoman-era [[Ajyad Fortress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/shame-of-the-house-of-saud-shadows-over-mecca-474736.html ‘Shame of the House of Saud: Shadows over Mecca’], The Independent, 19 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ostensible reason for much of the destruction of historic buildings has been for the construction of hotels, apartments, parking lots and other infrastructure facilities for [[Hajj]] pilgrims. However, many have been destroyed without any such reason. For example, when the house of Ali-Oraid, the grandson of Muhammed was discovered and excavated, [[King Fahd]] himself ordered that it be bulldozed in case it should become a pilgrimage site.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

==Pilgrimage==
[[File:La mecque pelerinage.png|thumb|The Hajj involves pilgrims visiting the Masjid al-Haram, but mainly camping and spending time in the plains of [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] and [[Arafah]].]]
The pilgrimage to Mecca attracts millions of Muslims from all over the world. There are two pilgrimages: the [[Hajj]], and the [[Umrah]].

The Hajj, the 'greater' pilgrimage is performed annually.  Once a year, the Hajj, the greater pilgrimage, takes place in Mecca and nearby sites. During the Hajj, several million people of varying nationalities worship in unison. Every adult, healthy Muslim who has the financial and physical capacity to travel to Mecca and can make arrangements for the care of his/her dependants during the trip, must perform the Hajj at least once in a lifetime.

Umrah, the lesser pilgrimage, is not obligatory, but is recommended in the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=What is Umrah?|url=http://islamonline.com/news/articles/21/What_is_Umrah_.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Often, they perform the [[Umrah]], the lesser pilgrimage, while visiting the Masjid al-Haram.

On 2 July 1990, a pilgrimage to Mecca ended in tragedy when the ventilation system failed in a crowded pedestrian tunnel and 1,426 people were either suffocated or trampled to death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressandstar.com/days/1976-2000/1990.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Mecca is at an elevation of {{convert|280|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, and approximately {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} inland from the Red Sea.&lt;ref name=world-13&gt;''Islamic World'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Central Mecca lies in a corridor between mountains, which is often called the &quot;Hollow of Mecca.&quot; The area contains the valley of Al Taneem, the Valley of Bakkah and the valley of Abqar.&lt;ref name =EIE/&gt;&lt;ref name = EIModern/&gt; This mountainous location has defined the contemporary expansion of the city. The city centers on the Masjid al-Haram area, whose elevation is lower than most of the city. The area around the mosque comprises the old city. The main avenues are ''Al-Mudda'ah'' and ''Sūq al-Layl'' to the north of the mosque, and ''As-Sūg Assaghīr'' to the south. As the Saudis expanded the Grand Mosque in the center of the city, where there were once hundreds of houses are now replaced with wide avenues and city squares. Traditional homes are built of local rock and are generally two to three stories. The total area of Mecca today stands over {{convert|1200|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holymakkah.gov.sa/ |title=Mecca Municipality |publisher=Holymakkah.gov.sa |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pre-modern Mecca, the city exploited a few chief sources of water. The first were local wells, such as the Zamzam Well, that produced generally brackish water. The second source was the spring of Ayn Zubayda. The sources of this spring are the mountains of J̲abal Saʿd (Jabal Sa'd) and Jabal Kabkāb, which lie a few kilometers east of Jabal Arafa or about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Mecca. Water was transported from it using underground channels. A very sporadic third source was rainfall which was stored by the people in small reservoirs or [[cistern]]s. The rainfall, as scant as it is, also presents the threat of flooding and has been a danger since earliest times. According to Al-Kurdī, there had been 89 historic floods by 1965, including several in the Saudi period. In the last century the most severe one occurred in 1942. Since then, dams have been constructed to ameliorate the problem.&lt;ref name = EIModern/&gt;

[[File:Masjid al-Haram panorama.JPG|thumb|center|800px|&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;[[Masjid al-Haram]] panorama.&lt;/div&gt;]]
Mecca houses the [[Masjid al-Haram]], the largest mosque in the world. The mosque surrounds the [[Kaaba]], which Muslims turn towards while offering [[Salah|daily prayer]]. This mosque is also commonly known as the ''Haram'' or ''Grand Mosque''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgijeddah.com/cgijed/haj/orient/visitharam.htm |title=Orientation |publisher=Cgijeddah.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Ramadan, 3 million people go there; at Hajj 20 million go there.

As [[Mecca#Destruction of Mecca's historic and religious sites|mentioned above]], because of the [[Wahhabist]] hostility to reverence being paid to historic and religious buildings, Mecca has lost most of its heritage in recent years and few buildings from the last 1500 years have survived Saudi rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Expansion of the city is ongoing and includes the construction of {{convert|601|m|abbr=on}} tall [[Abraj Al Bait Towers]] across the street from the Masjid al-Haram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2010/12/4/lifetravel/7478279&amp;sec=lifetravel |title=Going mega in Mecca |author= Kee Hua Chee|work= |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|date= 2010-12-04|accessdate=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towers are set to be completed in 2012 when they will become the 2nd tallest building in the world. The construction of the towers involved the demolition of the [[Ajyad Fortress]], which in turn sparked a dispute between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/jan2002/fort-j28.shtml Saudi government demolishes historic Ottoman castle]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Qishla of Mecca]] was an Ottoman [[castle]] facing the Grand Mosque and defending the city from attack.

==Economy==
[[File:Makkah (Mecca) (2).jpg|thumb|Night view of a busy street lined with hotels. Tourism is vital to the economy.]]
The Meccan economy has been heavily dependent on the annual pilgrimage. As one academic put it, &quot;[Meccans] have no means of earning a living but by serving the hajjis.&quot; Income generated from the Hajj, in fact, not only powers the Meccan economy but has historically had far reaching effects on the economy of the entire Hijaz and [[Najd]] regions. The income was generated in a number of ways. One method was taxing the pilgrims. Taxes especially increased during the [[Great Depression]], and many of these taxes existed as late as 1972. Another way the Hajj generates income is through services to pilgrims. For example, the Saudi [[Flag carrier|national airline]], [[Saudia]], generates 12% of its income from the pilgrimage. Fares paid by pilgrims to reach Mecca by land also generate income; as do the hotels and lodging companies that house them.&lt;ref name = EIModern/&gt;

The city takes in more than $100 million, while the Saudi government spends about $50 million on services for the Hajj. There are some industries and factories in the city, but Mecca no longer plays a major role in Saudi Arabia's economy, which is mainly based on oil exports.&lt;ref&gt;''Mecca.'' World Book Encyclopedia. 2003 edition. Volume M. P.353&lt;/ref&gt; The few industries operating in Mecca include textiles, furniture, and utensils.  The majority of the economy is service oriented.

Nevertheless, many industries have been set up in Mecca. Various types of enterprises that have existed since 1970: corrugated iron manufacturing, copper smithies, carpentry shops, upholstering establishments, vegetable oil extraction plants, sweets manufacturies, flour mills, bakeries, poultry farms, frozen food importing, photography processing, secretarial establishments, ice factories, bottling plants for soft drinks, barber shops, book shops, travel agencies and banks.&lt;ref name = EIModern/&gt;

The city has grown substantially in the 20th and 21st centuries, as the convenience and affordability of [[jet aircraft|jet]] travel has increased the number of pilgrims participating in the Hajj. Thousands of Saudis are employed year-round to oversee the Hajj and staff the hotels and shops that cater to pilgrims; these workers in turn have increased the demand for housing and services. The city is now ringed by freeways, and contains shopping malls and skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article358577.ece |title= Shame of the House of Saud: Shadows over Mecca |publisher=The Independent (UK) |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2007-05-03 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Howden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health care==
Health care is provided by the Saudi government free of charge to all pilgrims. There are five major hospitals in Mecca:
* Ajyad Hospital (Arabic: مستشفى أجياد)
* King Abdul Aziz Hospital ( Arabic: مستشفى الملك عبدالعزيز)
* Al Noor Hospital ( Arabic: مستشفى النور )
* Sheesha Hospital ( Arabic: مستشفى الششة )
* Hira Hospital ( Arabic: مستشفى حراء )
There are also many walk-in clinics available for both residents and pilgrims.

==Culture==
[[File:The Holy Mosque in Mecca.jpg|thumb|left|Modern buildings rise over the [[Masjid al-Haram]]]]
[[File:Mecca.JPG|thumb|left|The Picture of Masjid al-Haram and Kaaba.]]
Mecca's culture has been affected by the large number of pilgrims that arrive annually, and thus boasts a rich cultural heritage. The locals speak [[Hejazi Arabic]], but languages from all over the Muslim world can be found amongst the pilgrims.

As a result of the vast numbers of pilgims coming to the city each year (many of whom remain permanently), Mecca has become by far the most diverse city in the Muslim world. In contrast to the rest of Saudi Arabia, and particularly [[Nejd]], Mecca has, according to the [[New York Times]], become &quot;a striking oasis&quot; of free thought and discussion and, also, of &quot;unlikely liberalism&quot; as &quot;Meccans see themselves as a bulwark against the creeping extremism that has overtaken much Islamic debate&quot;.&lt;ref name= NYT/&gt; 

The first press was brought to Mecca in 1885 by [[Osman Nuri Paşa]], an Ottoman [[Wāli]]. During the Hashemite period, it was used to print the city's official gazette, ''al-Qibla''. The Saudi regime expanded this press into a larger operation, introducing the new Saudi official gazette ''Umm al-Qurā''. Henceforth presses and printing techniques were introduced in the city from around the [[Middle East]], mostly via [[Jeddah]].&lt;ref name = EIModern/&gt;

Mecca owns its hometown paper, ''[[Al Nadwa]]''. However, other Saudi and international newspapers are also provided in Mecca such as the ''[[Saudi Gazette]]'', ''[[Al Madinah]]'', ''[[Okaz]]'' and ''[[Al-Bilad (newspaper)|Al Bilad]]''. The first three are Mecca's (and other Saudi cities') primary newspapers focusing mainly on issues that affect the city, with over a million readers.

Many television stations serving the city area include ''[[Saudi TV1]]'', ''[[Saudi TV2]]'', ''[[Saudi TV Sports]]'', ''[[Al-Ekhbariya]]'', ''[[Arab Radio and Television Network]]'' and hundreds of cable, satellite and other speciality television providers.

In pre-modern Mecca the most common sports were impromptu wrestling and foot races.&lt;ref name = EIModern/&gt; [[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Mecca, the city hosting some of the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia such as, [[Al-Wahda (Mecca)|Al-Wahda FC]] (established in 1945). [[King Abdul Aziz Stadium|King Abdulaziz Stadium]] is the largest stadium in Mecca with capacity of 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fussballtempel.net/afc/listeafc.html Asian Football Stadiums] - Stadium King Abdul Aziz&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
As in other Saudi cities [[Kabsa]] (a spiced dish of rice and meat) is the most traditional lunch but the [[Yemen]]i [[mandi (food)|mandi]] (a dish of rice and tandoori cooked meat) is also popular. Grilled meat dishes such as [[shawarma]] (flat-bread meat sandwich), [[kofta]] (meatballs) and [[kebab]] are widely sold in Mecca. During [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], [[Ful medames|fava beans in olive oil]] and [[samosa]]s are the most popular dishes and are eaten at [[dusk]]. These dishes are almost always found in [[Lebanese cuisine|Lebanese]], [[Syrian cuisine|Syrian]], and [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] restaurants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The mixture of different ethnicities and nationalities amongst Meccan residents has significantly impacted Mecca's traditional cuisine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The city has been described as one of the most cosmopolitan Islamic cities, with an international cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Naylor Pearson|title=Pilgrimage to Mecca: the Ind[i]an experience, 1500-1800|publisher=Markus Wiener Publisher|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally during the month of Ramadan, men (known as Saggas) provided mineral water and fruit juice for Muslims breaking their fast at dusk. Today, Saggas make money providing sweets such as ''[[baklava]]'' and ''basbosa'' along with fruit juice drinks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In the 20th century, many fast-food chains have opened franchises in Mecca, catering to locals and pilgrims alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gorani: Masks and business at Hajj|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2006-01-07/world/hajj.gorani_1_hajj-grand-mosque-pilgrims?_s=PM:WORLD|publisher=[[CNN]] | date=2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exotic foods, such as fruits from India and Japan, are often brought by the pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
Population density in Mecca is very high. Most long-term residents of Mecca live in the Old City, and many work in the industry known locally as the ''Hajj Industry''. Iyad Madani, Saudi Arabia's minister for Hajj, was quoted as saying, &quot;We never stop preparing for the Hajj.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anisamehdi.com/projects/insidemecca/pressrelease.htm |title=A new National Geographic Special on PBS &quot;Inside Mecca&quot; |publisher=Anisamehdi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Year-round, pilgrims stream into the city to perform the rites of [[Umrah]], and during the last weeks of [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]], on average 4 million Muslims arrive in the city to take part in the rites known as Hajj.&lt;ref name='ebmm'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilgrims are from varying [[ethnic group|ethnicities]] and backgrounds, mainly [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]]. Many of these pilgrims have remained and become residents of the city. Adding to the Hajj-related diversity, the oil-boom of the past 50 years has brought hundreds of thousands of working immigrants.

Non-Muslims are not permitted to enter Mecca under [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Saudi law]],&lt;ref name=&quot;peters 206&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places |last=Peters |first=Francis E. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=0-691-02619-X |page=206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and using fraudulent documents to do so may result in arrest and prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Saudi embassy warns against entry of non-Muslims in Mecca |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=32627 |work= |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=March 14, 2006 |accessdate=2008-04-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060426192447/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=32627 |archivedate = April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many non-Muslims have visited the city. The first such recorded example is that of [[Ludovico di Varthema]] of [[Bologna]] in 1503.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197406/the.lure.of.mecca.htm |title=The Lure Of Mecca |publisher=Saudi Aramco World |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak|Guru Nanak Sahib]], the founder of Sikhism, visited Mecca in December 1518.[Unauthentic] &lt;ref&gt;(Dr Harjinder Singh Dilgeer says that Mecca was not banned to non-Muslim till nineteenth century; ''Sikh History in 10 volumes'', Sikh University Press, (2010-2012), vol. 1, pp. 181-82)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous was [[Richard Francis Burton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1853Burton.html |title=Sir Richard Francis Burton: A Pilgrimage to Mecca, 1853 |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; who traveled as a [[Qadiriyyah]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] from [[Afghanistan]] in 1853. The Saudi government supports their position using{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Sura]] 9:28 from the [[Qur'an]]:
''O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque.''

==Education==
{{See also|List of universities and colleges in Saudi Arabia}}
Formal education started to be developed in the late Ottoman period continuing slowly into and Hashimite times. The first major attempt to improve the situation was made by a Jeddah merchant, Muhammad ʿAlī Zaynal Riḍā, who founded the Madrasat al-Falāḥ in Mecca in 1911–12 that cost £400,000.&lt;ref name=EIModern/&gt;

The school system in Mecca has many public and private schools for both males and females. As of 2005, there were 532 [[State school|public]] and [[private school]]s for males and another 681 public and private schools for female students.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical information department of the ministry of education:[http://www.moe.gov.sa/statscenter/tawzee.rar Statistical summary for education in Saudi Arabia] (AR)&lt;/ref&gt; The medium of instruction in both public and private schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a [[second language]], but some private schools founded by foreign entities such as [[International school]]s use the English language for medium of instruction. They also allow the mixing between males and females while other schools do not.

For higher education, the city has only one university, [[Umm al-Qura University]], which was established in 1949 as a college and became a public university in 1979.

==Paleontology==
In 2010, the Mecca area became an important site for [[paleontology]] with respect to [[primate]] evolution, with the discovery of a ''[[Saadanius]]'' fossil. Saadanius is considered to be a primate closely related to the common ancestor of the [[Old World monkey]]s and [[apes]]. The fossil habitat, near what is now the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia, was a damp forest area between 28m and 29m years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications==
Telecommunications in the city were emphasized early under the Saudi reign. King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Al-Saud]] (Ibn Saud) pressed them forward as he saw them as a means of convenience and better governance. While in [[Ali of Hejaz|King Husayn's]] time there were about 20 telephones in the entire city; in 1936 the number jumped to 450, totalling about half the telephones in the country. During that time telephone lines were extended to Jeddah and Ta’if, but not to the capital [[Riyadh]]. By 1985, Mecca, like other Saudi cities, possessed the most modern telephone, telex, radio and TV communications.&lt;ref name = EIModern&gt;&quot;Makka – The Modern City&quot;, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited radio communication was established within the Hejaz region under the Hashimites. In 1929, wireless stations were set up in various towns of the region, creating a network that would become fully functional by 1932. Soon after World War II, the existing network was greatly expanded and improved. Since then, radio communication has been used extensively in directing the pilgrimage and addressing the pilgrims. This practice started in 1950, with the initiation of broadcasts the [[Day of Arafa]], and increased until 1957, at which time Radio Makka became the most powerful station in the Middle East at 50&amp;nbsp;kW. Later, power was increased to 450&amp;nbsp;kW. Music was not immediately broadcast, but gradually introduced.&lt;ref name = EIModern/&gt;

==Transportation==
Transportation facilities related to the Hajj or Umrah are the main services available. Mecca has only the small [[Mecca East Airport]] with no airline service, so most [[pilgrim]]s access the city through the Hajj terminal of [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]] or the [[Jeddah Seaport]], both of which are in Jeddah.

A high speed inter-city rail line ([[Haramain High Speed Rail Project]] also known as the &quot;Western Railway&quot;), is under construction in Saudi Arabia. It will link along 444 kilometres (276&amp;nbsp;mi), the Muslim holy cities of [[Medina]] and Mecca via [[King Abdullah Economic City]], [[Rabigh]], Jeddah and King Abdulaziz International Airport. It will be built by a business consortium from [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpais.com/articulo/economia/consorcio/espanol/firma/contrato/Ave/Meca/enero/elpepueco/20120109elpepueco_7/Tes&lt;/ref&gt;

The city lacks any public transportation options for residents and visitors alike, both during and outside of the pilgrimage season.  The main transportation options available for travel within and around the city are either personal vehicles or private taxis.

The {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}} [[Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro]] opened in November 2010.&lt;ref name=opening&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/hajj-pilgrims-take-the-metro-to-makkah.html | title=Hajj pilgrims take the metro to Makkah|publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]] |date=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 5 metro lines are planned to carry pilgrims to the religious sites.&lt;ref name=rgi20090624&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mecca metro contracts signed |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//makkah-metro-contracts-signed.html |work= |publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]] |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
