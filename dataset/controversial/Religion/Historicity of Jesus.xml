The '''historicity of Jesus''' refers to the analysis of historical data to determine if [[Jesus]] existed as a historical figure, approximately where and when he lived, and if any of the major milestones in his life, such as his method of death, can be confirmed as historical events.&lt;ref name=Evans2-5&gt;''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' by Craig A.

====Basic historical facts====
[[File:Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|220px|The ''[[Pilate Stone]]'' from [[Caesarea Maritima]], now at the [[Israel Museum]]]]
The reconstruction of portraits of the historical Jesus along with his life story has been the subject of wide ranging debate among scholars, with no scholarly consensus.&lt;ref name=AmyJill1 /&gt; In a review of the state of research [[Amy-Jill Levine]] stated that &quot;no single picture of Jesus has convinced all, or even most scholars&quot; and that all portraits of Jesus are subject to criticism by some group of scholars.&lt;ref name=AmyJill1 /&gt;

However, regardless of the scholarly disagreements on the reconstruction of portraits of the historical Jesus, almost all modern scholars consider the [[baptism of Jesus]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]] to be two historically certain facts about him.&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt;&lt;ref name=Verhoof39&gt;''Jesus of Nazareth'' by Paul Verhoeven (Apr 6, 2010) ISBN 1583229051 page 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] states that these &quot;two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent&quot; and &quot;rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts&quot; that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name=JDunn339&gt;''Jesus Remembered'' by James D. G. Dunn 2003 ISBN 0-8028-3931-2 page 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond these two key events, scholars attribute levels of certainty to other episodes, e.g. [[E.P. Sanders]] and separately [[Craig A. Evans]] go further and state that there are two other incidents in the life of Jesus can be historical, one that Jesus [[Twelve apostles|called disciples]], the other that he caused a [[Cleansing of the Temple|controversy at the Temple]].&lt;ref name=Hertzog1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans37&gt;''Authenticating the Activities of Jesus'' by Bruce Chilton and Craig A.

:* Jesus was baptized by [[John the Baptist]]. He called disciples. He had a controversy at the Temple. Jesus was crucified by the Romans near Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Hertzog1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans37/&gt;

:* Jesus was a Galilean. His activities were confined to Galilee and Judea. After his death his disciples continued. Some of his disciples were persecuted.&lt;ref name=Hertzog1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans37/&gt;

But scholarly agreement on this extended list is not universal, and beyond the two basic facts of baptism and crucifixion, scholarly consensus begins to dilute.&lt;ref name=Hertzog1&gt;''Prophet and Teacher: An Introduction to the Historical Jesus'' by William R.

Meier]] sees the calling of disciples a natural consequence of the information available about Jesus.&lt;ref name=Hertzog1/&gt;

[[File:Coin-of-Pilate.jpg|thumb|180px|left|A bronze [[prutah]] minted by Pontius Pilate]]
Although there is disagreement about issues such as the calling of disciples, the agreement on crucifixion is very widespread, and most scholars in the third [[quest for the historical Jesus]] consider the crucifixion indisputable.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated145&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig211&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L.

Although scholars agree on the historicity of the crucifixion, they differ on the reason and context for it, e.g. both [[E. P. Sanders]] and [[Paula Fredriksen]] support the historicity of the crucifixion, but contend that Jesus did not foretell his own crucifixion, and that [[Son of Man#Predicting His Death and Resurrection|his prediction of the crucifixion]] is a Christian story.&lt;ref name=Ernest125/&gt; [[Geza Vermes]] also views the crucifixion as a historical event but provides his own explanation and background for it.&lt;ref name=Ernest125&gt;''A Century of Theological and Religious Studies in Britain, 1902-2002'' by Ernest Nicholson 2004 ISBN 0-19-726305-4 pages 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of John the Baptist within the same time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by [[Herod Antipas]] is attested to by first century historian [[Josephus]] and the overwhelming majority of modern scholars view [[Josephus on Jesus|Josephus' accounts]] of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 &gt;Craig Evans, 2006 &quot;Josephus on John the Baptist&quot; in ''The Historical Jesus in Context'' edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al.

Maier ISBN 0-8254-2924-2 pages 662-663&lt;/ref&gt; One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is that it is a story which the [[early Christianity|early Christian Church]] would have never wanted to invent, typically referred to as the [[criterion of embarrassment]] in historical analysis.&lt;ref name=Powell47 &gt;''Jesus as a figure in history: how modern historians view the man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell 1998 ISBN 0-664-25703-8 page 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whois31 &gt;''Who Is Jesus?'' by John Dominic Crossan, Richard G.

Rausch 2003 ISBN 978-0-8146-5078-3 page 77&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of [[multiple attestation]].&lt;ref name=Murphy29 &gt;''John the Baptist: prophet of purity for a new age'' by Catherine M.

===Chronology===
{{Main|Chronology of Jesus}}
[[File:The Temple of Apollo at Delphi.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] in [[Delphi]], Greece, where the [[Delphi Inscription]] was discovered in the 20th century, helping confirm the chronology of Paul.&lt;ref name=CCPaul20 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marrow45 &gt;''Paul: his letters and his theology'' by Stanley B. Marrow 1986 ISBN 0-8091-2744-X pages 45-49&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Diverse approaches have been used to estimate the chronology of Jesus, ranging from the comparison of the accounts in the Christian gospels with Roman and Jewish sources regarding facts such as the marriage of [[Herodias]] and separately the [[Jerusalem Temple]], to correlation with the well established chronology of [[Paul of Tarsus]], to astronomical analysis based on an approach first suggested by [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kostenberger114&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox25 &gt;''Herodias: at home in that fox's den'' by Florence Morgan Gillman 2003 ISBN 0-8146-5108-9 pages 25-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton|Newton, Isaac]] (1733). &quot;[[s:Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel/Part I Chap XI|Of the Times of the Birth and Passion of Christ]]&quot;, in ''[[s:Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel|Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pratt &gt;{{cite journal |last=Pratt |first=J.

Two independent approaches can be used to estimate the year of birth of Jesus, one based on the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity accounts]] in the gospels, the other by working backwards from the date of the start of [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]]. Most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite document | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three independent approaches to estimate the dates of the ministry of Jesus (when he started calling disciples, generally considered to be after his baptism) and are: first, the fifteenth year of the reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]], second: the date of the building of the [[Herod's Temple|Jerusalem Temple]] and third, the date of the [[death of John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 /&gt;&lt;ref name=fox25 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 &gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press ISBN 90-5356-503-5 page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans67 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A.

Bromiley 1982 ISBN 0-8028-3782-4 pages 694-695&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally estimate that the ministry of Jesus began around AD 27-29 and lasted at least one year, and perhaps three years, or more.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PAnderson200 &gt;''The Riddles of the Fourth Gospel: An Introduction to John'' by Paul N.

At least four distinct approaches have been used to estimate the date of the crucifixion of Jesus. One approach uses the attestations of non-Christian sources such as [[Josephus]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul William Meyer page 112&quot;&gt;''The Word in this world'' by Paul William Meyer, John T.

Josephus provides a useful link between the chronology of the ministry of Jesus and his death. Most modern scholars also view [[Josephus]]' account (in [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|''Antiquities'' 18.5.2]]) of the execution of [[John the Baptist]] by [[Herod Antipas]], and the marriage of Herod and [[Herodias]] to be authentic.&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 &gt;Craig Evans, 2006 &quot;Josephus on John the Baptist&quot; in ''The Historical Jesus in Context'' edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al.

The [[Pauline letters]], which were written before the Christian gospels, also shed light on the chronology of Jesus. The estimation of the date of the [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|conversion of Paul]] places the death of Jesus before this conversion, which is estimated at around AD 33-36.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 &gt;''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'' by Paul Barnett 2002 ISBN 0-8308-2699-8 pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-D0116-0041-019, Albert Schweitzer.jpg|thumb|110px|[[Albert Schweitzer]], whose book coined the term [[Quest for the historical Jesus]]]]
While [[textual criticism]] (or lower criticism) had been practiced for centuries, a number of approaches to [[historical criticism|historical analysis]] and a number of criteria for evaluating the historicity of events emerged as of 18th century, as a series of &quot;Quests for the historical Jesus&quot; took place. At each stage of development, scholars suggested specific forms and methodologies of analysis and specific criteria to be used to determine historical validity.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt;

The first Quest which started in 1778 was almost entirely based on [[biblical criticism]]. This was supplemented with [[form criticism]] in 1919 and [[redaction criticism]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=criteria100&gt;''Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research'' by Stanley E. Porter 2004 ISBN 0567043606 pages 100-120&lt;/ref&gt; Form criticism began as an attempt to trace the history of the biblical material before it was written down, and may thus be seen as starting when textual criticism ends.&lt;ref name=Westdic215&gt;''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'' by Alan Richardson 1983 ISBN 0664227481 pages 215-216&lt;/ref&gt;  Form criticism looks for patterns within units of biblical text and attempts to trace their origin based on the patterns.&lt;ref name=Westdic215 /&gt; Redaction criticism may be viewed as the child of text criticism and form criticism.&lt;ref name=DHar96&gt;''Interpreting the New Testament'' by Daniel J. Harrington (Jun 1990) ISBN 0814651240 pages 96-98&lt;/ref&gt; This approach views an author as a &quot;redactor&quot; i.e. someone preparing a report, and tries to understand how the redactor(s) has molded the narrative to express their own perspectives.&lt;ref name=DHar96/&gt;

At the end of the first Quest (c. 1906) the criterion for [[multiple attestation]] was used and was the major additional element up to 1950s.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; The concept behind multiple attestation is simple: as the number of independent sources that vouch for an event increases, confidence in the historical authenticity of the event rises.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt;

Other criteria were being developed at the same time, e.g. &quot;double dissimilarity&quot; in 1913, &quot;least distinctiveness&quot; in 1919 and &quot;coherence and consistency&quot; in 1921.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; The criterion of double dissimilarity views a reported saying or action of Jesus as possibly authentic, if it is dissimilar from both the Judaism of his time and also from the traditions of the [[early Christianity]] that immediately followed him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Historical Jesus and the Final Judgment Sayings in Q'' by Brian Han Gregg (Jun 30, 2006) ISBN 3161487508 page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The least distinctiveness criterion relies on the assumption that when stories are passed from person to person, the peripheral, least distinct elements may be distorted, but the central element remains unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;''Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research'' by Stanley E. Porter 2004 ISBN 0567043606 pages 77-78&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion of &quot;coherence and consistency&quot; states that material can be used only when other material has been identified as authentic to corroborate it.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt;

The second Quest was launched in 1953, and along with it the [[criterion of embarrassment]] was introduced.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; This criterion states that a group is unlikely to invent a story that would be embarrassing to themselves.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; The criterion of &quot;historical plausibility&quot; was introduced in 1997, after the start of the third Quest in 1988.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt; This principle analyzes the plausibility of an event in terms of two separate components: contextual plausibility and consequential plausibility, i.e. the historical context needs to be suitable, as well as the consequences.&lt;ref name=criteria100 /&gt;

Of the two passages the James passage in Book 20 is used by scholars to support the existence of Jesus, the Testimonium Flavianum in Book 18 his crucifixion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camber121&quot;/&gt; Josephus' James passage not only attests to the existence of Jesus as a historical person but that some of his contemporaries considered him the Messiah.&lt;ref name=Camber121/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum104&gt;Kostenberger, Andreas J.; Kellum, L. Scott; Quarles, Charles L. (2009). ''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' ISBN 0-8054-4365-7 pages 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage deals with the death of &quot;James the brother of Jesus&quot; in Jerusalem, and given that works of Josephus refer to at least twenty different people with [[Jesus (name)|the name Jesus]], Josephus clarifies that this Jesus was the one &quot;who was called Christ&quot;.&lt;ref name=EB129&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007). ''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition''. ISBN 0-8010-3114-1 page 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;

''Josephus, Judaism and Christianity''. BRILL. ISBN 90-04-08554-8. page 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of modern scholars consider the reference in [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|Book 20, Chapter 9, 1]] of the ''Antiquities'' to &quot;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James&quot; to be authentic and to have the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity.&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maier95284/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst83&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E.

Feldman (ISBN 90-04-08554-8 pages 55-57) states that the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James has been &quot;almost universally acknowledged&quot;. Meir (ISBN 978-0-8254-3260-6 pages 108-109) agrees with Feldman that few have questioned the authenticity of the James passage. Setzer (ISBN 0-8006-2680-X pages 108-109) also states that few have questioned its authenticity.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Feldman]] states that the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James has been &quot;almost universally acknowledged&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'Josephus, Judaism and Christianity'' by [[Louis H.

The ''Testimonium Flavianum'' (meaning the testimony of Flavius &lt;nowiki&gt;[Josephus]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) is the name given to the passage found in [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|Book 18, Chapter 3, 3]] of the Antiquities in which Josephus describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus; Whiston, William; Maier, Paul L.

''Jewish Traditions in Early Christian Literature. 2''. ISBN 90-232-2653-4 pages 38-41&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have differing opinions on the total or partial authenticity of the reference in [[wikisource:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|Book 18, Chapter 3, 3]] of the ''Antiquities'' to the execution of Jesus by [[Pontius Pilate]], a passage usually called  the ''Testimonium Flavianum''.&lt;ref name=FeldHata8754/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 /&gt; The general scholarly view is that while the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate which was then subject to Christian interpolation.&lt;ref name=Kellum104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schrck38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Craig A. (2001). ''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' ISBN 0-391-04118-5 page 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wansbrough, Henry (2004). ''Jesus and the oral Gospel tradition''.

Ltd, 2003). ISBN 0-664-22721-X&lt;/ref&gt; there is broad consensus as to what the original text of the ''Testimonium'' by Josephus would have looked like.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;

The references found in ''Antiquities'' have no parallel texts in the other work by Josephus such as the ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]]'', written 20 years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence, e.g. that the ''Antiquities'' covers a longer time period and that during the 20 year gap between the writing of the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 70 AD) and ''Antiquities'' (after 90 AD) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the ''Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H.

ISBN 3-11-009522-X page 826&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of variations exist between the statements by Josephus regarding the deaths of James and the [[New Testament]] accounts.&lt;ref name=Painter143&gt;Painter, John (2005). ''Just James: The Brother of Jesus in History and Tradition''. ISBN 0-567-04191-3 pages 143-145&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, for a Christian interpolator would have made them correspond to the New Testament accounts, not differ from them.&lt;ref name=EB129/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painter143/&gt; For an extensive discussion of the scholarly arguments regarding these Josephus passages, see the article [[Josephus on Jesus]].

The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] and [[Roman senate|senator]] [[Tacitus]] referred to the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] by [[Pontius Pilate]] and the existence of [[early Christians]] in Rome in his final work, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' (written ''ca.'' 116 AD), [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|book 15, chapter 44]], in the context of the [[persecution of Christians]] and the [[Great Fire of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;P.E.

B. Eerdmans, 2000. p 39- 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars generally consider Tacitus's reference  to the execution of Jesus by [[Pontius Pilate]] to be both authentic, and of historical value as an independent Roman source about early Christianity that is in unison with other historical records.&lt;ref name=CEvans42  &gt;''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' by Craig A.

''The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition'' Baker Academic, ISBN 0-8010-3114-1 page 127&lt;/ref&gt; Although a few scholars question the passage given that Tacitus was born 25 years after Jesus's death, the majority of scholars consider it genuine.&lt;ref name=VVoorst39 /&gt; William L. Portier has stated that the consistency in the references by Tacitus, Josephus and the letters to [[Emperor Trajan]] by [[Pliny the Younger]] reaffirm the validity of all three accounts.&lt;ref name=Portier263 &gt;''Tradition and Incarnation: Foundations of Christian Theology'' by William L.

Tacitus was a patriotic [[Roman senator]] and his writings shows no sympathy towards Christians.&lt;ref name=CEvans42 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated293&quot;&gt;''Ancient Rome'' by William E.

Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography. HarperOne. ISBN 0-06-061662-8 page 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart D.

Some scholars have debated the historical value of the passage, given that Tacitus does not reveal the source of his information.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce,''Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament'', (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1974) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerd Theissen]] and Annette Merz argue that Tacitus at times had drawn on earlier historical works now lost to us, and he may have used official sources from a Roman archive in this case; however, if Tacitus had been copying from an official source, some scholars would expect him to have labeled Pilate correctly as a ''prefect'' rather than a ''procurator''.&lt;ref&gt;Theissen and Merz p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Theissen and Merz state that Tacitus gives us a description of widespread prejudices about Christianity and a few precise details about &quot;Christus&quot; and Christianity, the source of which remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Theissen, Gerd; Merz, Annette | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide |url = http://books.google.com/?id=3ZU97DQMH6UC&amp;pg=PA83| year=1998 | publisher=Fortress Press | location=Minneapolis  | isbn=978-0-8006-3122-2 | page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paul R.

By the end of the 19th century, there was a hypothesis that the ''Annals'' had been fabricated by 15th century Italian author [[Poggio Bracciolini]] (1380-1459).&lt;ref&gt;Clarence W. Mendell, ''Tacitus: The Man And His Work'' (Yale University Press/Oxford University Press, 1957) page 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson Ross, ''Tacitus and Bracciolini: The Annals Forged In The XVth Century'' ISBN 978-1-4068-4051-3. Originally published London: Diprose and Bateman, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= VVorst42/&gt; However, when [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (1313 - 1375) was commissioned by the city of Florence to write ''Commento di Dante'' which he completed c. 1374 (before the birth of Poggio Bracciolini), he made clear use of the Annals when he gave an account of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s death directly based on the Tacitus account in [[Wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15|Annals book 15]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Deaths of Seneca'' by James Ker ISBN 0195387031 Oxford Univ Press 2009 page 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Boccaccio's Expositions on Dante's Comedy'' by Giovanni Boccaccio, Michael Papio 2009 ISBN 0802099750 University of Toronto Press page 233, also see [http://www.iperteca.it/download.php?id=442 PDF file]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Van Voorst the forging of the Annals by Poggio Bracciolini was an extreme hypothesis which never gained a following among modern scholars.&lt;ref name= VVorst42&gt;[[Robert Van Voorst]] ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' 2000 ISBN 0-8028-4368-9 page 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Van Voorst]] states that the scarcity of Jewish references to Jesus is not surprising, given that Jesus was not a prominent issue for the Jews during the first century, and after the devastation caused by the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in the year 70, Jewish scholars were focusing on preserving [[Judaism]] itself, rather than paying much attention to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E.

Van Voorst states that although the question of who was referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, in the case of ''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin 43a]]'' (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and there is little doubt that it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref name=Voorst117118&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E.

Tuckett]] states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'' by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 ISBN 0521796784 page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andreas Kostenberger]] states that the passage is a [[Tannaitic]] reference to the trial and death of Jesus at Passover and is most likely earlier than other references to Jesus in the Talmud.&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt; The passage reflects hostility toward Jesus among the rabbis and includes this text:&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blom280&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg (Aug 1, 2009) ISBN 0805444823 page 280&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is taught: On the eve of Passover they hung Yeshu and the crier went forth for forty days beforehand declaring that &quot;[Yeshu] is going to be stoned for practicing witchcraft, for enticing and leading Israel astray. Anyone who knows something to clear him should come forth and exonerate him.&quot; But no one had anything exonerating for him and they hung him on the eve of Passover.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 43a.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peter Schäfer]] states that there can be no doubt that the narrative of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are not [[Tannaitic]] but from a later [[Amoraic]] period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, and may have been written as responses to them.&lt;ref name=PeterS141&gt;''Jesus in the Talmud'' by Peter Schäfer (Aug 24, 2009) ISBN 0691143188 page 141 and 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart Ehrman]] and separately Mark Allan Powell state that given that the Talmud references are quite late, they can give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart Ehrman 2001 ISBN 019512474X page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell (Nov 1, 1998) ISBN 0664257038 page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference in early second century Rabbinic literature ([[Tosefta|Tosefta Hullin]] II 22) refers to Rabbi Eleazar ben Dama who was bitten by a snake, but was denied healing in the name of Jesus by another Rabbi for it was against the law, and thus died.&lt;ref name=Bammel393/&gt; This passage reflects the attitude of Jesus' early Jewish opponents, i.e. that his miracles were based on evil powers.&lt;ref name=Kee71&gt;''The Beginnings of Christianity'' by Howard Clark Kee (Nov 22, 2005) ISBN 0567027414 page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bammel393/&gt;

Eddy and Boyd, who question the value of several of the Talmudic references state that the significance of the Talmud to historical Jesus research is that it never denies the existence of Jesus, but accuses him of sorcery, thus indirectly confirming his existence.&lt;ref name=BEddy170/&gt; [[R. T. France]] and separately Edgar V. McKnight state that the divergence of the Talmud statements from the Christian accounts and their negative nature indicate that they are about a person who existed.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. France ''The Evidence for Jesus'' 2006 ISBN 1573833703 page 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 ISBN 0865546770 pages 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Blomberg states that the denial of the existence of Jesus was never part of the Jewish tradition, which instead accused him of being a sorcerer and magician, as also reflected in other sources such as [[Celsus]].&lt;ref name=Blom280/&gt; [[Andreas Kostenberger]]  states that the overall conclusion that can be drawn from the references in the Talmud is that Jesus was a historical person whose existence was never denied by the Jewish tradition, which instead focused on discrediting him.&lt;ref name=Kellum107 /&gt;

The letter refers to the unjust treatment of &quot;three wise men&quot;: the murder of [[Socrates]], the burning of [[Pythagoras]], and the execution of &quot;the wise king&quot; of the Jews.&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ute /&gt; The author explains that in all three cases the wrongdoing resulted in the future punishment of those responsible by God and that when the wise are oppressed, not only does their wisdom triumph in the end, but God punishes their oppressors.&lt;ref name=VVoorst53/&gt;

The letter includes no Christian themes and the author is presumed to be a [[pagan]].&lt;ref name=Ute/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chilton455&quot;/&gt; Some scholars see the reference to the execution of the &quot;wise king&quot; of the Jews as an early non-Christian reference to [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ute/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chilton455 /&gt; Criteria that support the non-Christian origin of the letter include the observation that &quot;king of the Jews&quot; was not a Christian title, and that the letter's premise that Jesus lives on based on the wisdom of his teachings is in contrast to the Christian concept that Jesus continues to live through his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref name=Chilton455 /&gt;&lt;ref name=VVoorst53&gt;''Jesus outside the New Testament: an introduction to the ancient evidence'' by Robert E.

Scholars such as [[Robert Van Voorst]] see little doubt that the reference to the execution of the &quot;[[Jesus, King of the Jews|king of the Jews]]&quot; is about the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VVoorst53&quot;/&gt; Others such as [[Craig A.

{{Main|Suetonius on Christians}}
[[File:Suetonius Lives of the Twelve Caesars 1540.jpg|thumb|150px|A 1540 copy of ''[[The Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'' by Suetonius ]]
The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] [[Suetonius]] made references to [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and their leader in his work ''[[The Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cradle110&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lives&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=BCCrossan3 &gt;''Birth of Christianity'' by John Dominic Crossan 1999 ISBN 0567086682 pages 3-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29 &gt;Robert E. Van Voorst, ''Jesus outside the New Testament: an introduction to the ancient evidence'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pp 29-39&lt;/ref&gt; The references appear in [[wikisource:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|Claudius 25]] and [[wikisource:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Nero#16|Nero 16]] which describe the lives of [[Roman Emperor]]s [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]].&lt;ref name=lives /&gt; The Nero 16 passage refers to the abuses by Nero and mentions how he inflicted punishment on Christians - which is generally dated to around AD 64.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire'' by Matthew Bunson 1994 ISBN 081602135X page 111&lt;/ref&gt; This passage shows the clear contempt of Suetonius for Christians - the same contempt expressed by [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the younger]] in their writings, but does not refer to Jesus himself.&lt;ref name=BCCrossan3 /&gt;

The earlier passage in Claudius, may include a reference to Jesus, but is subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref name=vvorst29 /&gt; In [[wikisource:The Lives of the Twelve Caesars/Claudius#25|Claudius 25]] Suetonius refers to the expulsion of Jews by Claudius and states:&lt;ref name=lives /&gt;

:&quot;Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome.&quot;

The reference in Claudius 25 involves the agitations in the Jewish community which led to the expulsion of some Jews from Rome by Claudius, and is likely the same event mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:2|18:2]]).&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt; Most historians date this expulsion to around AD 49-50.&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated18&quot;/&gt;

Suetonius refers to the leader of the leader of the Christians as ''Chrestus'' (a term which may have also been [[Tacitus on Christ|used by Tacitus]]) and was also common at the time, particularly for slaves, meaning good or useful.&lt;ref name=France42 &gt;R. T. France. The Evidence for Jesus. (2006). Regent College Publishing ISBN 1-57383-370-3. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Van Voorst states that there is &quot;near-unanimous&quot; agreement among scholars that the use of Chrestus here refers to Christ.&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt;

However, Suetonius is confused in the passage and assumes that Chrestus was alive at the time of the disturbance and was agitating the Jews in Rome.&lt;ref name=Cradle110 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunn141&gt;''Jesus Remembered'' by James D. G. Dunn 2003 ISBN 0-8028-3931-2 pages 141-143&lt;/ref&gt; The confusion of Suetonius weakens the  historical value of his reference as a whole, and there is no overall scholarly agreement about its value as a reference to Jesus.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt; However, the confusion of Suetonius also points to the lack of Christian interpolation, for a Christian scribe would not have confused the Jews with Christians.&lt;ref name=Dunn141/&gt;&lt;ref name=vvorst29/&gt; Scholars are divided on the value of the Suetonius' reference. Some scholars such as [[Craig A. Evans]], [[John P. Meier|John Meier]] and [[Craig S. Keener]] see it as a likely reference to Jesus&lt;ref name=BoydE166&gt;Eddy, Paul; Boyd, Gregory (2007).

===Pauline Epistles===
{{Main|Pauline epistles}}

====Overview====
[[File:P46.jpg|thumb|150px|A page from [[2 Corinthians]] in [[Papyrus 46]], c. AD 200]]
In the context of Christian sources, even if all other texts are ignored, the [[Pauline epistles]] can provide some information regarding Jesus, just on their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuckett126&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38 /&gt; This information does not include a narrative of the life of Jesus, but refers to his existence as a person, and a few specific items such as his death by crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Furnish43&gt;Victor Furnish in ''Paul and Jesus'' edited by Alexander J. M. Wedderburn 2004 (Academic Paperback) ISBN 0567083969 pages 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; This information comes from those letters of Paul whose authenticity is not disputed.&lt;ref name=McK38&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 ISBN 0865546770 page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, thirteen letters are attributed to Paul but only seven letters are considered authentic by almost all scholars, and the others are generally considered [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]].&lt;ref name=Perkins4 &gt;Pheme Perkins, ''Reading the New Testament: An Introduction'' (Paulist Press, 1988), ISBN 0809129396 pp. 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 7 undisputed letters (and their approximate dates) are: [[1 Thessalonians]] (c. 51 AD), [[Philippians]] (c. 52-54 AD), [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] (c. 52-54 AD), [[1 Corinthians]] (c. 53-54 AD), [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] (c. 55 AD), [[2 Corinthians]] (c. 55-56 AD) and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] (c. 55-58 AD).&lt;ref name=Perkins4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The authenticity of these letters is accepted by almost all scholars, and they have been referenced and interpreted by early authors such as [[Origen]] and [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref name=Gorday&gt;Peter Gorday in ''Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism'' by Harold W. Attridge 1992 ISBN 0814323618 pages 139-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the Pauline epistles are generally dated to AD 50 to AD 60, they are the earliest surviving Christian texts that include information about Jesus.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; These letters were written approximately twenty to thirty years after the generally accepted time period for the death of Jesus, around AD 30-36.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt; The letters were written during a time when Paul recorded encounters with the disciples of Jesus, e.g. Galatians 1:18 states that several years after his conversion Paul went to Jerusalem and stayed with Apostle Peter for fifteen days.&lt;ref name=Adams94&gt;Edward Adams in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'' by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 ISBN 0521796784 pages 94-96&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauline letters were not intended to provide a narrative of the life of Jesus, but were written as expositions of Christian teachings.&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;&lt;ref name=JRDunn143/&gt; In Paul's view, the earthly life of Jesus was of a lower importance than the theology of his death and resurrection,a theme that permeates Pauline writings.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul&gt;James D. G. Dunn &quot;Paul's understanding of the death of Jesus&quot; in ''Sacrifice and Redemption'' edited by S. W. Sykes (Dec 3, 2007) Cambridge University Press ISBN 052104460X pages 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pauline letters clearly indicate that for Paul Jesus was a real person (born of a woman as in Gal 4.4) who had disciples (1 Corinthians 15.5) and who was crucified (as in 1  Corinthians 2.2 and Galatians 3.1).&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;&lt;ref name=DunnPaul /&gt; And the letters reflect the general concept within the early Christian Church that Jesus existed and was crucified.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams94/&gt;

The references by Paul to Jesus do not in themselves prove the existence of Jesus, but they do establish that the existence of Jesus was the accepted norm within the early Christians (including the Christian community in Jerusalem, given the references to collections there) twenty to thirty years after the death of Jesus, at a time when those who could have been acquainted with him could still be alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 ISBN 0805444823 pages 441-442&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Betrayal and rituals'': That Jesus was betrayed and established some traditions such as the [[Eucharist]] are derived from  [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|1 Corinthians 11:23-25]] which states: &quot;The Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt;

:* ''Crucifixion'': The Pauline letters include several references to the crucifixion of Jesus e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11.23|
1 Corinthians 11.23]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#2:2|
1 Corinthians 2:2]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:1|
Galatians 3:1]] among others.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt; The death of Jesus forms a central element of the Pauline letters.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul/&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#2:15|1 Thessalonians 2:15]] places the responsibility for the death of Jesus on some Jews.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furnish19/&gt;

:* ''Burial'': [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:4|1 Corinthians 15:4]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#6:4|Romans 6:4]] state that following his death Jesus was [[empty tomb|buried in a tomb]].&lt;ref name=Furnish19&gt;''Jesus according to Paul'' by Victor Paul Furnish 1994 ISBN 0521458242 pages 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; This reference is then used by Paul to build on the theology of resurrection, but reflects the common belief at the time that Jesus was buried after his death.&lt;ref&gt;''1 Corinthians'' by Richard Oster 1995 ISBN 0899006337 page 353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Apostle Paul: His Life and Theology'' by Udo Schnelle (Nov 1, 2005) ISBN 0801027969 pages 329-330&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of only these references to Jesus in the Pauline epistles has given rise to criticism of them by [[G. A. Wells]], who is generally accepted as a leader of the movement to deny the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name=WellsT49 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Casey39 /&gt; When Wells was still denying the existence of Jesus, he criticized the Pauline epistles for not mentioning items such as John the Baptist or Judas or the trial of Jesus and used that argument to conclude that Jesus was not a historical figure.&lt;ref name=WellsT49/&gt;&lt;ref name= Casey39&gt;'Jesus of Nazareth: An independent historian's account of his life and teaching'' by Maurice Casey page 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Dunn29&gt;''The Evidence for Jesus'' by James D. G. Dunn (Jan 1, 1986) ISBN 0664246982 page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James D. G. Dunn]] addressed Wells' statement and stated that he knew of no other scholar that shared that view, and most other scholars had other and more plausible explanations for the fact that Paul did not include a narrative of the life of Jesus in his letters, which were primarily written as religious documents rather than historical chronicles at a time when the life story of Jesus could have been well known within the early Church.&lt;ref name= Dunn29 /&gt; Dunn states that despite Wells' arguments, the theories of the non-existence of Jesus are a &quot;thoroughly dead thesis&quot;.&lt;ref name=DunnPaul /&gt;

While Wells no longer denies the existence of Jesus, he has responded to Dunn, stating that his [[arguments from silence]] not only apply to Paul but all early Christian authors, and that he still has a low opinion of early Christian texts, maintaining that for Paul Jesus may have existed a good number of decades before.&lt;ref name=WellsT49&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells 2003 ISBN 0812695674 pages 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-Pauline creeds====
{{Main|Creed}}
The Pauline letters sometimes refer to creeds, or confessions of faith, that predate their writings.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BAune /&gt;&lt;ref name=RMartin57 &gt;''Worship in the Early Church'' by Ralph P. Martin 1975 ISBN 0802816134 pages 57-58&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3-4]] reads: &quot;For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kruse41 &gt;''Paul's Letter to the Romans'' by Colin G. Kruse (Jul 1, 2012) ISBN 0802837433 pages 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#1:3|Romans 1:3-4]] refers to Romans 1:2 just before it which mentions an existing gospel, and in effect may be treating it as an earlier creed.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BAune /&gt;

One of the keys to identifying a pre-Pauline tradition is given in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:11|1 Corinthians 15:11]]&lt;ref name=RMartin57 /&gt;

: Whether then [it be] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

Here Paul refers to others before him who preached the creed.&lt;ref name=RMartin57 /&gt; The Pauline letters thus contain Christian creed elements of pre-Pauline origin.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, ''The Earliest Christian Confessions'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964) p. 47

*R. E. Brown, ''The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus'' (New York: Paulist Press, 1973) pp. 81, 92&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquity of the creed has been located by many Biblical scholars to less than a decade after Jesus' death, originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.&lt;ref&gt;see Wolfhart Pannenberg, ''Jesus – God and Man'' translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968)p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, ''The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology'', ed.

M. Hunter said, &quot;The passage therefore preserves uniquely early and verifiable testimony. It meets every reasonable demand of historical reliability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Hunter, ''Works and Words of Jesus'' (1973) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

These creeds date to within a few years of Jesus' death, and developed within the Christian community in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Leith12 &gt;''Creeds of the Churches, Third Edition'' by John H. Leith (Jan 1, 1982) ISBN 0804205264 page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Although embedded within the texts of the New Testament, these creeds are a distinct source for [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name=BAune &gt;''The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament'' edited by David E. Aune 2010 ISBN 1405108258 page 424&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that existence and death of Jesus was part of Christian belief a few years after his death and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles.&lt;ref name=Leith12 /&gt;

===Gospels===
{{see also|Historical Jesus|Synoptic problem|Historicity of the canonical Gospels}}
[[Image:P52 recto.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|P52]], a papyrus fragment from a codex (''c''. 90–160), one of the earliest known New Testament manuscripts.]]
The four canonical gospels, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], are the main sources for the biography of Jesus’ life, the teachings and actions attributed to him.&lt;ref name=Blomb442 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 ISBN 0-8054-4482-3 pages 441-442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fahlbusch52 &gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, 2005 ISBN 978-0-8028-2416-5 pages 52-56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans465 &gt;The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 ISBN 0-7814-3868-3 pages 465-477&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these namely Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are known as the [[synoptic Gospels]], from the Greek σύν (syn &quot;together&quot;) and ὄψις (opsis &quot;view&quot;), given that they display a high degree of similarity in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure.&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament Theology by Paul Haffner'' 2008 ISBN 88-902268-0-3 page 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to the Gospels'' by W. Graham Scroggie 1995 ISBN 0-8254-3744-X page 128&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation in the fourth canonical gospel, i.e. John, differs from these three in that it has more of a thematic nature rather than a narrative format.&lt;ref name=Moloney3 /&gt; Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the synoptic gospels and the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Moloney3 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' by Francis J. Moloney, Daniel J. Harrington 1998 ISBN 0-8146-5806-7 page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the New Testament generally showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 ISBN 0-86012-006-6 pages 730-731&lt;/ref&gt; The gospels were primarily written as theological documents in the context of [[early Christianity]] with the chronological timelines as a secondary consideration.&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 &gt;''Interpreting Gospel Narratives: Scenes, People, and Theology'' by Timothy Wiarda 2010 ISBN 0-8054-4843-8 pages 75-78&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of the gospels being theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Turner613 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 ISBN 0-8010-2684-9 page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, scholars have used them to reconstruct a number of portraits of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sanders3&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus'' ISBN 0140144994 Penguin, 1993. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#21:25|John 21:25]] the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Gerald3 &gt;''[[Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus]]'' by [[Gerald O'Collins]] 2009 ISBN 0-19-955787-X pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have varying degrees of certainty about the historical reliability of the accounts in the gospels, and the only two events whose historicity is the subject of almost universal agreement among scholars are the [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt; Scholars such as [[E.P. Sanders]] and separately [[Craig A. Evans]] go further and assume that two other events in the gospels are historically certain, namely that Jesus [[Twelve apostles|called disciples]], and caused a [[Cleansing of the Temple|controversy at the Temple]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans37&quot;/&gt;

Ever since the [[Augustinian hypothesis]], scholars continue to debate the order in which the gospels were written, and how they may have influenced each other, and several hypothesis exist in that regard, e.g. the [[Markan priority]] hypothesis holds that the Gospel of Mark was written first ''c.'' 70 AD/CE.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible'' edited by James D. G. Dunn (Nov 19, 2003) ISBN 0802837115 pages 1064-1065&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meier|first=John P.|authorlink=John P. Meier|title=A Marginal Jew|publisher=Doubleday|year=1991|location=New York, New York|pages=v.2 955–6|isbn=0-385-46993-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, Matthew is placed at being sometime after this date and Luke is thought to have been written between 70 and 100 AD/CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris Gospels&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L. Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. &quot;The Gospels&quot; p. 266-268&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the competing, and more popular, [[Q source]] hypothesis, the gospels were not independently written, but were derived from a common source called Q.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Jan 31, 1995) ISBN 0802837840 pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament: History, Literature, Religion'' by Gerd Theissen 2003 ISBN page 31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[two-source hypothesis]] then proposes that the authors of Matthew and Luke drew on the Gospel of Mark as well as on Q.&lt;ref&gt;''Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'' by Robert L. Thomas 2002 ISBN 0825438381 page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The gospels can be seen as having three separate lines: A literary line which looks at it from a textual perspective, secondly a historical line which observes how Christianity started as a renewal movement within Judaism and eventually separated from it, and finally a theological line which analyzes Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament: History, Literature, Religion'' by Gerd Theissen 2003 ISBN page x&lt;/ref&gt; Within the historical perspective, the gospels are not simply used to establish the existence of Jesus as sources in their own right alone, but their content is compared and contrasted to non-Christian sources, and the historical context, to draw conclusions about the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Tuckett126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voorst7&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.. ISBN 0-8028-4368-9 page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Church fathers===
[[File:Eusebius of Caesarea.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Eusebius of Caesarea]]]]
Two possible [[Church Fathers|patristic sources]] that may refer to eye witness encounters with Jesus are the early references of [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] and [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]], reported by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the 4th century.&lt;ref name=Bauck15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr22/&gt;

The works of Papias have not survived, but [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] quotes him as saying:&lt;ref name=Bauck15&gt;Richard Bauckham ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans, 2006), ISBN 0802831621 pp. 15–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;…if by chance anyone who had been in attendance on the elders should come my way, I inquired about the words of the elders — that is, what according to the elders Andrew or Peter said, or Philip, or Thomas or James, or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples, and whatever Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, were saying.&quot;

[[Richard Bauckham]] states that while Papias was collecting his information (''c''. 90), Aristion and the elder John (who were Jesus’ disciples) were still alive and teaching in [[Asia minor]], and Papias gathered information from people who had known them.&lt;ref name=Bauck15/&gt; However, the exact identity of the &quot;elder John&quot; is wound up in the debate on the authorship of the [[Gospel of John]], and scholars have differing opinions on that, e.g. [[Jack Finegan]] states that Eusebius may have misunderstood what Papias wrote, and the elder John may be a different person from the author of the fourth gospel, yet still a disciple of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Finegan42 &gt;''The archeology of the New Testament'' by Jack Finegan (Jan 1, 1981) ISBN 0709910061 pages 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Burge, on the other hand sees confusion on the part of Eusebius and holds the elder John to be different person from the apostle John.&lt;ref&gt;''Interpreting the Gospel of John'' by Gary M. Burge (Sep 1, 1998) ISBN 0801010217 pages 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter of Quadratus (possibly the first Christian apologist) to emperor [[Hadrian]] (who reigned 117 – 138) is likely to have an early date and is reported by [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' 4.3.2 to have stated:&lt;ref&gt;''Eusebius: The Church History'' by Eusebius and Paul L. Maier (May 31, 2007) ISBN 082543307X page 119&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;The words of our Savior were always present, for they were true: those who were healed, those who rose from the dead, those who were not only seen in the act of being healed or raised, but were also always present, not merely when the Savior was living on earth, but also for a considerable time after his departure, so that some of them survived even to our own times.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bauckham53 &gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), pp. 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

By “our Savior” Quadratus means Jesus and the letter is most likely written before AD 124.&lt;ref name=Carr22&gt;''The Early Christian Church: Volume 2, The Second Christian Century by Philip Carrington (Aug 11, 2011) ISBN 0521157382 pages 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham states that by “our times” he may refer to his early life, rather than when he wrote (117–124), which would be a reference contemporary with Papias.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), pp. 53l.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bauckham states that the importance of the statement attributed to Quadratus is that he emphasizes the &quot;eye witness&quot; nature of the testimonies to interaction with Jesus.&lt;ref name=Bauckham53 /&gt;

===Gnostic and apocryphal texts===
{{see also|Gnostic gospels|New Testament apocrypha}}
A number of later Christian texts, usually dating to the second century or later, exist as [[New Testament apocrypha]], among which the [[gnostic gospels]] have been of major recent interest among scholars.&lt;ref name=vvoorst215 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. ISBN 0-8028-4368-9 page 215-217&lt;/ref&gt; The 1945 discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] created a significant amount of scholarly interest and many modern scholars have since studied the gnostic gospels and written about them.&lt;ref name=Keener52 /&gt; However, the trend among the 21st century scholars has been to accept that while the gnostic gospels may shed light on the progression of early Christian beliefs, they offer very little to contribute to the study of the historicity of Jesus, in that they are rather late writings, usually consisting of sayings (rather than narrative), their authenticity and authorship remain questionable, and various parts of them rely on components of the New Testament.&lt;ref name=Keener52 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BartProphet72/&gt; The focus of modern research into the historical Jesus has been away from gnostic writings and towards the comparison of Jewish, [[Greco-Roman]] and [[canonical gospel|canonical]] Christian sources.&lt;ref name=Keener52 &gt;''The Historical Jesus of the Gospels'' by Craig S. Keener 2012 ISBN 0802868886 pages 52-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BartProphet72&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart D. Ehrman 2001 ISBN 019512474X pages 72-78&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, [[Bart Ehrman]] states that gnostic writings of the [[Gospel of Thomas]] (part of the Nag Hammadi library) have very little value in historical Jesus research, because the author of that gospel placed no importance on the physical experiences of Jesus (e.g. his crucifixion) or the physical existence of believers, and was only interested in the secret teachings of Jesus rather than any physical events.&lt;ref name=BartProphet72 /&gt; Similarly, the [[Apocryphon of John]] (also part of the Nag Hammadi library) has been useful in studying the prevailing attitudes in the second century, and questions of authorship regarding the [[Book of revelation]], given that it refers to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#1|Revelation 1:19]],  but is mostly about the [[Ascension of Jesus|post ascension]] teachings of Jesus in a vision, not a narrative of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Revelation'' by Robert H. Mounce 1997 ISBN 0802825370 page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars such as Edward Arnal contend that the Gospel of Thomas continues to remain useful for understanding how the teachings of Jesus were transmitted among early Christians, and sheds light on the development of early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Symbolic Jesus'' by William Edward Arnal 2005 ISBN 1845530071 pages 60-70&lt;/ref&gt;

There is overlap between the sayings of Jesus in the apocryphal texts and canonical Christian writings, and those not present in the canonical texts are called [[agrapha]]. There are at least 225 agrapha but most scholars who have studied them have drawn negative conclusions about the authenticity of most of them and see little value in using them for historical Jesus research.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 /&gt; Robert Van Voorst states that the vast majority of the agrapha are certainly inauthentic.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 /&gt; Scholars differ on the number of authentic agrapha, some estimating as low as 7 as authentic, others as high as 18 among the more than 200, rendering them of little value altogether.&lt;ref name=vvoorst183 &gt;Van Voorst, Robert E (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. ISBN 0-8028-4368-9 page 183&lt;/ref&gt; While research on apocryphal texts continues, the general scholarly opinion holds that they have little to offer to the study of the historicity of Jesus given that they are often of uncertain origin, and almost always later documents of lower value.&lt;ref name=vvoorst215 /&gt;
