The first Klan flourished in the [[Southern United States]] in the late 1860s, then died out by the early 1870s. Members adopted white costumes: robes, masks, and [[Pointed hat|conical hats]], designed to be outlandish and terrifying, and to hide their identities.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Frantz Parsons, &quot;Midnight Rangers: Costume and Performance in the Reconstruction-Era Ku Klux Klan&quot;. ''Journal of American History'' 92.3 (2005): 811–36, in [[History Cooperative]].&lt;/ref&gt; The second KKK flourished nationwide in the early and mid 1920s, and adopted the same costumes and code words as the first Klan, while introducing [[cross burning]]s.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; The third KKK emerged after World War II and was associated with opposing the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and progress among minorities. The second and third incarnations of the Ku Klux Klan made frequent reference to the USA's &quot;[[English-American|Anglo-Saxon]]&quot; and &quot;[[Celtic nations|Celtic]]&quot; blood, harking back to 19th-century nativism and claiming descent from the original 18th-century [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonial revolutionaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Newton, ''The Invisible Empire: The Ku Klux Klan in Florida''.&lt;/ref&gt; The first and third incarnations of the Klan have well-established records of engaging in terrorism and political violence, though historians debate whether or not the tactic was supported by the second KKK.

==Overview; Three Klans==
===First KKK===
The first Klan was founded in 1865 in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]], by six veterans of the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/history.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk |title=Ku Klux Klan – Extremism in America |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is probably from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''kuklos'' ([[wikt:κύκλος|κύκλος]]) which means circle, suggesting a circle or band of brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-694 |title=Ku Klux Klan in the Reconstruction Era |work=New Georgia Encyclopedia |date=October 3, 2002 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although there was no organizational structure above the local level, similar groups arose across the South adopted the same name and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease, ''White Terror'' (1971), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Klan groups spread throughout the South as an insurgent movement during the [[Reconstruction era in the United States]]. As a secret [[vigilante]] group, the Klan targeted freedmen and their allies; it sought to restore [[white supremacy]] by threats and violence, including murder, against [[freedmen|black]] and white [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]]. In 1870 and 1871, the federal government passed the [[Force Acts#Acts after the Civil War|Force Acts]], which were used to prosecute Klan crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/major-acts-congress/ku-klux-klan-act |title=Ku Klux Klan Act (1871): Major Acts of Congress |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecution of Klan crimes and enforcement of the Force Acts suppressed Klan activity. In 1874 and later, however, newly organized and openly active [[paramilitary]] organizations, such as the [[White League]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], started a fresh round of violence aimed at suppressing blacks' voting and running Republicans out of office. These contributed to segregationist white Democrats regaining political power in all the Southern states by 1877.

===Second KKK===
In 1915, the second Klan was founded in Atlanta, Georgia. Starting in 1921, it adopted a modern business system of recruiting (which paid most of the initiation fee and costume charges as commissions to the organizers) and grew rapidly nationwide at a time of prosperity. Reflecting the social tensions of urban industrialization and vastly increased immigration, its membership grew most rapidly in cities, and spread out of the South to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and West. The second KKK preached &quot;One Hundred Percent Americanism&quot; and demanded the purification of politics, calling for strict morality and better enforcement of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Its official rhetoric focused on the threat of the Catholic Church, using [[anti-Catholicism]] and [[nativism (politics)|nativism]].&lt;ref name=pegram&gt;Thomas R. Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American: The Rebirth and Decline of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s'' (2011), pp. 47-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Its appeal was directed exclusively at white Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly J. Baker, ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915-1930'' (2011), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Some local groups took part in attacks on private houses and carried out other violent activities. The violent episodes were generally in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Klan was a formal [[fraternal and service organizations|fraternal organization]], with a national and state structure. At its peak in the mid-1920s, the organization claimed to include about 15% of the nation's eligible population, approximately 4–5 million men. Internal divisions, criminal behavior by leaders, and external opposition brought about a collapse in membership, which had dropped to about 30,000 by 1930. It finally faded away in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2730 |title=Ku Klux Klan in the Twentieth Century |accessdate= |author=Lay, Shawn |date= |work=[[The New Georgia Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Coker College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Klan organizers also operated in Canada, especially in [[History of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]] in 1926-28, where it attacked immigrants from Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Sher, ''White Hoods: Canada's Ku Klux Klan'' (1983), pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third KKK===
The &quot;Ku Klux Klan&quot; name was used by many independent local groups opposing the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[desegregation]], especially in the 1950s and 1960s. During this period, they often forged alliances with Southern police departments, as in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]; or with governor's offices, as with [[George C. Wallace|George Wallace]] of Alabama.&lt;ref name=&quot;McWhorter&quot;&gt;McWhorter 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of KKK groups were convicted of murder in the deaths of civil rights workers and children in the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham]]. Today, researchers estimate that there may be 150 Klan chapters with upwards of 5,000 members nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk|title=About the Ku Klux Klan |publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a large majority of sources classify the Klan as a &quot;subversive or terrorist organization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk|title=About the Ku Klux Klan |publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Virginia Tech&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/16/us/inquiry-begun-on-klan-ties-of-2-icons-at-virginia-tech.html|title=Inquiry Begun on Klan Ties Of 2 Icons at Virginia Tech|date=November 16, 1997|publisher=NY Times|page=138|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee, Jennifer&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/us/06bowers.html|title=Samuel Bowers, 82, Klan Leader Convicted in Fatal Bombing, Dies |last=Lee|first=Jennifer|date=November 6, 2006|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brush, Pete&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/05/28/supremecourt/main510317.shtml|title=Court Will Review Cross Burning Ban|last=Brush|first=Pete|date=May 28, 2002|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1997, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents arrested four members of the True Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Dallas for conspiracy to commit robbery and to blow up a natural gas processing plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dallas.fbi.gov/history.htm Dallas.FBI.gov &quot;Domestic terrorism by the Klan remained a key concern&quot;], FBI, Dallas office&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the city council of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] passed a resolution declaring the Klan to be a terrorist organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charleston&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c0wPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J4YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6460,2081194&amp;dq=klan+terrorist-organization&amp;hl=en|title=Klan named terrorist organization in Charleston|date=October 14, 1999|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a professor at the [[University of Louisville]] began a campaign to have the Klan declared a terrorist organization in order to ban it from campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5030023|title=Ban the Klan?

==First Klan 1865–1874==
=== Creation and naming ===
[[File:Kkk-carpetbagger-cartoon.jpg|thumb|250px|A cartoon threatening that the KKK would [[lynching in the United States|lynch]] [[carpetbagger]]s. From the ''Independent Monitor'', [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], 1868.]]
Six well-educated [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans from [[Pulaski, Tennessee]], created the original Ku Klux Klan on December 24, 1865, during [[Reconstruction Era in the United States|Reconstruction]] of the South after the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 9. The founders were John C. Lester, John B. Kennedy, James R. Crowe, Frank O. McCord, Richard R. Reed, and J. Calvin Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Walter J., Ku Klux Klan: Its Origins, Growth and Disbandment, p. 27, 1905, Neale Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was formed by combining the Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[kyklos]]}}'' (''κύκλος'', ''circle'') with ''[[clan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 11, states that Reed proposed ''{{lang|grc|κύκλος}}'' (''{{lang|grc-Latn|kyklos}}'') and Kennedy added ''clan''. Wade 1987, p. 33 says that Kennedy came up with both words, but Crowe suggested transforming ''{{lang|grc|κύκλος}}'' into ''{{lang|grc-Latn|kuklux}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was known for a short time as the &quot;Kuklux Clan&quot;. The Ku Klux Klan was one among a number of secret, oath-bound organizations using violence, including the Southern Cross in [[New Orleans]] (1865) and the [[Knights of the White Camelia]] (1867) in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, pp. 679–680.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally see the KKK as part of the post Civil War [[insurgent]] violence related not only to the high number of veterans in the population, but also to their effort to control the dramatically changed social situation by using extrajudicial means to restore white supremacy. In 1866, [[Mississippi]] Governor [[William L. Sharkey]] reported that disorder, lack of control and lawlessness were widespread; in some states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. The Klan used public violence against blacks as intimidation. They burned houses, and attacked and killed blacks, leaving their bodies on the roads.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, p. 671–675.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anti-kkk-cartoon.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon depicting the KKK and the Democratic Party as continuations of the Confederacy]]
At an 1867 meeting in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Klan members gathered to try to create a hierarchical organization with local chapters eventually reporting up to a national headquarters. Since most of the Klan's members were veterans, they were used to the hierarchical structure of the organization, but the Klan never operated under this centralized structure. Local chapters and bands were highly independent.

Former Confederate Brigadier General [[George Gordon (Civil War General)|George Gordon]] developed the ''Prescript'', or Klan [[dogma]]. The Prescript suggested elements of white supremacist belief. For instance, an applicant should be asked if he was in favor of &quot;a white man's government&quot;, &quot;the reenfranchisement and emancipation of the white men of the South, and the restitution of the Southern people to all their rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/gz580/his101/kkk.html |title=Ku Klux Klan, Organization and Principles, 1868 |accessdate= |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[State University of New York at Albany]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a reference to the [[Ironclad Oath]], which stripped the vote from white persons who refused to swear that they had not borne arms against the Union. Confederate General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] became [[Grand Wizard]], claiming to be the Klan's national leader.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= A Battle from the Start: The Life of Nathan Bedford Forrest |last= Wills |first= Brian Steel |year= 1992 |publisher= HarperCollins Publishers |location= New York, New York|page=336|isbn= 0-06-092445-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NathanBedfordForrest.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]]]

In an 1868 newspaper interview, Forrest stated that the Klan's primary opposition was to the [[Loyal Leagues]], [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] state governments, people like Tennessee governor [[William Gannaway Brownlow|Brownlow]] and other [[carpetbagger]]s and [[scalawag]]s. He argued that many southerners believed that blacks were voting for the Republican Party because they were being hoodwinked by the Loyal Leagues.&lt;ref&gt;Cincinnati ''Commercial'', August 28, 1868, quoted in Wade, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; One Alabama newspaper editor declared &quot;The League is nothing more than a nigger Ku Klux Klan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Gordon's and Forrest's work, local Klan units never accepted the Prescript and continued to operate autonomously. There were never hierarchical levels or state headquarters. Klan members used violence to settle old feuds and local grudges, as they worked to restore white dominance in the disrupted postwar society. The historian Elaine Frantz Parsons describes the membership:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of antiblack [[vigilante]] groups, disgruntled poor white farmers, wartime [[guerrilla]] bands, displaced Democratic politicians, [[rum-running|illegal whiskey]] [[distilling|distillers]], [[coercion|coercive]] moral reformers, [[sadomasochism|sadists]], [[rape|rapists]], white workmen fearful of black competition, employers trying to enforce labor discipline, common thieves, neighbors with decades-old grudges, and even a few [[freedmen]] and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own. Indeed, all they had in common, besides being overwhelmingly white, southern, and Democratic, was that they called themselves, or were called, Klansmen.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 2005, p. 816.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Eric Foner]] observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic party]], the planter class, and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy. Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society. It aimed to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction: to destroy the Republican party's infrastructure, undermine the Reconstruction state, reestablish control of the black labor force, and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner425&quot;&gt;Foner 1989, p. 425–426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Wikisource|Interview with Nathan Bedford Forrest}}

To that end they worked to curb the education, economic advancement, [[voting rights]], and [[right to arms|right to keep and bear arms]] of blacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner425&quot;/&gt; The Ku Klux Klan soon spread into nearly every southern state, launching a &quot;[[reign of terror]] against [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] leaders both black and white. Those political leaders assassinated during the campaign included [[Arkansas]] Congressman [[James M. Hinds]], three members of the [[South Carolina]] legislature, and several men who served in constitutional conventions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1989, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klan members adopted masks and robes that hid their identities and added to the drama of their night rides, their chosen time for attacks. Many of them operated in small towns and rural areas where people otherwise knew each other's faces, and sometimes still recognized the attackers. &quot;The kind of thing that men are afraid or ashamed to do openly, and by day, they accomplish secretly, masked, and at night.&quot; With this method both the high and the low could be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, pp. 677–678.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ku Klux Klan night riders &quot;sometimes claimed to be ghosts of Confederate soldiers so, as they claimed, to frighten superstitious blacks. Few freedmen took such nonsense seriously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'', New York: Perennial Classics, 1989; reprinted 2002, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 404 page error&lt;ref name=&quot;splc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iupui.edu/~aao/kkk.html |title= A Hundred Years of Terror |accessdate= |author= A special report prepared by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date= |work= |publisher= [[Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The Klan attacked black members of the [[Loyal Leagues]] and intimidated southern Republicans and [[Freedmen's Bureau]] workers. When they killed black political leaders, they also took heads of families, along with the leaders of churches and community groups, because these people had many roles in society. Agents of the Freedmen's Bureau reported weekly assaults and murders of blacks.
&quot;Armed guerrilla warfare killed thousands of Negroes; political riots were staged; their causes or occasions were always obscure, their results always certain: ten to one hundred times as many Negroes were killed as whites.&quot; Masked men shot into houses and burned them, sometimes with the occupants still inside. They drove successful black farmers off their land. &quot;Generally, it can be reported that in North and South Carolina, in 18 months ending in June 1867, there were 197 murders and 548 cases of aggravated assault.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, pp. 674–675.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George W. Ashburn.jpg|thumb|200px|[[George W. Ashburn]] assassinated for his pro–black sentiments.]]
Klan violence worked to suppress black voting. More than 2,000 persons were killed, wounded and otherwise injured in [[Louisiana]] within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868. Although [[St. Landry Parish]] had a registered Republican majority of 1,071, after the murders, no Republicans voted in the fall elections. White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for Grant's opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods. Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot; a half-buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods. The KKK made people vote Democratic and gave them certificates of the fact.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, pp.680–681.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the April 1868 [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] gubernatorial election, [[Columbia County, Georgia|Columbia County]] cast 1,222 votes for Republican [[Rufus Bullock]]. By the [[United States presidential election, 1868|November presidential election]], however, Klan intimidation led to suppression of the Republican vote and only one person voted for [[Ulysses S. Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-694 |title=Ku Klux Klan in the Reconstruction Era |accessdate= |author=Bryant, Jonathan M |date= |work=[[The New Georgia Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Georgia Southern University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klansmen killed more than 150 African Americans in a county in [[Florida]], and hundreds more in other counties. Freedmen's Bureau records provided a detailed recounting of Klansmen's beatings and murders of freedmen and their white allies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Newton, ''The Invisible Empire: The Ku Klux Klan in Florida'', pp. 1–30. Newton quotes from the ''Testimony Taken by the Joint Select Committee to Enquire into the Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States'', Vol. 13. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1872. Among historians of the Klan, this volume is also known as ''The KKK testimony''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milder encounters also occurred. In [[Mississippi]], according to the Congressional inquiry:&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 1920, pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of these teachers (Miss Allen of [[Illinois]]), whose school was at Cotton Gin Port in [[Monroe County, Mississippi|Monroe County]], was visited ... between one and two o'clock in the morning on March 1871, by about fifty men mounted and disguised. Each man wore a long white robe and his face was covered by a loose mask with scarlet stripes. She was ordered to get up and dress which she did at once and then admitted to her room the captain and lieutenant who in addition to the usual disguise had long horns on their heads and a sort of device in front. The lieutenant had a [[pistol]] in his hand and he and the captain sat down while eight or ten men stood inside the door and the porch was full. They treated her &quot;gentlemanly and quietly&quot; but complained of the heavy school-tax, said she must stop teaching and go away and warned her that they never gave a second notice. She heeded the warning and left the county.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1868, two years after the Klan's creation, its activity was beginning to decrease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horn-p375&quot;&gt;Horn 1939, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Members were hiding behind Klan masks and robes as a way to avoid prosecution for freelance violence. Many influential southern Democrats feared that Klan lawlessness provided an excuse for the federal government to retain its power over the South, and they began to turn against it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade-p102&quot;&gt;Wade 1987, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; There were outlandish claims made, such as Georgian [[B. H. Hill]] stating &quot;that some of these outrages were actually perpetrated by the political friends of the parties slain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Horn-p375&quot;/&gt;

===Resistance===
Union Army veterans in mountainous [[Blount County, Alabama]], organized &quot;the anti-Ku Klux&quot;. They put an end to violence by threatening Klansmen with reprisals unless they stopped whipping Unionists and burning black churches and schools. Armed blacks formed their own defense in [[Bennettsville, South Carolina]] and patrolled the streets to protect their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1989, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

National sentiment gathered to crack down on the Klan, even though some Democrats at the national level questioned whether the Klan really existed or believed that it was just a creation of nervous Southern Republican governors.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Many southern states began to pass anti-Klan legislation.

{{Wikisource|Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871}}
In January 1871, [[Pennsylvania]] Republican Senator [[John Scott (Pennsylvania)|John Scott]] convened a Congressional committee which took testimony from 52 witnesses about Klan atrocities. They accumulated 12 volumes of horrifying testimony. In February, former Union General and Congressman [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]] of [[Massachusetts]] introduced the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] (Ku Klux Klan Act). This added to the enmity that southern white Democrats bore toward him.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; While the bill was being considered, further violence in the South swung support for its passage. The [[Governor of South Carolina]] appealed for federal troops to assist his efforts in keeping control of the state. A [[Meridian race riot of 1871|riot and massacre]] in a [[Meridian, Mississippi]], courthouse were reported, from which a black state representative escaped only by taking to the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1871 Civil Rights Act allowed President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to suspend [[Habeas Corpus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scaturro&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Scaturro |first=Frank |title=The Presidency of Ulysses S.

[[File:BenFrankButler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]] wrote the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] (Klan Act)]]

In 1871, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed Butler's legislation. The Ku Klux Klan Act was used by the Federal government together with the 1870 Force Act, another act that President Grant signed, to enforce the civil rights provisions for individuals under the constitution. Under the 1871 Klan Act, after the Klan refused to voluntarily dissolve, President Grant issued a suspension of [[Habeas Corpus]], and sent Federal troops into 9 [[South Carolina]] counties. The Klansmen were arrested and prosecuted in Federal court. More African Americans served on juries in Federal court than were selected for local or state juries, so they had a chance to participate in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scaturro&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrow-stories&quot;/&gt; In the crackdown, hundreds of Klan members were fined or imprisoned.

===The Klan declines and is superseded by other groups===
Although Forrest boasted that the Klan was a nationwide organization of 550,000 men and that he could muster 40,000 Klansmen within five days' notice, as a secret or &quot;[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]&quot; group, it had no membership rosters, no chapters, and no local officers. It was difficult for observers to judge its actual membership. It had created a sensation by the dramatic nature of its masked forays and because of its many murders.

In 1870 a federal grand jury determined that the Klan was a &quot;[[terrorist]] organization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isbn.nu/toc/9780807119532 |title=''White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' by Allen W. Trelease (Louisiana State University Press: 1995) |publisher=Isbn.nu |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It issued hundreds of indictments for crimes of violence and terrorism. Klan members were prosecuted, and many fled from areas that were under federal government jurisdiction, particularly in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Trelease 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people not formally inducted into the Klan had used the Klan's costume for anonymity, to hide their identities when carrying out acts of violence. Forrest ordered the Klan to disband in 1869, stating that it was &quot;being perverted from its original honorable and patriotic purposes, becoming injurious instead of subservient to the public peace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from Wade 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Stanley Horn]] writes &quot;generally speaking, the Klan's end was more in the form of spotty, slow, and gradual disintegration than a formal and decisive disbandment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter in Georgia wrote in January 1870, &quot;A true statement of the case is not that the Ku Klux are an organized band of licensed criminals, but that men who commit crimes call themselves Ku Klux&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1939, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NCG-WilliamHolden.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gov. [[William Woods Holden|William Holden]] of North Carolina.]]

While people used the Klan as a mask for nonpolitical crimes, state and local governments seldom acted against them. African Americans were kept off juries. In lynching cases, all-white juries almost never indicted Ku Klux Klan members. When there was a rare indictment, juries were unlikely to vote for a conviction. In part, jury members feared reprisals from local Klansmen.

Others may have agreed with lynching as a way of keeping dominance over black men. In many states, officials were reluctant to use black militia against the Klan out of fear that racial tensions would be raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrow-stories&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_enforce.html |title=The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow—The Enforcement Acts (1870–1871) |accessdate= |author=Wormser, Richard |date= |work= |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Republican [[Governor of North Carolina]] [[William Woods Holden]] called out the militia against the Klan in 1870, it added to his unpopularity. Combined with violence and fraud at the polls, the Republicans lost their majority in the state legislature. Disaffection with Holden's actions led to white Democratic legislators' impeaching Holden and removing him from office, but their reasons were numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Klan was destroyed in South Carolina&lt;ref&gt;Wade, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; and decimated throughout the rest of the South, where it had already been in decline. Attorney General [[Amos Tappan Ackerman]] led the prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 109, writes that by ca. 1871–1874, &quot;For many, the lapse of the enforcement acts was justified since their reason for being—the Ku-Klux Klan—had been effectively smashed as a result of the dramatic showdown in South Carolina&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, other local paramilitary organizations such as the [[White League]], [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], saber clubs, and rifle clubs continued to intimidate and murder black voters.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, organized white [[paramilitary]] groups were formed in the Deep South to replace the faltering Klan: the [[White League]] in [[Louisiana]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]]. They campaigned openly to turn Republicans out of office, intimidated and killed black voters, tried to disrupt organizing and suppressed black voting. They were out in force during the campaigns and elections of 1874 and 1876, contributing to the conservative Democrats regaining power in 1876, against a background of electoral violence.

Shortly after, in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875), the Supreme Court ruled that the Force Act of 1870 did not give the Federal government power to regulate private actions, but only those by state governments. The result was that as the century went on, African Americans were at the mercy of hostile state governments that refused to intervene against private violence and paramilitary groups.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whereas the number of indictments across the South was large, the number of cases leading to prosecution and sentencing was relatively small. The overloaded federal courts were not able to meet the demands of trying such a tremendous number of cases, a situation that led to selective pardoning. By late 1873 and 1874, most of the charges against Klansmen were dropped although new cases continued to be prosecuted for several more years. Most of those sentenced had either served their terms or had been pardoned by 1875.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] eviscerated the Ku Klux Act in 1876 by ruling that the federal government could no longer prosecute individuals although states would be forced to comply with federal civil rights provisions. Republicans passed a second civil rights act (the Civil Rights Act of 1875) to grant equal access to public facilities and other housing accommodations regardless of race. Ironically, the Klan during this period served to further Northern reconstruction efforts, as Ku Klux violence provided the political climate needed to pass civil rights protections for blacks. Although the Ku Klux Act of 1871 dismantled the first Klan, Southern whites formed other, similar groups that kept blacks away from the polls through intimidation and physical violence. Reconstruction ended with the election of President Rutherford B. Hayes, who suspended the federal military occupation of the South; yet blacks still found themselves without the basic civil liberties that Congressional Republicans had sought to secure.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871&quot;.

[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/HistRC/ Galenet.Galegroup.com].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1882, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Harris]]'' that the Klan Act was partially [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. It ruled that Congress's power under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not extend to the right to regulate against private conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/opeds/historylesson1.pdf |format=PDF |title=History Lesson |accessdate= |author=Balkin, Jack M. |year=2002 |work= |publisher=[[Yale University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klan costumes, also called &quot;[[Ku Klux Klan regalia and insignia|regalia]]&quot;, disappeared by the early 1870s (Wade 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;109). The fact that the Klan did not exist for decades was shown when Simmons's 1915 recreation of the Klan attracted only two aging &quot;former Reconstruction Klansmen.&quot; All other members were new.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1872, the Klan was broken as an organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_enforce.html &quot;The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow: The Enforcement Acts, 1870–1871&quot;, Public Broadcast Service]. Retrieved April 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the goals that the Klan had failed to achieve itself, such as suppressing [[suffrage]] for Southern blacks and driving a wedge between poor whites and blacks, were largely accomplished by the 1890s by militant Southern whites. Lynchings of African Americans, far from being ended by the Klan's disintegration, instead peaked in 1892 with 161 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varney |first=Blaine |url=http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/lynching/lynching.html |title=Lynching in the 1890s (The Inhumanity of Lynching) |work=Bgsu.edu |publisher =[[BGSU]]|location=[[Bowling Green, Ohio]] |year=1996 |accessdate=December 24, 2009| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xDrTvjen| archivedate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The second Klan: 1915–1944==
===Refounding in 1915===
Three events in 1915 acted as catalysts to the revival of the Klan:
* The film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' was released, mythologizing and glorifying the first Klan.
* In 1915 Jewish businessman [[Leo Frank]] was lynched near Atlanta after the Georgia governor commuted his death sentence to life in prison. Frank had been convicted in 1913 and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a young white factory worker named [[Mary Phagan]], in a trial marked by intimidation of the jury and media frenzy. He had lost his appeals. 
* The second Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1915 by [[William J. Simmons]] at [[Stone Mountain]], outside Atlanta. Its growth was based on a new anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibitionist]] and antisemitic agenda, which developed in response to contemporary social tensions. Most of the founders were from a small Atlanta-area organization called the Knights of Mary Phagan, who had organized around Leo Frank's trial. The new organization and chapters adopted regalia featured in ''The Birth of a Nation''.

====''The Birth of a Nation''====
[[File:Birth-of-a-nation-poster-color.jpg|thumb|Movie poster for ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. It has been widely noted for reviving the Ku Klux Klan.]]
Director [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''The Birth of a Nation'' glorified the original Klan. His film was based on the book and play ''[[The Clansman]]'' and the book ''[[The Leopard's Spots]]'', both by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]] Dixon said his purpose was &quot;to revolutionize northern sentiment by a presentation of history that would transform every man in my audience into a good [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]!&quot; The film created a nationwide Klan craze. At the official premier in Atlanta, members of the Klan rode up and down the street in front of the theater.&lt;ref&gt;Dray 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the modern Klan's iconography, including the standardized white costume and the lighted cross, are derived from the film. Its imagery was based on Dixon's romanticized concept of old England and Scotland, as portrayed in the novels and poetry of Sir [[Walter Scott]]. The film's influence was enhanced by a purported endorsement by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], a Southerner. A Hollywood press agent claimed that after seeing the film Wilson said, &quot;It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.&quot; Historians doubt he said it.&lt;ref&gt;Dray 2002, p. 198. Griffith quickly relayed the comment to the press, where it was widely reported.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's remarks generated controversy, and he tried to remain aloof. On April 30, his staff issued a denial.  Wilson's aide, [[Joseph Tumulty]] said, &quot;the President was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from J. M. Tumulty, secretary to President Wilson, to the Boston branch of the [[NAACP]], quoted in {{cite book|author=John Milton Cooper, Jr.|title=Woodrow Wilson: A Biography|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xOZVsyO4K2cC&amp;pg=PA273|year=2011|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Klan was inaugurated in 1915 by [[William J. Simmons]] on top of [[Stone Mountain]]. It was a small local organization until 1921. Simmons said he had been inspired by the original Klan's Prescripts, written in 1867 by Confederate veteran George Gordon, but they were never adopted by the first Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Chester L. Quarles, ''The Ku Klux Klan and Related American Racialist and Antisemitic Organizations: A History and Analysis,'' p. 219. The second Klan's constitution and preamble attributed debt to the original Klan's Prescripts.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prescript expressed an idealistic goals, but its members had committed acts of vigilante violence and murder from behind masks.

===Social factors===
The Second Klan saw threats from every direction. A religious tone was apparent in its activities; &quot;two-thirds of the national Klan lecturers were Protestant ministers,&quot; says historian Brian R. Farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Brian R. Farmer, ''American Conservatism: History, Theory and Practice'' (2005), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Klan's energy went to guarding &quot;the home;&quot; the historian Kathleen Bleeits said its members wanted to protect &quot;the interests of white womanhood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Blee, ''Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s'' (2008), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second Klan arose during the [[nadir of American race relations]], but much of its growth was in response to new issues of [[urbanization]], [[immigration]] and [[industrialization]]. The massive immigration of Catholics and Jews from [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] and [[Southern Europe|southern]] Europe led to fears among Protestants about the new peoples, and especially about job and social competition. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans to the [[Northern United States|North]] stoked job and housing competition and racism by whites in Midwestern and Western industrial cities. The second Klan achieved its greatest political power in [[Indiana]]; it was active throughout the South, Midwest, especially Michigan; and in the West, in Colorado and Oregon. The migration of both African Americans and whites from rural areas to Southern and Midwestern cities increased social  tensions.

The Klan grew most rapidly in urbanizing cities that had high growth rates between 1910 and 1930, such as [[Detroit]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and [[Dayton]] in the Upper South and Midwest; and [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], and [[Houston]] in the South. In [[Michigan]], more than half of the Klan members lived in Detroit, where they numbered 40,000; they were concerned about urban issues: limited housing, rapid social change, and competition for jobs with European immigrants and Southerners both black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1967, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Horn]], a Southern historian sympathetic to the first Klan, was careful in an oral interview to distinguish it from the later &quot;spurious Ku Klux organization which was in ill-repute—and, of course, had no connection whatsoever with the Klan of Reconstruction days&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/research/Biltmore_Project/OHIs/HornOHI.pdf |title=An Interview with Stanley F. Horn – Oral History Interviews of the Forest History Society |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an era without [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] or widely available [[life insurance]], men joined [[fraternal organizations]] such as the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks]] or the [[Woodmen of the World]] to provide for their families in case they died or were unable to work. The founder of the new Klan, [[William J. Simmons]], was a member of twelve different fraternal organizations. He [[Ku Klux Klan recruitment|recruited for the Klan]] with his chest covered with fraternal badges, and consciously modeled the Klan after fraternal organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898581,00.html |title=Nation: The Various Shady Lives of The Ku Klux Klan |work=TIME |date=April 9, 1965 |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klan organizers, called &quot;[[Ku Klux Klan recruitment|Kleagles]]&quot;, signed up hundreds of new members, who paid initiation fees and bought KKK costumes. The organizer kept half the money and sent the rest to state or national officials. When the organizer was done with an area, he organized a huge rally, often with burning crosses, and perhaps presented a [[Bible]] to a local Protestant preacher. He left town with the money collected. The local units operated like many fraternal organizations and occasionally brought in speakers.

The Klan's growth was also affected by the mobilization for [[World War I]] and postwar tensions, especially in the cities, where strangers came up against each other more often and competed for housing and jobs. Southern whites resented the arming of black soldiers. Black veterans did not want to return to second-class status in the South. Some black veterans in the South were [[lynching|lynched]] while still in uniform, after returning from overseas service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mailer.fsu.edu/~mjones/rosewood/rosewood.html Maxine D. Rogers et al., ''Documented History of Rosewood, Florida in January 1923''], pp. 4–6, accessed March 28, 2008; Clarence Lusane (2003), ''Hitler's Black Victims'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
Simmons initially met with little success in either recruiting members or in raising money, and the Klan remained a small operation in the Atlanta area until 1920, when he handed its day-to-day activities over to two professional publicists, [[Elizabeth Tyler (KKK organizer)|Elizabeth Tyler]] and [[Edward Young Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Newton, The Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi: a history, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The revived Klan appealed to new members based on current social tensions, and stressed responses to fears raised by immigration and mass migrations within industrializing cities: it became [[History of antisemitism in the United States|anti-Jewish]], [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholic]], [[anti-immigrant]] and later [[anti-communism|anti-Communist]]. It presented itself as a fraternal, nativist and strenuously patriotic organization; and its leaders emphasized support for vigorous enforcement of [[prohibition]] laws. It expanded membership dramatically; by the 1920s, most of its members lived in the Midwest and West. It had a national base by 1925. 

====Prohibition====
Historians agree that the Klan's resurgence in the 1920s was aided by the national debate over prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'', pp. 119-56.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Prendergast says that the KKK’s &quot;support for [[Prohibition in the United States#National Prohibition|Prohibition]] represented the single most important bond between Klansmen throughout the nation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast 1987, pp. 25–52, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan opposed bootleggers, sometimes with violence. In 1922, two hundred Klan members set fire to saloons in [[Union County, Arkansas]]. The national Klan office was established in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], but [[Little Rock]], Arkansas was the home of the [[WKKK|Women of the Ku Klux Klan]]. The first head of this [[KKK auxiliaries|auxiliary]] was a former president of the [[Arkansas]] [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union|WCTU]].&lt;ref&gt;Lender et al. 1982, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=November 2008}} Membership in the Klan and in other prohibition groups overlapped, and they often coordinated activities.&lt;ref&gt;Barr 1999, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urbanization===
[[File:theendkkk.jpg|right|thumb|&quot;The End&quot; Referring to the end of Catholic influence in the US. ''[[Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty]]'' 1926]]
A significant characteristic of the second Klan was that it was an organization based in urban areas, reflecting the major shifts of population to cities in both the North and the South. In Michigan, for instance, 40,000 members lived in Detroit, where they made up more than half of the state's membership. Most Klansmen were lower- to middle-class whites who were trying to protect their jobs and housing from the waves of newcomers to the industrial cities: immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, who tended to be Catholic and Jewish in numbers higher than earlier groups of immigrants; and black and white migrants from the South. As new populations poured into cities, rapidly changing neighborhoods created social tensions. Because of the rapid pace of population growth in industrializing cities such as Detroit and Chicago, the Klan grew rapidly in the U.S. [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The Klan also grew in booming Southern cities such as Dallas and Houston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;&gt;Jackson 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medium-size industrial city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in the 1920s, the Klan ascended to power quickly but declined as a result of opposition from the Catholic Church. There was no violence and the local newspaper ridiculed Klansmen as &quot;night-shirt knights&quot;. Half of the members were [[Swedish American]], including some first-generation immigrants. The ethnic and religious conflicts among more recent immigrants contributed to the rise of the Klan in the city. Swedish Protestants were struggling against Irish Catholics, who had been entrenched longer, for political and ideological control of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Parker, &quot;'Night-Shirt Knights' in the City: The Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Worcester, Massachusetts&quot;, ''New England Journal of History'', Fall 2009, Vol. 66 Issue 1, pp. 62–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some states, historians have obtained membership rosters of some local units and matched the names against city directory and local records to create statistical profiles of the membership. Big city newspapers were often hostile and ridiculed Klansmen as ignorant farmers. Detailed analysis from [[Indiana]] showed the rural stereotype was false for that state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Indiana's Klansmen represented a wide cross section of society: they were not disproportionately urban or rural, nor were they significantly more or less likely than other members of society to be from the working class, middle class, or professional ranks. Klansmen were [[Protestantism|Protestants]], of course, but they cannot be described exclusively or even predominantly as [[fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. In reality, their religious affiliations mirrored the whole of white Protestant society, including those who did not belong to any church.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Klan attracted people but most of them did not remain in the organization for long. Membership in the Klan turned over rapidly as people found out that it was not the group they wanted. Millions joined, and at its peak in the 1920s, the organization included about 15% of the nation's eligible population. The lessening of social tensions contributed to the Klan's decline.

===The burning cross===
[[File:Burning-cross2.jpg|thumb|[[Cross burning]] is said to have been introduced by [[William J. Simmons]], the founder of the second Klan in 1915.]]
The second Klan adopted a burning [[Latin cross]] as its symbol. No such crosses had been used by the first Klan, but the burning cross was used as a symbol of intimidation by the second Klan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenhouse&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/us/supreme-court-roundup-free-speech-or-hate-speech-court-weighs-cross-burning.html?pagewanted=all|title=Supreme Court Roundup; Free Speech or Hate Speech? Court Weighs Cross Burning|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|date=May 29, 2002|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burning of the cross was also used by the second Klan as a symbol of Christian fellowship, and its lighting during meetings was steeped in Christian prayer, the singing of hymns, and other overtly religious symbolism.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite book |title=The fiery cross: the Ku Klux Klan in America |last=Wade |first=Wyn Craig |year= 1998|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= USA|page= 185|url= http://books.google.com/?id=6O_XYBMhNYAC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=cross+burning+religious+kkk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= May 3, 2011 |isbn=978-0-19-512357-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of cross burning had been loosely based on ancient Scottish clans' burning a [[saltire|St. Andrew's cross]] (an X-shaped cross) as a beacon to muster forces for war. In ''The Clansman'' (see above), Dixon had falsely claimed that the first Klan had used fiery crosses when rallying to fight against Reconstruction. Griffith brought this image to the screen in ''The Birth of a Nation''; he portrayed the burning cross as an upright [[Latin cross]] rather than the St. Andrew's cross. Simmons adopted the symbol wholesale from the movie, prominently displaying it at the 1915 Stone Mountain meeting. The symbol has been associated with the Klan ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cecil Adams |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1038/why-does-the-ku-klux-klan-burn-crosses |title=Why does the Ku Klux Klan burn crosses? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=June 18, 1993 |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 1921, in an attempt to gain a foothold in education, the Klan bought [[Lanier University]], a struggling [[Baptist]] university in [[Atlanta]]. Nathan Bedford Forrest, grandson of the [[Nathan Bedford Forrest|Confederate general by the same name]], was appointed its business manager. The school was to teach &quot;pure, 100 percent Americanism&quot;. Enrollment was dismal, and the school closed after the first year of Klan ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F50610FF3E5A1B7A93C0A81782D85F458285F9 |title=Forrest tells aims of Ku Klux College |publisher=New York Times |date=1921-09-12 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
By the 1920s, the KKK developed a women's auxiliary, with chapters in many areas. Its activities included participation in parades, cross lighting, lectures, rallies, and boycotts of local businesses owned by Catholics and Jews. The Women's Klan were active in promoting prohibition, stressing liquor's negative impact on wives and children. Their efforts in public schools included distributing Bibles and working for the dismissal of Roman Catholic teachers. Texas would not hire Catholic teachers in public schools. As scandals rocked the Klan leadership late in the 1920s, the organization's popularity among both men and women dropped off sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Blee, ''Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s'' (University of California Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political role===
[[File:klan-sheet-music.jpg|thumb|left|Sheet music to &quot;We Are All Loyal Klansmen&quot;, 1923]]
The members of the first Klan in the South were exclusively [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. The second Klan expanded with new chapters in the Midwest and West, where for a time, its members were courted by both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and Democrats. The KKK state organizations endorsed candidates from either party that supported its goals; Prohibition in particular helped the Klan and some Republicans to make common cause in the Midwest. 

The Klan had numerous members in every part of the United States, but was particularly strong in the South and Midwest. At its peak, claimed Klan membership exceeded four million and comprised 20% of the adult white male population in many broad geographic regions, and 40% in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;Marty Gitlin, ''The Ku Klux Klan: A Guide to an American Subculture'' (2009) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan also moved north into Canada, especially [[Saskatchewan]], where it opposed Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Sher, ''White Hoods: Canada's Ku Klux Klan'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

With expanded membership came election of Klan members to political office. In Indiana,  members were chiefly American-born, white Protestants of many income and social levels. In the 1920s, Indiana had the most powerful Ku Klux Klan in the nation. It had a high number of members statewide (over 30% of its white male citizens&lt;ref name=nicfh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main7.html|title=Indiana History Chapter Seven|publisher=Northern Indiana Center for History|accessdate=October 7, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080411163028/http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main7.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in 1924 elected the Klan member [[Edward L. Jackson|Edward Jackson]] as  governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library&quot;/&gt; 

Given success in state and local elections, the Klan issue contributed to the bitterly divisive [[1924 Democratic National Convention]] in New York City. The leading candidates were [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], a Protestant with a base in areas where the Klan was strong, and New York Governor [[Al Smith]], a Catholic with a base in the large cities. After weeks of stalemate, both candidates withdrew in favor of a compromise. Anti-Klan delegates proposed a resolution indirectly attacking the Klan; it was narrowly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Lee N. Allen, &quot;The McAdoo Campaign for the Presidential Nomination in 1924&quot;, ''Journal of Southern History'', May 1963, Vol. 29 Issue 2, pp. 211–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas B. Craig, ''After Wilson: The Struggle for the Democratic Party, 1920–1934'' (1992), ch. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, such as Alabama and California, KKK chapters had worked for political reform. In 1924, Klan members were elected to the city council in [[Anaheim, California]]. The city had been controlled by an entrenched commercial-civic elite that was mostly [[German American]]. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support prohibition laws—the mayor had been a saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1200 members in [[Orange County, California]]. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos suggests that many of the individuals in Orange County joined the Klan out of that sense of civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired known city employees who were Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocoltchos&quot;/&gt; 

The opposition organized, bribed a Klansman for the secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries; they defeated most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government, and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed, its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cocoltchos&quot;&gt;Christopher N. Cocoltchos, &quot;The Invisible Empire and the Search for the Orderly Community: The Ku Klux Klan in Anaheim, California&quot;, in Shawn Lay, ed. ''The invisible empire in the West'' (2004), pp. 97-120.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the South, Klan members were still Democratic, as it was a one-party region for whites. Klan chapters were closely allied with Democratic police, sheriffs, and other functionaries of local government. Since [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement]] of most African Americans and many poor whites at the turn of the century, the only political activity for whites took place within the Democratic Party.

In Alabama, Klan members advocated better public schools, effective [[prohibition]] enforcement, expanded road construction, and other political measures to benefit lower-class white people. By 1925, the Klan was a political force in the state, as leaders such as [[J. Thomas Heflin]], [[David Bibb Graves]], and [[Hugo Black]] tried to build political power against the Black Belt [[plantation|planters]], who had long dominated the state.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Black was elected [[US senator]] in 1926. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] later appointed Black to the Supreme Court without knowing he had been active in the Klan in the 1920s. In 1926, with Klan support, [[Bibb Graves]] won the Alabama governor's office. He was a former Klan chapter head. He pushed for increased education funding, better public health, new highway construction, and pro-labor legislation. Because the Alabama state legislature refused to redistrict until 1972, and then under court order, the Klan was unable to break the planters' and rural areas' hold on legislative power.

===Resistance and decline===
[[File:D. C. Stephenson Grand Dragon of the Klu Klux Klan in Indiana, c 1922.jpg|thumb|upright|[[D. C. Stephenson]], Grand Dragon of the [[Indiana Klan]]. His conviction in 1925 for murdering a young white schoolteacher led to the decline of the Indiana Klan.]]
Many groups and leaders, including prominent Protestant ministers such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] in Detroit, spoke out against the Klan, gaining national attention. The Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] was formed in the early 20th century after the lynching of [[Leo Frank]], and in response to attacks against Jewish Americans and the Klan's campaign to outlaw private schools. Opposing groups worked to penetrate the Klan's secrecy. After one civic group began to publish Klan membership lists, there was a rapid decline in members. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] created public education campaigns in order to inform people about Klan activities and lobbied in Congress against Klan abuses. After its peak in 1925, Klan membership in most areas began to decline rapidly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;/&gt;

Specific events contributed to the decline as well. In Indiana, the scandal surrounding the 1925 murder trial of Grand Dragon [[D.C. Stephenson]] destroyed the image of the KKK as upholders of law and order. By 1926 the Klan was &quot;crippled and discredited.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Library&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[D. C. Stephenson]] was the Grand Dragon of Indiana and 22 northern states. In 1923 he had led the states under his control to separate from the national KKK organization. In his 1925 trial, he was convicted for second degree murder for his part in the rape and subsequent death&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.indianahistory.org/library/manuscripts/collection_guides/m0264.html |title=D. C. Stephenson manuscript collection |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Madge Oberholtzer]]. After Stephenson's conviction, the Klan declined dramatically in Indiana. The historian [[Leonard Moore]] says that a failure in leadership caused the Klan's collapse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stephenson and the other salesmen and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana's Invisible Empire lacked both the ability and the desire to use the political system to carry out the Klan's stated goals. They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen to the top of the hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1991, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1920 Klan membership in Alabama dropped to less than 6,000. Small independent units continued to be active in the industrial city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. In the late 1940s and 1950s, members launched a reign of terror by bombing the homes of upwardly mobile African Americans. Activism by such independent KKK groups increased as a reaction against the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s.
[[File:Kkk1928.jpg|thumb|left|Ku Klux Klan members march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. in 1928]]
In Alabama, KKK vigilantes launched a wave of physical terror in 1927. They targeted both blacks and whites for violation of racial norms and for perceived moral lapses.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers et al., pp. 432–433.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a strong backlash, beginning in the media. [[Grover C. Hall]], Sr., editor of the ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'', began publishing a series of editorials and articles that attacked the Klan for its &quot;racial and religious intolerance&quot;. Hall won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his crusade.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers et al., p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Other newspapers kept up a steady, loud attack on the Klan, referring to the organization as violent and &quot;un-American&quot;. Sheriffs cracked down on activities. In the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 presidential election]], the state voters overcame initial opposition to the Catholic candidate [[Al Smith]], and voted the Democratic Party line as usual.

Although in decline, a measure of the Klan's influence was its march along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC in 1928.

====Labor and anti-unionism====
In southern cities such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Klan members kept control of access to the better-paying industrial jobs and opposed unions. During the 1930s and 1940s, Klan leaders urged members to disrupt the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), which advocated industrial unions and accepted African-American members, unlike earlier unions. With access to dynamite and using the skills from their jobs in mining and steel, in the late 1940s some Klan members in Birmingham used bombings in order to intimidate upwardly mobile blacks who moved into middle-class neighborhoods. &quot;By mid-1949, there were so many charred house carcasses that the area [College Hills] was informally named Dynamite Hill.&quot;&lt;ref name=Carry/&gt; Independent Klan groups remained active in Birmingham and violently opposed the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref name=Carry&gt;Diane McWhorter, ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution'', New York: Touchstone Book, 2002, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, after years of the [[Great Depression]], the [[Imperial Wizard]] [[Hiram Wesley Evans]] sold the national organization to [[James Colescott]], an Indiana [[veterinarian]], and [[Samuel Green (Ku Klux Klan)|Samuel Green]], an Atlanta [[obstetrician]]. They could not revive the declining membership. In 1944, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] filed a lien for $685,000 in back taxes against the Klan, and Colescott dissolved the organization that year. Local Klan groups closed over the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Georgia Orders Action to Revoke Charter of Klan.

Due in part to [[lynching]]s and Klan terror directed against them, from the early 1900s to 1940, 1.5 million blacks left the South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to northern and midwestern industrial cities. Many were recruited by expanding industries in the North, such as the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and industries in [[Chicago]] and [[Omaha]]. Although Southern violence had declined, better economic, education and voting opportunities in other areas attracted another 5 million blacks to migrate out of the South from 1940-1970, with many going to West Coast cities, a center of defense industry jobs. 

After [[World War II]], the folklorist and author [[Stetson Kennedy]] infiltrated the Klan; he provided internal data to media and law enforcement agencies. He also provided secret code words to the writers of the ''[[Superman (radio)|Superman]]'' radio program, resulting in episodes in which [[Superman]] took on the KKK. Kennedy stripped away the Klan's mystique and trivialized its rituals and code words, which may have contributed to the decline in Klan recruiting and membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=von Busack |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Superman Versus the KKK |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.02.98/comics-9826.html |work=MetroActive |publisher= |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Kennedy wrote a bestselling book about his experiences, which further damaged the Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Klans, 1950 through 1960s==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Poster35.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda poster (''Freedom, American style'', 1950, by Nikolay Dolgorukov and [[Boris Efimov]]), showing the KKK's lynchings of blacks. {{ifdc|File:Poster35.jpg|log=2012 June 7}}]] --&gt;

The name &quot;Ku Klux Klan&quot; began to be used by several independent groups. Beginning in the 1950s, for instance, individual Klan groups in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], began to resist social change and blacks' improving their lives by bombing houses in transitional neighborhoods. There were so many bombings in Birmingham of blacks' homes by Klan groups in the 1950s that the city's nickname was &quot;Bombingham&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McWhorter&quot;/&gt;

During the tenure of [[Bull Connor]] as police commissioner in the city, Klan groups were closely allied with the police and operated with impunity. When the [[Freedom Riders]] arrived in Birmingham, Connor gave Klan members fifteen minutes to attack the riders before sending in the police to quell the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;McWhorter&quot;/&gt; When local and state authorities failed to protect the Freedom Riders and activists, the federal government established effective intervention.

In states such as Alabama and [[Mississippi]], Klan members forged alliances with governors' administrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;McWhorter&quot;/&gt; In Birmingham and elsewhere, the KKK groups bombed the houses of [[civil rights]] activists. In some cases they used physical violence, intimidation and assassination directly against individuals. Many murders went unreported and were not prosecuted by local and state authorities. Continuing [[disfranchisement]] of blacks across the South meant that most could not serve on juries, which were all white.

According to a report from the [[Southern Regional Council]] in [[Atlanta]], the homes of 40 black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952. Some of the bombing victims were social activists whose work exposed them to danger, but most were either people who refused to bow to racist convention or were innocent bystanders, unsuspecting victims of random violence.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1994, p. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:AndrewGoodman-JamesChaney-MichaelSchwerner.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner were three civil rights workers abducted and murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan.]]
Among the more notorious murders by Klan members:
* The 1951 Christmas Eve bombing of the home of [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) activists [[Harry T. Moore|Harry and Harriette Moore]] in [[Mims, Florida]], resulting in their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/454.html &quot;Who Was Harry T.

* The 1963 assassination of NAACP organizer [[Medgar Evers]] in Mississippi. In 1994, former Ku Klux Klansman [[Byron De La Beckwith]] was convicted.
* The 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church]] in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed four [[African-American]] girls. The perpetrators were Klan members [[Robert Chambliss]], convicted in 1977, [[Thomas Edwin Blanton, Jr.]] and [[Bobby Frank Cherry]], convicted in 2001 and 2002. The fourth suspect, [[Herman Cash]], died before he was indicted.
* The 1964 murders of three civil rights workers, [[Mississippi civil rights worker murders|Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner]], in Mississippi. In June 2005, Klan member [[Edgar Ray Killen]] was convicted of [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kris |last=Axtman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mississippi verdict greeted by a generation gap |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0623/p01s03-ussc.html |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |publisher= |date=June 23, 2005 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1964 murder of two black teenagers, [[Henry Hezekiah Dee]] and [[Charles Eddie Moore]] in Mississippi. In August 2007, based on the confession of Klansman [[Charles Marcus Edwards]], [[James Ford Seale]], a reputed Ku Klux Klansman, was convicted. Seale was sentenced to serve three life sentences. Seale was a former Mississippi policeman and sheriff's deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/usatoday/docs/crights/usseale12407ind.html |title=Reputed Klansman, Ex-Cop, and Sheriff's Deputy Indicted For The 1964 Murders of Two Young African-American Men in Mississippi; U.S. v.

* The 1965 Alabama murder of [[Viola Liuzzo]]. She was a Southern-raised [[Detroit]] mother of five who was visiting the state in order to attend a civil rights march. At the time of her murder Liuzzo was transporting Civil Rights Marchers.
* The 1966 firebombing death of NAACP leader [[Vernon Dahmer]] Sr., 58, in Mississippi. In 1998 former Ku Klux Klan wizard [[Sam Bowers]] was convicted of his murder and sentenced to life. Two other Klan members were indicted with Bowers, but one died before trial, and the other's indictment was dismissed.

There was also resistance to the Klan. In 1953, newspaper publisher [[W. Horace Carter]] received a [[Pulitzer prize]] for reporting on the activities of the Klan. In a 1958 [[North Carolina]] incident, the Klan burned crosses at the homes of two [[Lumbee]] Native Americans who had associated with white people, and they threatened to return with more men. When the KKK held a nighttime rally nearby, they were quickly surrounded by hundreds of armed Lumbees. Gunfire was exchanged, and the Klan was routed at what became known as the [[Battle of Hayes Pond]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingalls 1979; {{cite web |url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/nchistory/jan2005/jan05.html |title=January 1958 – The Lumbees face the Klan |accessdate= |author=Graham, Nicholas |month=January | year=2005 |work= |publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) had paid informants in the Klan, for instance in Birmingham in the early 1960s, its relations with local law enforcement agencies and the Klan were often ambiguous. The head of the FBI, [[J. Edgar Hoover]], appeared more concerned about Communist links to civil rights activists than about controlling Klan excesses against citizens. In 1964, the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] program began attempts to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;McWhorter&quot;/&gt;

As 20th-century Supreme Court rulings extended federal enforcement of citizens' [[civil rights]], the government revived the Force Act and Klan Act from Reconstruction days. Federal prosecutors used these laws as the basis for investigations and indictments in the 1964 murders of [[Mississippi civil rights workers murders|Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dsimon/Change-CivRts2.html |title=The Civil Rights Movement, 1964–1968 |accessdate= |author=Simon, Dennis M |date= |work= |publisher=[[Southern Methodist University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1965 murder of [[Viola Liuzzo]]. They were also the basis for prosecution in 1991 in ''[[Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic]]''.

==Contemporary Klan: 1970s–present==
[[File:Kkk-march-violence.jpg|thumb|Violence at a Klan march in [[Mobile, Alabama]], 1977]]
Once African Americans secured federal legislation to protect civil and voting rights, the KKK shifted its focus to opposing court-ordered [[desegregation busing|busing to desegregate schools]], [[affirmative action]] and more open [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]]. In 1971, KKK members used bombs to destroy 10 school buses in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].

===Altercation with Communist Workers Party===
{{main|Greensboro massacre}}
On November 3, 1979, five protesters were killed by KKK and [[American Nazi Party]] members in the [[Greensboro massacre]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2004/11/18/remembering_the_1979_greensboro_massacre_25 | title=Remembering the 1979 Greensboro Massacre: 25 Years Later Survivors Form Country’s First Truth and Reconciliation Commission | publisher=[[Democracy Now]] | date= November 18, 2004 | first= | last= | accessdate =August 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was the culmination of attempts by the [[Communist Workers Party (US)|Communist Workers Party]] to organize industrial workers, predominantly black, in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hand (November 18, 2004).

===Jerry Thompson infiltration===
Jerry Thompson, a newspaper reporter who infiltrated the KKK in 1979, reported that the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] efforts were highly successful. Rival KKK factions accused each other's leaders of being [[FBI informant]]s. [[William Wilkinson (KKK)|Bill Wilkinson]] of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was revealed to have been working for the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson also related that KKK leaders who appeared indifferent to the threat of arrest showed great concern about a series of civil lawsuits filed by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] for damages of millions of dollars. These were filed after KKK members shot into a group of African Americans. Klansmen curtailed activities to conserve money for defense against the lawsuits. The KKK also used lawsuits as tools; they filed a libel suit to prevent publication of a paperback edition of Thompson's book.

===Tennessee shooting===
In 1980, three KKK members shot four elderly black women (Viola Ellison, Lela Evans, Opal Jackson and Katherine Johnson) in [[Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]], following a KKK initiation rally. A fifth woman, Fannie Crumsey, was injured by flying glass in the incident. Attempted murder charges were filed against the three KKK members, two of whom—Bill Church and Larry Payne—were acquitted by an all-white jury, and the other of whom—Marshall Thrash—was sentenced by the same jury to nine months on lesser charges. He was released after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=r59bGyH4lOAC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=1980+chattanooga+kkk+shootings |title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: &quot;White Power, White Pride!&quot;, by Betty A.

===Michael Donald lynching===
After [[Michael Donald]] was lynched in 1981 in [[Alabama]], the FBI investigated his death and two local KKK members were convicted of having a role, including [[Henry Francis Hays]], who was sentenced to death. With the support of attorneys [[Morris Dees]] and Joseph J. Levin of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, sued the KKK in civil court in Alabama. Her lawsuit against the [[United Klans of America]] was tried in February 1987. The all-white jury found the Klan responsible for the lynching of Donald and ordered the Klan to pay US$7 million. To pay the judgment, the KKK turned over all of its assets, including its national headquarters building in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. After exhausting the appeals process, Hays was executed for Donald's death in Alabama on June 6, 1997. It was the first time since 1913 that a white man had been executed in Alabama for a crime against an African American.

===Neo-Nazi alliances and Stormfront===
{{Main|Stormfront (website)}}
In 1995, [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]] and Chloê Hardin, former KKK Grand Wizard [[David Duke]]'s ex-wife, began a small [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) called [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]. Today, Stormfront has become a prominent online forum for [[white nationalism]], [[Neo-Nazism]], [[hate speech]], [[racism]], and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/12/5/143556/393 &quot;RedState, White Supremacy, and Responsibility&quot;], ''[[Daily Kos]]'', December 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FOX&quot;&gt;[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,86338,00.html &quot;Circling the Wagons in Georgia&quot;], ''[[Fox News Channel]]'', May 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/dtv2001-0023.html &quot;WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center: Case No. DTV2001-0023&quot;], [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], January 13, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Duke has an account on Stormfront which he uses to post articles from his own website, as well as polling forum members for opinions and questions, in particular during his internet broadcasts. Duke has worked with Don Black on numerous projects including [[Operation Red Dog]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manana.com/dominica.htm Captmike works undercover with the US Government to stop the invasion of the Island Nation of Dominica], manana.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiancontent.ca/articles/031401reddog.html Operation Red Dog: Canadian neo-nazis were central to the planned invasion of Dominica in 1981],{{dead link|date=February 2011}} canadiancontent.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current developments===
The modern KKK is not one organization; rather it is composed of small independent chapters across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp |title=About the Ku Klux Klan – Extremism in America |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] }} According to the report, the KKK's estimated size then was &quot;No more than a few thousand, organized into slightly more than 100 units.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of independent chapters has made KKK groups more difficult to infiltrate, and researchers find it hard to estimate their numbers. Estimates are that about two-thirds of KKK members are concentrated in the [[Southern United States]], with another third situated primarily in the lower [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name=adl-ak-kkk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/backgrounders/american_knights_kkk.asp |title=Church of the American Knights of the KKK |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |date=October 22, 1999 |work= |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/map/hate.jsp |title=Active U.S. Hate Groups |accessdate= |author= |date= |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adl-kkk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/default.asp |title=About the Ku Klux Klan – Extremism in America |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Klan splinter divisions grew substantially after the 2008 election of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], the first [[African-American]] to hold the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nowpublic.com/world/obama-win-fuels-ku-klux-klan-membership |title=Obama Win Fuels Ku Klux Klan Membership |author= Mangus, Rhonda J. |date=February 1, 2009 |work= |publisher=[[NowPublic]] (from [[news.com.au]]) |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. police fear post-Obama Ku Klux Klan recruitment drive after woman is 'shot dead when she asked to leave initiation ritual' |first= |last= |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |location=United Kingdom |date=November 13, 2008 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1085003/U-S-police-fear-post-Obama-Ku-Klux-Klan-recruitment-drive-woman-shot-dead-asked-leave-initiation-ritual.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan has expanded its recruitment efforts to white supremacists at the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sify.com/news/ku-klux-klan-warns-race-war-if-obama-wins-news-international-jegv8yeajcg.html |title=Ku Klux Klan warns race war if Obama wins |author= |date=November 3, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Sify|Sify News]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the long run, the Klan's numbers are steadily dropping. This decline has been attributed to the Klan's lack of competence in the use of the Internet, their history of violence, a proliferation of competing hate groups, and a decline in the number of young racist activists who are willing to join groups at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Brian|title=Ku Klux Kontraction: How did the KKK lose nearly one-third of its chapters in one year?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/ku_klux_klan_in_decline_why_did_the_kkk_lose_so_many_chapters_in_2010_.html|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=[[Slate Magazine]]|date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recent membership campaigns have been based on issues such as people's anxieties about [[illegal immigration]], urban crime, [[civil union]]s and [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0209/p02s02-ussc.html |title=Anti-Immigrant Sentiments Fuel Ku Klux Klan Resurgence |accessdate= |author= Knickerbocker, Brad |date=February 9, 2007 |work= [[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many KKK groups have formed strong alliances with other white supremacist groups, such as [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]]. Some KKK groups have become increasingly &quot;nazified&quot;, adopting the look and emblems of [[white power skinheads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/affiliations.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=4&amp;item=kkk |title=Ku Klux Klan – Affiliations – Extremism in America |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) has provided legal support to various factions of the KKK in defense of their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights to hold public rallies, parades, and marches, as well as their right to field political candidates.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite news |title=A.C.L.U.

===Women and Children in the Klan===
The Klan organization known as the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan have been undergoing radical reforms in recent years, one of which has been to embrace women into the group.&lt;ref name=TSTWM&gt;{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Tahir|title=Travels With Myself|year=2011|publisher=Mosaique|location=London|isbn=978-4478-0582-3|pages=237-245|url=http://www.tahirshah.com/travels-with-myself-book/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom Robb, the national director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, stated in an interview with writer [[Tahir Shah]] that &quot;My two sons and Rachel are very much involved in the Klan. Women have an important part to play in the KKK.&quot; [[Rachel Pendergraft]], Thom Robb's daughter, emphasized the importance of the role of women and children to the future of the Klan.&lt;ref name=TSTWM/&gt; Shah included her reflections on the future of the Klan in his book ''[[Travels With Myself]]'', in the chapter entitled &quot;Queen of the Ku Klux Klan&quot;. In her very candid interview, Pendergraft discussed plans for the future, including the development of a Youth Corps program for American children between the ages of 12 and 17, a Youth Klan Training Camp located deep in the Ozark Mountains, and a two-year KKK school for leadership.&lt;ref name=TSTWM/&gt; In the same series of interviews, Pendergraft's sister-in-law Anastasia Robb also focused on the importance of women and children as the future of the Klan: &quot;'Women are important members of the KKK, as the Klan becomes more liberal it's attracting more and more women who see its message as the future they want for their children. It's important for kids to be involved.'&quot;&lt;ref name=TSTWM/&gt;

==Vocabulary==
{{mainarticle|Ku Klux Klan titles and vocabulary}}
Membership in the Klan is secret. Like many fraternal organizations, the Klan has signs which members can use to recognize one another. A member may use the acronym ''AYAK'' (Are you a Klansman?) in conversation to surreptitiously identify himself to another potential member. The response ''AKIA'' (A Klansman I am) completes the greeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/acronyms_KIGY.asp |title=A Visual Database of Extremist Symbols, Logos and Tattoos |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its varied history, the Klan has coined many words&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod 1997, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with &quot;Kl&quot; including:
* Klabee: treasurers
* Klavern: local organization
* Imperial Kleagle: recruiter
* Klecktoken: initiation fee
* Kligrapp: secretary
* Klonvocation: gathering
* [[Kloran]]: ritual book
* Kloreroe: delegate
* Imperial Kludd: chaplain

All of the above terminology was created by William Simmons, as part of his 1915 revival of the Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Wade 1987, p. 142. &quot;'It was rather difficult, sometimes, to make the two letters fit in,' he recalled later, 'but I did it somehow.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Reconstruction-era Klan used different titles; the only titles to carry over were &quot;[[Grand Wizard|Wizard]]&quot; for the overall leader of the Klan and &quot;Night Hawk&quot; for the official in charge of security.

The Imperial Kludd was the chaplain of the Imperial Klonvokation and he performed &quot;such other duties as may be required by the Imperial Wizard.&quot; The Imperial Kaliff was the second highest position after the [[Imperial Wizard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Chester L.
