==Personal life== 
Quiboloy has never been married and has no children.&lt;ref name=pdi2/&gt;

==Political involvement==
Quiboloy anointed [[Gilbert Teodoro]] as the next president in the [[Philippine presidential election, 2010|2010 Philippine presidential election]]. “Tonight let it be known to all Filipinos that the Almighty Father has appointed the president of this nation. He is no other than Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro,” Quiboloy told thousands of cheering followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100503-267767/Pastor-Quiboloy-anoints-Teodoro Pastor Quiboloy anoints Teodoro, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt; Teodoro finished fourth in the election with 4,095,839 votes (or 11.33%) to which Quiboloy responded, “I myself am a little bit disturbed with the reports of fraud and cheating in the last elections. Even I am asking where did the votes of the Kingdom go? What happened to our votes when we were supposed to be solid for Gibo?”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=577340&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 Quiboloy: Where did our votes for Gibo go?, Philippine Star]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Controversies==
Quiboloy has been sued by a former member for allegedly brainwashing and holding her young daughter against her will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O1Y1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ciUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=757,33541770 Lawyers sue cult to get custody of Baguio girl, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Plg1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kCUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1722,8240927 Cult probed for disappearance of teenrs, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The communist [[New People's Army]] (NPA) has accused Apollo Quiboloy of being behind the massacre of K’lata-Bagobos leader Datu Domingo Diarog and his family on April 29, 2008 for allegedly refusing to sell two hectares of their property for P50,000 to Quiboloy and his sect. The property is within the 700-hectare ancestral domain claimed by the Bagobo people in Tugbok and is adjacent to Quiboloy's walled “prayer mountain” in Tamayong. Diarog's widow said followers of Quiboloy had threatened to evict them from the land and her relatives were even offered P20,000 for Diarog's head.&lt;ref name=pdi&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080517-137214/Why-did-they-kill-the-Bagobo-datu Why did they kill the Bagobo datu?, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt; Quiboloy, however, said the charges are &quot;''totally false and baseless, if not ridiculous.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/97657/Killings-land-dispute-turn-tribal-village-into-virtual-ghost-town Killings, land dispute turn tribal village into virtual ghost town GMA News]&lt;/ref&gt;
While Quiboloy has branded the rebels “''mga anak ni Satanas''” (Satan’s offsprings), the NPA has declared him a “''warlord in the service of the [[Gloria Arroyo]] administration’s policies against the peasants and indigenous peoples.''”&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20080519-137528/Slay-of-tribal-leader-stirs-Pastor-Quiboloy-NPA-word-war Slay of tribal leader stirs Pastor Quiboloy-NPA word war, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt; Quiboloy also said on his television program that &quot;''he could arm 20,000 of his followers with [[M-16 rifle]]s to fight the communist New People’s Army (NPA)''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080521-137818/Preacher-rebels-exchange-harsh-words-over-killing Preacher, rebels exchange harsh words over killing Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt; Police investigator Ireneo Dalogdog, head of the Tugbok police, said he had been receiving reports that Diarog was being harassed by armed men associated with Quiboloy. Diarog’s farmhouse had earlier been burned down thrice.&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt;
