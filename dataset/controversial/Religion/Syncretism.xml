'''Syncretism''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|k|r|ə|t|ɪ|z|əm}} is the combining of different (often seemingly contradictory) beliefs, often while melding practices of various schools of thought. Syncretism may involve the merger and [[analogy|analogising]] of several originally discrete [[tradition]]s, especially in the [[theology]] and [[mythology]] of [[religion]], thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an [[inclusive]] approach to other faiths.

Syncretism occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture (known as [[eclecticism]]) as well as politics ([[syncretic politics]]).

== Nomenclature, orthography, and etymology ==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] first attests the word ''syncretism'' in English in 1618. It derives from modern [[Latin]] ''syncretismus'', drawing on [[Greek language|Greek]] συγκρητισμός (''synkretismos''), meaning &quot;Cretan federation&quot;.

The Greek word occurs in [[Plutarch]]'s (1st century AD) essay on &quot;Fraternal Love&quot; in his ''Moralia'' (2.490b). He cites the example of the [[Crete|Cretans]], who compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. &quot;And that is their so-called ''Syncretism''&quot;.

[[Erasmus]] probably coined the modern usage of the Latin word in his ''[[Adagia]]'' (&quot;Adages&quot;), published in the winter of 1517–1518, to designate the coherence of [[dissenter]]s in spite of their differences in theological opinions. In a letter to [[Melanchthon]] of April 22, 1519, Erasmus specifically adduced the Cretans of Plutarch as an example of his adage &quot;Concord is a mighty rampart&quot;.

== Social and political roles ==

Overt syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or previous tradition, but the &quot;other&quot; cult may survive or infiltrate without authorized ''syncresis'' nevertheless. For example, some [[Converso]]s developed a sort of [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] for martyr-victims of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], thus incorporating elements of [[Catholicism]] while resisting it.

Some religious movements have embraced overt syncretism, such as the case of [[Shinbutsu-shūgō|melding Shintō beliefs into Buddhism]] or the amalgamation of Germanic and Celtic [[Christianity_and_Paganism#Pagan_influences_on_Christianity|pagan views]] into [[Early_Christianity#Spread_of_Christianity|Christianity]] during its spread into Gaul, the British Isles, Germany, and Scandinavia. Indian influences are seen in the practice of Shi'i Islam in [[Trinidad]]. Others have strongly rejected it as devaluing and compromising precious and genuine distinctions; examples of this include post-[[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Exile]] [[Second Temple Judaism]], [[Islam]], and most of Protestant Christianity.

Syncretism tends to facilitate coexistence and unity between otherwise different cultures and worldviews ([[intercultural competence]]), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic [[empire|realm]]s. Conversely, the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of &quot;[[piety]]&quot; and &quot;[[orthodoxy]]&quot;, may help to generate, bolster or authenticate a sense of uncompromised [[Cultural identity|cultural unity]] in a well-defined minority or majority.

==Religious syncretism==

Religious syncretism exhibits  blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions.  This can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in the culture, or when a culture is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or, especially, practices.

Religions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so-labeled systems often frown on applying the label, especially adherents who belong to &quot;revealed&quot; religious systems, such as the [[Abrahamic religions]], or any system that exhibits an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] approach.  Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth.  By this reasoning, adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true.  Indeed, critics of a specific syncretistic trend may sometimes use the word &quot;syncretism&quot; as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system actually distort the original faith. Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. Others state that the term syncretism is an elusive one,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.missiology.org.uk/pdf/cotterell-fs/15_ferdinando.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and can be applied to refer to substitution or modification of the central elements of Christianity or Islam of beliefs or practices introduced from somewhere else. The consequences under this definition, according to Keith Fernando,  is a fatal compromise of the religion's integrity.

In modern [[secularization|secular]] society, religious innovators sometimes create new religions syncretically as a mechanism to reduce inter-religious tension and enmity, often with the effect of offending the original religions in question.  Such religions, however, do maintain some appeal to a less exclusivist audience.  Discussions of some of these blended religions appear in the individual sections below.

=== Ancient Greece ===
Classical Athens was exclusive in matters of religion. The Decree of Diopithes made the introduction of and belief in foreign Gods a criminal offence and only Greeks were allowed to worship in Athenian temples and festivals as foreigners were considered impure. Syncretism functioned as a feature of [[Hellenistic]] [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] religion although only outside of Greece. Overall, [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] culture in the age that followed [[Alexander the Great]] itself showed syncretist features, essentially blending of [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Iran|Persian]], [[Anatolia]]n, [[Egypt]]ian (and eventually [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]&amp;ndash;[[List of topics related to ancient Rome|Roman]]) elements within an Hellenic formula. The [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] god [[Amun]] developed as the Hellenized ''[[Zeus]] Ammon'' after [[Alexander the Great]] went into the desert to seek out Amun's [[oracle]] at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Such identifications derive from ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', the Hellenic habit of identifying gods of disparate [[mythology|mythologies]] with their own. When the proto-Greeks (peoples whose language would evolve into Greek proper) first arrived in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and on the mainland of modern-day Greece early in the [[2nd millennium BCE]], they found localized [[nymph]]s and [[divinity|divinities]] already connected with every important feature of the landscape: mountain, cave, [[Grove (nature)|grove]] and [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] all had their own locally venerated [[Deism|deity]]. The countless [[epithet]]s of the [[Greek pantheon|Olympian gods]] reflect their syncretic identification with these various figures. One defines &quot;''Zeus Molossos''&quot; (worshipped only at [[Dodona]]) as &quot;the god identical to Zeus as worshipped by the [[Molossians]] at Dodona&quot;. Much of the apparently arbitrary and trivial mythic [[fable|fabling]] results from later mythographers' attempts to explain these obscure epithets.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

=== Judaism ===

In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', [[Sigmund Freud]] made a case for [[Judaism]] arising out of the pre-existing [[monotheism]] that was briefly imposed upon [[Egypt]] during the rule of [[Akhenaten]]. [[Aten]], the disk of the Sun in ancient Egyptian mythology, and originally an aspect of [[Ra]], was chosen as the sole deity for Akhenaten's new religion. The &quot;[[Code of Hammurabi]]&quot; is also cited as a likely starting point for the Jewish [[Ten Commandments]]. [[Hammurabi]] was from the [[Mesopotamia]]n culture that revered [[Marduk]], among others. Judaism fought lengthy battles against syncretist tendencies: note the case of the [[golden calf]] and the railing of [[prophet]]s against [[temple prostitution]], [[witchcraft]] and local [[fertility cult]]s, as told in the [[Tanakh]]. On the other hand, some [[scholar]]s hold that Judaism refined its concept of monotheism and adopted features such as its [[eschatology]], [[angelology]] and [[demonology]] through contacts with [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=Zoroastrianism: A Shadowy but Powerful Presence in the Judaeo-Christian World|location=London|publisher=William's Trust|year=1987}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the Jewish [[halakha|halakhic]] prohibitions on [[polytheism]], [[idolatry]], and associated practices ([[Avodah Zarah|''avodah zarah'']]), several combinations of Judaism with other religions have sprung up: [[Jewish Buddhists|Jewish Buddhism]], [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenism]], [[Judeo-Paganism]], [[Messianic Judaism]], [[Mormonism and Judaism|Jewish Mormonism]],{{cn|date=June 2012}} and others such as Judeo-Christianity.  Until relatively recently, China had a Jewish community which had adopted some [[Confucian]] practices.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Several of the [[Jewish Messiah]] claimants (such as [[Jacob Frank]]) and the [[Sabbateans]] came to mix [[Kabbalah|Cabalistic]] Judaism with Christianity and Islam.

=== Roman world ===

The [[Rome|Romans]], identifying themselves as common heirs to a very similar civilization, identified [[Greek mythology|Greek deities]] with similar figures in the [[Roman mythology|Etruscan-Roman tradition]], though without usually copying [[Cult (religious practice)|cult practice]]s. (For details, see [[Interpretatio graeca]].)   Syncretic [[god]]s of the Hellenistic period found also wide favor in Rome: [[Serapis]], [[Isis]] and [[Mithras]], for example. [[Cybele]] as worshipped in Rome essentially represented a syncretic East Mediterranean [[goddess]].  The Romans imported the Greek god [[Dionysus]] into Rome, where he merged with the Latin [[mead]] god ''Liber'', and converted the Anatolian [[Sabazios]] into the Roman [[Sabazius]].

The degree of correspondence varied: [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] makes perhaps a better match for [[Zeus]] than the rural huntress [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] does for the feared [[Artemis]]. [[Ares]] does not quite match [[Mars (god)|Mars]]. The Romans physically imported the Anatolian goddess [[Cybele]] into Rome from her Anatolian cult-center [[Pessinos]] in the form of her original aniconic archaic stone [[Idolatry|idol]]; they identified her as ''[[Magna Mater]]'' and gave her a matronly, iconic image developed in Hellenistic [[Pergamum]].

Likewise, when the Romans encountered [[Celt]]s and [[Germanic peoples]], they mingled these peoples' gods with their own, creating [[Sulis Minerva]], Apollo [[Sucellos]] (Apollo the Good Smiter) and Mars Thingsus (Mars of the war-assembly), among many others.  In the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] speaks of Germanic worshippers of [[Heracles|Hercules]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]; most modern scholars tentatively identify Hercules as [[Thor]] and Mercury as [[Odin]].

=== Christianity ===

Syncretism did not play a role when Christianity split into [[Eastern Orthodoxy|eastern]] and [[Catholicism|western]] rites during the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. It became involved, however, with the rifts of the [[Protestant Reformation]], with [[Desiderius Erasmus]]'s readings of Plutarch. Even earlier, Syncretism was a fundamental aspect of the efforts of Neoplatonists such as Marsilio Ficino to reform the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, James D., Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century, Repristination Press, 2011. ISBN 978-1-4610-9382-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1615, [[David Pareus]] of [[Heidelberg]] urged Christians to a &quot;pious syncretism&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} in opposing the [[Antichrist]], but few 17th-century Protestants discussed the compromises that might effect a reconciliation with the Catholic Church: [[Johann Hülsemann]], [[Johann Georg Dorsche]] and [[Abraham Calovius]] (1612–85) opposed the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Georgius Calixtus|Georg Calisen &quot;Calixtus&quot;]] (1586–1656) of the [[University of Helmstedt]] for his &quot;syncretism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = LCMS | url = http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&amp;word=SYNCRETISM | title = Cyclopedia | contribution = Syncretism}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Syncretistic Controversy|Syncretistic Controversy]].)

Catholicism in Central and South America has integrated a number of elements derived from [[Indigenous people|indigenous]] and slave cultures in those areas (see [[#Syncretism in the Caribbean|the Caribbean]] and [[#Modern syncretic religions|modern sections]]); while many [[African Initiated Church]]es demonstrate an integration of [[Protestant]] and traditional African beliefs. In Asia the revolutionary movements of [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Taiping]] (19th-century China) and [[God's Army (revolutionary group)|God's Army]] ([[Karen people|Karen]] in the 1990s) have blended Christianity and traditional beliefs. The Catholic Church allows some symbols and traditions to be carried over from older belief systems, so long as they are remade to fit into a Christian worldview; syncretism of other religions with Catholicism, such as [[Voudun]] or [[Santería]], is condemned by the Church.

One can contrast Christian syncretism with [[contextualization]] or [[inculturation]], the practice of making Christianity relevant to a culture:  ''Contextualisation'' does not address the doctrine but affects a change in the styles or expression of worship. Although Christians often took their European music and building styles into churches in other parts of the world, in a contextualization approach, they would build churches, sing songs, and pray in a local ethnic style.  Some [[Jesuit]] missionaries adapted local systems and images to teach Christianity, as did the Portuguese in China.

In this view, ''syncretism'' implies compromising the message of Christianity by merging it with not just a culture, but another religion, common examples being [[animism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] can be framed as a syncretic outgrowth of main-line Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/seekers/conclusion.htm#Mormons9|title=Religious Seekers and the Advent of Mormonism|author=Dan Vogel|accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Syncretistic controversy}}
The syncretistic controversy was the theological debate provoked by the efforts of [[Georg Calixt]] and his supporters to secure a basis on which the [[Lutheran]]s could make overtures to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Reformed]] Churches. It lasted from 1640 to 1686. Calixt, a professor at [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]], had through travels in England, the Netherlands, Italy, and France, acquaintance with the different churches and their representatives, and extensive study, developed a more open attitude toward the different religious bodies than had the majority of his contemporary Lutheran theologians. While the latter firmly adhered to the &quot;pure doctrine&quot;, Calixt tended not to regard doctrine as the one thing necessary for a Christian, nor did he regard all doctrine as equally certain and important. Consequently, he advocated unity between those who agreed on the fundamental minimum, with liberty as to all less fundamental points. In regard to Catholicism, he would have (as [[Melanchthon]] once would have) conceded to the [[pope]] a primacy human in origin, and he also admitted that one might call the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] a [[sacrifice]].

The theological faculties of [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]], [[Rinteln]], and [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]] supported Calixt; opposed were those of [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Strasbourg|Strasburg]], [[University of Giessen|Giessen]], [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]]. [[Abraham Calov]] opposed Calixt. The [[Elector of Saxony]], for political reasons, opposed the [[Reformed Church]], because the other two secular [[Prince-elector|elector]]s (Palatine and Brandenburg) were &quot;[[reformed]]&quot;, and were competing with him. In 1649 he wrote to the three dukes of Brunswick, who maintained Helmstedt as their common university, and expressed the objections of his Lutheran professors, complaining that Calixt wished to extract the elements of truth from all religions, fuse all into a new religion, and provoke a schism.

In 1650 Calov became a professor at Wittenberg, and quickly attacked the Syncretists in Helmstedt. An outburst of polemical writings followed. In 1650 the dukes of Brunswick responded with the desire to limit the discord, and proposed a meeting of the political councillors. Saxony, however, did not favour this suggestion. An attempt to convene theologians was unsuccessful. The theologians of Wittenberg and Leipzig condemned 98 heresies of the Helmstedt theologians. They urged that this &quot;Formula of Concord&quot; be signed by everyone who wished to remain in the Lutheran Church. Outside Wittenberg and Leipzig, however, it was not accepted, and Calixt's death in 1656 ushered in five years of almost undisturbed peace.

The controversy broke out afresh in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], where [[Landgrave]] [[William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|William VI]] sought to effect a union between his [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] subjects, or at least to lessen their mutual hatred. In 1661 he had a [[Colloquy of Cassel|colloquy held in Kassel]] between the Lutheran theologians of the [[Rinteln|University of Rinteln]] and the Reformed theologians of the [[University of Marburg]]. Enraged at this revival of the syncretism of Calixt, the Wittenberg theologians called on the Rinteln professors to make their submission, whereupon the latter answered with a detailed defence. Another long series of polemical treatises followed.

In Brandenburg-Prussia in 1663, the Great Elector (Frederick William I) forbade preachers from speaking of the Evangelical disputes. A long colloquy in Berlin (September 1662 to May 1663) led only to fresh discord. Growing impatient, the Elector ended his conferences in 1664 and published another &quot;syncretistic&quot; edict. Since the edict disallowed the [[Formula of Concord]], one of the Lutheran Confessions as contained in the ''[[Book of Concord]]'', many Lutheran clergy did not comply with the edict. Whoever refused to sign the form declaring his intention to observe this regulation was deprived of his position, including [[Paul Gerhardt]], a pastor and noted hymnwriter. The citizens of Berlin petitioned to have him restored, and owing to their repeated requests, the Elector made an exception for Gerhardt. His conscience did not allow him to retain the post and Gernardt lived in Berlin for more than a year without fixed employment. During this time his wife also died, leaving him with one surviving child. The Elector withdrew the edict a few months later, but Gerhardt's patroness, Electress Louisa Henrietta, had died, so he was still without a position.

Calixt's son, Friedrich Ulrich Calixt, defended his father's views against the Wittenberg theologians's calling his school &quot;un-Lutheran&quot; and [[Heresy|heretical]].  The younger Calixt tried to show that his father's doctrine did not differ much from that of his opponents. Wittenberg had a new champion in [[Ægidius Strauch]], who attacked Calixt with all his resources of learning, polemics, and wit. The Helmstedt side was defended by the celebrated scholar and statesman, [[Hermann Conring]]. The Saxon princes recognized that trying to carry through the &quot;Consensus&quot; might lead to a fresh schism in the [[Lutheran Church]], and endanger its position related to Catholic power. They forbade the Saxon theologians from continuing the controversy in writing. Negotiations for peace then resulted, with Duke [[Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Altenburg|Ernst the Pious]] of [[Saxe-Gotha]] especially active.  They considered creating a permanent college of theologians to decide theological disputes. However, the negotiations with the courts of Brunswick, Mecklenburg, Denmark, and Sweden remained as fruitless as those with the theological faculties, except that peace was maintained until 1675.

[[Abraham Calovius|Calov]]  renewed hostilities. He attacked not only Calixt, but also and particularly the moderate [[John Musæus]] of Jena. Calov succeeded in having the [[University of Jena]] and Musæus compelled to renounce syncretism. But this was his last victory. The Elector renewed his prohibition against polemical writings. Calov seemed to give way for a time. Although he returned to his attack on the syncretists, he died in 1686, and the controversy ended.

The Syncretist Controversy had the result of lessening religious hatred and of promoting mutual forbearance. [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] benefited, as some [[Protestant]]s came to better understand and appreciate it. In Protestant theology, it prepared the way for the sentimental theology of [[Pietism]] to become more popular than [[Lutheran orthodoxy]].

=== Islam ===
{{original research|section|date=January 2012}}
The mystical tradition in [[Islam]], known as [[Sufism]] appears somewhat syncretic in nature, not only in its [[History of Sufism|origins]] but also in its beliefs since it espouses the concepts of [[Sufi_metaphysics#Wahdat_al-Wujud|Wahdat-al-Wujud]] and [[Sufi_metaphysics#Wahdat_al-Shuhud|Wahdat-al-Shuhud]] that are, to a great extent, synonymous to [[Pantheism]] and [[Panentheism]] and sometimes [[Monism]] although the traditional [[Aqeedah|Islamic belief system]] reject them and stress on strict [[monotheism]] called [[Tawhid]].

===Druze religion===

The [[Druze]]s integrated elements of [[Ismaili]] [[Islam]] with [[Gnosticism]] and [[Platonism]].

===Barghawata===

The [[Barghawata]] kingdom followed a syncretic religion inspired by Islam (perhaps influenced by Judaism) with elements of [[Sunni]], [[Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijite]] Islam, mixed with astrological and heathen traditions. Supposedly, they had their own [[Qur'an]] in the [[Berber language]] comprising 80 suras under the leadership of the second ruler of the dynasty [[Salih ibn Tarif]] who had taken part in the Maysara uprising. He proclaimed himself a prophet. He also claimed to be the final [[Mahdi]], and that [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] ([[Jesus]]) would be his companion and pray behind him.

=== Bahá'í Faith ===

The [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] follow [[Bahá'u'lláh]], a prophet whom they consider a successor to [[Muhammad]], [[Jesus]], [[Moses]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Zoroaster]], and [[Abraham]].  This acceptance of other religious founders has encouraged some to regard the Bahá'í religion as a syncretic faith.  However, Bahá'ís and the Bahá'í writings explicitly reject this view.  Bahá'ís consider Bahá'u'lláh's revelation an independent, though related, revelation from God.  Its relationship to previous [[Dispensationalism|dispensations]] is seen as analogous to the relationship of Christianity to Judaism.  They regard beliefs held in common as evidence of truth, [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressively revealed by God]] throughout human history, and culminating in (at present) the Bahá'í revelation.  Bahá'ís have their own [[Sacred text|sacred scripture]], interpretations, laws and practices that, for Bahá'ís, supersede those of other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |pages = 276–277 &amp; p.291 |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stockman, Robert (1997).

===Caribbean religions and cultures===

The process of syncretism in the Caribbean region often forms a part of cultural creolization. (The technical term &quot;[[Creole peoples|Creole]]&quot; may apply to anyone born and raised in the region, regardless of ethnicity.) The shared histories of the Caribbean islands include long periods of European [[Imperialism]] (mainly by Spain, France, and the United Kingdom) and the importation of African [[slaves]] (primarily from Central and Western Africa). The influences of each of the above interacted in varying degrees on the islands, producing the fabric of society that exists today in the Caribbean.

The [[Rastafari movement]], founded in [[Jamaica]], syncretizes vigorously, mixing elements from the [[Bible]], [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Pan Africanism]] movement, [[Hinduism]], and [[Caribbean culture]].

Another highly syncretic religion of the area, [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]], combines elements of Western African, native Caribbean, and [[Christianity|Christian]] (especially [[Roman Catholic]]) beliefs.

See [[#Modern syncretic religions|the modern section]] for other Caribbean syncretisms.

=== Indian traditions ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] in ancient India have made many adaptations over the millennia, assimilating elements of various diverse religious traditions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} One example of this is the [[Yoga Vasistha]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fe_5bUKSaUEC&amp;pg=PR12 The concise Yoga Vāsiṣṭha By Venkatesananda],  1985, pp. xii&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]], who wanted to consolidate the diverse religious communities in his empire, propounded [[Din-i-Ilahi]], a syncretic religion intended to merge the best elements of the religions of his empire

[[Meivazhi]] (Tamil: மெய்வழி) is a syncretic monotheistic minority religion based in Tamil Nadu, India. Its focus is spiritual enlightenment and the conquering of death, through the teachings. Mevaizhi preaches the Oneness of essence message of all the previous major scriptures - particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity - allowing membership regardless of creed. Meivazhi's disciples are thousands of people belonging once to 69 different castes of different religions being united as one family of Meivazhi Religion.

=== Other modern syncretic religions ===

Recently developed religious systems that exhibit marked syncretism include the [[New World]] religions [[Candomblé]], ''21 Division'', [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and [[Santería]], which analogize various [[Yorùbá mythology|Yorùbá]] and other [[List of African deities|African deities]] to the [[Saint#Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman Catholic saints]]. Some sects of Candomblé have also incorporated [[Native American deities]], and [[Umbanda]] combined African deities with [[spiritism|Kardecist]] [[spiritualism]].

[[Hoodoo]] is a similarly derived form of [[folk magic]] practiced by some [[African American]] communities in the [[Southern United States]]. Other traditions of syncretic folk religion in North America include [[Louisiana Voodoo]] as well as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[Pow-wow (folk magic)|Pow-wow]], in which practitioners profess to invoke power through the [[Christian God]].

Many historical [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religious movements have incorporated Christian European influence, like the [[Native American Church]], the [[Ghost Dance]], and the religion of [[Handsome Lake]].

[[Unitarian Universalism]] also provides an example of a modern syncretic religion. It traces its roots to [[Universalism|Universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[Christian]] congregations. However, modern Unitarian Universalism freely incorporates elements from other religious and non-religious traditions, so that it no longer identifies as &quot;Christian.&quot;

[[Theosophy]] and the Theosophy-based [[Ascended Master Teachings]] are syncretic religions that combine deities primarily from [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] into an elaborate [[Spiritual Hierarchy]].

[[Universal Sufism]] seeks the [[Cultural identity|unity]] of all people and [[religion]]s. Universal Sufis strive to &quot;realize and spread the knowledge of Unity, the religion of Love, and Wisdom, so that the biases and prejudices of faiths and beliefs may, of themselves, fall away, the human heart overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences be rooted out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071227021948/http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php Hazrat Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, The 3 Objects of the Sufi Movement],  Sufi Ruhaniat International (1956–2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, [[Caodaism]] blends elements of [[Buddhism]], Catholicism and Kardecism.

Several [[Religions of Japan#New religions|new Japanese religions]], (such as [[Konkokyo]] and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]), are syncretistic.

The [[Nigeria]]n religion [[Chrislam]] combines Christian and Islamic doctrines.

[[Thelema]] is a mixture of many different schools of belief and practice, including [[Hermeticism]], Eastern [[Mysticism]], [[Yoga]], 19th century [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophies (e.g. [[Nietzsche]]), [[occultism]], and the [[Kabbalah]], as well as ancient [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] religion.

Examples of strongly syncretist [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and modern movements with some religious elements include [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], [[theosophy]], modern [[astrology]], [[Neopaganism]], and the [[New Age]] movement.

In China, most of the population follows syncretist religions combining [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and elements of [[Confucianism]]. Out of all Chinese believers, approximately 85.7% adhere to [[Chinese traditional religion]], as many profess to be both Mahayana Buddhist and Taoist at the same time. Many of the pagodas in China are dedicated to both Buddhist and Taoist deities.

In [[Réunion]], the [[Malbars]] combine elements of Hinduism and Christianity.

The [[Unification Church]], founded by religious leader [[Sun Myung Moon]] in [[South Korea]] in 1954. Its teachings are based on the [[Bible]], but include new interpretations not found in mainstream Judaism and Christianity and incorporates Asian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;George D.

=== During The Enlightenment ===

The modern, rational non-pejorative connotations of syncretism date from [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' articles: ''Eclecticisme'' and ''Syncrétistes, Hénotiques, ou Conciliateurs.''  Diderot portrayed syncretism as the concordance of eclectic sources.
