The materializations of ''[[Vibhuti#Sacred ash|vibhuti]]'' (holy ash) and other small objects such as rings, necklaces and watches by Sathya Sai Baba were a source of both fame and controversy; devotees considered them signs of divinity, while skeptics viewed them as simple conjuring tricks.

Post. Durban: Apr 27, 2011. pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and using the Indian way of accounting for age, which counts the year to come as part of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Philip M. Prasad, Malayalam Daily. Kerala, India: 25 April 2011. &quot;What Baba has foretold was indeed correct. According to the Roman calendar he has completed 85 years. But one can note that generally in all of Baba’s discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days. Accordingly, under the star basis of calculation he was in his 96th year having completed 54 days when he left his physical body.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other devotees have spoken of his anticipated resurrection, reincarnation or awakening.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindustan Times'', New Delhi: 25 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Sai Baba might interact with people, accept letters, materialize and distribute [[vibhuti]] (sacred ash) or call groups or individuals for interviews. Devotees considered it a great privilege to have an interview and sometimes a single person, group or family was invited for a private interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;kent&quot;/&gt;

In September 2000 [[UNESCO]] withdrew from the conference which was going to be held in Prashanthi Nilaym, one of the ashrams of Sathya Sai Baba.

Satyajit, a close aide of Sri Satya Sai Baba, has released to the media a declaration of Sai Baba registered on March, 23, 1967, in Bombay (now Mumbai) saying his relatives had no authority over the Satya Sai Trust assets.
The text of the declaration, released here on Sunday September 2, 2012: “I, Satya Sai, Prashanti Nilayam, Indian, hereby declare as follows: I was born in the village of Puttapathi in Anantapur district and am at present 44 years old. I joined school and gave up studies and dedicated myself to spread Sanatana Dharma. I am unmarried and left my parents at the age of 12 and have taken up religious order with saffron dress and I have no worldly/or family attachments. I declare that I left parents permanently and adopted holy order with no intention to revert back. I relinquished all my right title and interest in family property, moveable or immovable, whatsoever and wherever they may, and I do not own and possess personal property or wealth or estate. Whatever is given to me is under my management, supervision and control as a trustee to be used for public charitable purposes. This declaration, I am making so (that) nobody can claim, under or through me, in the family properties if any.”
Satyajit also attached the attestation of Indu Lal Sha, who is the sole surviving witness to the original document. Satyajit said he has been in possession of the document since 1998, as per the directions of Sai Baba.&lt;ref&gt; http://ibnlive.in.com/news/declaration-made-by-satya-sai-in-1967-released/287928-60-121.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical examinations==
In April 1976, [[H. Narasimhaiah]], a physicist, rationalist and then vice chancellor of [[Bangalore University]], founded and chaired a committee &quot;to rationally and scientifically investigate miracles and other verifiable superstitions&quot;. Narasimhaiah wrote Sathya Sai Baba three letters that were widely publicized, in which he publicly challenged him to perform his miracles under controlled conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;haraldsson204&quot;&gt;Haraldson, ''op. cit'', pp&amp;nbsp;204–205&lt;/ref&gt; Sathya Sai Baba said that he ignored Narasimhaiah's challenge because he felt his approach was improper, adding that &quot;Science must confine its inquiry only to things belonging to the human senses, while spiritualism transcends the senses. If you want to understand the nature of spiritual power you can do so only through the path of spirituality and not science. What science has been able to unravel is merely a fraction of the cosmic phenomena&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blitz&quot;&gt;Interview given by Sathya Sai Baba to [[R. K. Karanjia]] of Blitz News Magazine in September 1976 [http://www.saibaba.ws/articles/interviewwithjournalistsept1976.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Narasimhaiah's committee was dissolved in August 1977. According to Erlendur Haraldsson, the formal challenge from the committee came to a dead end because of the negative attitude of the committee, and perhaps because of all the fanfare surrounding it. Narasimhaiah held the fact that Sathya Sai Baba ignored his letters to be one of several indications that his miracles were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this episode, a public debate raged for several months in Indian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian rationalist [[Basava Premanand]] stated in a BBC documentary that he had been investigating Sathya Sai Baba since 1968 and that, in his opinion, Sai Baba faked his materialisations. He sued Sai Baba in 1986 for violations of the [[Gold Control Act]], citing Sathya Sai Baba's purported &quot;materializations&quot; of gold objects. When the case was dismissed, Premanand unsuccessfully appealed on the grounds that claimed spiritual power is not a defense recognized in law.&lt;ref name=bbca1&gt;{{cite news|author=Tanya Datta|title=Sai Baba: Goan or con man?|date=17 June 2004|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magician [[James Randi]] wrote about Sathya Sai Baba and Premanand, &quot;Examination of films and videotapes of Sai Baba's actual performances show them to be simple sleight of hand, exactly the same as the sort used by the other Indian jaduwallahs, or 'street conjurors.' Sai Baba has never submitted to an examination of his abilities under controls, so his claims are totally unproven. Parsimony applies here. India's leading debunker of the claims of the god-men who infest that country, the famous Premanand, has duplicated all of Sai Baba's tricks and tours the world demonstrating these feats.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Randi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=James Randi

A 1995 TV documentary ''Guru Busters'', produced by filmmaker [[Robert Eagle (writer and director)|Robert Eagle]] for UK's [[Channel 4]], similarly accused Sathya Sai Baba of faking his materializations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/guru.htm |title=Eagle &amp; Eagle |publisher=Eagletv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-01-07}} [http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/videos/Saimagic.mov Clip]&lt;/ref&gt; The clip from the film was mentioned in [[the Deccan Chronicle]], on 23 November 1992, on a front page headline ''&quot;DD Tape Unveils Baba Magic&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;295–301&lt;/ref&gt; However, Haraldsson stated that, on investigating the DD video, researchers did not find evidence of fake materialisation as claimed by Deccan chronicle. According to Haraldsson, the video was taken to a company which investigates corporate fraud. In spite of improving the graininess of the low quality video with enhanced filters and running it through advanced image processing systems, Haraldsson stated the DD video did not provide firm evidence of sleight of hand.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp 300, 295–301&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, British journalist Mick Brown stated in his book ''The Spiritual Tourist'' that Sathya Sai Baba's claim of &quot;resurrecting&quot; the American devotee Walter Cowan in 1971 was probably untrue.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiritualtourist&quot;&gt;Mick Brown, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', 1998, Bloomsbury Publishing, ISBN 1-58234-034-X Chapter ''In the House of God'', pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion was based on letters from the attending doctors presented in the magazine ''[[Indian Skeptic]]'', published by Premanand.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiritualtourist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hislop, John S.

It was produced by Denmark's national television and radio broadcast company, [[Danish radio|Danmarks Radio]] (DR).&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The show also presented allegations from Indian skeptic Basava Premanand, who campaigned against Sai Baba for over 30 years. He claimed Sai Baba was &quot;not just a fraud, but a dangerous sexual abuser&quot;. According to him, rumours about sexual abuse had been circulating for years, but due to the popularity of the internet, the tide of claims against Sai Baba &quot;[became] a groundswell&quot;. Though his claims spanned 30 years, he stated that his stories were similar, a common practice being the rubbing of genitals with oil by the spiritual leader. Among his claims were that one ex-devotee claimed Sai Baba &quot;put the oil on his hands, told me to drop my pants and rubbed my genitals with the oil&quot;. Premanand theorized that many Indian boys were abused but were never heard from because they too afraid to speak out, alleging Sai Baba was well-connected with the elite and powerful of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' in 2001 reported that Sathya Sai Baba told his adherents not to browse the [[Internet]] due to allegations rapidly circulating on various Internet [[website]]s and in a few newspapers.&lt;ref name= VS&gt;The Vancouver Sun, 27 February 2001, ''Holy man? Sex abuser? Both?''&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 public discourse, Sathya Sai Baba said, &quot;These teachings (the Vedas) are highly sacred. Today people are ready to believe all that they see on television and internet but do not repose their faith in the Vedic declarations. Internet is like a waste paper basket. Follow the 'innernet,' not the internet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume33/sss33-17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to criticism==
The guru and his followers consistently denied the charges of misconduct, which were never proved.&lt;ref name=funeral/&gt; Devotees generally responded to allegations, such as those of sexual misconduct, with outright denial, asserting that former followers were vindictive and not reputable – fickle people who one day sang Sathya Sai Baba's praises and then turned against him when some wish of theirs was not fulfilled.&lt;ref name=Palmer117&gt;Palmer, Norris W. &quot;Baba's World&quot;. In: {{cite book| last = Forsthoefel| first = Thomas A.

He said that the more detractors railed against Sathya Sai Baba, the more new devotees went to see him.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Bill (27 November 2005), Miracle of Welfare http://web.archive.org/web/20060909111636/http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the article ''Divine Downfall'', published in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Anil Kumar, the ex-principal of the Sathya Sai Educational Institute, said that he believed that the controversy was part of Baba's divine plan and that all great religious teachers had to face criticism during their lives. Anil Kumar also said that allegations had been leveled at Sathya Sai Baba since childhood, but with every criticism he had become more and more triumphant.&lt;ref name=&quot;divine&quot;&gt;Brown, Mick (2000-10-28). &quot;Divine Downfall&quot;. Daily Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official letter made public in December 2001, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] (then [[Prime Minister of India]] and a devotee of Sathya Sai Baba&lt;ref name=Palmer97-98 /&gt;), P.N. Bhagawati (Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India), [[Ranganath Misra]] (Chair Person, National Human Rights Commissioner of India and Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India), Najma Heptulla (President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union; UNDP Distinguished Human Development Ambassador) and [[Shivraj V. Patil|Shivraj Patil]] (Member of Parliament, India; Formerly of the Lok Sabha &amp; Union Minister) all signed a letter which stated as follows:

{{quote|We are deeply pained and anguished by the wild, reckless and concocted allegations made by certain vested interests and people against Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. We would normally expect that responsible media would ascertain the true facts before printing such calumny – especially when the person is revered globally as an embodiment of love and selfless service to humanity. Since this professional ethic has not been observed by a section of the media, we have elected to go public with this signed statement.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Sathya Sai Baba – A Living Legend – An Embodiment Of Love For All Mankind, Letter from A.B. Vajpayee (the then Prime Minister of India), [http://www.geocities.com/wikirefs/prime-minister-of-india.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[Times Of India]]'' on 26 December 2000 said that Sathya Sai Baba &quot;lashed out at his detractors in a rare display of anger&quot; while referring to criticism published in a magazine. The Times quoted him as saying, &quot;[[Jesus]] Christ underwent many hardships, and was put to the cross because of jealousy. Many around him could not bear the good work he did and the large number of followers he gathered. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], betrayed him. In those days there was one Judas, but today there are thousands. Just as that Judas was tempted to betray Jesus, the Judases of today, too, are bought out to lie. Jealousy was the motive behind the allegations levelled at him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Manu (26 December 2000), Sai Baba lashes out at detractors http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/534425761.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

Sathya Sai Baba publicly responded to the allegations on 25 December 2000:
{{quote|Some people out of their mean-mindedness are trying to tarnish the image of Sai Baba. I am not after name and fame. So, I do not lose anything by their false allegations. My glory will go on increasing day by day. It will never diminish even a bit if they were to publicize their false allegations in the whole world in bold letters. Some devotees seem to be perturbed over these false statements. They are not true devotees at all. Having known the mighty power of Sai, why should they be afraid of the 'cawing of crows'? One should not get carried away by all that is written on walls, said in political meetings or the vulgar tales carried by the print media.&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Speaks Vol.33, pg.389&lt;/ref&gt;}}
