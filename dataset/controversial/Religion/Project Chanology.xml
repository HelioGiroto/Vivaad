[[Image:Anonymous Scientology 1 by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|300px|Protesters in [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s outside a Scientology center at the February 10, 2008 Project Chanology protest.]]
'''Project Chanology''' (also called '''Operation Chanology'''&lt;ref name=&quot;landers&quot; /&gt;) is a [[protest]] movement against the practices of the [[Church of Scientology]] by members of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], a leaderless [[Internet]]-based group that defines itself as ubiquitous. The project was started in response to the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove material from a highly publicized interview with [[Scientologist]] [[Tom Cruise]] from the Internet in January 2008.

The project was publicly launched in the form of a video posted to [[YouTube]], &quot;Message to Scientology&quot;, on January 21, 2008. The video states that [[Scientology and the Internet|Anonymous views Scientology's actions]] as [[Internet censorship]], and asserts the group's intent to &quot;expel the church from the Internet&quot;. This was followed by distributed [[denial-of-service attack]]s (DDoS), and soon after, [[black fax]]es, [[prank call]]s, and other measures intended to disrupt the Church of Scientology's operations. In February 2008, the focus of the protest shifted to legal methods, including [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] protests and an attempt to get the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to investigate the Church of Scientology's [[Tax exemption|tax exempt status]] in the United States.

Reactions from the Church of Scientology regarding the protesters' actions have varied. Initially, one spokesperson stated that members of the group &quot;have got some wrong information&quot; about Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;schliebs&quot; /&gt; Another referred to the group as a group of &quot;computer geeks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomas&quot; /&gt; Later, the Church of Scientology started referring to Anonymous as &quot;cyberterrorists&quot; perpetrating &quot;religious hate crimes&quot; against the church.

Detractors of Scientology have also criticized the actions of Project Chanology, asserting that they merely provide the Church of Scientology with the opportunity to &quot;play the religious persecution card&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcmillan&quot; /&gt; Other critics such as [[Mark Bunker]] and [[Tory Christman]] initially questioned the [[legality]] of Project Chanology's methods,&lt;ref name=&quot;braiker&quot; /&gt; but have since spoken out in support of the project as it shifted towards nonviolent protests and other legal methods.

==Background==
{{main|Scientology and the Internet}}

The Church of Scientology has a history of conflict with groups on the Internet. In 1995, attorneys for the Church of Scientology attempted to get the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.religion.scientology]] (a.r.s.) removed from [[Usenet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oconnell&quot; /&gt; This attempt backfired and generated a significant amount of press for a.r.s. The conflict with a.r.s led the [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] group [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] to declare war on the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;oconnell&quot; /&gt; The Church of Scientology mounted a 10-year legal campaign against Dutch writer [[Karin Spaink]] and several [[Internet service providers]] after Spaink and others posted documents alleged to be secret teachings of the organization. The Church of Scientology's efforts ended in a legal defeat in a Dutch court in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;barkham&quot; /&gt; This series of events is often referred to as &quot;Scientology versus the Internet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;oconnell&quot; /&gt;
