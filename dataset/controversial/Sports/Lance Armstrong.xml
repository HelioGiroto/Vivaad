'''Lance Edward Armstrong''' (born '''Lance Edward Gunderson''', September 18, 1971) is an American former professional [[road bicycle racing|road racing cyclist]]. In 2012 he was banned for life and disqualified from all his results since August 1998, for using and distributing [[performance-enhancing drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usada.org/media/sanction-armstrong8242012 Lance Armstrong Receives Lifetime Ban And Disqualification Of Competitive Results For Doping Violations Stemming From His Involvement In The United States Postal Service Pro-Cycling Team Doping Conspiracy, USADA]&lt;/ref&gt; He had recovered from [[testicular cancer]] before winning the [[Tour de France]] seven consecutive times, from 1999 to 2005: those victories are now annulled. 

At 16, Armstrong began competing as a triathlete and became a national sprint-course triathlon champion in 1989 and 1990. In 1992, Armstrong began his career as a professional cyclist with the [[Motorola Cycling Team|Motorola]] team. He had notable success between 1993 and 1996, including the 1993 [[UCI Road World Championships, Men|World Championship]], Clásica de San Sebastián in 1995, an overall victory in the penultimate Tour DuPont and a handful of stage victories in Europe, including the stage to Limoges in the Tour de France.

In October 1996, he was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] that had spread to his brain and lungs. His cancer treatments included brain and testicular surgery and extensive [[chemotherapy]]. His last chemotherapy treatment was received on December 13, 1996. In February 1997, he was declared cancer-free and the same year he founded the [[Lance Armstrong Foundation]] for cancer support. By January 1998, Armstrong had renewed serious cycling training, having signed a new racing contract with [[U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team|US Postal]]. He was a member of the US Postal/Discovery team between 1998 and 2005. On July 24, 2005, Armstrong retired from racing at the end of the [[2005 Tour de France]], but returned to competitive cycling with the Astana team in January 2009 and finished third in the [[2009 Tour de France]]. Between 2010 and 2011, he raced with the [[UCI ProTeam]] he helped found, [[Team Radio Shack]].

On February 16, 2011, he announced his retirement from competitive cycling, while facing a US federal investigation into doping allegations. In February 2012, he returned to triathlon, competing as a professional in several events. In June 2012, the [[U.S. Anti-Doping Agency]] (USADA) charged Armstrong with having used illicit performance-enhancing drugs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong&quot;/&gt; and in August they announced a lifetime ban from competition, which applies in all sports which follow the [[World Anti Doping Agency]] code, as well as the stripping of all titles won since August 1998. The USADA report called Armstrong a &quot;serial cheat who led the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/19903716 Lance Armstrong: Usada report labels him 'a serial cheat']&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 2012, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI), the sport's governing body, endorsed USADA's verdict and confirmed both the lifetime ban and the stripping of titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-UCI&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
Armstrong was born on September 18, 1971, at Methodist Hospital in [[Plano, Texas]], north of [[Dallas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bike Friendly Oak Cliff: BFOC interviews Lance Armstrong's mom, Linda Armstrong Kelly&quot;/&gt;
At the age of 12 he started racing in his sporting career as a swimmer at the City of Plano Swim Club and finished fourth in Texas state 1,500-meter freestyle. He stopped swimming-only races after seeing a poster for a junior [[triathlon]], called the Iron Kids Triathlon, which he won at age 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;LanceArmstrong.com&quot;/&gt;

In the 1987–1988 Tri-Fed/Texas (&quot;Tri-Fed&quot; was the former name of [[USA Triathlon]]), Armstrong was ranked the number-one triathlete in the 19-and-under group; second place was [[Chann McRae]], who became a US Postal Service cycling teammate and the 2002 [[United States National Road Race Championships|USPRO national champion]]. Armstrong's total points in 1987 as an amateur was better than five professionals ranked higher than him that year. At 16, Lance Armstrong became a professional triathlete and became national sprint-course triathlon champion in 1989 and 1990 at 18 and 19, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breaking Away: Lance Armstrong of the U.S. is the world cycling champ. Now he's going for an even bigger prize.&quot;/&gt;

===Motorola: 1992–96===
In 1992 Armstrong turned professional with the [[Motorola Cycling Team]], the successor of 7-Eleven team. In 1993, Armstrong won 10 one-day events and stage races, but his breakthrough victory was the [[UCI Road World Championships, Men|UCI Road World Championship]] held in Norway. Prior to his World's win, he took his first win at the [[1993 Tour de France|Tour de France]], in the stage from [[Châlons-sur-Marne]] to [[Verdun]]. He was 97th in the general classification when he retired after stage 12.

He also collected the [[Thrift Drug]] Triple Crown of Cycling: the Thrift Drug Classic in [[Pittsburgh]], the K-Mart West Virginia Classic, and the [[CoreStates]] [[United States National Road Race Championships|USPRO national championship]] in [[Philadelphia]].

In 1994, he again won the Thrift Drug Classic and came second in the [[Tour DuPont]] in the United States. His successes in Europe where he placed second in [[Liège–Bastogne–Liège]] and the [[Clásica de San Sebastián]], where just two years before, he finished in last place as his first all-pro event in Europe.

He won the Clásica de San Sebastián in 1995, followed by an overall victory in the penultimate [[Tour DuPont]] and a handful of stage victories in Europe, including the stage to [[Limoges]] in the [[1995_Tour_de_France#Stages|Tour de France]], three days after the death of his teammate [[Fabio Casartelli]], who crashed on the descent of the [[Col de Portet d'Aspet]] on the 15th stage.

Armstrong's successes were much the same in 1996. He became the first American to win the [[La Flèche Wallonne]] and again won the Tour DuPont. However, he was only able to compete for five days in the Tour De France. In the [[1996 Olympic Games]] he finished 6th in the [[time trial]] and 12th in the road race. In August 1996 following the Leeds Classic, Armstrong signed a 2 year, $2m deal with the French [[Cofidis Cycling Team]]. Joining him in signing contracts with the French team were teammates [[Frankie Andreu]] and [[Laurent Madouas]]. Two months later, in October of 1996 he was diagnosed with testicular cancer.

===Cancer===
On October 2, 1996, then aged 25, Armstrong was diagnosed as having [[Testicular cancer#Staging|stage three]] (advanced) testicular cancer ([[embryonal carcinoma]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong Acknowledges Cancer Battle&quot;/&gt; The cancer [[metastasis|spread]] to his lungs, abdomen and brain. On his first visit to a [[urologist]] in Austin, Texas, for his cancer symptoms he was coughing up blood and had a large, painful testicular tumor. Immediate surgery and chemotherapy saved his life. Armstrong had an [[inguinal orchiectomy|orchiectomy]] to remove his diseased testicle. After his surgery, his doctor said that he had less than a 40% survival chance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong, Sally Jenkins: ''It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life'' (ISBN 0-425-17961-3), Putnam 2000&quot;/&gt;

The standard chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of this type of cancer is a cocktail of the drugs [[bleomycin]], [[etoposide]], and [[cisplatin]] (or [[Platinol]]) (BEP). Armstrong, however, chose an alternative, [[etoposide]], [[ifosfamide]], and [[cisplatin]] (VIP), to avoid the lung toxicity associated with bleomycin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong, Sally Jenkins: ''It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life'' (ISBN 0-425-17961-3), Putnam 2000&quot;/&gt; This decision may have saved his cycling career. His primary treatment was received at the [[Indiana University]] (IU), [[Indianapolis]], Medical Center, where [[Lawrence Einhorn]] had pioneered the use of cisplatinum to treat testicular cancer. His primary oncologist there was Craig Nichols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong, Sally Jenkins: ''It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life'' (ISBN 0-425-17961-3), Putnam 2000&quot;/&gt; His brain tumors were surgically removed by Scott A. Shapiro, MD, Professor of Neurosurgery at Indiana University and Resident Director, and were found to contain extensive [[necrosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;societyns&quot;/&gt;

According to Armstrong's first book, Shapiro convinced him that he was the right neurosurgeon for him by saying: &quot;You'll have to convince me you know what you're doing,&quot; said Armstrong. &quot;Look, I've done a large number of these,&quot; Shapiro said, &quot;I've never had anyone die, and I've never made anyone worse.&quot; &quot;Yeah, but why should you be the person who operates on my head?&quot; Armstrong responded. &quot;Because as good as you are at cycling&quot; – he paused – &quot;I'm a lot better at brain surgery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong, Sally Jenkins: ''It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life'' (ISBN 0-425-17961-3), Putnam 2000&quot;/&gt;

His last chemotherapy treatment was received on December 13, 1996. In the February of 1997 he was declared cancer-free but shortly after came the news that his contract with the Cofidis team had been cancelled. Again it was a former boss at Subaru Montgomery who came to the rescue offering him a contract with the US Postal team on a salary of $200,000 a year. By January 1998 he was already engaged in serious training for racing, moving to Europe with the team. A pivotal week (April 1998) in his comeback was one he spent training in the very challenging Appalachian terrain around Boone, North Carolina, with his racing friend [[Bob Roll]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong, Sally Jenkins: ''It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life'' (ISBN 0-425-17961-3), Putnam 2000&quot;/&gt;

===US Postal/Discovery: 1998–2005===
Before his cancer treatment, Armstrong had won two Tour de France stages. In 1993, he won the eighth stage and in 1995; he took stage 18 in honor of teammate [[Fabio Casartelli]] who crashed and died on stage 15. Armstrong dropped out of the 1996 Tour after the fifth stage after becoming ill, a few months before his diagnosis.

[[File:Lance Armstrong MidiLibre 2002.jpg|thumb|250px|Armstrong finishing third in [[Sète]], taking over the Yellow Jersey at [[Grand Prix Midi Libre]].]]
Armstrong's cycling comeback began in 1998 when he finished fourth in the [[Vuelta a España]]. In 1999 he won the Tour de France, including four stages. He beat the second rider, [[Alex Zülle]], by 7 minutes 37 seconds. However, the absence of [[Jan Ullrich]] (injury) and [[Marco Pantani]] (drug allegations) meant Armstrong had not yet proven himself against the biggest names. Stage wins included the prologue, stage eight, an [[individual time trial]] in [[Metz]], an Alpine stage on stage nine, and the second individual time trial on stage 19.

In 2000, Ullrich and Pantani returned to challenge Armstrong. The race that began a six-year rivalry between Ullrich and Armstrong ended in victory for Armstrong by 6 minutes 2 seconds over Ullrich. Armstrong took one stage in the 2000 Tour, the second individual time trial on stage 19. In 2001, Armstrong again took top honors, beating Ullrich by 6 minutes 44 seconds. In 2002, Ullrich did not participate due to suspension, and Armstrong won by seven minutes over [[Joseba Beloki]].

[[File:Lance-Armstrong-TdF2004.jpg|thumb|250px|Armstrong riding the prologue of the [[2004 Tour de France]].]]
The pattern returned in 2003, Armstrong taking first place and Ullrich second. Only 1 minute 1 second separated the two at the end of the final day in Paris. U.S. Postal won the [[team time trial]] on stage four, while Armstrong took stage 15, despite being knocked off on the ascent to [[Luz Ardiden]], the final climb, when a spectator's bag caught his right handlebar. Ullrich waited for him, which brought Ullrich fair-play honors.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportunterricht&quot;/&gt;

In 2004, Armstrong finished first, 6 minutes 19 seconds ahead of German [[Andreas Klöden]]. Ullrich was fourth, a further 2 minutes 31 seconds behind. Armstrong won a personal best five individual stages, plus the team time trial. He became the first since [[Gino Bartali]] in 1948 to win three consecutive mountain stages; 15, 16, and 17.

The individual time trial on stage 16 up [[Alpe d'Huez]] was won in style by Armstrong as he passed [[Ivan Basso]] on the way despite setting out two minutes after the Italian. He won sprint finishes from Basso in stages 13 and 15 and made up a significant gap in the last 250&amp;nbsp;m to nip Klöden at the line in stage 17. He won the final individual time trial, stage 19, to complete his personal record of stage wins.

[[File:Lance Armstrong 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|Armstrong wearing the yellow jersey at the [[2005 Tour de France]].]]
In 2005, Armstrong was beaten by [[David Zabriskie]] in the Stage 1 time trial by two seconds, despite passing Ullrich on the road. His Discovery Channel team won the team time trial, while Armstrong won the final individual time trial. In the mountain stages, Armstrong was attacked multiple times mostly by Ivan Basso, but also by T-mobile leaders Jan Ullrich, Andreas Kloden and Alexandre Vinokourov and former teammate [[Levi Leipheimer]]. But still, the American champion handled them well, maintained his lead and, on some occasions, increased it. To complete his record-breaking feat, Armstrong crossed the line on the Champs-Élysées on July 24 to win his seventh consecutive Tour, finishing 4m 40s ahead of Basso, with Ullrich third. Another record achieved that year was that Armstrong completed the tour at the highest pace in the race's history: his average speed over the whole tour was 41.7&amp;nbsp;km/h(26 mph).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tour de France winners and their average speeds&quot;/&gt;

On July 24, 2005, Armstrong officially announced his retirement from professional cycling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong retires...&amp;nbsp;– Event news&quot;/&gt;

===Comeback===

====Astana: 2009====
{{See also|2009 Astana season}}
Armstrong announced on September 9, 2008, that he would return to pro cycling with the express goal of participating in the [[2009 Tour de France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;azcentral&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;coming out&quot;/&gt; ''VeloNews'' reported that Armstrong would race for no salary or bonuses and would post his internally tested blood results online.&lt;ref name=&quot;coming out&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Lance Armstrong (Tour de France 2009 - Stage 17).jpg|thumb|250px|Armstrong riding for Astana on Stage 17 of the [[2009 Tour de France]].]]
Australian [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio reported on September 24, 2008, that Armstrong would compete in the UCI [[Tour Down Under]] through [[Adelaide]] and surrounding areas in January 2009. UCI rules say a cyclist has to be in an anti-doping program for six months before an event, but UCI allowed Armstrong to compete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong given the all clear from UCI for Tour Down Under comeback&quot;/&gt; He had to retire from the 2009 Vuelta a Castilla y León during the first stage after crashing in a rider pileup in [[Baltanás]], Spain and breaking his [[Clavicle|collarbone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong breaks his collarbone&quot;/&gt; Armstrong flew back to [[Austin, Texas]], for corrective surgery, which was successful, and was back training on a bicycle within four days of his operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot;/&gt;

On April 10, 2009, a controversy emerged between the French anti-doping agency [[AFLD]] and Armstrong and his team manager, [[Johan Bruyneel]], stemming from a March 17, 2009, encounter with an AFLD anti-doping official who visited Armstrong after a training ride in [[Beaulieu-sur-Mer]]. When the official arrived, Armstrong claims he asked—and was granted—permission to take a shower while Bruyneel checked the official's credentials. In late April, the AFLD cleared Armstrong of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong cleared by French anti-doping agency&quot;/&gt; Armstrong returned to racing after his collarbone injury at the [[Tour of the Gila]] in [[New Mexico]] on April 29.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong to return from injury&quot;/&gt;

On July 7, in the fourth stage of the [[2009 Tour de France]], Armstrong narrowly failed to win the yellow jersey after his Astana team won the [[team time trial]]. His Astana team won the 39&amp;nbsp;km lap of [[Montpellier]] but Armstrong ended up just over two tenths of a second (0.22) outside of [[Fabian Cancellara]]'s overall lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong just misses Tour lead&quot;/&gt; Armstrong finished the 2009 Tour de France in third place overall, 5:24 behind the overall winner, his Astana teammate [[Alberto Contador]].

====Team RadioShack: 2010–11====
On July 21, 2009, Armstrong announced that he would return to the Tour de France in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong Says He Will Return for 2010&quot;/&gt; [[RadioShack]] was named as the main sponsor for Armstrong's 2010 team, named [[Team RadioShack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;espn-radioshack&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Team RadioShack 2010&quot;/&gt; Armstrong made his 2010 season debut at the [[2010 Tour Down Under|Tour Down Under]] where he finished 25th out of the 127 riders that completed the race. He made his European season debut at the [[Vuelta a Murcia|2010 Vuelta a Murcia]] finishing in seventh place overall. Armstrong was also set to compete in several classics such as the [[Milan&amp;nbsp;– San Remo]], [[Amstel Gold Race]], [[Liège–Bastogne–Liège]], and the [[Tour of Flanders]], but bouts with gastroenteritis forced his withdrawal from three of the four races.&lt;ref name=&quot;VeloNews.com&amp;nbsp;– Bruyneel confirms Armstrong will race classics&quot;/&gt;

Armstrong returned to the United States in mid-April to compete in the Tour of Gila and May's [[2010 Tour of California|Tour of California]], both as preparation for the Tour de France. However, he crashed outside [[Visalia, California|Visalia]] early in stage 5 of the Tour of California and had to withdraw from the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong heading to local hospital after crash outside of Visalia&quot;/&gt; He showed fine shape after recovering from the Tour of California crash, placing second in the [[2010 Tour de Suisse|Tour of Switzerland]] and third in the [[Tour of Luxembourg]].

On June 28, Armstrong announced via Twitter that the [[2010 Tour de France|2010 edition]] would be his final Tour de France.&lt;ref name=&quot;competitor&quot;/&gt; Armstrong put in an impressive performance in the Tour de France prologue TT, finishing third, but was plagued by crashes in later stages that put him out of GC contention, especially a serious crash in stage 8. He rallied for the brutal Pyreneean stage 16, working as a key player in a successful break that included teammate [[Chris Horner]]. He finished his last tour in 23rd place, 39 minutes 20 seconds behind former winner [[Alberto Contador]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Contador wins Tour; Lance walks away&quot;/&gt; He was also a key rider in helping Team RadioShack win the team competition, beating Caisse D'Epargne by 9 minutes, 15 seconds.

In October, he announced the end of his international career after the [[2011 Tour Down Under|Tour Down Under]] in January 2011. He stated that after January 2011 he will only race in the U.S. with the [[Radioshack]] domestic team.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclismactu&quot;/&gt;

Armstrong announced his retirement from competitive cycling 'for good' on February 16, 2011, while still facing a US federal investigation into doping allegations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcforgood&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong Retires From Cycling&quot;/&gt;

===Physical attributes===
Armstrong has recorded [[VO2 max|an aerobic capacity]] of 83.8 mL/kg/min (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max),&lt;ref name=&quot;How Fast Could Lance Armstrong Run a Marathon?&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ: VO2 Max&quot;/&gt; much higher than the average person (40–50), but lower than some other [[Tour De France]] winners, such as [[Miguel Indurain]] (88.0, although reports exist that Indurain tested at 92–94) and [[Greg LeMond]] (92.5).&lt;ref name=&quot;VO2 Max&amp;nbsp;— a Measure of Athletic Fitness&quot;/&gt; At his peak, he had a [[heart rate|resting heart rate]] of 32–34 beats per minute (bpm) with a maximum heart rate of 201 bpm.&lt;ref name=&quot;performance&quot;/&gt;

===Collaboration of sponsors===
Armstrong revolutionized the support behind his well-funded teams, asking sponsors and suppliers to contribute and act as part of the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;CYCLING; Overhauling Lance Armstrong&quot;/&gt; For example, rather than having the frame, handlebars, and tires designed and developed by separate companies with little interaction, his teams adopted a [[Formula One]] relationship with sponsors and suppliers named &quot;F-One&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclingnews.com: Armstrong's 'F-One' group plots the hour&quot;/&gt; taking full advantage of the combined resources of several organizations working in close communication. The team, [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[AMD]], Bontrager (a Trek company), [[Shimano]], [[SRAM Corporation|Sram]], [[Giro (company)|Giro]] and [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]], collaborated for an array of products.

==Family and personal life==
Armstrong was born to Linda Gayle (née Mooneyham), a secretary, and Eddie Charles Gunderson, a route manager for ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''. His great-grandfather was the son of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancestry of Lance Armstrong&quot;/&gt; He was named after [[Lance Rentzel]], a [[Dallas Cowboys]] wide receiver. His father left his mother when Lance was two and has two other children from another relationship. His mother later married Terry Keith Armstrong, a wholesale salesman, who adopted Lance in 1974.

Armstrong met Kristin Richard in June 1997. They married on May 1, 1998 and had three children: Luke David, born October 1999, and twins Isabelle Rose and Grace Elisabeth, born November 2001. The pregnancy was possible through sperm Armstrong banked three years earlier, prior to chemotherapy and surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cancer survivor Armstrong accepts new role&quot;/&gt; The couple filed for divorce in September 2003. At Armstrong's request, his children flew in for the Tour de France podium ceremony in 2005, where Luke helped his father hoist the trophy, while his daughters (in yellow dresses) held the stuffed lion mascot and bouquet of yellow flowers.

Armstrong began dating singer-songwriter [[Sheryl Crow]] in late 2003 and revealed their relationship in January 2004. The couple announced their [[engagement]] in September 2005 and their split in February 2006.

In December 2008, Armstrong announced that his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, was pregnant with his child. The couple started dating in July 2008 after meeting through Armstrong's charity work. Although it was believed that Armstrong could no longer father children, after having undergone chemotherapy for testicular cancer, this child was conceived naturally.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;/&gt; The baby boy, Maxwell Edward Armstrong, was born in 2009 in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. Armstrong announced the birth via Twitter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wassup, world? My name is...&quot;/&gt; Armstrong has become a popular Twitter user, with 3,385,486 followers on April 10, 2012.

==History of allegations of doping==
{{main|Lance Armstrong doping allegations}}
{{Very long|section|date=October 2012}}
For much of the second phase of his career, Armstrong faced persistent allegations of doping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Index of Lance Armstrong doping allegations over the years&quot;/&gt;

Armstrong has been criticised for his disagreements with outspoken opponents of [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] such as [[Paul Kimmage]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Countdown to the Tour de France Jonathan Vaughters and his drugsfree team&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;They bust the addicts but the dealers ride on&quot;/&gt; and [[Christophe Bassons]], the only cyclist in his team to come clean of drugs during the infamous [[Festina affair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong rounds on critics over drugs storm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Bassons wrote a number of articles for a French newspaper during the 1999 Tour de France which made references to doping in the [[peloton]]. Subsequently, Armstrong had an altercation with Bassons during the 1999 Tour de France where Bassons said Armstrong rode up alongside on the Alpe d'Huez stage to tell him &quot;it was a mistake to speak out the way I (Bassons) do and he (Armstrong) asked why I was doing it. I told him that I'm thinking of the next generation of riders. Then he said 'Why don't you leave, then?'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Le coup de blues de Christophe Bassons&amp;nbsp;– l'Humanite&quot;/&gt;

Armstrong confirmed the story. On the main evening news on [[TF1]], a national television station, Armstrong said: &quot;His accusations aren't good for cycling, for his team, for me, for anybody. If he thinks cycling works like that, he's wrong and he would be better off going home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cited&quot;/&gt; Kimmage, a professional cyclist in the 1980s who later became a sports journalist, referred to Armstrong as a &quot;cancer in cycling&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline.co.uk&quot;/&gt; He also asked Armstrong questions in relation to his &quot;admiration for dopers&quot; at a press conference at the Tour of California in 2009, provoking a scathing reaction from Armstrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline.co.uk&quot;/&gt; This spat continued and is exemplified by Kimmage's articles in ''[[Irish Independent|The Irish Independent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/sport/other-sports/cycling-big-reveal-of-cancer-jesus-3266380.html Big reveal of Cancer Jesus], [[Irish Independent]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong has continually denied using illegal performance-enhancing drugs and has described himself as the most tested athlete in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pound Stunned By Attack&quot;/&gt; A 1999 urine sample showed traces of [[corticosteroid]]. A medical certificate showed he used an approved cream for [[saddle sores]] which contained the substance.&lt;ref name=&quot;velonews050823&quot;/&gt; Emma O' Reilly, Armstrong's masseuse said she heard team officials worrying about Armstrong's positive test for steroids during the Tour. She said: &quot;They were in a panic, saying: 'What are we going to do? What are we going to do?'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong, Best of His Time, Now With an Asterisk&quot;/&gt;

According to O'Reilly the solution was to get one of their compliant doctors to issue a pre-dated prescription for a steroid-based ointment to combat saddle sores. O'Reilly said she would have known if Armstrong had saddle sores as she would have administered any treatment for it. O'Reilly said that Armstrong told her: &quot;Now, Emma, you know enough to bring me down.&quot; O'Reilly said on other occasions she was asked to dispose of used syringes for Armstrong and pick up strange parcels for the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong: the whistleblowers&quot;/&gt;

From his return to cycling in the fall of 2008 through March 2009, Armstrong claims to have submitted to 24 unannounced drug tests by various anti-doping authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance to Drug Tester: Your Papers, Please&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong outraged by French misbehaviour claims&quot;/&gt;

U.S. federal prosecutors pursued allegations of doping by Armstrong from 2010–2012. The effort convened a grand jury to investigate doping charges, including taking statements under oath from Armstrong's former team members and other associates; met with officials from France, Belgium, Spain, and Italy; and requested samples from the [[Agence Française de Lutte contre le Dopage|French anti-doping agency]]. The investigation was led by federal agent [[Jeff Novitzky]], who also investigated suspicions of steroid use by baseball players [[Barry Bonds]] and [[Roger Clemens]]. The probe was terminated on February 3, 2012 with no charges filed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prosecutors close Armstrong inquiry, no charges&quot;/&gt;

===Specific allegations===
Armstrong was criticized for working with controversial trainer [[Michele Ferrari]]. Ferrari claimed that he was introduced to Lance by [[Eddy Merckx]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyclingnews&quot;/&gt; [[Greg LeMond]] described himself as &quot;devastated&quot; on hearing of them working together, while [[Tour de France]] organizer [[Jean-Marie Leblanc]] said, &quot;I am not happy the two names are mixed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;/&gt; Following Ferrari's later-overturned conviction for &quot;sporting fraud&quot; and &quot;abuse of the medical profession&quot;, Armstrong claimed he suspended his professional relationship with him, saying that he had &quot;zero tolerance for anyone convicted of using or facilitating the use of performance-enhancing drugs&quot; and denying that Ferrari had ever &quot;suggested, prescribed or provided me with any performance-enhancing drugs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline1&quot;/&gt;

Ferrari was later absolved of all charges by an Italian appeals court of the sporting fraud charges as well as charges of abusing his medical license to write prescriptions. The court stated that it overturned his conviction &quot;because the facts do not exist&quot; to support the charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.cyclingnews.com&amp;nbsp;– The World Centre of Cycling&quot;/&gt; Ferrari, however, is still banned from practicing medicine with cyclists by the Italian Cycling Federation. According to Italian law enforcement authorities, Armstrong met with Ferrari as recently as 2010 in a country outside of Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;associated&quot;/&gt;

In 2004, reporters [[Pierre Ballester]] and [[David Walsh (sports reporter)|David Walsh]] published a book alleging Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs (''[[L. A. Confidentiel]]&amp;nbsp;– Les secrets de Lance Armstrong''). Another figure in the book, Steve Swart, claims he and other riders, including Armstrong, began using drugs in 1995 while members of the Motorola team, a claim denied by other team members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stop strong-arm tactics&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2 Ex-Teammates of Cycling Star Admit Drug Use&quot;/&gt;

Allegations in the book were reprinted in the UK newspaper ''The Sunday Times'' in a story by deputy sports editor Alan English in June 2004. Armstrong sued for libel, and the paper settled out of court after a High Court judge in a pre-trial ruling stated that the article &quot;meant accusation of guilt and not simply reasonable grounds to suspect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2&quot;/&gt; The newspaper's lawyers issued the statement: &quot;The Sunday Times has confirmed to Mr. Armstrong that it never intended to accuse him of being guilty of taking any performance-enhancing drugs and sincerely apologized for any such impression.&quot; (See also William Fotheringham's July 26, 2005, article in ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong faces legal marathon&quot;/&gt;) The same authors (Pierre Ballester and David Walsh) subsequently published &quot;L.A. Official&quot; and &quot;Le Sale Tour&quot; (The Dirty Trick), further pressing their claims that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career.

On March 31, 2005, Mike Anderson filed a brief&lt;ref name=&quot;coxnewsweb&quot;/&gt; in Travis County District Court in Texas, as part of a legal battle following his termination in November 2004 as an employee of Armstrong. Anderson worked for Armstrong for two years as a personal assistant. In the brief, Anderson claimed that he discovered a box of [[androstenone]] while cleaning a bathroom in Armstrong's apartment in [[Girona]], Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Papers: Lance had steroid in home&quot;/&gt; Androstenone is not on the list of banned drugs. Anderson stated in a subsequent deposition that he had no direct knowledge of Armstrong using a banned substance. Armstrong denied the claim and issued a counter-suit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong asks Austin court to sanction his former assistant&quot;/&gt; The two men reached an out-of-court settlement in November 2005; the terms of the agreement were not disclosed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong settles lawsuit with former assistant&quot;/&gt;

In June 2006, French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported claims by Betsy and [[Frankie Andreu]] during a deposition that Armstrong had admitted using performance-enhancing drugs to his physician just after brain surgery in 1996. The Andreus' testimony was related to litigation between Armstrong and SCA Promotions, a Texas company attempting to withhold a $5-million bonus; this was settled out of court with SCA paying Armstrong and Tailwind Sports $7.5&amp;nbsp;million, to cover the $5-million bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees. The testimony stated &quot;And so the doctor asked him a few questions, not many, and then one of the questions he asked was... have you ever used any performance-enhancing drugs? And Lance said yes. And the doctor asked, what were they? And Lance said, [[growth hormone]], [[cortisone]], [[Erythropoietin|EPO]], [[steroid]]s and [[testosterone]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;npr.org&quot;/&gt;

Armstrong suggested Betsy Andreu may have been confused by possible mention of his ''post-operative treatment'' which included steroids and EPO that are taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell-destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong issues statement&quot;/&gt; The Andreus' allegation was not supported by any of the eight other people present, including Armstrong's doctor Craig Nichols,&lt;ref name=&quot;Papers charge Armstrong admitted doping&quot;/&gt; or his medical history. According to Greg LeMond (who has been [[Greg LeMond#Controversy|embroiled]] with his own disputes with Armstrong), he (LeMond) had a recorded conversation,&lt;ref name=&quot;b5z&quot;/&gt; the transcript of which was reviewed by [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), with Stephanie McIlvain (Armstrong's contact at Oakley Inc.) in which she said of Armstrong's alleged admission 'You know, I was in that room. I heard it.' However, McIlvain has contradicted LeMond allegations on the issue and denied under oath that the incident in question ever occurred in her sworn testimony.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr.org&quot;/&gt;

In July 2006, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a story on the allegations raised in the SCA case.&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot;/&gt; The report cited evidence at the trial including the results of the LNDD test and an analysis of these results by an expert witness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evidence of a banned substance?&quot;/&gt; From the ''Los Angeles Times'' article: &quot;The results, Australian researcher Michael Ashenden testified in Dallas, show Armstrong's levels rising and falling, consistent with a series of injections during the Tour. Ashenden, a paid expert retained by SCA Promotions, told arbitrators the results painted a &quot;compelling picture&quot; that the world's most famous cyclist &quot;used EPO in the '99 Tour.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trail&quot;/&gt;

Ashenden's finding were disputed by the Vrijman report, which pointed to procedural and privacy issues in dismissing the LNDD test results. The ''Los Angeles Times'' article also provided information on testimony given by Armstrong's former teammate, Swart, Andreu and his wife Betsy, and [[instant messaging]] conversation between Andreu and [[Jonathan Vaughters]] regarding blood-doping in the peloton. Vaughters signed a statement disavowing the comments and stating he had: &quot;no personal knowledge that any team in the Tour de France, including Armstrong's Discovery team in 2005, engaged in any prohibited conduct whatsoever.&quot; Andreu signed a statement affirming the conversation took place as indicated on the instant messaging logs submitted to the court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andy Shen&quot;/&gt;

The SCA trial was settled out of court, and the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported: &quot;Though no verdict or finding of facts was rendered, Armstrong called the outcome proof that the doping allegations were baseless.&quot; The ''Los Angeles Times'' article provides a review of the disputed positive EPO test, allegations and sworn testimony against Armstrong, but notes that: &quot;They are filled with conflicting testimony, hearsay and circumstantial evidence admissible in arbitration hearings but questionable in more formal legal proceedings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Andy Shen&quot;/&gt;

On May 20, 2010, former U.S. Postal teammate [[Floyd Landis]] accused Armstrong of doping in 2002 and 2003, and claimed that U.S. Postal team director Johan Bruyneel had bribed former [[UCI]] president [[Hein Verbruggen]] to keep quiet about a positive Armstrong test in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Floyd Landis puts Lance Armstrong at the centre of new drug allegations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cossins&quot;/&gt; Landis admitted there was no documentation that supports these claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landis admits doping, accuses Lance&quot;/&gt; However, in July 2010 the president of the UCI, Pat McQuaid, revealed that Armstrong made two donations to the UCI: $25,000 in 2002, used by the juniors anti-doping program, and $100,000 in 2005, to buy a blood testing machine, and documentation of those payments does exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;McQuaid reveals Armstrong made two donations to the UCI&quot;/&gt;

Landis also maintains that he witnessed Armstrong receiving multiple blood transfusions, and dispensing testosterone patches to his teammates on the United States Postal Service Team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Floyd Landis Nightline Interview&quot;/&gt; On May 25, 2010, The International Cycling Union disputed comments from Floyd Landis, &quot;Due to the controversy following the statements made by Floyd Landis, the International Cycling Union wishes to stress that none of the tests revealed the presence of EPO in the samples taken from riders at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland,&quot; the UCI said in a statement. &quot;The UCI has all the documentation to prove this fact.&quot; According to ESPN, &quot;Landis claimed that Armstrong tested positive while winning in 2002, a timeline Armstrong himself said left him 'confused,' because he did not compete in the event in 2002.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;International Cycling Union refutes Floyd Landis' claims about 2001 Tour de Suisse&quot;/&gt;

In May 2011, former Armstrong teammate [[Tyler Hamilton]] told [[CBS News]] that he and Armstrong had together taken EPO before and during the 1999, 2000, and 2001 Tours de France. Armstrong's attorney, Mark Fabiani, responded that Hamilton was lying.&lt;ref name=&quot;60minutesEPO&quot;/&gt; The accompanying ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigation alleged that two other former Armstrong teammates, [[Frankie Andreu]] and [[George Hincapie]], have told federal investigators that they witnessed Armstrong taking banned substances, including EPO, or supplied Armstrong with such substances.&lt;ref name=&quot;60minutesEPO&quot;/&gt;

Fabiani stated in response that, &quot;We have no way of knowing what happened in the grand jury and so can't comment on these anonymously sourced reports.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;associated3&quot;/&gt; Hamilton further claimed that Armstrong tested positive for EPO during the 2001 [[Tour de Suisse]]; ''60 Minutes'' reported that the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] intervened to conceal those test results, and that donations from Armstrong totaling US$125,000 may have played into said actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;60minutesEPO&quot;/&gt;

Martial Saugy, chief of the Swiss anti-doping agency, later confirmed that they found four urine samples suspicious of EPO use at the 2001 race, but said there was no &quot;positive test&quot; and claimed not to know whether the suspicious results belonged to Armstrong. As a result, Armstrong's lawyers demanded an apology from ''60 Minutes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo4&quot;/&gt; Instead of apologizing, CBS News chairman [[Jeff Fager]] said CBS News stands by its report as &quot;truthful, accurate and fair&quot;, and added that the suspicious tests which Saugy confirmed to exist have been linked to Armstrong &quot;by a number of international officials&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thewrap&quot;/&gt;

On February 2, 2012, U.S. federal prosecutors officially dropped their criminal investigation with no charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn5&quot;/&gt;

Interviewed for ''[[Hardtalk]]'' on the [[BBC]] News channel, Hamilton again insisted that he and Armstrong had routinely doped together. Dismissing the fact that Armstrong had passed numerous drug tests, Hamilton said that he himself had also passed hundreds of drug tests while doped.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube&quot;/&gt;

On October 10, 2012, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said Armstrong was part of &quot;the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen,&quot; in advance of issuing its long-awaited report detailing the evidence it acquired.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Anti-Doping Agency says evidence against Lance Armstrong is 'overwhelming' and includes testimony from 15 teammates&quot;/&gt;

===1999 Tour de France urine tests===
On August 23, 2005, ''L'Équipe'', a major French daily sports newspaper, reported on its front page under the headline &quot;le mensonge Armstrong&quot; (&quot;The Armstrong Lie&quot;) that 6 urine samples taken from the cyclist during the prologue and five stages of the [[1999 Tour de France]], frozen and stored since at &quot;Laboratoire national de dépistage du dopage de Châtenay-Malabry&quot; (LNDD), had tested positive for [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) in recent retesting conducted as part of a research project into EPO testing methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;L'EQUIPE.FR Cyclisme&amp;nbsp;– CYCLISME&amp;nbsp;– Affaire Armstrong&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP: No comment on Armstrong from US cycling, anti-doping groups&quot;/&gt;

Armstrong immediately replied on his website, saying, &quot;Unfortunately, the witch hunt continues and tomorrow's article is nothing short of tabloid journalism. The paper even admits in its own article that the science in question here is faulty and that I have no way to defend myself. They state: 'There will therefore be no counter-exam nor regulatory prosecutions, in a strict sense, since defendant's rights cannot be respected.' I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Litke: Suspicion Remains Lance's Opponent&quot;/&gt;

In October 2008, the [[AFLD]] gave Armstrong the opportunity to have samples taken during the 1998 and 1999 Tours de France retested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agency challenges Armstrong to have urine samples retested&quot;/&gt; Armstrong immediately refused, saying, &quot;the samples have not been maintained properly.&quot; Head of AFLD Pierre Bordry stated: &quot;Scientifically there is no problem to analyze these samples&amp;nbsp;– everything is correct&quot; and &quot;If the analysis is clean it would have been very good for him. But he doesn't want to do it and that's his problem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Doping boss rues Armstrong stance&quot;/&gt; However, according to the results of an investigative report by Emile Vrijman (a Dutch lawyer and the former head of the Dutch anti-doping agency, which he headed for ten years), who was appointed by the UCI to head an independent investigations into the LNDD lab's findings, it was determined that the analysis of the urine samples were conducted improperly and that they &quot;did not satisfy any standard for doping control testing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;California Western School of Law&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholten c.s. Advocaten&quot;/&gt; Vrijman's report went on to state that handling and testing of the samples fell so far short of scientific standards, and that &quot;the process that generated those results and the subsequent reports was so deficient&quot; that it was &quot;completely irresponsible&quot; to suggest that the results could &quot;constitute evidence of anything,&quot; and cleared Armstrong of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholten c.s. Advocaten&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong cleared in drug inquiry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCI report clears Armstrong&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Max2006&quot;/&gt; But WADA rejected these conclusions stating &quot;The Vrijman report is so lacking in professionalism and objectivity that it borders on farcical.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadaboss2006&quot;/&gt;

In October 2005, in response to calls from the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for an independent investigation, the UCI appointed Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the handling of urine tests by the French national anti-doping laboratory, LNDD. Vrijman was head of the Dutch anti-doping agency for ten years; since then he has worked as a defense attorney defending high-profile athletes against doping charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;California Western School of Law&quot;/&gt; Vrijman's report cleared Armstrong because of improper handling and testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong cleared in drug inquiry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCI report clears Armstrong&quot;/&gt; The report said tests on urine samples were conducted improperly and fell so short of scientific standards that it was &quot;completely irresponsible&quot; to suggest they &quot;constitute evidence of anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Max2006&quot;/&gt;

The recommendation of the commission's report was no disciplinary action against any rider on the basis of LNDD research. It also called upon the WADA and LNDD to submit themselves to an investigation by an outside independent authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholten c.s. Advocaten&quot;/&gt; The IOC Ethics Commission subsequently censured [[Dick Pound]], the President of WADA and a member of the IOC, for his statements in the media that suggested wrongdoing by Armstrong.

In April 2009, Michael Ashenden said that &quot;the LNDD absolutely had no way of knowing athlete identity from the sample they're given. They have a number on them, but that's never linked to an athlete's name. The only group that had both the number and the athlete's name is the federation, in this case it was the UCI.&quot; He added &quot;There was only two conceivable ways that synthetic [[erythropoietin|EPO]] could've gotten into those samples. One, is that Lance Armstrong used EPO during the '99 Tour. The other way it could've got in the urine was if, as Lance Armstrong seems to believe, the laboratory spiked those samples. Now, that's an extraordinary claim, and there's never ever been any evidence the laboratory has ever spiked an athlete's sample, even during the Cold War, where you would've thought there was a real political motive to frame an athlete from a different country. There's never been any suggestion that it happened.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The possibility of tampering&quot;/&gt;

Ashenden's statements are at odds with the findings of the Vrijman report. &quot;According to Mr. Ressiot, the manner in which the LNDD had structured the results table of its report&amp;nbsp;– i.e. listing the sequence of each of the batches, as well as the exact number of urine samples per batch, in the same (chronological) order as the stages of the 1999 Tour de France they were collected at&amp;nbsp;– was already sufficient to allow him to determine the exact stage these urine samples referred to and subsequently the identity of the riders who were tested at that stage.&quot; The Vrijman report also says &quot;Le Monde of July 21 and 23, 1999 reveal that the press knew the contents of original doping forms of the 1999 Tour de France&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholten c.s. Advocaten&quot;/&gt;

==USADA findings==
On August 24, 2012, the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] stripped Armstrong of all competitive results from August 1, 1998 to present. USADA also issued a lifetime ban of Armstrong from any activity or competition for which it has jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong Receives Lifetime Ban And Disqualification Of Competitive Results For Doping Violations Stemming From His Involvement In The United States Postal Service Pro-Cycling Team Doping Conspiracy&quot;/&gt;

Three days later, Armstrong, while publicly maintaining his innocence, decided to not officially challenge the USADA sanctions. In a statement, Armstrong said that the USADA had engaged in &quot;an unconstitutional witch hunt&quot; based on &quot;outlandish and heinous claims.&quot; He added that he would have been more than willing to fight the charges, what he described as USADA's &quot;one-sided and unfair&quot; arbitration process was not worth the toll on his foundation and his family. &quot;There comes a point in every man's life when he has to say, 'Enough is enough.'&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;For me, that time is now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTdropsfight&quot;/&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that, &quot;according to the WADA Code&quot;, Armstrong's failure to contest such serious charges of anti-doping rules violations means that he forfeits all awards and prizes earned after August 1, 1998, including his Tour titles, and is banned from any sport that uses the World Anti-Doping Code.&lt;ref name=NYTdropsfight/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WADA Code Article 8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;indiatimes2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong Receives Lifetime Ban And Disqualification Of Competitive Results For Doping Violations Stemming From His Involvement In The United States Postal Service Pro-Cycling Team Doping Conspiracy6&quot;/&gt;

===Activity prior to August decision===
In June 2012, USADA accused Armstrong of doping and trafficking of drugs, based on blood samples from 2009 and 2010, and testimonies from other cyclists. Armstrong, denying all doping use in a statement,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong: US Anti-Doping Agency charges 'spiteful'&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong statement regarding USADA Charges&quot;/&gt; was suspended from competition in cycling and triathlon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong charged with doping by USADA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USADA levels doping charges at Armstrong&quot;/&gt; Armstrong was charged in a letter from USADA, along with five others including former team manager [[Johan Bruyneel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Letter from USADA to Lance Armstrong, Johan Bruyneel, Dr Pedro Celaya, Dr Luis Garcia del Moral, Pepe Marti, and Dr Michele Ferrari&quot;/&gt; USADA says Armstrong used banned substances, including the blood-booster EPO and steroids, as well as blood transfusions dating back to 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCIasksUSADA2012&quot;/&gt;

On July 9, 2012, Armstrong filed a lawsuit in federal court in [[Austin, Texas]] against USADA. U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks threw out Armstrong's 80-page complaint later the same day on the grounds that Armstrong's complaint was too long, and characterized more by a desire for publicity and self-aggrandizement than a presentation of the facts, commenting, that Federal Rules of Civil Procedure &quot;demand a short and plain statement of detailed facts, not a mechanical recital of boilerplate allegations, nor...a lengthy and bitter polemic against the named defendants.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Judge dismisses Lance Armstrong's suit, says he can refile&quot;/&gt;

The following day, Armstrong filed a revised lawsuit against the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, once again asking to stop the agency from stripping his seven Tour de France titles and banning him from sport for life if he fails to submit to arbitration over alleged doping violations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong refiles USADA suit; team members decline arbitration, receive lifetime bans&quot;/&gt; Also on July 10, USADA announced lifetime bans against three of his former U.S. Postal Service cycling team associates: [[Luis Garcia del Moral]], a team doctor, [[Michele Ferrari]], a consulting doctor, and Jose &quot;Pepe&quot; Marti, team trainer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michele Ferrari, Pepe Marti and Luis Garcia del Moral receive lifetime bans&quot;/&gt;

Armstrong's lawsuit claimed that USADA did not have jurisdiction and that his right to due process was being violated. U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks issued his ruling on August 20, 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Motion to dismiss-Case 1:12-cv-00606-SS&quot;/&gt; He ruled in favor of USADA. However he questioned the timing and motivation of USADA's investigation of Armstrong, and their apparent &quot;single minded determination to force Armstrong to arbitrate&quot; but also noting &quot;in direct conflict with UCI's equally evident desire not to proceed against him&quot;. Applying [[rational basis review]] to the [[Federal Arbitration Act]], the [[Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act|Stevens Amateur Sports Act]], and various governing documents of USADA, USOC, and U.S. Cycling, Sparks upheld USADA's authority to investigate Armstrong and initiate arbitration against him, and that Armstrong's right to due process could not be violated by USADA before any proceedings had actually occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas judge dismisses Lance Armstrong case against USADA&quot;/&gt;

===UCI response===
The UCI, the sport's ruling body, requested on August 24, 2012 a &quot;reasoned decision&quot; from USADA, explaining why USADA thinks the UCI should strip Armstrong of his titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Release: UCI's statement on Lance Armstrong's decision&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong: USADA will reveal doping evidence&quot;/&gt; On October 10, USADA published the details of its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Anti Doping Agency|title=REPORT ON PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE WORLD ANTI-DOPING CODE  AND THE USADA PROTOCOL  UNITED STATES ANTI-DOPING AGENCY,  Claimant,  v.

He deserves to be forgotten.&quot;&lt;ref name=BBC-UCI /&gt;

A day after the UCI decision, Armstrong deleted references to his Tour wins from his [[Twitter]] biography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-cycling-doping-armstrong-twitter-idUSBRE89M0DQ20121023 Armstrong deletes Tour wins reference in Twitter bio (Reuters)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other reactions===
* The [[French Cycling Federation]] (FFC) issued a statement in support of the USADA decision, stating that &quot;Armstrong's refusal to contest USADA's accusations sounds like an admission of his guilt with regards to breaches of anti-doping regulation.&quot; The FFC wants the vacated positions to not be reassigned. The FFC also announced they want &quot;...reimbursement of Lance Armstrong's prizes obtained during the Tour de France and other competitions for an amount assessed at 2.95 million Euros for the development of cycling among the youth and the prevention of doping.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;French Cycling Federation praises USADA's actions in Armstrong case&quot;/&gt;

* The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA)'s official statement indicates that it also awaits delivery of the USADA decision before making any comment on the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;WADA statement on Lance Armstrong's decision not to seek arbitration&quot;/&gt; The president of the WADA, John Fahey, believes Armstrong's decision not to appeal USADA pursuant to its process indicates there was &quot;substance to those charges&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong's record will be 'obliterated' says WADA chief&quot;/&gt;

* Armstrong resigned as director of the [[Lance Armstrong Foundation]] and was dropped by sponsors [[RadioShack]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Nike Drops Lance Armstrong&quot;/&gt; and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] on 17 October 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong dropped by Nike over doping evidence&quot;/&gt; [[Anheuser-Busch]] the same day said it would not renew its relationship with Armstrong at the end of 2012, but will continue to support the racer's cancer charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anheuser-Busch follows Nike in dropping Armstrong sponsorship&quot;/&gt;

==Outside of cycling==
In 1997, Armstrong founded the [[Lance Armstrong Foundation]], which supports people affected by cancer. The foundation raises awareness of cancer and has raised&lt;ref name=&quot;It's not about the lab rats&quot;/&gt; more than $325&amp;nbsp;million from the sale of yellow Livestrong bracelets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doping scandal may hurt Lance Armstrong foundation&quot;/&gt; During his first retirement beginning after the 2005 season, he also maintained other interests. He was the [[List of Indianapolis 500 pace cars|pace car driver]] of the [[Chevrolet Corvette C6#Z06|Chevrolet Corvette Z06]] for the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]].

In 2007, Armstrong with [[Andre Agassi]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Warrick Dunn]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Mia Hamm]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Andrea Jaeger]], [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]], [[Mario Lemieux]], [[Alonzo Mourning]], and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] founded [[Athletes for Hope]], a charity that helps professional athletes become involved in charitable causes and aims to inspire non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Athletes for Hope&quot;/&gt;

In August 2009, Armstrong headlined the inaugural charity ride &quot;Pelotonia&quot; in Columbus, Ohio, riding over 100 miles on Saturday with the large group of cyclists. He addressed the riders the Friday evening before the two-day ride and helped the ride raise millions for cancer research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cyclists hit the streets for second Pelotonia Tour&quot;/&gt;

===Marathons===
Armstrong ran the 2006 [[New York City Marathon]] with two friends. With Nike, he assembled a pace team of [[Alberto Salazar]], [[Joan Benoit Samuelson]], and [[Hicham El Guerrouj]] to help him reach 3 hours. He finished in 2h 59m 36s, in 856th place. He said the race was extremely difficult compared to the Tour de France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong: A Classic Case of Too Much, Too Soon?&quot;/&gt; The NYC Marathon had a dedicated camera on Armstrong throughout the event which, according to Armstrong, pushed him to continue through points in which he would have normally &quot;stopped and stretched&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thefinalsprint&quot;/&gt; He also helped raise $600,000 for his [[LiveStrong]] campaign during the run.

Armstrong ran the 2007 NYC Marathon in 2h 46m 43s, finishing 232nd.&lt;ref name=&quot;Results&amp;nbsp;– The ING New York City Marathon&quot;/&gt; On April 21, 2008, he ran the [[Boston Marathon]] in 2h 50m 58s, finishing in the top 500.&lt;ref name=&quot;No pedals, he showed his mettle&quot;/&gt;

===Triathlon===
Armstrong made his return to triathlon in the inaugural Ironman 70.3 Panama race, on February 12, 2012. He raced in the professional category, finishing with a time of 3:50:55, second overall to Bevan Docherty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Docherty steals victory from Lance Armstrong&quot;/&gt; Armstrong's splits were 19:22 for the 1.2-mile swim, 2:10:18 for the 56-mile bike ride, and 1:17:01 for the run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong7&quot;/&gt; He also entered half-Ironman distance races in Texas (7th)&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong surrenders lead, finishes seventh in Memorial Hermann Ironman 70.3 Texas triathlon&quot;/&gt; and St. Croix (3rd)&lt;ref name=&quot;Potts And Naeth Win Ironman 70.3 St. Croix, Armstrong Third&quot;/&gt; before breaking through with victories at Ironman 70.3 Florida and Ironman 70.3 Hawaii in overall times of 3:45:38&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance Armstrong wins Ironman 70.3 in Florida&quot;/&gt; and 3:50:58,&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong, Corbin Set Course Records At 70.3 Hawaii&quot;/&gt; respectively.

==Politics==
[[File:President George Bush and 2005 Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong take a ride together.jpg|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] and Armstrong mountain biking at the president's [[Prairie Chapel Ranch]].]]

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', teammate [[George Hincapie]] hinted that Armstrong would run for [[Governor of Texas]] after cycling. In the July 2005 issue of ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine, Armstrong hinted at running for governor, although &quot;not in '06&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breaking Away&quot;/&gt; Armstrong and former president [[George W. Bush]], a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and fellow Texan, call themselves friends. Bush called Armstrong in France to congratulate him after his 2005 victory in August 2005, ''[[The Times]]'' reported the President had invited Armstrong to his [[Prairie Chapel Ranch]] to go [[mountain biking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Can this bike ride be Bush's tour de force?&quot;/&gt; In a 2003 interview with ''[[The Observer]]'', Armstrong said: &quot;He's a personal friend, but we've all got the right not to agree with our friends.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Serena got the message, now it's Lance's turn as French cheers become jeers for US stars&quot;/&gt;

In August 2005, Armstrong hinted he had changed his mind about politics. In an interview with [[Charlie Rose]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] on August 1, 2005, Armstrong pointed out that running for governor would require the commitment that led him to retire from cycling. Also, in August 2005, Armstrong said that he was no longer considering politics:

{{quote|The biggest problem with politics or running for the governor—the governor's race here in Austin or in Texas—is that it would mimic exactly what I've done: a ton of stress and a ton of time away from my kids. Why would I want to go from pro cycling, which is stressful and a lot of time away, straight into politics?|&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong rules out political career... for now&quot;/&gt;}}

Armstrong was co-chair of a California campaign committee to pass the [[California Cancer Research Act]], a ballot measure defeated by California voters on June 5, 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCRA Leadership Team&quot;/&gt; Had it passed, the measure was projected to generate over $500 million annually for cancer research, smoking-cessation programs and tobacco law-enforcement by levying a $1-per-pack tax on tobacco products in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prop 29&amp;nbsp;– The California Cancer Research Act&quot;/&gt;
