The '''2008 World Series''' was the 104th [[World Series]] between the [[American League|American]] and [[National League]]s for the championship of [[Major League Baseball]]. The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] as [[2008 National League Championship Series|champions of the National League]] and the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], as [[2008 American League Championship Series|American League champions]], competed to win four games out of a possible seven.

The Series began on Wednesday, October 22, and (after weather delays had postponed the end of Game 5) concluded the following Wednesday, October 29. The American League's 4–3 win in the [[2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2008 All-Star Game]] gave the Rays [[Home advantage|home field advantage]] for the series, meaning no more than three games would be played at the Phillies' stadium, [[Citizens Bank Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Associated Press|authorlink= Associated Press|title= Young caps marathon goodbye to Yankee Stadium with sac fly in 15th|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280715131|publisher= [[ESPN.com]]|date= 2008-07-15|accessdate=2008-09-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080914102247/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280715131| archivedate= 14 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phillies won their second championship in their 126-year history, taking the series four games to one and brought the city of Philadelphia a championship after [[1983 NBA Finals|25 year]]s.&lt;ref name=Octoberphest&gt;{{cite news |first= Ken|last= Mandel|title=Octoberphest!

The Philadelphia Phillies advanced to the World Series after defeating the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the National League's [[2008 National League Division Series|Divisional]] and [[2008 National League Championship Series|Championship Series]], respectively. The team won its position in the [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] after its second consecutive [[National League East]] title. This was the Phillies' first World Series appearance in fifteen years. The Tampa Bay Rays advanced to the World Series after defeating the [[Chicago White Sox]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the American League's [[2008 American League Division Series|Division]] and [[2008 American League Championship Series|Championship Series]], respectively. The team earned its first trip to the postseason in franchise history after winning the [[American League East]] title, only one season after finishing in last place. Since each team had come first in its respective division during the [[Major League Baseball schedule|regular season]], this was the first Series since 2001 without a [[Major League Baseball#Postseason|wild-card team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;postseasonbref&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldAlmanac&quot;/&gt;

The Philadelphia Phillies scored the first runs of the Series when [[Chase Utley]] hit a [[home run]] with [[Jayson Werth]] on base in the top of the first inning. The Phillies loaded the bases in the second inning, but were unable to score when [[Shane Victorino]] was thrown out at home plate by [[B. J. Upton]]. The Tampa Bay Rays loaded the bases in the bottom of the third inning; however, Upton grounded into an inning-ending [[double play]] and the score remained 2–0. The Phillies extended their lead when [[Carlos Ruiz (baseball)|Carlos Ruiz]] batted in Victorino in the fourth inning. In the bottom of the inning, a solo home run from [[Carl Crawford]] pulled the Rays within two runs. The Rays added their second run the following inning when a double by [[Akinori Iwamura]] scored [[Jason Bartlett (baseball)|Jason Bartlett]].

After the game was suspended, umpiring crew chief [[Tim Tschida]] told reporters that he and his crew ordered the players off the field because the wind and rain threatened to make the game &quot;comical.&quot;&lt;ref name=ESPNdel&gt;{{cite news |first= Gene|last= Wojciechowski|title= Selig made correct call in suspending Game 5|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=3668142&amp;sportCat=mlb|publisher= ESPN.com|date= 2008-10-27|accessdate=2008-10-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081031103756/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=3668142&amp;sportCat=mlb| archivedate= 31 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chase Utley agreed, saying that by the middle of the sixth inning, &quot;the infield was basically underwater.&quot;&lt;ref name=ESPNdel/&gt; Rain continued to fall in Philadelphia on Tuesday, further postponing the game to Wednesday, October 29.

The game resumed with the Phillies batting in the bottom of the sixth inning. Pinch hitter [[Geoff Jenkins]] led off with a double and was bunted to third by Rollins. Jayson Werth then batted in Jenkins to take the lead for the Phillies, 3–2. In the top of the seventh inning, Rocco Baldelli re-tied the game at three runs with a solo home run.

Eric Bruntlett, pinch-running for Burrell, scored on a single by Pedro Feliz to put the Phillies up by a run again, 4–3. In the top of the ninth, [[Brad Lidge]] gave up a single and a stolen base, but was able to strike out [[Eric Hinske]] to win the World Series for the Phillies.&lt;ref name=Octoberphest/&gt;

====Implications of the suspension====
[[File:2008 world series rain delay.JPG|thumb|right|The grounds crew covers the field with a tarpaulin during the Game 5 rain delay.]]
Under normal conditions, games are considered to be official games after five innings, or four and a half if the home team is leading at that point. However, post-season games are operated by the [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner's]] Office, thus are subject to the Commissioner's discretion of how to handle the scheduling of the games.&lt;ref name=delay/&gt; So, with rain in the forecast for Philadelphia, Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] informed both the Rays and the Phillies management before the game began that a team would not be allowed to clinch the Series in a rain-shortened game.&lt;ref name=delay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Larry|last= Fine|coauthors= John O'Brien|title= Suspension leaves World Series in the balance|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUSN2646794520081028?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=sportsNews&amp;sp=true|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date= 2008-10-28|accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the rainfall, Game 5 was suspended after the top of the sixth inning. Rain continued to fall in Philadelphia on Tuesday, October 28, and the game ultimately resumed on Wednesday, October 29, at Citizens Bank Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Bryan|last= Hoch|url= http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081028&amp;content_id=3650918&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title= Game 5 will not resume on Tuesday|date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2008-10-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029181417/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081028&amp;content_id=3650918&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb| archivedate= 29 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official MLB records will show that even though the game was finished on October 29, the game was officially played two days earlier, and was completed on that date.

This was the first game in World Series history to be [[suspended game|suspended]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081028&amp;content_id=3650971&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb | title=FAQs on the suspended Game 5 | accessdate=2008-10-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029181422/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081028&amp;content_id=3650971&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb| archivedate= 29 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been three [[Tie (draw)|tied games]] in the history of the World Series: [[1907 World Series|1907]], [[1912 World Series|1912]], and [[1922 World Series|1922]], all of them called due to darkness. In general, no ties would be needed under modern rules, which provide for suspension of a tied game and resumption of it at the next possible date. Weather has caused numerous delays and postponements in Series history (notable postponements beforehand coming in 1911, 1962, 1975, 1986, 1996 and 2006), but never any suspended games before 2008.

Although not officially a suspended game, the most notorious postponement of a World Series due to natural events was the [[1989 World Series]] in which the start of Game 3 was delayed ten days, the longest in World Series history, due to the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] striking the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Several Nevada sports betting agencies treated the suspended game as a completed game and a win for the Phillies on Monday, October 27. Under Nevada house rules, the final score of a baseball game is determined by reverting to the last completed full inning, and the Phillies led 2–1 at the end of the fifth inning. Game 5 side bets on Philadelphia were paid off while bets on totals and [[sports betting#Types of bets|run-line bets]] were refunded.&lt;ref name=&quot;vegas&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lvrj.com/sports/33433179.html | title= Sports books pay as if Phillies won | accessdate=2008-10-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029073327/http://www.lvrj.com/sports/33433179.html| archivedate= 29 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the following offseason, Selig's interpretation of the rules became codified, as the 30 Major League Baseball club owners approved a rule change stipulating that all &quot;postseason games and games added to the regular season to determine qualifiers for the postseason&quot; become [[suspended game]]s if they are called before nine innings are played, regardless of whether the game would otherwise qualify as an [[official game]], or the score at the time the game is called. The game is resumed when conditions permit at the same location from the point of suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090115&amp;content_id=3745318&amp;vkey=pr_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Ownership approves two major rules amendments|date=2009-01-15|work=MLB.com|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=2009-02-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090121182633/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090115&amp;content_id=3745318&amp;vkey=pr_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb| archivedate= 21 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Harry Kalas, this series brought together a father and son calling the series for different teams, with his son, [[Todd Kalas|Todd]], calling the Series in English for the Rays.&lt;ref name=KalasFamily&gt;{{cite news|title=In 78 Minutes, Not Much to See or Say|date=October 30, 2008|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|newspaper=New York Times|page=B17|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/sports/baseball/30sandomir.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print| accessdate= 14 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For international viewers, MLB International televised the game with commentators [[Rick Sutcliffe]] and [[Dave O'Brien (sportscaster)|Dave O'Brien]]. This feed was also carried to U.S. service personnel stationed around the globe via the [[American Forces Network]].

Game 1 was watched by 10.1&amp;nbsp;million viewers in the United States; Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] stated he was satisfied with the ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Barry M.|last= Bloom|title= Selig pleased with Game 1 ratings|url= http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081023&amp;content_id=3640727&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;partnerId=rss_mlb|publisher= MLB.com|date= 2008-10-23|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall viewership was 25% lower than the previous World Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Barry M.|last= Bloom|title= Game 4 draws Series' highest ratings|url= http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081027&amp;content_id=3649354&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|publisher= MLB.com|date= 2008-10-27|accessdate=2008-10-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081031063747/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081027&amp;content_id=3649354&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb| archivedate= 31 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall national [[Nielsen rating]] for the five games was 8.4, tied with the [[2010 World Series]] for the event's lowest-ever TV rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wstv.shtml World Series Television Ratings Breakdown]&lt;/ref&gt;

This World Series win had significance for McCarver and Harry Kalas. Both were Phillies broadcasters in {{wsy|1980}}, but neither one could call the final out.&lt;ref name=HarryKalasAndMcCarver&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2010|pages=169&amp;ndash;173}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarver was a backup commentator for ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'' on [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]], but he was not part of the broadcast team that called the final out.&lt;ref name=HarryKalasAndMcCarver/&gt; For Kalas, MLB radio-broadcasting regulations forbade local stations from producing live coverage of World Series games, instead forcing them to air the national [[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]] feed of the games.&lt;ref name=KalasFamily/&gt; Philadelphia fans were so outraged about this afterward that they started a letter-writing campaign to the [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner's Office]], demanding a change to the rule. The [[1981 World Series|following year]], MLB amended its broadcasting contracts to allow World Series teams' flagship radio stations to air the games with local announcers, due at least in part to this outcry from Philadelphia fans.&lt;ref name=HarryKalasAndMcCarver/&gt; In 2008, both called the Phillies' World Series win.

==Umpiring==

In Game 2, home plate umpire [[Kerwin Danley]] appealed a call to the first base umpire after calling strike three; the first base umpire called ball four to award the Rays' [[Rocco Baldelli]] a walk. Baldelli indicated that the calls did not come up in the locker room, and he did not believe they had an effect on the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Umpires in Spotlight For the Wrong Reasons |last=Robinson |first=Joshua |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/sports/baseball/28baseball.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;oref=slogin |date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2008-11-01|newspaper=New York Times| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081030015030/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/sports/baseball/28baseball.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;oref=slogin| archivedate= 30 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Game 3, Phillies' pitcher [[Jamie Moyer]] threw the ball to [[Ryan Howard]] to force out the Rays' [[Carl Crawford]] at first base, despite umpire [[Tom Hallion]] calling Crawford safe in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Not Blind, but Human&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3667915&amp;type=story |title=Umpires admit second missed World Series call in as many games |author=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Game 4, [[Evan Longoria]] tagged Rollins at third base, though umpire [[Tim Welke]] had ruled Rollins safe.

The Phillies' second World Series championship brought about a series of firsts, not just for them, but for Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=Octoberphest/&gt; In winning their first championship since {{wsy|1980}}, the Phillies brought the city of [[Sports in Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] its first major professional sports championship since the [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]] swept the [[1983 NBA Finals]].&lt;ref name=Octoberphest/&gt;

In summing up the firsts and given how long the city's sports fans have waited, Phillies President [[David Montgomery (baseball)|David Montgomery]] said that &quot;our first name is Philadelphia,&quot; and he and manager [[Charlie Manuel]] dedicated the championship to the city of Philadelphia and the fans.&lt;ref name=Octoberphest/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Video&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?mid=200810293653581|title=Phillies receive trophy|date=October 29, 2008|accessdate=February 19, 2011|work=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel also dedicated the championship to his mother, who died on the day of Game 2 of the [[2008 National League Championship Series|NLCS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrilla in Phila: Game 5 unforgettable|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081029&amp;content_id=3653812&amp;vkey=news_phi&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=phi|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=February 21, 2011|first=Mark|last=Newman|work=MLB.com|publisher=phillies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Sheridan of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' said that the 25 years without a championship &quot;helped define this city as a sports town for way too long.

Maybe this championship will turn the vinegar back into wine,&quot;&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt; and said that the fans &quot;waited forever and a day.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sheridan/&gt;

On [[Halloween]], October 31, approximately two million lined [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] for a ticker-tape parade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=Some in the news media guessed two million, about the same number long tied to Flyers parades in '[[1974 Stanley Cup Finals|74]] and '[[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|75]], and more than the current population of Philly.|title=A party for, oh, 2 million of their closest friends|date=November 1, 2008|first=Derrick|last=Nunnally|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=F2}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest gathering for a championship parade in Philadelphia since the [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]] won the [[1974 Stanley Cup Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=In the annals of Philadelphia sports parades, the biggest crowd turned out for the 1974 celebration of the Flyers' Stanley Cup.

In 2010, Philadelphia sports fans picked both of the Phillies' World Series wins as the two greatest moments in Philadelphia sports, picking the 2008 championship as the greatest moment.&lt;ref name=GreatestMoments&gt;{{cite news|title=Fans pick 2008 World Series as top Philadelphia sports moment|date=May 6, 2010|first=Mark|last=Kram|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News|url=http://articles.philly.com/2010-05-06/news/24959019_1_philadelphia-fans-philadelphia-sports-phillies| accessdate= 4 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phillies returned to the World Series in {{wsy|2009}}, the first defending champion to return to the Series since the [[2001 New York Yankees season|2001 New York Yankees]]. During [[2009 Major League Baseball season|that season]] they finished first in the National League East with a 93–69 mark, and eliminated the [[2009 Colorado Rockies season|Rockies]] and the [[2009 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] in the NL playoffs. They would lose to the Yankees in six games.

===Rays===
For the Rays, at the same time the ticker-tape parade went down Broad Street in Philadelphia, thousands of Rays' fans attended a rally at Straub Park in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], celebrating their 2008 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;RaysRally&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081031&amp;content_id=3658769&amp;vkey=news_tb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tb|title=Rays' fans celebrate at rally|date=October 31, 2008|accessdate=March 4, 2011|first=Brittany|last=Ghiroli|work=TampabayRays.MLB.com|publisher=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayor [[Rick Baker (mayor)|Rick Baker]] said that the rally &quot;really needed to be done. There was so much demand in the community. They didn't win the World Series but they won the AL. And we want to celebrate that and thank them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RaysRally&quot;/&gt; He and Tampa Mayor [[Pam Iorio]] addressed the fans during the rally.&lt;ref name=&quot;RaysRally&quot;/&gt;

Though the Rays missed the playoffs in 2009, they earned a winning record of 84–78, placing them third behind the Red Sox and eventual champion Yankees.
