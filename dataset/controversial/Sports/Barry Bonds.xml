Bonds' salary for the 2005 season was $22 million, the second-highest salary in Major League Baseball (the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]' [[Alex Rodriguez]] earned the highest, $25.2 million).&lt;ref name=BRSalaries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_salaries.shtml|title=Highest Career Total and Single-Season Salaries|accessdate=2007-09-29|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference, Inc.|date=2007-09-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070929153252/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_salaries.shtml| archivedate= 29 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bonds endured a knee injury, multiple surgeries, and rehabilitation. He was activated on September 12 and started in left field.

====2006 season====
[[File:Barry Bonds3.jpg|thumb|Bonds batting against the Chicago Cubs in 2006]]
In 2006, Bonds earned $20 million (not including bonuses), the fourth highest salary in baseball. Through the 2006 season he had earned approximately $172 million during his then 21-year career, making him baseball's all-time highest paid player.&lt;ref name=BRSalaries/&gt; Bonds hit under .200 for his first 10 games of the season and did not hit a home run until April 22.

On September 22, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career home run record of 733. The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10–8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the Brewers' [[Chris Spurling]] with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, Bonds' home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13–12, despite Bonds' going 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260922108|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=2006-09-22|title=Bonds ties Aaron's NL HR mark, but Giants fall to Brewers|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, Bonds surpassed Aaron for the NL career home run record. Hit in Milwaukee like the previous one, this was a solo home run off [[Chris Capuano]] of the Brewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260923108|accessdate=2007-07-02|date=2006-09-23|title=Bonds hits NL-record 734th HR, but Giants lose again|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last home run Bonds hit in 2006. In 2006, Bonds recorded his lowest [[slugging percentage]] (a statistic that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since 1991 with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

Bonds resumed his march to the all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately followed by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=270403126|title=San Diego 7, San Francisco 0 (recap)|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=[[Yahoo!

===BALCO scandal===
[[File:Barry bonds mug shot 1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Mug shot taken after 2007 indictment]]
Since 2003, Bonds has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative ([[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]]) scandal. He was under investigation by a federal [[grand jury]] regarding his testimony in the BALCO case, and was indicted on [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] charges on November 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2003, Bonds first became embroiled in a scandal when [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] of the [[BALCO|Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO), Bonds' trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and charged with supplying [[anabolic steroids]] to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet and legitimate supplements.&lt;ref name=Bttsdw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594|title=Bonds testified that substances didn't work|accessdate=2008-02-20|date=2004-12-04|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080120163542/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594| archivedate= 20 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During grand jury testimony on December 4, 2003,&lt;ref name=BlEg2yip/&gt; Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, Greg Anderson, who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/12/03/MNGGFA0UDU65.DTL|title=What Bonds told BALCO grand jury|date=2004-12-03|accessdate=2007-10-10|publisher=[[Hearst Communications Inc.]]|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Williams, Lance, Mark Fainaru-Wada| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071118085803/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/12/03/MNGGFA0UDU65.DTL| archivedate= 18 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This testimony, as reported by [[Lance Williams]] and [[Mark Fainaru-Wada]], has frequently been misrepresented.

===Perjury investigation and federal indictment===
{{main|Barry Bonds perjury case}}
On November 15, 2007, Bonds was indicted on four counts of [[perjury]] and one count of [[obstruction of justice]] as it relates to the government investigation of BALCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7097583.stm|title=Baseball star Barry Bonds charged|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2008-02-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080226225527/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7097583.stm| archivedate= 26 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2008 a [[typo]] in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November, 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run.

Bonds withdrew from the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]]'s (MLBPA) [[license|licensing]] agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him.

In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with Bonds. For this reason he does not appear in some baseball [[video games]], forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him.

==Career distinctions==
Besides holding Major League career records in home runs (762), walks (2,558), and intentional walks (688), at the time of his retirement, Bonds also led all active players in RBI (1,996), [[on-base percentage]] (.444), runs (2,227), games (2,986), extra-base hits (1,440), at-bats per home run (12.92), and [[total bases]] (5,976). He is 2nd in doubles (601), slugging percentage (.607), stolen bases (514), at-bats (9,847), and hits (2,935), 6th in triples (77), 8th in sacrifice flies (91), and 9th in [[strikeout]]s (1,539), through September 26, 2007.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

Bonds is the lone member of the 500–500 club, which means he has hit at least 500 home runs (762) and stolen 500 bases (514). He is also one of only four baseball players all-time to be in the 40–40 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season; the other members are [[José Canseco]], [[Alex Rodriguez]] and [[Alfonso Soriano]].
