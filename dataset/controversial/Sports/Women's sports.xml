{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women's sports''' include amateur and professional competitions in virtually all [[sports]]. Female participation in sports rose dramatically in the twentieth century, especially in the last quarter, reflecting changes in modern societies that emphasized gender parity. Although the level of participation and performance still varies greatly by country and by sport, [[women]]'s sports have broad acceptance throughout the world, and in a few instances, such as [[tennis]] and [[figure skating]], rival or exceed their male counterparts in popularity. An important aspect about women's sports is that women usually do not compete on equal terms against men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsscientists.com/2010/04/let-male-and-female-compete-together.html/ ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient civilizations===
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
In the [[ancient Olympic Games]], women were not allowed even to watch competitions, much less compete as athletes. However, [[Cynisca]] won an Olympic game as owner of a chariot (champions of chariot races were owners not riders), as did Euruleonis, [[Belistiche]], Timareta, Theodota, and Cassia.  Besides the Olympics there was a separate women's athletic event, the [[Heraea Games]], held in ancient Greece.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Few women competed in sports until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as social changes in Europe and North America favored increased female participation in society as equals with men. Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. There was often disapproval of those who did.

&quot;Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.&quot; [[Susan B. Anthony]] said &quot;I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance.&quot;

The modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men.  Concern over the physical strength and stamina of women led to the discouragement of female participation in more physically intensive sports, and in some cases led to less physically demanding female versions of male sports.  Thus [[netball]] was developed out of [[basketball]] and [[softball]] out of [[baseball]].

Most early women's professional sports leagues foundered.  This is often attributed to a lack of spectator support.  Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Women's rights in sports are very important because even though women today enjoy their freedom playing sports, there were women that worked hard to gain that freedom for women who have a passion for sports now. There are many examples of the restrictions women had for playing sports during the 1900s. One example is when Senda Berenson, a gymnastics instructor and P.E. teacher at an all-girls school,that wanted to allow her girls to play basketball, since it was a newly-created sport. Senda wondered about this at the time that women could only play certain sports if they were in clubs.

The rise of women playing sports began during World War I and World War II. This issue impacted the society at the time because most people believed that women should not take part in any type of sport or physical activity, because women were portrayed as inferior to men. But even though many people were against it at the time; women gained the right to play more physical sports.

==Title IX==

===Implementation and Regulation===
In 1972 women's sports in the United States got a boost when the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Title IX legislation. Title IX prohibits gender discrimination in schools that receive federal funds through grants, scholarships, or other support for students. The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coakley|first=Jay|title=Sports in Society|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, the difficulty with Title IX is making sure schools are compliant with the law. In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the &quot;three-part test&quot;. 
# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and                                     women are &quot;substantially proportionate&quot; to their respective undergraduate enrollment.
# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of   program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).
# Accommodating the interest and ability of underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.
Although schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, many schools have not managed to achieve equity. Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong, however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irons|first=Alicia|title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX|journal=Major Themes in Economics|year=2006|month=Spring|url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX. To be considered compliant with Title IX, athletic departments simply need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title IX Information|url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on women's sports===
The main purpose of Title IX was to bring equality between the sexes in educational institutions. However, Title IX is most commonly associated with its impact on athletics and more specifically the impact it has had on women's participation in athletics at every age. Today there are more females participating in athletics than ever before. As of the 2007-2008 school year, females made up 41% of the participants in college athletics.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Title IX Athletic Statistics|url=http://www.aauw.org/act/laf/library/athleticStatistics.cfm|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see the growth of women's sports just look at the difference in participation before the passing of Title IX and today. In 1971-1972 there were 294,015 females participating in high school athletics and in 2007-2008 there were over three million females participating, meaning there has been a 940% increase in female participation in high school athletics.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; In 1971-1972 there were 29,972 females participating in college athletics and in 2007-2008 there were 166,728 females participating, that is a 456% increase in female participation in college athletics.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; More females are getting involved and finding a love and passion for sports that were once seen as something for men. Increased participation in sports has had direct effects on other areas of women's lives. These effects can be seen in women's education and employment later on in life; a recent study found that the changes set in motion by Title IX explained about 20 percent of the increase in women’s education and about 40 percent of the rise in employment for 25-to-34-year-old women.&lt;ref name=&quot;parker1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker-Pope|first=Tara|title=As Girls Become Women, Sports Pay Dividends|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/health/16well.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2012|date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that all women who are successful later on in life played sports, but it is saying that women who did participate in athletics received benefits in their education and employment later on in life.&lt;ref name=&quot;parker1&quot;/&gt;

=={{anchor|The Battle for Equality}}The Battle for Equality==
&lt;!-- [[Gender and sport]] redirects here. The anchor insulates against section title changes, please do not remove it. --&gt;
Today, the battle for equality between men's and women's sports rages on.  Women make up 54% of enrollment at 832 schools that responded to an NCAA gender equity study in 2000, however, females at these institutions only account for 41% of the athletes. This violates Title IX's premise that the ratio of female athletes to male athletes should be roughly equivalent to the overall proportion of female and male students.&lt;ref name=&quot;garber1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Garber|first=Greg|title=Landmark law faces new challenges even now|url=http://espn.go.com/gen/womenandsports/020619title9.html|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the issues today often revolve around the amount of money going into men and women's sports. According to 2000-2001 figures, men's college programs still have many advantages over women's in the average number of scholarships (60.5%), operating expenses (64.5%), recruiting expenses (68.2%) and head coaching salaries (59.5%).&lt;ref name=&quot;garber1&quot;/&gt; Other forms of inequality are in the coaching positions. Before Title IX, women coached 90% of women's teams, in 1978 that percentage dropped to 58, and in 2004 it dropped even more to 44 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;coakley255&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Coakley|first=Jay|title=Sports in Society|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, women administered 90 percent of women's athletic programs, in 2004 this fell to 19 percent and also in 2004 18 percent of all women's programs had no women administrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;coakley255&quot;/&gt; The most startling statistics is in 2004 there were 3356 administrative jobs in NCAA women's athletic programs and of those jobs women held 35 percent of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;coakley255&quot;/&gt; Today women are allowed to participate in every aspect of sports, but even in women athletic programs men are still outnumbering them. These statistics show that while Title IX has gotten rid of the discrimination against females participating in sports, there is not equality.

==Women's sports today==
{{refimprove|date=March 2012}}
In the United States today, nearly all schools require student participation in sports, guaranteeing that all girls were exposed to athletics at an early age, which was generally not the case in Western Europe and Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  In [[intramural sports]], the genders were often mixed, though for competitive sports the genders remained segregated.  [[Title IX]] legislation required colleges and universities to provide equal athletic opportunities for women. This large pool of female athletes enabled the U.S. to consistently rank among the top nations in women's Olympic sports, and female Olympians from skater [[Peggy Fleming]] (1968) to [[Mary Lou Retton]] (1986) became household names.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Tennis was the most-popular professional female sport from the 1970s onward,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} and it provided the occasion for a symbolic &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; between [[Billie Jean King]] and [[Bobby Riggs]], enhancing the profile of female athletics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The success of [[Women's Tennis Association|women's tennis]], however, did little to help the fortunes of women's professional team sports.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Women's professional sports|Women's professional team sports]] achieved popularity for the first time in the 1990s, particularly in [[basketball]] and [[football (soccer)]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This popularity has been asymmetric, being strongest in the U.S., certain European countries and former Communist states.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Thus, [[Women's association football|women's soccer]] was originally dominated by the U.S., China, and Norway, who have historically fielded weak men's national teams. However, more recently{{when|date=February 2011}}, several nations with strong and even dominant men's national teams, such as Germany, Sweden, and Brazil, have established themselves as women's powers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Despite this increase in popularity, women's professional sports leagues continue to struggle financially. The [[WNBA]] is operated at a loss by the [[NBA]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} in the hopes of creating a market that will eventually be profitable.  A similar approach is used to promote [[women's boxing]], as women fighters are often [[undercard]]s on prominent male boxing events, in the hopes of attracting an audience.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Today, women compete professionally and as amateurs in virtually every major sport, though the level of participation typically decreases when it comes to the more violent contact sports;  few schools have women's programs in American football, boxing or wrestling.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, these typical non-participation habits may slowly be evolving as more women take real interest in the games, for example [[Katie Hnida]] became the first woman ever to score points in a [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[NCAA]] [[American football]] game when she kicked two [[extra-point]]s for the [[University of New Mexico]] in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Modern sports have seen the development of a higher profile for female athletes in other historically male sports, such as [[golf]], [[marathon]]s or [[ice hockey]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
