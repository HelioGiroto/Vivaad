{{Personal finance}}

A '''debt''' is an [[Law of obligations|obligation]] owed by one party (the [[debtor]]) to a second party, the [[creditor]]; usually this refers to [[asset]]s granted by the creditor to the debtor, but the term can also be used [[metaphor]]ically to cover [[morality|moral]] obligations and other interactions not based on [[economic value]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A debt is created when a creditor [[Loan agreement|agrees]] to [[loan|lend]] a sum of assets to a debtor.  Debt is usually granted with expected repayment; in modern society, in most cases, this includes repayment of the original sum, plus [[interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp|title=Debt Definition|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[finance]], debt is a means of using anticipated future [[purchasing power]] in the present before it has actually been earned.  Some [[company|companies]] and [[corporation]]s use debt as a part of their overall [[corporate finance]] strategy.

==Payment==

Before a debt can be made, both the [[debtor]] and the [[creditor]] must agree on the manner in which the debt will be repaid, known as the [[standard of deferred payment]].  This [[payment]] is usually denominated as a sum of [[money]] in [[units of measurement|units]] of [[currency]], but can sometimes be denominated in terms of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] or services.  Payment can be made in increments over a period of [[time]], or all at once at the end of the [[loan agreement]].

==Types of debt==
A [[company]] uses various kinds of debt to [[finance]] its [[Business operations|operations]]. The various types of debt can generally be categorized into: 1) secured and unsecured debt, 2) private and public debt, 3) syndicated and bilateral debt, and 4) other types of debt that display one or more of the characteristics noted above.&lt;ref name=&quot;Practitioner&quot;&gt;Joseph Swanson and Peter Marshall, [[Houlihan Lokey]] and Lyndon Norley, Kirkland &amp; Ellis International LLP (2008). A Practitioner's Guide to Corporate Restructuring page 5. City &amp; Financial Publishing, 1st edition ISBN 978-1-905121-31-1&lt;/ref&gt;

A debt obligation is considered secured, if creditors have recourse to the assets of the company on a [[Property|proprietary]] basis or otherwise ahead of general claims against the company.
Unsecured debt comprises financial obligations, where creditors do not have recourse to the [[assets]] of the borrower to satisfy their claims.

Private debt comprises bank-loan type obligations, whether senior or [[Mezzanine capital|mezzanine]]. Public debt is a general definition covering all financial instruments that are freely tradeable on a public exchange or over the counter, with few if any restrictions.

A basic [[loan]] or &quot;[[term loan]]&quot; is the simplest form of debt. It consists of an agreement to lend a fixed amount of money, called the [[principal sum]] or principal, for a fixed period of time, with this amount to be repaid by a certain date. In commercial loans [[interest]], calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year, will also have to be paid by that date, or may be paid periodically in the interval, such as annually or monthly. Such loans are also colloquially called [[bullet loan]]s, particularly if there is only a single payment at the end – the &quot;bullet&quot; – without a &quot;stream&quot; of interest payments during the life of the loan. There are many conventions on how interest is calculated – see [[day count convention]] for some – while a standard convention is the [[annual percentage rate]] (APR), widely used and required by regulation in the United States and United Kingdom, though there are different forms of APR.

In some loans, the amount actually loaned to the debtor is less than the principal sum to be repaid; the additional principal has the same economic effect as a higher interest rate (see [[point (mortgage)|point]]), and is sometimes referred to as a [[wikt:banker's dozen|banker's dozen]], a play on &quot;[[baker's dozen]]&quot; – owe twelve (a dozen), receive a loan of eleven (a banker's dozen). Note that the effective interest rate is not equal to the discount: if one borrows $10 and must repay $11, then this is ($11–$10)/$10 = 10% interest; however, if one borrows $9 and must repay $10, then this is ($10–$9)/$9 = 11 1/9% interest.&lt;ref&gt;Formally, a discount of ''d''% results in effective interest of &lt;math&gt;d/(1-d)%.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than the entire principal amount of the loan being due at the end of the loan, the principal may be slowly repaid or &quot;amortized&quot; over the course of the loan – see [[amortizing loan]]. This is particularly common in [[mortgage]]s and in the [[minimum payment]] on [[credit card]]s.

A [[syndicated loan]] is a loan that is granted to companies that wish to borrow more money than any single lender is prepared to risk in a single loan, usually many millions of dollars. In such a case, a syndicate of banks can each agree to put forward a portion of the principal sum. Loan syndication is a risk management tool that allows the lead banks [[underwriting]] the debt to reduce their risk and free up lending capacity.

A [[Bond (finance)|bond]] is a debt [[security (finance)|security]] issued by certain institutions such as [[company (law)|companies]] and [[government]]s. A bond entitles the holder to repayment of the principal sum, plus [[interest]].  Bonds are issued to [[investment|investors]] in a [[marketplace]] when an institution wishes to borrow money.  Bonds have a fixed lifetime, usually a number of [[year]]s; with long-term bonds, lasting over 30 years, being less common.  At the end of the bond's life the money should be repaid in full.  Interest may be added to the end payment, or can be paid in regular installments (known as [[coupon (bond)|coupons]]) during the life of the bond. Bonds may be traded in the [[bond market]]s, and are widely used as relatively safe investments in comparison to [[Stock|equity]].

== Debt syndication ==
{{further|Syndicated loan}}

A syndicated loan is one that is provided by a group of lenders and is structured, arranged, and administered by one or several commercial banks or investment banks known as arrangers.

== Letters of credit ==

The LC can also be the source of payment for a transaction, meaning that redeeming the letter of credit will pay an exporter. Letters of credit are used primarily in international trade transactions of significant value, for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another. They are also used in the land development process to ensure that approved public facilities (streets, sidewalks, stormwater ponds, etc.) will be built. The parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money, the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client, and the [[advising bank]] of whom the beneficiary is a client. Almost all letters of credit are irrevocable, i.e., cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary, the issuing bank and the confirming bank, if any. In executing a transaction, letters of credit incorporate functions common to giros and Traveler's cheques. Typically, the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a commercial invoice, bill of lading, and a document proving the shipment was insured against loss or damage in transit. However, the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin.

==Accounting debt==
In national accounting, debts are added according to those who are indebted. Household debt is the debt held by households. &quot;National&quot; or Public debt is the debt held by the various governmental institutions (federal government, states, cities ...). Business debt is the debt held by businesses. Financial debt is the debt held by the financial sector (from one financial institution to another).
Total debt is the sum of all those debts, excluding financial debt to prevent double accounting.
These various types of debt can be computed in debt/GDP ratios. Those ratios help to assess the speed of variations in the indebtness and the size of the debt due.
For example, the USA has a high consumer debt and a low public debt, while in eastern European countries the opposite tends to be true.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

There are differences in the accounting of debt for private and public agents. If a private agent promises to pay something later, it has a debt, and this debt is enforceable by public agents. If a public body passes a law stating that it'll pay something later (a kind of promise), it keeps the right to change the law later (and not to pay). This is why, for instance, the money governments promised to pay for retirements does not show up in the public debt assessment, whereas the money private companies promised to pay for retirements does.

===Securitization===
{{main|Securitization}}
Securitization occurs when a company groups together assets or receivables and sells them in units to the market through a trust. Any asset with a cashflow can be securitized. The cash flows from these receivables are used to pay the holders of these units. Companies often do this in order to remove these assets from their balance sheets and monetize an asset. Although these assets are &quot;removed&quot; from the balance sheet and are supposed to be the responsibility of the trust, that does not end the company's involvement. Often the company maintains a special interest in the trust which is called an &quot;interest only strip&quot; or &quot;first loss piece&quot;. Any payments from the trust must be made to regular investors in precedence to this interest. This protects investors from a degree of risk, making the securitization more attractive. The aforementioned brings into question whether the assets are truly [[off-balance-sheet]] given the company's exposure to losses on this interest.

== Inflation and exchange rates ==
As noted below, debt is normally denominated in a particular monetary [[currency]], and so changes in the valuation of that currency can change the effective size of the debt.  This can happen due to [[inflation]] or [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]], so it can happen even though the borrower and the lender are using the same [[currency]]. Thus it is important to agree on standards of deferred payment in advance, so that a degree of fluctuation will also be agreed as acceptable. It is for instance common{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} to agree to &quot;[[United States dollar|US dollar]] denominated&quot; debt.

The form of debt involved in [[banking]] accounts for a large proportion of the money in most industrialized nations (see [[money]], [[broad money]], and [[demand deposit]]s for a discussion of this). There is therefore a relationship between [[inflation]], [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]], the [[money supply]], and debt. The [[store of value]] represented by the entire economy of the industrialized nation, and the state's ability to levy tax on it, acts to the foreign holder of debt as a guarantee of repayment, since industrial goods are in high demand in many places worldwide.

===Inflation indexed debt===
Borrowing and repayment arrangements linked to inflation-indexed units of account are possible and are used in some countries. For example, the US government issues two types of [[inflation-indexed bond]]s, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds.  These are one of the safest forms of investment available, since the only major source of risk – that of [[inflation]] – is eliminated. A number of other governments issue similar bonds, and some did so for many years before the US government.

In countries with consistently high inflation, ordinary borrowings at banks may also be inflation indexed.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Metrics and functions ==

===Risk free interest rates===
{{main|risk-free interest rate}}
{{Finance sidebar}}
Lendings to stable financial entities such as large companies or governments are often termed &quot;risk free&quot; or &quot;low risk&quot; and made at a so-called &quot;[[risk-free interest rate]]&quot;.  This is because the debt and interest are highly unlikely to be [[default (finance)|defaulted]]. A good example of such risk-free interest is a [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]] {{Dubious|date=August 2011}} – it yields the minimum return available in economics, but investors have the comfort of the (almost) certain expectation that the US Treasury will not default on its debt instruments. A risk-free rate is also commonly used in setting floating interest rates, which are usually calculated as the risk-free interest rate plus a bonus to the creditor based on the creditworthiness of the debtor (in other words, the risk of him or her defaulting and the creditor losing the debt). In reality, no lending is truly risk free, but borrowers at the &quot;risk free&quot; rate are considered the least likely to default.

However, if the real value of a currency changes during the term of the debt, the purchasing power of the money repaid may vary considerably from that which was expected at the commencement of the loan.  So from a practical investment point of view, there is still considerable risk attached to &quot;risk free&quot; or &quot;low risk&quot; lendings. The real value of the money may have changed due to inflation, or, in the case of a foreign investment, due to exchange rate fluctuations.

The [[Bank for International Settlements]] is an [[organisation]] of [[central bank]]s that sets rules to define how much capital banks have to hold against the loans they give out.

===Ratings and creditworthiness===
Specific bond debts owed by both governments and private corporations is rated by [[rating agency|rating agencies]], such as [[Moody's]], Fitch Ratings Inc., [[A. M. Best]] and [[Standard &amp; Poor's]]. The government or company itself will also be given its own separate rating. These agencies assess the ability of the debtor to honor his obligations and accordingly give him or her a [[credit rating]]. Moody's uses the letters ''Aaa Aa A Baa Ba B Caa Ca C'', where ratings ''Aa-Caa'' are qualified by numbers 1-3. [[Munich Re]], for example, currently is rated ''Aa3'' ({{As of|2004|lc=on}}). S&amp;P and other rating agencies have slightly different systems using capital letters and +/- qualifiers.

A change in ratings can strongly affect a company, since its cost of [[refinancing]] depends on its [[creditworthiness]]. Bonds below Baa/BBB (Moody's/S&amp;P) are considered [[junk bonds|junk-]] or high risk bonds. Their high risk of default (approximately 1.6% for Ba) is compensated by higher interest payments. Bad Debt is a loan that can not (partially or fully) be repaid by the debtor. The debtor is said to [[Default (finance)|default]] on his debt. These types of debt are frequently repackaged and sold below face value. Buying junk bonds is seen as a risky but potentially profitable form of investment.

===Consolidation===
{{main|Debt consolidation}}
Debt consolidation involves taking out one loan to pay off many others, i.e. combining multiple loans into a single loan.  It is often done to secure a lower interest rate, secure a fixed interest rate, or for the convenience of servicing only one loan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Ryan|title=Personal Financial Literacy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zdWrPiSGXY4C&amp;pg=PA292|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=14 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-8400-5829-4|pages=292–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation===
{{main|Debt relief}}
Short of bankruptcy, it is rare that debts are wholly or partially relinquished.  Traditions in some cultures demand that this be done on a regular (often annual) basis, in order to prevent systemic inequities between groups in society, or anyone becoming a specialist in holding debt and coercing repayment. An example is the Biblical [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee year]], described in the [[Book of Leviticus]].

Under [[English law]], when the creditor is deceived into relinquishing the debt, this is a crime under the [[Theft Act 1978]].

International [[Third World debt]] has reached the scale that many [[economist]]s are convinced that [[debt cancellation]] is the only way to restore global equity in relations with the [[developing nation]]s. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Effects of debt==
Debt allows people and organizations to do things that they would otherwise not be able, or allowed, to do.  Commonly, people in industrialised nations use it to purchase houses, cars and many other things too expensive to buy with cash on hand.  Companies also use debt in many ways to leverage the [[investment]] made in their [[asset]]s, &quot;leveraging&quot; the return on their [[Stock|equity]]. This [[leverage (finance)|leverage]], the proportion of debt to equity, is considered important in determining the riskiness of an investment; the more debt per equity, the riskier. For both companies and individuals, this increased risk can lead to poor results, as the cost of servicing the debt can grow beyond the ability to pay due to either external events (income loss) or internal difficulties (poor management of resources).

Excesses in debt accumulation have been blamed for exacerbating economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = 5 Ways to Get Out of Debt Faster | medium | internet video | publisher = Kiplinger | date = 2007 | url = http://www.webcastr.com/videos/informational/5-ways-to-get-out-of-debt-faster.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, prior to the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] debt/GDP ratio was very high. Economic agents were heavily indebted. This excess of debt, equivalent to excessive expectations on future returns, accompanied asset bubbles on the stock markets. When expectations corrected, deflation and a [[credit crunch]] followed.  [[deflation (economics)|Deflation]] effectively made debt more expensive and, as Fisher explained, this reinforced deflation again, because, in order to reduce their debt level, economic agents reduced their [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and investment. The reduction in demand reduced business activity and caused further unemployment. In a more direct sense, more [[bankruptcy|bankruptcies]] also occurred due both to increased debt cost caused by deflation and the reduced demand.

It is possible for some organizations to enter into alternative types of borrowing and repayment arrangements which will not result in bankruptcy.  For example, companies can sometimes convert debt that they owe into equity in themselves.  In this case, the creditor hopes to regain something equivalent to the debt and interest in the form of dividends and capital gains of the borrower.  The &quot;repayments&quot; are therefore proportional to what the borrower earns and so can not in themselves cause bankruptcy.  Once debt is converted in this way, it is no longer known as debt.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the French ''dette'' and ultimately Latin ''debere'' (to owe), from ''de habere'' (to have).&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/debt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/debt&lt;/ref&gt; The letter ''b'' in the word ''debt'' was reintroduced in the 18th century, possibly by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his Dictionary of 1755 – several other words that had existed without a ''b'' had them reinserted at around that time.

==History of debt==
{{See also|History of money}}
Debt is as old as economy. The anthropologist David Graeber argues in [[Debt: The First 5000 Years]] that trade starts with some sort of credit namely the promise to pay later for already handed over goods. Therefore credit and debt existed even before coins.&lt;ref&gt;David Graeber: Debt: The First 5000 Years, Melville 2011. Cf. http://www.socialtextjournal.org/reviews/2011/10/review-of-david-graebers-debt.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/08/what-is-debt-%E2%80%93-an-interview-with-economic-anthropologist-david-graeber.html|title=What is Debt? – An Interview with Economic Anthropologist David Graeber
|publisher=[[Naked Capitalism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{Citation style|section|date=August 2011}}
{{main|Criticism of debt}}
Some argue against debt as an instrument and institution, on a personal, family, social, corporate and governmental level. [[Islam]] [[Islamic banking|forbids]] lending with interest even today, while the [[Catholic Church]] allowed it from 1822 onwards, and the [[Torah]] states that all debts should be erased every 7 years and every 50 years (in the [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee year]], as described in the [[Book of Leviticus]]).

Debt will increase through time if it is not repaid faster than it grows through interest. This effect may be termed [[usury]], while the term &quot;usury&quot; in other contexts refers only to an excessive rate of interest, in excess of a reasonable profit for the [[risk]] accepted.

In international legal thought, [[Odious debt]] is debt that is incurred by a regime for purposes that do not serve the interest of the state. Such debts are thus considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state.

In an economy with high interest rates, debt will be more costly to a business than more flexible dividends on equity investment.  It may be easier for a struggling business to be financed through equity investment as it may be possible to avoid paying a dividend if times are hard.

At the household level, debts can also have detrimental effects. In particular when households make spending decisions assuming income to increase, or remain stable, for the years to come. When households take on credit based on this assumption, life events can easily change indebtedness into over-indebtedness. Such life events include unexpected unemployment, relationship break-up, leaving the parental home, business failure, illness, or home repairs. Over-indebtedness has severe social consequences, such as, financial hardship, poor physical and mental health, family stress, stigma, difficulty obtaining employment, exclusion from basic financial services (European Commission, 2009), work accidents and industrial disease, a strain on social relations (Carpentier and Van den Bosch, 2008), absenteeism at work and lack of organisational commitment (Kim ''et al.'', 2003), feeling of insecurity, and relational tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois &amp; Anderson (2010) Managing household debts: Social service provision in the EU. Working paper. Dublin: European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.  http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialprotection/householdebts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels and flows==
{{main|Debt levels and flows}}
Global debt underwriting grew 4.3% year-over-year to $5.19 trillion during 2004. It is expected to rise in the coming years if the spending habits of millions of people worldwide continue the way they do.
