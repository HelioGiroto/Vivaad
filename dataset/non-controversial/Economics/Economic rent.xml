'''Economic rent''' is [[technical terminology]] used by [[economists]] to define one aspect of the [[price]] of [[goods and services]].   Generally, it designates the difference between the raw costs of everything needed to produce the goods or service and the price.   In the analysis, economic rent is determined for each of the [[factors of production]] that are used to produce the good or service.  Usually economic rent is due to some exclusivity.  For example, for labor, it could be due to celebrity or skill (e.g., higher pay for skilled workers, in a region where there is a scarcity of such skilled workers);  for a good, it may be due to the power of a [[patent]]; for real estate, it may be due to a favorable location.   By contrast, if there is no exclusivity and there is [[perfect competition]], there are no economic rents, as competition drives prices down to their floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/r#node-21529784 | work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-economic-rent.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jstore&gt;{{Cite journal

==Definitions==

According to [[Robert Tollison]] (1982), economic rents are &quot;excess returns&quot; above &quot;normal levels&quot; that take place in competitive markets.  More specifically, it is &quot;a return in excess of the resource owner's [[opportunity cost]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Henry George]], best known for his proposal for a [[land value tax|single tax on land]], defined ''rent'' as &quot;the part of the produce that accrues to the owners of land (or other natural capabilities) by virtue of ownership&quot; and as &quot;the share of wealth given to landowners because they have an exclusive right to the use of those natural capabilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Henry |last=George |year= 1880 |edition=4 |url=http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp11.htm |title=Progress and Poverty |contribution=Chapter 11 The Law of Rent |publisher= Robert Schalkenbach Foundation 2006 |isbn=0-665-09522-8 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors of law [[Lucian Bebchuk]] and [[Jesse Fried]] define the term &quot;to refer to extra returns that firms or individuals obtain due to their positional advantages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Pay Without Performance - the Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation'', by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press, 2004, (p.62)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical factor rent==

Classical factor rent is primarily concerned with the fee paid for the use of fixed (e.g. natural) resources. The classical definition is expressed as any excess payment above that required to induce or provide for production.

* &quot;A payment for the services of an economic resource which is not necessary as an incentive for its production&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O19-economicrent.html |title=Definition of economic rent  |publisher=HighBeam.com: Online Dictionary (www.highbeam.com) |date=2001-01-01 |accessdate=2010-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &quot;A payment to any factor in perfectly inelastic supply&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wessels1&quot;/&gt;

==Neoclassical Paretian rent==

[[Neoclassical economics]] extends the concept of rent to include factors other than natural resource rents.  But the labeling of this version of &quot;rent&quot; may be somewhat opportunistic or simply incorrect in that [[Vilfredo Pareto]], the economist for whom this kind of rent was named, may or may not have proffered any conceptual formulation of rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vilfredo Pareto: critical assessments of leading economists |volume=2 |page=474 |editor= John Cunningham Wood and Michael McLure |publisher=Routledge (Taylor &amp; Francis Group) |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-18501-7 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=pB1IX9rFH4cC&amp;lpg=PA475&amp;dq=%22Paretian%20Rent%22&amp;pg=PA473#v=onepage&amp;q |contribution=Paretian Rent versus Pareto's Rent Theory : A Clarification and Correction

==Monopoly rent==
Some returns are associated with legally enforced monopolies like patents or copyrights. In addition, companies like Microsoft and Intel have important de facto monopolies that can be quite valuable. The American Medical Association has traditionally regulated the number of students each US medical school can graduate, and by restricting the supply of doctors has been accused of thus increasing the income of doctors. Some businesses like public utilities are by their very nature monopolies.  [[George Stigler]] estimated the impact of monopoly rent on the US economy to be fairly low, but he specially excluded labor monopolies from his studies.

==Land rent==

In political economy including [[physiocracy]], [[classical economics]], and other [[schools of economic thought]] excepting [[neoclassical economics]],  land  is recognized as an inelastic [[factor of production]]. Rent is the distribution paid to [[Fee simple|freehold]]ers for &quot;allowing&quot; production on the land they control.

{{quote|&quot;As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them, come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent of land ....&quot; | [[Adam Smith]]: ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/cgi-bin/searchbooks.pl?searchtype=BookSearchPara&amp;id=smWN&amp;query=gathering &quot;Wealth of Nations B.I, Ch.6, Of the Component Parts of the Price of Commodities&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[David Ricardo]] is credited with the first clear and comprehensive analysis of differential land rent and the associated economic relationships ([[Law of Rent]]).

[[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] was especially influential in developing the spatial analysis of rents, which highlighted the importance of centrality and transport. Simply put, it was density of population increasing the profitability of commerce and providing for the division and specialization of labor that commanded higher municipal rents.  And the high rents determined that land in a central city would not be allocated to farming, but would be allocated instead to more profitable residential or commercial uses.

Observing that a tax on the unearned [[Land Value Tax|rent of land]] would not distort economic activities, [[Henry George]] proposed that publicly collected land rents ([[land value taxation]]) should be the primary ([[Single Tax|or only]]) source of public revenue; though he also advocated public ownership, taxation and regulation of [[natural monopolies]] and monopolies of scale that cannot be eliminated by regulation.

==Hypothetical example==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
The generalization of the concept of rent to include opportunity cost has served to highlight the role of political barriers in creating and privatizing rents. For example, a person seeking to become a member of a medieval [[guild]] makes a huge investment in training and education, which has limited potential application outside of that guild. In a competitive market, the wages of a member of the guild would be set where the expected net return on the investment in training would be just enough to justify making the investment. In a sense, the required investment is a natural barrier to entry, discouraging some would-be members from making the necessary investment in training to enter the competitive market for the services of the guild. This is a natural &quot;free market&quot; self-limiting control on the number of guild members and/or the cost of training necessitated by certification. Some of those who would have opted for a particular guild may well decide to choose a different guild or occupation.

However, a political restriction on the numbers of people entering into the competitive market for services of the guild has the effect of raising the return on investments in the guilds training, especially for those already practising, by creating an artificial scarcity of guild members.  To the extent that a constraint on entrants to the medieval guild actually increases the returns to guild members as opposed to ensuring competence, then to that extent the practice of limiting entrants to the field is a '''[[rent seeking]]''' activity, and the excess return realized by the guild members is economic rent as defined.

==Terminology relating to rent==

; Gross rent:  Gross rent refers to the rent paid for the services of land and the capital invested on it. It consists of economic rent, interest on capital invested for improvement of land and reward for risk taken by the landlord in investing his capital.

; Scarcity rent:  Scarcity rent refers to the price paid for the use of the homogeneous land when its supply is limited in relation to demand. If all units of land are homogeneous, but demand exceeds supply, the entire land will earn economic rent by virtue of its scarcity.

; Differential rent:  Differential rent refers to that rent, which arises owing to differences in fertility of land. The surplus that arises due to difference between the marginal and intra-marginal land is the differential rent. It is accrued generally under extensive cultivation of land. The term was first stated by David Ricardo.

; Contract rent:  Contract rent refers to that rent which is mutually agreed upon between the land-owner and the user. It may be equal to the economic rent of the factor.
