      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6650">An '''Event study''' is a [[:statistics|statistical]] method to assess the impact of an event on the value of a firm. For example, the announcement of a [[merger]] between two business entities can be analyzed to see whether investors believe the merger will create or destroy value.  The basic idea is to find the [[abnormal return]] attributable to the event being studied by adjusting for the return that stems from the price fluctuation of the market as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Gilson and Bernard S. Black, The Law and Finance of Corporate Acquisitions, 2 edition, 1995, 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the event methodology can be used to elicit the effects of any type of event on the direction and magnitude of stock price changes, it is very versatile. Event studies are thus common to various research areas, such as accounting and finance, management, economics, marketing, information technology, law, and political science. 

One aspect oftentimes used to structure the overall body of event studies is the breath of the studied event types. On the one hand, there is research investigating the stock market responses to economy-wide events (i.e., market shocks, such as regulatory changes, or catastrophic events). On the other hand, event studies are used to investigate the stock market responses to corporate events, such as mergers and acquisitions, earnings announcements, [[debt]] or [[Stock|equity]] issues, corporate reorganisations, investment decisions and [[corporate social responsibility]] (MacKinlay 1997; McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 1997).

==Motivation==
The logic behind the event study methodology (within the specific context of [[merger]]s) is explained in Warren-Boulton and Dalkir (2001): 
:Investors in financial markets bet their dollars on whether a merger will raise or lower prices. A merger that raises market prices will benefit both the merging parties and their rivals and thus raise the prices for all their shares.  Conversely, the financial community may expect the efficiencies from the merger to be sufficiently large to drive down prices.  In this case, the share values of the merging firms’ rivals fall as the probability of the merger goes up.  Thus, evidence from financial markets can be used to predict market price effects when significant merger-related events have taken place.

==Methodologies==
The general event study methodology is explained in, for example, MacKinlay (1997) or Mitchell and Netter (1994).

Warren-Boulton and Dalkir use an event-probability methodology originally developed by McGuckin ''et al.'' (1992) to be applied to merger analysis. Their specific methodology involves ex-ante calculation of the financial markets' assessment of the probability that the merger will indeed take place in the future.

It is important to note that [[short-horizon]] event studies are more reliable than [[long-horizon]] event studies as the latter have many limitations. However, [[S.P. Kothari|Kothari]] and [[Jerold Warner|Warner]] (2005) (S.P. Kothari and Jerold Warner) were able to refine long-horizon methodologies in order to improve the design and reliability of the studies over longer periods.

==Application to merger analysis==
Warren-Boulton and Dalkir (2001) apply their event-probability methodology to the proposed merger between ''[[Staples, Inc.]]'' and ''[[Office Depot]]'' (1996), which was challenged by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and eventually withdrawn. 

===Empirical methods===
Methodologically, event studies imply the following: Based on an estimation window prior to the analyzed event, the method estimates what the normal stock returns of the affected firm(s) should be at the day of the event and several days prior and after the event (i.e., during the event window). Thereafter, the method deducts this 'normal returns' from the 'actual returns' to receive 'abnormal returns' attributed to the event. 

Event studies, however, may differ with respect to their specification of normal returns. The most common model for normal returns is the 'market model' (MacKinlay 1997). Following this model, the analysis implies to use an estimation window (typically sized 120 days) prior to the event to derive the typical relationship between the firm's stock and a reference index through a [[regression analysis]]. Based on the regression coefficients, the normal returns are then projected and used to calculate the abnormal returns. Alternative models for the normal returns include the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] model, or more simplistic approaches such as mean returns (see Schimmer 2012 for an overview).

===Findings===
Warren-Boulton and Dalkir (2001) find highly significant returns to the only rival firm in the relevant market.  Based on these returns, they are able to estimate the price effect of the merger in the product market which is highly consistent with the estimates of the likely price increase from other independent sources.
