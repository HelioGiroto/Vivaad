[[File:DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf|thumb|360px|right|Circulation [[Model (economics)|model]] of [[Stock and flow|economic flows]] for a [[closed economy|closed]] market economy.]]    
      
An '''economic system''' is the combination of the various institutions, agencies, consumers, entities (or even sectors as described by some authors) that comprise the economic structure of a given [[society]] or community. It also includes how these various agencies and institutions are linked to one another, how information flows between them, and the social relations within the system (including [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] and the structure of management). A related concept is the [[mode of production]].

The economic system involves [[Production (economics)|production]], allocation of economic inputs, [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] of economic outputs, land availability, households (earnings and expenditure [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] in an [[economy]]), financial institutions and government policies. It involves a set of [[institutions]] and their various [[social relations]].

Alternatively, it is the set of principles by which problems of [[economics]] are addressed, such as the [[economic problem]] of [[scarcity]] through allocation of finite productive resources.&lt;ref&gt;NA (2007). &quot;economic systems,&quot; ''The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', v. 4, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; An economic system is composed of [[person|people]], [[institutions]], rules, and relationships.  For example, the [[Convention (norm)|convention]] of [[property]], the institution of government, or the employee-employer relationship. Examples of contemporary economic systems include [[Capitalism|capitalist systems]], [[Socialist economy|socialist systems]], and [[mixed economies]]. Today the world largely operates under a global economic system based on the [[capitalist mode of production]].  

&quot;Economic systems&quot; is the [[JEL classification codes#Economic systems JEL: P Subcategories|economics category]] that includes the study of such systems. It includes [[comparative economic systems]] as a subfield. 

==Components==
There are multiple components to economic systems. Decision-making structures of an economy determine the use of economic inputs (the [[means of production]]), distribution of output, the level of centralization in decision-making, and who makes these decisions. Decisions might be carried out by [[Industrial democracy|industrial councils]], by a government agency, or by private owners. Some aspects of these structures include:
* ''Coordination mechanism'': How information is obtained and used to coordinate economic activity. The two dominant forms of coordination include [[Economic planning|planning]] and the [[Market economy|market]]; planning can be either centralized or de-centralized, and the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.
* ''Productive property rights'': This refers to ownership (rights to the proceeds of output generated) and control over the use of the [[means of production]]. They may be owned [[Private property|privately]], by [[State enterprise|the state]], [[Worker cooperative|by those who use it]], or [[Common ownership|held in common by society]].
* ''Incentive system'': A mechanism for inducing certain economic agents to engage in productive activity; it can be based on either material reward (compensation) or moral reward (social prestige).&lt;ref name=&quot;ComparingEconomic&quot;&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. ISBN 0-618-26181-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Communism.PNG|thumb|350px|[[Marxist-Leninist]] [[Socialist state|Communist states]] (red) and formerly Communist-run (orange) countries of the world.]]
There are several basic questions that must be answered in  order for an economy to run satisfactorily. The [[scarcity problem]], for example, requires answers to basic questions, such as: ''what'' to produce, ''how'' to produce it, and ''who'' gets what is produced. An economic system is a way of answering these basic questions, and different economic systems answer them differently.  Many different objectives may be seen as desirable for an economy, like [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], [[economic growth|growth]], [[liberty]], and [[Equality of outcome|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;David W. Conklin (1991), ''Comparative Economic Systems'', University of Calgary Press, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Economic systems can be divided by the way they allocate economic inputs (the [[means of production]]) and how they make decisions regarding the use of inputs.  A common distinction of great importance is that between [[capitalism]] (a [[market economy]]) and [[socialism]] ([[economic planning]]). 

In a capitalist economic system, production is carried out to maximize private profit, decisions regarding investment and the use of the means of production are determined by competing business owners in the marketplace; production takes place within the process of [[capital accumulation]]. The means of production are owned primarily by private enterprises and decisions regarding production and investment determined by private owners in [[capital market]]s. Capitalist systems range from laissez-faire, with minimal government regulation and state enterprise, to regulated and social market systems, with the stated aim of ensuring [[social justice]] and a more equitable distribution of [[wealth]] (see [[welfare state]]) or ameliorating market failures (see [[economic intervention]]). 

In a socialist economic system, production is carried out to directly satisfy economic demand by [[Production for use|producing goods and services for use]]; decisions regarding the use of the means of production are adjusted to satisfy economic demand, investment (control over the surplus value) is carried out through a mechanism of inclusive collective decision-making. The means of production are either [[Public ownership|publicly owned]], or are owned by the [[Worker cooperative|workers cooperatively]].  A socialist economic system that is based on the process of capital accumulation, but seeks to control or direct that process through state ownership or cooperative control to ensure stability, equality or expand decision-making power, are [[Market Socialism|market socialist systems]].  

The basic and general economic systems are:

* [[Market economy]] (&quot;hands off&quot; systems, such as [[Laissez-faire]] capitalism)
* [[Mixed economy]] (a hybrid that blends some aspects of both market and planned economies)
* [[Planned economy]] (&quot;hands on&quot; systems, such as [[state socialism]] or [[state capitalism]])
* [[Traditional economy]] (a generic term for older economic systems)
* [[Command (Centrally Planned) Economic Systems:]] (a generic term for older economic systems)
* [[Participatory economics]] (a system where the production and distribution of goods is guided by [[Participation (decision making)|public participation]])
* [[Gift economy]] (where an exchange is made without any explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards)
* [[Barter economy]] (where goods and services are directly exchanged for other goods or services)

===Types of socialist systems===
Economic systems can be subdivided by their coordinating mechanism (planning and markets) into [[Economic planning|planned socialist]]  [[market socialist]] systems. Additionally, socialism can be divided based on the ownership of the means of production into those that are based on [[public ownership]], worker or consumer [[cooperative]]s and [[common ownership]] (i.e., non-ownership). [[Pure communism|Communism]] is a hypothetical stage of Socialist development articulated by Marx as &quot;second stage Socialism&quot; in [[Critique of the Gotha Program]], whereby economic output is distributed based on need and not simply on the basis of labor contribution.

The primary concern for socialist planned economies is to coordinate production to directly satisfy human needs/economic demand (as opposed to generate profit and satisfy needs as a byproduct of pursuing profit), to advance the productive forces of the economy while being immune to the systemic inefficiencies ([[Business cycle|cyclical processes]]) and crisis of [[overproduction]] that plagues capitalism so that production would be subject to the needs of society as opposed to being ordered around capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism: Still Impossible After All These Years'', on Mises.org. Retrieved February 15, 2010, from Mises.org http://mises.org/journals/scholar/Boettke.pdf, What Socialism means: &quot; The ultimate end of socialism was the 'end of history', in which perfect social harmony would permanently be established. Social harmony was to be achieved by the abolition of exploitation, the transcendence of alienation, and above all, the transformation of society from the 'kingdom of necessity' to the 'kingdom of freedom.' How would such a world be achieved? The socialists informed us that by rationalizing production and thus advancing material production beyond the bounds reachable under capitalism, socialism would usher mankind into a post-scarcity world.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism and Calculation'', on worldsocialism.org. Retrieved February 15, 2010, from worldsocialism.org: http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/overview/calculation.pdf: &quot;Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations...Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value. In socialism their value, in the normal non-economic sense of the word, will not be their selling price nor the time needed to produce them but their usefulness. It is for this that they will be appreciated, evaluated, wanted. . . and produced.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[orthodox Marxism]], the [[mode of production]] is tantamount to the subject of this article, [[Base and superstructure|determining with a superstructure of relations]] the entirety of a given culture or stage of human development.

===Types of mixed economies===
Economic systems that contain substantial state, private and sometimes cooperative ownership and operated in mixed economies - i.e., ones that contain substantial amounts of both market activity and economic planning.
* [[Distributism]] - Catholic ideal of a &quot;third way&quot; economy, featuring more distributed ownership
* [[Georgism]] - socialized rents on land
* [[Mixed economy]]

** [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|Japanese system]]
** [[Mercantilism]]
** [[Social market economy]] also known as ''Soziale Marktwirtschaft''
** [[Social corporatism]]
** [[Socialist-oriented market economy]]

** [[Indicative planning]] also known as a planned market economy

==Evolutionary economics==
{{See also|Evolutionary economics}}
[[Karl Marx]]'s theory of economic development was based on the premise of evolving economic systems; specifically, over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones. Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them impossible to survive over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ComparingEconomic&quot; /&gt; [[Joseph Schumpeter]] had an evolutionary conception of economic development, but unlike Marx, he de-emphasized the role of class struggle in contributing to qualitative change in the economic mode of production. In subsequent world history, [[Communist states]] run according to [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideologies have either collapsed or gradually reformed their centrally-planned economies toward [[market economy|market-based economies]], for example with [[perestroika]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], [[Chinese economic reform]], and [[ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi]] in Vietnam.

Mainstream [[evolutionary economics]] continues to study economic change in modern times.  There has also been renewed interest in understanding economic systems as evolutionary systems in the emerging field of [[Complexity economics]].

==Context in society==
An economic system can be considered a part of the [[social system]] and hierarchically equal to the [[law system]], [[political system]], [[cultural]], etc. There is often a strong correlation between certain [[ideology|ideologies]], [[political system]]s and certain economic systems (for example, consider the meanings of the term &quot;[[communism]]&quot;). Many economic systems overlap each other in various areas (for example, the term &quot;[[mixed economy]]&quot; can be argued to include elements from various systems). There are also various mutually exclusive hierarchical categorizations.
