      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24218">[[File:Reserve currencies.svg|thumb|350px|The [[United States dollar|US dollar]] and the [[Euro]] make up 90% of Allocated Reserves globally. Unallocated Reserves are not included in this graph, although they make up over 45% of total world foreign exchange holdings]]

A '''reserve currency''', or '''anchor currency''', is a [[currency]] that is held in significant quantities by many governments and institutions as part of their [[foreign exchange reserves]]. It also tends to be the international pricing currency for products traded on a global market, and commodities such as [[Petroleum|oil]], [[gold]], etc. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This permits the issuing country to purchase the commodities at a marginally lower rate than other nations, which must exchange their currencies with each purchase and pay a [[transaction cost]]. For major currencies, this transaction cost is negligible with respect to the price of the commodity. It also permits the government issuing the currency to borrow money at a better rate, as there will always be a larger market for that currency than others.

==History==

As emphasised by the economist [[Avinash Persaud]], reserve currencies come and go. &quot;International currencies in the past have included the Chinese [[Tael|Liang]] and Greek [[drachma]], coined in the fifth century B.C., the silver [[Punch marked coins of india|punch-marked coins]] of fourth century India, the Roman [[Denarius|denari]], the Byzantine [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] and Islamic [[Gold Dinar|dinar]] of the middle-ages, the Venetian [[Ducato (coin)|ducato]] of the Renaissance, the seventeenth century [[Dutch guilder]] and of course, more recently, sterling and the dollar.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3672 |title=Shifting wealth: Is the US dollar Empire falling? |publisher=voxeu.org |author=Helmut Reisen |accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1944, the world reference currency was the Pound Sterling. After [[World War II]], the international financial system was governed by a formal agreement, the [[Bretton Woods System]]. Under this system the [[United States dollar]] was placed deliberately as the anchor of the system, with the US government guaranteeing other central banks that they could sell their US dollar reserves at a fixed rate for gold.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/exchange-rate-policies/Documents/Appendix%201%20Final%20October%2015%202009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; European countries and Japan deliberately devalued their currencies against the dollar in order to boost exports and development. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s the system suffered setbacks due to problems pointed out by the [[Triffin dilemma]], a general problem with any [[fiat currency]] under a fixed exchange regime, as the dollar was in the Bretton Woods system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Global currency reserves==

A 2011 study about the current dominant reserve currency in central banks shows that dollar may not be the obvious dominant currency, because of the major part of Unallocated Reserves increasingly reported by central banks since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://conscience-sociale.blogspot.com/2011/06/how-to-replace-world-trade-reference.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus the following table is only a limited view about the global currency reserves because it only deals with Allocated Reserves:
{{Reserve currencies}}

==Theory==

Economists debate whether a single reserve currency will always dominate the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=723305 |title=Sterling's Past, Dollar's Future: Historical Perspectives on Reserve Currency Competition |first=Barry |last=Eichengreen |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) |month=May |year=2005 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have recently argued that one currency will almost always dominate due to [[network externalities]], especially in the field of invoicing trade and denominating foreign debt securities, meaning that there are strong incentives to conform to the choice that dominates the marketplace. The argument is that, in the absence of sufficiently large shocks, a currency that dominates the marketplace will not lose much ground to challengers.

However, some economists, such as [[Barry Eichengreen]] argue that this is not as true when it comes to the denomination of official reserves because the network externalities are not strong. As long as the currency's market is sufficiently liquid, the benefits of reserve diversification are strong, as it insures against large capital losses. The implication is that the world may well soon begin to move away from a financial system dominated uniquely by the US dollar. In the first half of the 20th century multiple currencies did share the status as primary reserve currencies. Although the British Sterling was the largest currency, both the French franc and the German mark shared large portions of the market until the First World War, after which the mark was replaced by the dollar. Since the Second World War, the dollar has dominated official reserves, but this is likely a reflection of the unusual domination of the American economy during this period, as well as official discouragement of reserve status from the potential rivals, Germany and Japan.

The top reserve currency is generally selected by the banking community for the strength and stability of the economy in which it is used. Thus, as a currency becomes less stable, or its economy becomes less dominant, bankers may over time abandon it for a currency issued by a larger or more stable economy. This can take a relatively long time, as recognition is important in determining a reserve currency. For example, it took many years after the United States overtook the United Kingdom as the world's largest economy before the dollar overtook Sterling as the dominant global reserve currency.&lt;ref name=Schenk_2009&gt;&quot;[http://cneh09.dal.ca/Schenk_CNEH.pdf The Retirement of Sterling as a Reserve Currency after 1945: Lessons for the US Dollar ?]&quot;, Catherine R. Schenk, Canadian Network for Economic History conference, 10/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Schenk has shown in her 2009 study that in 1944 (Bretton Woods) the US dollar was chosen as the world reference currency whereas it was only the second currency in global reserves.&lt;ref name=Schenk_2009/&gt;

The [[G8]] also frequently issues public statements as to [[exchange rates]]. In the past due to the [[Plaza Accord]], its predecessor bodies could directly manipulate rates to reverse large [[trade deficit]]s.

==Major reserve currencies==
[[File:Global Reserve Currencies.png|thumb|280px|Distribution of global reserve currencies]]
===United States dollar===
The [[United States dollar]] is the most widely held currency in the Allocated Reserves today. Throughout the last decade, an average of two thirds of the total Allocated foreign exchange reserves of countries have been in US dollars. For this reason, the US dollar is said to have &quot;reserve-currency status&quot;, making it somewhat easier for the United States to run higher trade deficits with greatly postponed economic impact or even postponing a [[currency crisis]]. Central bank reserves held in dollar-denominated debt, however, are small compared to private holdings of such debt. In the event that non-United States holders of dollar-denominated assets decided to shift holdings to assets denominated in other currencies, there could be serious consequences for the US economy. Changes of this kind are rare, and typically change takes place gradually over time; the markets involved adjust accordingly.&lt;ref name=Schenk_2009/&gt;

However, the dollar remains until recently the favorite reserve currency because it has stability along with assets such as [[United States Treasury security]] that have both scale and liquidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/business-finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=16064067&amp;source=hptextfeature |title=In a world of ugly currencies, the dollar is sitting pretty |publisher=Economist.com |date= 2010-05-06|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US dollar dominant position in global reserves is very much challenged currently, because of the growing share of Unallocated Reserves, and because of the doubt regarding dollar stability in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Dollar 'losing grip as world's reserve currency' http://www.iol.co.za/business/markets/currencies/dollar-losing-grip-as-world-s-reserve-currency-1.1093803 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IMF discusses plan to replace dollar as reserve currency http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/10/markets/dollar/index.htm &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Central Banks Dump Treasuries As Dollar's Reserve Currency Status fades http://blogs.forbes.com/afontevecchia/2011/03/16/central-banks-dump-treasuries-as-dollars-reserve-currency-status-fades/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Why the Dollar's Reign Is Near an End http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703313304576132170181013248.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.N. sees risk of crisis of confidence in dollar http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/25/us-economy-un-idUSTRE74O6EI20110525&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euro===
{{See|International status and usage of the euro}}
The [[euro]] is currently the second most commonly held reserve currency, comprising approximately a quarter of allocated holdings.  After World War II and the [[Wirtschaftswunder|rebuilding]] of the [[Germany|German]] economy, the German [[Deutsche Mark]] gained the status of the second most important reserve currency after the US dollar.  When the euro was [[Introduction of the euro|launched]] on 1 January 1999, replacing the Mark, [[French Franc]] and ten other European currencies, it inherited the status of a major reserve currency from the Mark.  Since then, its contribution to official reserves has risen continually as banks seek to diversify their reserves and trade in the [[eurozone]] continues to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2006/wp06153.pdf |title=The Euro‚Äôs Challenge to the Dollar: Different Views from Economists and Evidence from COFER (Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves) and Other Data |first=Ewe-Ghee |last=Lim |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] |month=June |year=2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Former U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] said in September 2007 that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. It is &quot;absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Reuters | work=Euro could replace dollar as top currency&amp;nbsp;‚Äî Greenspan | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSL1771147920070917 | accessdate=September 17, 2007 | date=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Econometric analysis by Jeffery Frankel and Menzie Chinn in 2006 suggests the euro may replace the U.S. dollar as the major reserve currency by 2020 if (1) the remaining EU members, including the UK and Denmark, adopt the euro by 2020 ''or'' (2) the recent depreciation trend of the dollar persists into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Menzie |first= Chinn |coauthors= Jeffery Frankel |year= 2006 |month= January |title= Will the Euro Eventually Surpass The Dollar As Leading International Reserve Currency? |journal=[[NBER]] |url=http://www.wage.wisc.edu/uploads/Working%20Papers/chinnfrankel_NBER_eurotopcurrency.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/14350/1/MPRA_paper_14350.pdf |title=Aristovnik, Aleksander &amp; ƒåeƒç, Tanja, 2010. &quot;Compositional Analysis Of Foreign Currency Reserves In The 1999-2007 Period.

June 30, 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2012, as the European sovereign debt crisis intensifies, there is growing uncertainty about the future of the Euro, some analysts are even predicting it's collapse in the next few years.

==Other reserve currencies==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}

===Pound sterling===
The United Kingdom's [[pound sterling]] was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Schenk_2009/&gt; The emergence of the USA as an economic superpower (and, importantly, the establishment of the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913), U.S. economic dominance from the second half of the 20th century onward, as well as economic weakness in the UK at various intervals during the second half of the 20th century resulted in Sterling losing its status as the world's most reserved currency.&lt;ref name=Schenk_2009/&gt;

Since mid-2006 it is the third most widely held reserve currency, having seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, growing from about 2.5% to around 4% of all currency reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Sterling surges to 14-year high | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/01/23/bcnpound23.xml |accessdate=2007-01-24 |date=2007-01-23 |first=Richard |last=Blackden | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts say this resurgence is caused by [[carry trade#Currency|carry-trade]] investors considering the pound as a stable high-yield proxy to the euro, as well as the position of London in world financial affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xak.com/main/newsshow.asp?id=56419 |date=2006-02-08 |title=Currency Strategists: Morgan Says Pound Is Euro Proxy |work=xak.com |publisher=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese yen===
Japan's [[yen]] is part of the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s (IMF) [[special drawing rights]] (SDR) valuation. The SDR currency value is determined daily by the IMF, based on the exchange rates of the currencies making up the basket, as quoted at noon at the London market. The valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted every five years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The SDR Values and yen conversion for government procurement are used by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] for Japan's official procurement in [[international trade]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Swiss franc===
The [[Swiss franc]] is often considered a reserve currency, because of the perceived stability of the currency and the Swiss banking system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, the share of all foreign exchange reserves held in Swiss francs has historically been well below 0.5%. The daily trading market turnover of the franc however, ranked fifth, or about 3.4%, among all currencies in a 2007 survey by the [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Triennial-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=Triennial Central Bank Survey, Foreign exchange and derivatives market activity in 2007
|date=December 2007
|publisher=[[Bank for International Settlements]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian dollar===
A number of central banks (and commercial banks) keep [[Canadian dollars]] as a reserve currency. In the economy of the Americas, the Canadian dollar plays a similar role to that played by the [[Australian dollar]] (AUD) in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The Canadian dollar (as a regional reserve currency for banking) has been an important part of the British, French and Dutch Caribbean states' economies and finance systems since the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Canadian dollar is also held by many central banks in Central America and South America. The Canadian dollar is held in Latin America because of remittances and international trade  in each nation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Canadian economists primarily define and value the Canadian dollar in terms of the United States dollar, and thus by observing how the Canadian dollar floats in terms of the US dollar, foreign-exchange economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and patterns in the US economy that could not be seen by direct observation (Canada‚Äôs primary foreign-trade relationship is with the United States). Also, considered a [[petrocurrency|petrodollar]], the Canadian dollar has only fully evolved into a global reserve currency since the 1970s when it was floated against all other world currencies. Some economists have attributed the rise of importance of the Canadian dollar to the long term effects of the [[Nixon Shock]] that effectively ended the [[Bretton Woods system]] of global finance. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Canadian dollar is used as a reserve currency around the world and in 2007 it was ranked 6th in value held as reserves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Triennial-2007&quot;/&gt;

==Call for new major reserve currency==
A report released by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] in 2010, called for abandoning the U.S. dollar as the single major reserve currency. The report states that the new reserve system should not be based on a single currency or even multiple national currencies but instead permit the emission of international liquidity to create a more stable global financial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Countries such as [[Russia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]], central banks, and economic analysts and groups, such as the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], have expressed a desire to see an independent new currency replace the dollar as the reserve currency.

On 10 July 2009, Russian President Medvedev proposed a new 'world currency' at the G8 meeting in London as an alternative reserve currency to replace the dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to economist [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]], China has said, &quot;we don't want to make any more foreign exchange reserve of any paper currency, because all the paper currencies are government debt currencies.&quot; China, Russia, India, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela and oil-producing countries have recently agreed &quot;to transact all of their mutual trade and investment in their own currencies&quot; effectively minimizing the need, at least in the short term, for a global reserve currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=therealnews.com 
|date=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; And yet oil is still priced in dollars, which has brought complaints about OPEC's policies of managing oil quotas to maintain dollar price stability.&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh, Marc. [http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5guURtqDTvJVO3fkDP09Z_P_ofVpA?docId=CNG.079b1b56853f883a607a8f382e61450a.bf1 &quot;OPEC leaves oil quotas unchanged, seeing economic 'risks'.&quot;] ''[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]'', 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special drawing rights===
Some have proposed the use of the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s (IMF) [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) as a reserve.

China has proposed using SDRs, calculated daily from a basket of U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen and British pound, for international payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/wtUSInvestingNews/idUSLJ93633020090319 |title=China backs talks on dollar as reserve -Russian source, Reuters, 19 March 2, 2009 |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 2009-03-19|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2009, the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) issued a report calling for a new reserve currency based on the SDR, managed by a new global reserve bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Webflyer.asp?intItemID=1397&amp;docID=11867 |title=UNCTAD Trade and Development Report 2009 |publisher=Unctad.org |date=2002-10-06 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF released a report in February 2011, stating that using SDRs could help stabilize the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/10/markets/dollar/index.htmc | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese yuan===
The [[Chinese yuan]] or [[renminbi]] (RMB) cannot be used as a reserve currency as long as the Chinese government maintains capital controls on the conversion of its currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE5650W720090706 |title=Yuan starts on long slog to reserve currency status |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 2009-07-06|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currency would not be attractive to central banks for holding unless China develop a strong open bond market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
