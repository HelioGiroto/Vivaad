{{Capitalism}}
'''Consumerism''' is a social and economic order that encourages the purchase of goods and services in ever-greater amounts. The term is often associated with criticisms of consumption starting with [[Thorstein Veblen]].  Veblen's subject of examination, the newly emergent middle class arising at the turn of the twentieth century, comes to full fruition by the end of the twentieth century through the process of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thorstein Veblen|Veblen, Thorstein]] (1899):  ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]: an economic study of institutions'', Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1994, ISBN 0-486-28062-4. (also available: [http://www.gutenberg.net/browse/BIBREC/BR833.HTM Project Gutenberg e-text])&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, consumerism is usually considered a part of [[media culture]].

Sometimes, the term &quot;consumerism&quot; is also used to refer to the consumerists movement, [[consumer protection]] or [[consumer activism]], which seeks to protect and inform consumers by requiring such practices as honest packaging and advertising, product guarantees, and improved safety standards. In this sense it is a movement or a set of policies aimed at regulating the products, services, methods, and standards of manufacturers, sellers, and advertisers in the interests of the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/consumerism consumerism], [[answers.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], consumerism refers to economic policies placing emphasis on consumption. In an abstract sense, it is the belief that the free choice of consumers should dictate the economic structure of a society (cf. [[Producerism]], especially in the British sense of the term).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Consumerism&quot;. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia Online. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;consumerism&quot; was first used in 1915 to refer to &quot;advocacy of the rights and interests of consumers&quot; (Oxford English Dictionary) but in this article the term &quot;consumerism&quot; refers to the sense first used in 1960, &quot;emphasis on or preoccupation with the acquisition of consumer goods&quot; (Oxford English Dictionary).

==History==

=== Origins ===
Consumerism has weak links with the [[Western world]], but is in fact an international phenomenon. People purchasing [[good (economics)|good]]s and consuming materials in excess of their basic needs is as old as the first [[civilization]]s (e.g. [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Babylon]] and [[Ancient Rome]]).

A great turn in consumerism arrived just before the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In the nineteenth century, capitalist development and the industrial revolution were primarily focused on the capital goods sector and industrial infrastructure (i.e., mining, steel, oil, transportation networks, communications networks, industrial cities, financial centers, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Ryan in Ritzer 2007, p. 701&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, agricultural commodities, essential consumer goods, and commercial activities had developed to an extent, but not to the same extent as other sectors. Members of the working classes worked long hours for low wages – as much as 16 hours per day, 6 days per week. Little time or money was left for consumer activities.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Michael T. (2007) &quot;consumption&quot; in George Ritzer (ed.) ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology'',  Blackwell Publishing, 2007, 701-705&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, capital goods and infrastructure were quite durable and took a long time to be used up. [[Henry Ford]] and other leaders of industry understood that mass production presupposed mass consumption.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} After observing the assembly lines in the meat packing industry, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] brought his theory of [[scientific management]] to the organization of the assembly line in other industries; this unleashed incredible productivity and reduced the costs of all commodities produced on assembly lines.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan in Ritzer 2007, p. 702&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2012}}

While previously the norm had been the scarcity of resources, the [[Industrial Revolution]] created an unusual economic situation. For the first time in history products were available in outstanding quantities, at outstandingly low prices, being thus available to virtually everyone. So began the era of mass consumption, the only era where the concept of consumerism is applicable.

Consumerism has long had intentional underpinnings, rather than just developing out of capitalism. As an example, [[Earnest Elmo Calkins]] noted to fellow [[advertising]] executives in 1932 that &quot;consumer engineering must see to it that we use up the kind of goods we now merely use&quot;, while the domestic theorist [[Christine Frederick]] observed in 1929 that &quot;the way to break the vicious deadlock of a low standard of living is to spend freely, and even waste creatively&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEADMALL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changeobserver.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11747|title=Essay - Dawn of the Dead Mall|date=11 November 2009 |work=The Design Observer Group|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The older term and concept of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writings of sociologist and economist, [[Thorstein Veblen]]. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following:
{{cquote|It is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of consumption, that people will undergo a very considerable degree of privation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate, for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term &quot;[[conspicuous consumption]]&quot; spread to describe consumerism in the United States in the 1960s, but was soon linked to debates about [[media influence|media theory]], [[culture jamming]], and its corollary [[productivism]].

{{cquote|By 1920 most people [Americans] had experimented with occasional installment buying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== In the 21st century ===
Beginning in the 1990s, the most frequent reason given for attending college had changed to making a lot of money, outranking reasons such as becoming an authority in a field or helping others in difficulty{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a source|date=November 2011}}. This correlates with the rise of [[Economic materialism|materialism]]{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}, specifically the technological aspect: the increasing prevalence of compact disc players, digital media, personal computers, and cellular telephones. Madeline Levine criticized what she saw as a large change in American culture – “a shift away from values of [[community]], [[spirituality]], and integrity, and toward competition, materialism and disconnection.” &lt;ref&gt;Levine, Madeline. “[http://www.nais.org/publications/ismagazinearticle.cfm?ItemNumber=150274 Challenging the Culture of Affluence].” Independent School. 67.1 (2007): 28-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses have realized that wealthy consumers are the most attractive targets of marketing. The upper class's tastes, lifestyles, and preferences trickle down to become the standard for all consumers. The not so wealthy consumers can “purchase something new that will speak of their place in the tradition of affluence”.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Eric. Attracting the Affluent. Naperville, Illinois: Financial Sourcebooks, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  A consumer can have the [[Deferred gratification|instant gratification]] of purchasing an expensive item to improve social status.

Emulation is also a core component of 21st century consumerism. As a general trend, regular consumers seek to emulate those who are above them in the social hierarchy. The poor strive to imitate the wealthy and the wealthy imitate celebrities and other icons. The celebrity endorsement of products can be seen as evidence of the desire of modern consumers to purchase products partly or solely to emulate people of higher social status. This purchasing behavior may co-exist in the mind of a consumer with an image of oneself as being an individualist.

==Criticism==
{{Criticism section|date=July 2011}}
{{Main|Anti-consumerism|Affluenza}}

===Overview===
Since consumerism began, various individuals and groups have consciously sought an alternative lifestyle. These movements range on a spectrum from moderate &quot;[[simple living]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Janet Luhrs's &quot;The Simple Living Guide&quot; (NY: Broadway Books, 1997); Joe Dominquez, Vicki Robin et al., &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot; (NY: Penguin Group USA, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Environmentally friendly|eco-conscious shopping]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Alan Durning, &quot;How Much is Enough: The Consumer Society and the Future of the Earth&quot; (NY: W.W. Norton, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[Local food|localvore]]&quot;/&quot;[[Local purchasing|buying local]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Paul Roberts, &quot;The End of Food&quot; (NY: Houghton Mifflin, 2008); Michael Shuman, &quot;The Small-mart Revolution&quot; (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Freeganism]] on the extreme end. Building on these movements, [[ecological economics]] is a discipline which addresses the macro-economic, social and ecological implications of a primarily consumer-driven economy.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote &quot;Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things.&quot;.

In many critical contexts, ''consumerism'' is used to describe the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially those with commercial [[brand]] names and perceived [[status symbol|status-symbolism]] appeal, e.g. a [[luxury car]], [[designer clothing]], or expensive [[jewelry]]. A culture that is permeated by consumerism can be referred to as a ''consumer culture'' or a ''market culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiffkitten.wordpress.com/2010/05/09/consumerism-%E2%80%93-enough-is-enough/ |title=Consumerism - enough is enough |publisher=Stiff Kitten's blog |date=May 9, 2010 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumerism can take extreme forms such that consumers sacrifice significant time and income not only to purchase but also to actively support a certain firm or brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Eisingerich|first1=Andreas B.|last2=Bhardwaj|first2=Gunjan|last3=Miyamoto|first3=Yoshio|year=2010|month=April|title=Behold the Extreme Consumers and Learn to Embrace Them|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=88|pages=Pages 30–31|url=http://hbr.org/2010/04/vision-statement-behold-the-extreme-consumersand-learn-to-embrace-them/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of consumerism argue that many luxuries and unnecessary consumer products may act as social mechanism allowing people to identify like-minded individuals through the display of similar products, again utilizing aspects of status-symbolism to judge [[socioeconomic status]] and [[social stratification]]. Some people believe relationships with a product or brand name are substitutes for healthy human relationships lacking in [[societies]], and along with consumerism, create a [[cultural hegemony]], and are part of a general process of social control&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindpress.com/sunday/sundayitems.asp?id=SEV20060406083003&amp;eTitle=Focus&amp;rLink=0/ |title=Fool Britannia |publisher=Newindpress.com |date= |accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in modern society. Other researchers argue that the struggle for symbols of social distinction promoted by consumer culture creates narcissistic, hostile relations between individuals, which can be criminogenic in locations where consumer products are difficult to acquire, or where individuals simply see no limit to their acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S., Winlow, S. and Ancrum, C. (2008) Criminal Identities and Consumer Culture. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of consumerism often point out that consumerist societies are more prone to damage the environment, contribute to [[global warming]] and use up resources at a higher rate than other societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seed.slb.com/en/scictr/watch/climate_change/co2.htm Global Climate Change and Energy CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Production—An International Perspective]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jorge Majfud says that &quot;Trying to reduce environmental pollution without reducing consumerism is like combatting drug trafficking without reducing the drug addiction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Majfud |first=Jorge |url=http://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/chronicle/home/archive/issues2009/toprotectsucceedinggenerations/pid/21570 |title=The Pandemic of Consumerism |publisher=UN Chronicle |year=2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, economist [[Victor Lebow]] stated:
{{cquote|&quot;Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lebow, Victor. http://hundredgoals.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/journal-of-retailing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics of consumerism include [[Pope Benedict XVI]],&lt;ref&gt;Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks-consumerism/&lt;/ref&gt; German historian [[Oswald Spengler]] (who said, &quot;Life in America is exclusively economic in structure and lacks depth&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Stearns, Peter. ''Consumerism in World History''. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;), and French writer [[Georges Duhamel]], who held &quot;American materialism up as a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In an opinion segment of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] of the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Warren Hern]] of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are &quot;subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coghlan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Coghlan|first=Andy|title=Consumerism is 'eating the future'|url= http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17569-consumerism-is-eating-the-future.html|accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the [[Ecological Society of America]], human society is in a &quot;global overshoot&quot;, consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic &quot;bio-capacities&quot;, and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries, which have a material surplus due to their lower consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coghlan&quot;/&gt;

Not all anti-consumerists oppose [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] in itself, but they argue against increasing the consumption of resources beyond what is [[sustainability|environmentally sustainable]]. [[Jonathan Porritt]] writes that consumers are often unaware of the negative environmental impacts of producing many modern goods and services, and that the extensive [[advertising]] industry only serves to reinforce increasing consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymultiplesclerosis.co.uk/big-ideas/consumerism.html|title=Consumerism - Big Ideas|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, other ecological economists such as [[Herman Daly]] recognize the inherent conflict between consumer-driven consumption and planet-wide ecological degradation.

===Response to criticism===
{{Original research|section|date=August 2010}}
Most of the response to criticism comes from [[libertarianism|libertarian]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;A defense of consumerism, as pragmatically less lethal than religion and nationalism appears in Charles Arthur Willard ''Liberalism and the Problem of Knowledge: A New Rhetoric for Modern Democracy.'' University of Chicago Press. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian criticisms of the anti-consumerist movement are largely based on the perception that it leads to [[elitism]]. Namely, libertarians believe that no person should have the right to decide for others what goods are necessary for living and which aren't, or that luxuries are necessarily wasteful, and thus argue that anti-consumerism is a precursor to [[central planning]] or a [[totalitarian]] society. Twitchell, in his book ''Living It Up'', sarcastically remarked that the logical outcome of the anti-consumerism movement would be a return to the [[sumptuary laws]] that existed in [[ancient Rome]] and during the [[Middle Ages]], historical periods prior to the era of Karl Marx in the 19th century. 

Historian James Livingston's book ''Against Thrift: Why Consumer Culture is Good for the Economy, the Environment, and Your Soul'' [Basic, 2011], is a pro-consumerist argument from the left. He argues that under-consumption caused the current economic crisis, and goes beyond that to make a moral case for spending more and saving less.
