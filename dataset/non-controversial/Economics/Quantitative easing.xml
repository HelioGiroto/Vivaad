'''Quantitative easing''' ('''QE''') is an [[Monetary policy#Unconventional monetary policy at the zero bound|unconventional monetary policy]] used by [[central banks]] to stimulate the national economy when conventional monetary policy has become ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/14649284 | work=The Economist | title=Loose thinking | date=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/events/QEConference/index.htm Publications | Learning the Lessons from QE and Other Unconventional Monetary Policies: 17–18 November]. Bank of England (18 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying [[financial asset]]s from [[bank|commercial banks]] and other private institutions with [[money creation|newly created money]] in order to inject a pre-determined ''quantity'' of money into the economy.

[[Expansionary monetary policy]] typically involves the central bank buying short-term government bonds in order to lower short-term market interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/open_market_operations Open market operations: A Glossary of Political Economy Terms – Dr. Paul M.

Quantitative easing may then be used by the monetary authorities to further stimulate the economy by purchasing assets of longer maturity than only short-term government bonds, and thereby lowering longer-term interest rates further out on the [[yield curve]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A: Quantitative easing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frbsf.org/education/activities/drecon/2010/0310.html|title=Dr. Econ: I noticed that banks have dramatically increased their excess reserve holdings.

Quantitative easing can be used to help ensure inflation does not fall below target.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOE QE Explained (web)&quot;/&gt; Risks include the policy being more effective than intended in acting against [[deflation]] – leading to higher inflation,&lt;ref name=&quot;bowlby fear&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7925981.stm |last=Bowlby |first=Chris |title=The fear of printing too much money |publisher=BBC News |date=5 March 2009 |accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of not being effective enough if banks do not [[loan|lend]] out the additional reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/05/news/economy/Fed_quantitative_easing/index.htm |first=Chris |last=Isidore |publisher=CNNMoney.com |title= Federal Reserve move toward quantitative easing poses risks |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

Ordinarily, a central bank conducts [[monetary policy]] by raising or lowering its interest rate target for the inter-bank interest rate. A central bank generally achieves its interest rate target mainly through [[open market operations]], where the central bank buys or sells short-term [[government bonds]] from banks and other financial institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;omofed&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;omoecb&quot;/&gt; When the central bank disburses or collects payment for these bonds, it alters the amount of money in the economy, while simultaneously affecting the price (and thereby the [[Yield (finance)|yield]]) for short-term government bonds. This in turn affects the [[Interbank lending market|interbank interest rate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Abel |first=Andrew |last2=Bernanke |first2=Ben |authorlink2=Ben Bernanke |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Pearson |year=2005 |edition=5th|pages=522–532 |chapter=14.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mankiw&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Mankiw |first=N. Gregory |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Worth |year=2002 |edition=5th |pages=482–489 |chapter=Chapter 18: Money Supply and Money Demand }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the [[nominal interest rate]] is at or very near [[Zero interest rate policy|zero]], the central bank cannot lower it further. Such a situation, called a [[liquidity trap]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=The Liquidity Trap |first=Gauti |last=Eggertsson |chapter=liquidity trap |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/economists/eggertsson/palgrave.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; can occur, for example, during [[deflation]] or when inflation is very low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |first1=Roberto M. |last1=Billi |first2=George A. |last2=Kahn |title=What is the optimal inflation rate? |journal=Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Review |year=2008 |number=2 |url=http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/ECONREV/PDF/2q08billi_kahn.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a situation, the central bank may perform quantitative easing by purchasing a pre-determined amount of bonds or other assets from financial institutions without reference to the interest rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A: Quantitative easing |date=9 March 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7924506.stm |work=BBC |accessdate=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stlouisfed.org/publications/re/articles/?id=1862 |title=Quantitative easing—uncharted waters for monetary policy |first=James |last=Bullard |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis |date=Jan 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this policy is to increase the [[money supply]] rather than to decrease the interest rate, which cannot be decreased further.&lt;ref name=&quot;boe&quot; /&gt; This is often considered a &quot;last resort&quot; to stimulate the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quantitative easing: A therapy of last resort |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-views12.1.19248009.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 July 2010 |date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quantitative easing: last resort to get credit moving again |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/jan/29/question-and-answer-quantitative-easing |work=The Guardian |accessdate=12 July 2010 |date=29 January 2009 |first=Heather |last=Stewart |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative easing, and monetary policy in general, can only be carried out if the central bank controls the currency used. The central banks of countries in the [[Eurozone]], for example, cannot unilaterally expand their money supply, and thus cannot employ quantitative easing. They must instead rely on the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) to set monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_statute_2.pdf |title=Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank: statements 14.4, 18.2 |pages=5–6 |accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===In Japan===
{{POV-section|date=July 2012}}
The original Japanese expression for ''quantitative easing'' (量的金融緩和, ''ryōteki kin'yū kanwa''), was used for the first time by a Central Bank in the Bank of Japan's publications. The [[Bank of Japan]] has claimed that the central bank adopted a policy with this name on 19 March 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMES2002&quot;&gt;Shirakawa, Masaaki, [http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/english/publication/edps/2002/02-E-03.pdf &quot;One Year Under 'Quantitative Easing'&quot;], Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bank of Japan's official monetary policy announcement of this date does not make any use of this expression (or any phrase using &quot;quantitative&quot;) in either the Japanese original statement or its English translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;boj.or.jp&quot;&gt;Bank of Japan, [http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/release/zuiji/kako02/k010319a.htm New Procedures for Money Market Operations and Monetary Easing], 19 March 2001. Retrieved 9 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Bank of Japan had for years, including as late as February 2001, claimed that &quot;quantitative easing … is not effective&quot; and rejected its use for monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshi Fujiki et. al., [http://www.imes.boj.or.jp/english/publication/mes/2001/me19-1-4.pdf Monetary Policy under Zero Interest Rate: Viewpoints of Central Bank Economists], Monetary and Economic Studies, February 2001, p.98. Retrieved 9 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Speeches by the Bank of Japan leadership in 2001 gradually, and ''ex post'', hardened the subsequent official Bank of Japan stance that the policy adopted by the Bank of Japan on 19 March 2001 was in fact quantitative easing. This became the established official view, especially after Toshihiko Fukui was appointed governor in February 2003. The use by the Bank of Japan is not the origin of the term ''quantitative easing'' or its Japanese original (ryoteki kinyu kanwa). This expression had been used since the mid-1990s by critics of the Bank of Japan and its monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;First in the headline of Richard Werner's article in the Nikkei, the main Japanese financial daily newspaper: Richard Werner (1995), &quot;''Keizai Kyoshitsu: Keiki kaifuku, ryoteiki kinyu kanwa kara,''&quot; ''Nikkei, 2 September 1995, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative easing was used unsuccessfully by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to fight domestic [[deflation]] in the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|early 2000s]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A: Quantitative easing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8517760.stm|title=Japan sets inflation goal in fight against deflation|date=16 February 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Spiegel |title=FRBSF: Economic Letter—Quantitative Easing by the Bank of Japan (11/02/2001) |url=http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2001/el2001-31.html |publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco]] |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;voutsinas&quot;&gt;Voutsinas, Konstantinos, and Richard A.

With quantitative easing, it flooded commercial banks with excess [[liquidity]] to promote private lending, leaving them with large stocks of [[excess reserves]], and therefore little risk of a liquidity shortage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2004/el2004-33.html Easing Out of the Bank of Japan's Monetary Easing Policy (2004–33, 19 November 2004)]. Frbsf.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The BOJ accomplished this by buying more government bonds than would be required to set the interest rate to zero. It also bought [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] and [[Stock|equities]], and extended the terms of its [[commercial paper]] purchasing operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europe.pimco.com/LeftNav/Viewpoints/2006/Masanao-+Quantitative+Easing.htm PIMCO/Tomoya Masanao interview]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 2007===
More recently, similar policies have been used by the United States, the United Kingdom and the [[Eurozone]] during the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2012]]. Quantitative easing was used by these countries as their ''risk-free short-term nominal interest rates'' are either at, or close to, zero. In US, this interest rate is the [[federal funds]] rate. In UK, it is the [[official bank rate]].

During the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, in the United States the Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet dramatically by adding new assets and new liabilities without &quot;sterilizing&quot; these by corresponding subtractions. In the same period the United Kingdom also used quantitative easing as an additional arm of its monetary policy in order to alleviate its financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Alloway, Tracy, [http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/11/10/18038/the-unthinkable-has-happened/ The Unthinkable Has Happened], [[ft.com]], 10 November 2008.

The [[European Central Bank]] has used 12-month and 36-month [[European Central Bank#Long term refinancing operation|long term refinancing operations (LTRO)]] (forms of quantitative easing without referring to them as such&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Matthew, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-central-banks-provide-oil-markets-take-away-2012-02-29 &quot;What central banks provide, oil markets take away&quot;], ''MarketWatch'', 29 February 2012. Retrieved 29 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) through a process of expanding the assets that banks can use as collateral that can be posted to the ECB in return for euros. This process has led to bonds being &quot;structured for the ECB&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans&quot;&gt;Evans, Rachel, [http://www.iflr.com/Article/2006925/Unsellable-bonds-structured-to-abuse-ECB-scheme.html Unsellable bonds structured to abuse ECB scheme], IFLR, 2 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison the other central banks were very restrictive in terms of the collateral they accept: the US Federal Reserve used to accept primarily treasuries (in the first half of 2009 it bought almost any relatively safe dollar-denominated securities); the [[Bank of England]] applied a large [[haircut (finance)|haircut]].

During its QE programme, the Bank of England bought [[Gilt-edged securities|gilts]] from financial institutions, along with a smaller amount of relatively high-quality debt issued by private companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;boe&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/pdf/qe-pamphlet.pdf|title=Quantitative Easing explained|publisher=Bank of England|pages=7–9|quote=(page 7) Bank buys assets from … institutions … credits the seller's bank account.

That will push up the prices of those assets,|isbn=1-85730-114-5|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banks, insurance companies and pension funds can then use the money they have received for lending or even to buy back more bonds from the bank. The central bank can also lend the new money to private banks or buy assets from banks in exchange for currency.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} These have the effect of depressing interest yields on government bonds and similar investments, making it cheaper for business to raise capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;bean&quot;&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Charlie Bean|first=Charles|last=Bean| url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/qe/askqa.htm|title=Ask the Deputy Governor|publisher=Bank of England|date=July 2009|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another side effect is that investors will switch to other investments, such as shares, boosting their price and thus encouraging consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;boe&quot;/&gt; QE can reduce interbank overnight interest rates, and thereby encourage banks to loan money to higher interest-paying and financially weaker bodies.

Nevin argued that QE failed to stimulate recovery in the UK and instead prolonged the recession between 2009 and 2012 as it caused a collapse in the velocity of circulation, or rate at which money circulates around the economy.  This happened because QE drove down gilt yields and annuity rates and forced pensioners, savers and companies to hoard cash to counter the negative impact of QE on their investment income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nevin|first=Michael|title=The Golden Guinea.

In 2012 the [[Bank of England]] itself reckoned that quantitative easing had benefited households differently, according to the assets they hold; richer households have more assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2012/nr073.pdf The Distributional Effects of Asset Purchases], ''Bank of England'', July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Amounts ===
The US [[Federal Reserve]] held between $700 billion and $800 billion of Treasury notes on its balance sheet before the recession. In late November 2008, the Fed started buying $600 billion in [[Mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS).&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Robin. (3 November 2010) [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/69e8c92c-e758-11df-880d-00144feab49a.html Quantitative easing explained]. ''Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2009, it held $1.75 trillion of bank debt, MBS, and Treasury notes, and reached a peak of $2.1 trillion in June 2010. Further purchases were halted as the economy had started to improve, but resumed in August 2010 when the Fed decided the economy was not growing robustly. After the halt in June holdings started falling naturally as debt matured and were projected to fall to $1.7 trillion by 2012. The Fed's revised goal became to keep holdings at the $2.054 trillion level. To maintain that level, the Fed bought $30 billion in 2–10-year Treasury notes a month. In November 2010, the Fed announced a second round of quantitative easing, or &quot;QE2&quot;, buying $600 billion of [[Treasury securities]] by the end of the second quarter of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/11/03/news/economy/fed_decision/index.htm |title=QE2: Fed pulls the trigger |first=Annalyn |last= Censky |publisher=[[CNNmoney.com]] |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://useconomy.about.com/od/glossary/g/Quantitative-Easing.htm What is the Federal Reserve Quantitative Easing]. Useconomy.about.com (22 September 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; A third round of quantitative easing, or &quot;QE3,&quot; was announced by the Federal Reserve in September 2012. The third round includes a plan to  purchase US$40 billion of [[mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) per month. Additionally, the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC) announced that it would likely maintain the [[federal funds rate]] near zero &quot;at least through 2015.&quot;&lt;ref name=qe3&gt;{{cite news|last=Zumbrun|first=Joshua|title=Fed Undertakes QE3 With $40 Billion MBS Purchases Per Month|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/fed-plans-to-buy-40-billion-in-mortgage-securities-each-month.html|accessdate=13 September 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its meeting in November 2010, the [[Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) voted to increase total asset purchases to £200 billion.

In early October 2010, the BOJ announced that it would examine the purchase of ¥5 trillion (US$60 billion) in assets.

===QE1, QE2, and QE3 {{anchor|QE2|QE3}}===
The expression &quot;QE2&quot; became a &quot;[[wiktionary:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] nickname&quot; in 2010, when used to refer to a second round of quantitative easing by central banks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d3dd363a-e918-11df-a1b4-00144feab49a.html#axzz1A9nIrzex Fed's desperate measure is a watershed moment], John Authers, The Long View, Financial Times, 5 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively, the round of quantitative easing preceding QE2 may be called &quot;QE1&quot;.

QE3 was announced on 13 September 2012. In an 11-to-1 vote, the Federal Reserve decided to launch a new $40 billion a month, open-ended, bond purchasing program of agency [[mortgage-backed securities]] and also to continue extremely low rates policy until at least mid-2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Steve|title=Fed To Launch QE3 Of $40 Billion MBS Each Month|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2012/09/13/fed-to-launch-qe3-40-billion-mbs-each-month/|accessdate=19 September 2012|website=Fox Business|date=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NASDAQ.com, this is effectively a stimulus program which allows the Federal Reserve to relieve $40 billion dollars per month of commercial housing market debt risk with no maximum amount or time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Greg|title=QE3 Launched: The Ever Decreasing Effects of Monetary Stimulus|url=http://community.nasdaq.com/News/2012-09/qe3-launched-the-ever-decreasing-effects-of-monetary-stimulus.aspx?storyid=174677|accessdate=19 September 2012|website=NASDAQ|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings firm Egan-Jones said it believes the Fed’s decision “will hurt the U.S. economy and, by extension, credit quality.” As a result the firm once again slashed the U.S. bond rating bringing it down to AA-.

==Effectiveness==
According to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], the quantitative easing policies undertaken by the central banks of the major developed countries since the beginning of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] have contributed to the reduction in systemic risks following the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]]. The IMF states that the policies also contributed to the improvements in market confidence and the bottoming out of the recession in the G-7 economies in the second half of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2009/spn0927.pdf Unconventional Choices for Unconventional Times: Credit and Quantitative Easing in Advanced Economies; by Vladimir Klyuev, Phil de Imus, and Krishna Srinivasan; IMF Staff Position Note SPN/09/27; November 4, 2009.]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Martin Feldstein]] argues that QE2 led to a rise in the stock-market in the second half of 2010, which in turn contributed to increasing consumption and the strong performance of the US economy in late-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/feldstein33/English |title=Quantitative Easing and America's Economic Rebound |first=Martin |last=Feldstein |work=project-syndicate.org |publisher=Project Syndicate |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Alan Greenspan]] calculated that as of July 2012 there was &quot;very little impact on the economy&quot; and noted &quot;I'm very surprised at the data.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Bruno J..

== Risks ==
=== Adverse impact on savings and pensions ===

In November 2010, a group of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] economists and political activists released an open letter to Federal Reserve Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] questioning the efficacy of the Fed's QE program. The Fed responded that their actions reflected the economic environment of high unemployment and low inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/11/15/open-letter-to-ben-bernanke/ |title=Open letter to Ben Bernanke |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowering interest rates can actually ''hurt'' the economy if people who depend on interest income spend less in response to their reduced income. In general, however, the Federal Reserve has assumed that the advantages of the low interest rates outweigh this effect, though they often admit that seniors may be hit as [[collateral damage]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In the [[European Union]], [[:fr: Forum Mondial des Fonds de Pension|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] [[financial economist]]s have also argued that QE-induced artificially  low [[interest rate]]s will have an adverse impact on the underfunding condition of pension funds as “without returns that outstrip inflation, pension investors face the real value of their savings declining rather than ratcheting up over the next few years”&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=M. Nicolas J. Firzli quoted in Sinead Cruise |title= ‘Zero Return World Squeezes Retirement Plans’ |url= http://www.cnbc.com/id/48484139 |work=Reuters with CNBC |date= 4 August 2012|accessdate=5  Aug 2012| location=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inflation from purchasing liquid assets ===
Quantitative easing may cause higher inflation than desired if the amount of easing required is overestimated, and too much money is created by the purchase of liquid assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;bowlby fear&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, it can fail if banks remain reluctant to lend money to small business and households in order to spur demand. Quantitative easing can effectively ease the process of deleveraging as it lowers yields.

It should be noted that [[mortagage-backed securities]] such as are being purchased as part of the QE3 program are not based on liquid assets, and their purchase does not entail inflation risks. If the easing resulted in an expansion of the money supply, it would be expected to cause an inflationary effect (as indicated by an increase in the annual rate of inflation). Since there is a time lag between money growth and inflation, inflationary pressures associated with money growth from QE could build before the central bank acts to counter them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1034.pdf |first=Daniel L. |last=Thornton |title=The downside of quantitative easing |journal=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economic Synopses |number=34 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflationary risks are mitigated if the system's economy outgrows the pace of the increase of the money supply from the easing. If production in an economy increases because of the increased money supply, the value of a unit of currency may also increase, even though there is more currency available.  For example, if a nation's economy were to spur a significant increase in output at a rate at least as high as the amount of debt monetized, the inflationary pressures would be equalized.  This can only happen if member banks actually lend the excess money out instead of hoarding the extra cash.  During times of high economic output, the central bank always has the option of restoring the reserves back to higher levels through raising of interest rates or other means, effectively reversing the easing steps taken. Increasing the money supply tends to depreciate a country's [[exchange rate]]s versus other currencies. This feature of QE directly benefits exporters residing in the country performing QE and also [[debtor]]s whose debts are denominated in that currency, for as the currency devalues so does the debt. However, it directly harms [[creditor]]s and holders of the currency as the real value of their holdings decrease. Devaluation of a currency also directly harms importers as the cost of imported goods is inflated by the devaluation of the currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/29/how-world-paid-hidden-cost-america-quantitative-easing | location=London |work=The Guardian | first=Phillip | last=Inman | title=How the world paid the hidden cost of America's quantitative easing | date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Housing market over-supply and QE3 ===

The only member of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] to vote against QE3, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President [[Jeffrey M. Lacker]], said:

{{quote|&quot;The impetus ... is to aid the housing market. That's an area that's fallen short in this recovery. In most other U.S. postwar recoveries, we've seen a pretty sharp snap back in housing. Of course, the reason it hasn't come back in this recovery is that this recession was essentially caused by us building too many houses prior to the recession. We still have a huge overhang of houses that haven't been sold that are vacant. And it's going to take us a while before we want the houses we have, much less need to build more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio (September 15, 2012) [http://www.npr.org/2012/09/15/161208104/feds-latest-stimulus-lacked-unanimous-support &quot;Fed's Latest Stimulus Lacked Unanimous Support&quot;] ''All Things Considered''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Capital flight ===
The new money could be used by the banks to invest in emerging markets, commodity-based economies, commodities themselves and non-local opportunities rather than to lend to local businesses that are having difficulty getting loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/bernanke-s-cheap-money-stimulus-spurs-corporate-investment-outside-u-s-.html | work=Bloomberg | first=David J. | last=Lynch | title=Bernanke's 'Cheap Money' Stimulus Spurs Corporate Investment Outside U.S | date=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other instruments ==
=== Qualitative easing ===
Professor [[Willem Buiter]], of the [[London School of Economics]], has proposed a terminology to distinguish ''quantitative easing'', or an expansion of a central bank's balance sheet, from what he terms ''qualitative easing'', or the process of a central bank adding riskier assets onto its balance sheet:

{{quote|Quantitative easing is an increase in the size of the balance sheet of the central bank through an increase [in its] monetary liabilities ([[Monetary base|base money]]), holding constant the composition of its assets. Asset composition can be defined as the proportional shares of the different financial instruments held by the central bank in the total value of its assets. An almost equivalent definition would be that quantitative easing is an increase in the size of the balance sheet of the central bank through an increase in its monetary liabilities that holds constant the (average) liquidity and riskiness of its asset portfolio.

Qualitative easing is a shift in the composition of the assets of the central bank towards less liquid and riskier assets, holding constant the size of the balance sheet (and the official policy rate and the rest of the list of usual suspects). The less liquid and more risky assets can be private securities as well as sovereign or sovereign-guaranteed instruments. All forms of risk, including credit risk (default risk) are included.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Credit easing ===
In introducing [[Federal Reserve responses to the subprime crisis#Expansion of Fed Balance Sheet (&quot;Credit easing&quot;)|the Federal Reserve's response]] to the 2008–9 financial crisis, Fed Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] distinguished the new programme, which he termed &quot;[[Subprime mortgage crisis solutions debate#Arguments for credit easing|credit easing]]&quot; from Japanese-style quantitative easing. In his speech, he announced:
{{quote|Our approach—which could be described as &quot;credit easing&quot;—resembles quantitative easing in one respect:  It involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet.  However, in a pure QE regime, the focus of policy is the quantity of bank reserves, which are liabilities of the central bank; the composition of loans and securities on the asset side of the central bank's balance sheet is incidental.  Indeed, although the Bank of Japan's policy approach during the QE period was quite multifaceted, the overall stance of its policy was gauged primarily in terms of its target for bank reserves.  In contrast, the Federal Reserve's credit easing approach focuses on the mix of loans and securities that it holds and on how this composition of assets affects credit conditions for households and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090113a.htm Credit Easing versus Quantitative Easing]. Federalreserve.gov (13 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Credit easing involves increasing the money supply by the purchase not of government bonds, but of private sector assets such as corporate bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities.&lt;ref name=&quot;lexicon.ft.com&quot;&gt;[http://lexicon.ft.com/term.asp?t=credit-easing&amp;ftauth=1293458776021 Credit Easing Definition].

''BusinessWeek'' (28 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; When undertaking credit easing, the Federal Reserve increases the money supply not by buying government debt, but instead by buying private sector assets including residential mortgage-backed securities.&lt;ref name=&quot;lexicon.ft.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek.com&quot;/&gt; In 2010, the Federal Reserve purchased $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in order to support the sagging mortgage market. These purchases increased the monetary base in a way similar to a purchase of government securities.&lt;ref name=&quot;research.stlouisfed.org&quot;&gt;http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Printing money ===
Quantitative easing has been nicknamed &quot;printing money&quot; by some members of the media,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/stephanieflanders/2009/02/obtaining_the_right_to_print_m.html Stephanomics: Is quantitative easing really just printing money?].

With QE, the newly created money is used for buying government bonds or other financial assets, whereas the term ''printing money'' usually implies that the newly minted money is used to directly finance government deficits or pay off government debt (also known as ''[[Monetizing debt|monetizing]] the government debt'').&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Central banks in most developed nations (e.g., UK, US, Japan, and EU) are forbidden by law to buy government debt directly from the government and must instead buy it from the secondary market.&lt;ref name=&quot;research.stlouisfed.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/stephanieflanders/2009/02/ Stephanomics]. BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; This two-step process, where the government sells bonds to private entities which the central bank then buys, has been called &quot;monetizing the debt&quot; by many analysts.&lt;ref name=&quot;research.stlouisfed.org&quot;/&gt; The distinguishing characteristic between QE and monetizing debt is that with QE, the central bank is creating money to stimulate the economy, not to finance government spending. Also, the central bank has the stated intention of reversing the QE when the economy has recovered (by selling the government bonds and other financial assets back into the market).&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The only effective way to determine whether a central bank has monetized debt is to compare its performance relative to its stated objectives. Many central banks have adopted an inflation target. It is likely that a central bank is monetizing the debt if it continues to buy government debt when inflation is above target, and the government has problems with debt-financing.&lt;ref name=&quot;research.stlouisfed.org&quot;/&gt;

[[Ben Bernanke]] remarked in 2002 that the US Government had a technology called the printing press, or today its electronic equivalent, so that if rates reached zero and deflation was threatened the government could always act to ensure deflation was prevented.  He said, however, that the Government would not print money and distribute it &quot;willy nilly&quot; but would rather focus its efforts in certain areas (for example, buying federal agency debt securities and mortgage-backed securities).&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Martin.

Fisher]], president of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]], warned that a potential risk of QE is, &quot;the risk of being perceived as embarking on the slippery slope of debt monetization. We know that once a central bank is perceived as targeting government debt yields at a time of persistent budget deficits, concern about debt monetization quickly arises.&quot; and later in the same speech states that the Fed is monetizing the government debt, &quot;The math of this new exercise is readily transparent: The Federal Reserve will buy $110 billion a month in Treasuries, an amount that, annualized, represents the projected deficit of the federal government for next year. For the next eight months, the nation’s central bank will be monetizing the federal debt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2010/fs101108.cfm Speeches by Richard W. Fisher].

Based on research reassessing the effectiveness of the US [[Federal Open Market Committee]] action in 1961 known as [[Operation Twist]], ''[[The Economist]]'', based on research by economist Eric Swanson, has posited that a similar restructuring of the supply of different types of debt would have an effect equal to that of QE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18486271?story_id=18486271 |title=Twisted thinking: Government Debt-Managers May be Undermining Quantitative Easing |journal=[[The Economist]] |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such action would allow finance ministries (e.g., the [[US Department of the Treasury]]) a role in the process now reserved for central banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist&quot;/&gt;
