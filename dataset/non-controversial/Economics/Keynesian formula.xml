The '''Keynesian formula''' is an economic theory developed by the British [[economist]] [[John Maynard Keynes]]. Keynes argued that the level of output and employment in the economy was determined by [[aggregate demand]] or [[effective demand]]. In a reversal of [[Say's Law]], Keynes in essence argued that &quot;man creates his own supply,&quot; up to the limit set by [[full employment]]. Adherents of the [[Austrian School|Austrian]] and [[Monetarism|Monetarist]] and schools of economic thought are critical of this theory.

==Composition of the Keynesian Formula==
In scientific notation, the Keynesian Formula consists of the following make-up:

&lt;math&gt;C + I + G + X - M = Y (GDP)&lt;/math&gt;

which means:

[[consumption (economics)|Consumption]] + [[Investment]] + [[Government Spending]] + [[Export]]s âˆ’ [[Import]]s = [[Gross Domestic Product]]

==Consumption==
In [[Keynesian economics]] aggregate consumption is total personal consumption expenditure, i.e., the purchase of currently produced [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] out of income, out of savings (net worth), or from borrowed funds. It refers to that part of disposable income (income after taxes paid and payments received) that does not go to [[saving]].

==Investment==
Investment is a term with several closely related meanings in [[business management]], [[finance]] and [[economics]], related to [[saving]] or deferring [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. An [[asset]] is usually purchased, or equivalently a deposit is made in a bank, in hopes of getting a future return or interest from it. Literally, the word means the &quot;action of putting something in to somewhere else&quot; (perhaps originally related to a person's garment or '[[vestment]]').

==Government Spending==
Government spending or government expenditure consists of [[government]] purchases, which can be financed by [[seigniorage]], [[taxes]], or government borrowing. It is considered to be one of the major components of gross domestic product.

John Maynard Keynes was one of the first economists to advocate government [[deficit spending]] as part of a [[fiscal policy]] to cure an economic contraction. In Keynesian economics, increased government spending is thought to raise aggregate demand and increase consumption.

==Exports==
In economics, an export is any good or [[commodity]], transported from one country to another country in a legitimate fashion, typically for use in trade. Export is an important part of [[international trade]]. Its counterpart is import.

Export goods or services are provided to foreign consumers by domestic producers. Export of commercial quantities of goods normally requires involvement of the Customs authorities in both the country of export and the country of import.

==Imports==
In economics, an import is any good or commodity, brought into one country from another country in a legitimate fashion, typically for use in trade. Import goods or services are provided to domestic [[consumer|consumers]] by foreign [[Production, costs, and pricing|producers]]. Import of commercial quantities of goods normally requires involvement of the [[Customs]] authorities in both the country of import and the country of export.

==GDP==
A common measurement of national income.

==Economic Consequences==
If the rate of consumption, investment, government spending and/or exports increases, there will be an overall increase in gross domestic product. This will have a resulting effect on [[aggregate demand]], causing it to rise and, thus resulting in the aggregate demand curve shifting outwards. Alternatively, if there was a decrease in the mentioned factors, the result will be a fall in aggregate demand, thus causing and inward shift in the aggregate demand curve.

The Keynesian Formula can be used to track changes in aggregate demand, gross domestic product and what consequence that will have on the [[price level]] ([[inflation]]). This formula is a tool for analysing [[macroeconomic]] performance.
