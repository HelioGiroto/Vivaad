[[File:Cumulative Current Account Balance per capita.png|thumb|400px|Cumulative Current Account Balance '''per capita''' 1980–2008 based on [[International Monetary Fund]] data.]]

The '''balance of trade''', or '''net exports''' (sometimes symbolized as '''NX'''), is the difference between the monetary value of [[export]]s and [[International trade|import]]s of output in an economy over a certain period. It is the relationship between a nation's imports and exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan|coauthors=Steven M. Sheffrin|title=Economics: Principles in action|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2003|location= Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458|pages=462|url=http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ3R9&amp;PMDbSiteId=2781&amp;PMDbSolutionId=6724&amp;PMDbCategoryId=&amp;PMDbProgramId=12881&amp;level=4|doi=|isbn=0-13-063085-3}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2011}} A positive balance is known as a '''trade surplus''' if it consists of exporting more than is imported; a negative balance is referred to as a '''trade deficit''' or, informally, a trade gap. The balance of trade is sometimes divided into a goods and a services balance.

Early understanding of the functioning of balance of trade informed the economic policies of Early Modern Europe that are grouped under the heading [[mercantilism]]. An early statement appeared in ''Discourse of the Common Wealth of this Realm of England'', 1549: &quot;We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Now attributed to [[Thomas Smith (diplomat)|Sir Thomas Smith]]; quoted in [[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Wheels of Commerce'', vol. II of ''Civilization and Capitalism 15th-18th Century'', 1979:204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly a systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through [[Thomas Mun]]'s c1630 &quot;England's treasure by forraign trade, or, The balance of our forraign trade is the rule of our treasure&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mun, Oxford National Dictionary of Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Image:Panama Canal Ship Entering Chamber.jpeg|right|thumb|350px|The balance of trade encompasses the activity of exports and imports, like the work of this cargo ship going through the [[Panama Canal]].]]

The balance of trade forms part of the [[current account]], which includes other transactions such as income from the [[international investment position]] as well as international aid. If the current account is in surplus, the country's net international asset position increases correspondingly. Equally, a deficit decreases the net international asset position.

The trade balance is identical to the difference between a country's output and its domestic demand (the difference between what goods a country produces and how many goods it buys from abroad; this does not include money re-spent on foreign stock, nor does it factor in the concept of importing goods to produce for the domestic market).

Measuring the balance of trade can be problematic because of problems with recording and collecting data. As an illustration of this problem, when official data for all the world's countries are added up, exports exceed imports by almost 1%; it appears the world is running a positive balance of trade with itself. This cannot be true, because all transactions involve an equal [[credit (finance)|credit]] or [[debit]] in the account of each nation. The discrepancy is widely believed to be explained by transactions intended to launder money or evade taxes, smuggling and other visibility problems. However, especially for developed countries, accuracy is likely.

Factors that can affect the balance of trade include:
*The cost of production (land, labor, capital, taxes, incentives, etc.) in the exporting economy ''vis-à-vis'' those in the importing economy;
*The cost and availability of raw materials, intermediate goods and other inputs;
*Exchange rate movements;
*Multilateral, bilateral and unilateral taxes or restrictions on trade;
*Non-tariff barriers such as environmental, health or safety standards;
*The availability of adequate foreign exchange with which to pay for imports; and
*Prices of goods manufactured at home (influenced by the responsiveness of supply)

In addition, the trade balance is likely to differ across the [[business cycle]]. In export-led growth (such as oil and early industrial goods), the balance of trade will improve during an economic expansion. However, with domestic demand led growth (as in the United States and Australia) the trade balance will worsen at the same stage in the business cycle.

Since the mid 1980s, the United States has had a growing deficit in tradeable goods, especially with Asian nations (China and Japan) which now hold large sums of U.S debt that has funded the consumption.&lt;ref name=Bivens/&gt;&lt;ref name=debt&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/tic/mfh.txt MAJOR FOREIGN HOLDERS OF TREASURY SECURITIES]. ''U.S. Treasury.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has a trade surplus with nations such as [[Australia]]. The issue of trade deficits can be complex. Trade deficits generated in tradeable goods such as manufactured goods or software may impact domestic employment to different degrees than trade deficits in raw materials.

Economies such as [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and [[Germany]] which have savings surpluses, typically run trade surpluses. [[China]], a high growth economy, has tended to run trade surpluses. A higher savings rate generally corresponds to a trade surplus. Correspondingly, the U.S. with its lower savings rate has tended to run high trade deficits, especially with Asian nations.

===Conditions where trade imbalances may be problematic===
Those who ignore the effects of long run trade deficits may be confusing [[David Ricardo]]'s principle of [[comparative advantage]] with [[Adam Smith]]'s principle of [[absolute advantage]], specifically ignoring the latter. The economist [[Paul Craig Roberts]] notes that the [[comparative advantage]] principles developed by [[David Ricardo]] do not hold where the factors of production are internationally mobile.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Paul Craig (August 7, 2003).

====The case of the United States====
Since the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s, the U.S. economy has been characterized by slower GDP growth. In 1985, the U.S. began its growing trade deficit with China. Over the long run, nations with trade surpluses tend also to have a savings surplus. The U.S. generally has lower savings rates than its trading partners, which tend to have trade surpluses. Germany, France, Japan, and Canada have maintained higher savings rates than the U.S. over the long run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=3839554 The shift away form thrift].''The Economist'', April 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditions where trade imbalances may not be problematic===
Small trade deficits are generally not considered to be harmful to either the importing or exporting economy. However, when a national trade imbalance expands beyond prudence (generally thought to be several{{clarify|date=November 2010}} percent of GDP, for several years), adjustments tend to occur. While unsustainable imbalances &lt;ref&gt;Aristovnik, Aleksander, 2006. &quot;Current Account Sustainability In Selected Transition Countries&quot; William Davidson Institute Working Papers Series WP844.&lt;/ref&gt; may persist for long periods (cf, [[Singapore]] and [[New Zealand]]’s surpluses and deficits, respectively), the distortions likely to be caused by large flows of wealth out of one economy and into another tend to become intolerable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} 

In simple terms, trade deficits are paid for out of [[foreign exchange reserves]], and may continue until such reserves are depleted. At such a point, the importer can no longer continue to purchase more than is sold abroad. This is likely to have [[exchange rate]] implications: a sharp loss of value in the deficit economy’s exchange rate with the surplus economy’s currency will change the relative price of [[tradable goods]], and facilitate a return to balance or (more likely) an over-shooting into surplus the other direction.

More complexly, an economy may be unable to export enough goods to pay for its imports, but is able to find funds elsewhere. [[Service exports]], for example, are more than sufficient to pay for [[Hong Kong]]’s domestic goods export shortfall. In poorer countries, [[foreign aid]] may fill the gap while in rapidly developing economies a [[capital account]] surplus often off-sets a [[current-account]] deficit. There are some economies where transfers from nationals working abroad contribute significantly to paying for imports. [[The Philippines]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Mexico]] are examples of transfer-rich economies.
Finally, a country may partially rebalance by use of [[quantitative easing]] at home. This involves a central bank buying back long term government bonds from other domestic financial institutions without reference to the interest rate (which is typically low when QE is called for), seriously increasing the money supply. This debases the local currency but also reduces the debt owed to foreign creditors - effectively &quot;exporting inflation&quot;.

===Adam Smith on trade deficits===
&quot;In the foregoing part of this chapter I have endeavoured to show, even upon the principles of the commercial system, how unnecessary it is to lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods from those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous.
Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this [absurd] doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium.&quot; (Smith, 1776, book IV, ch. iii, part ii)
&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam. (1776). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981, 2 vols., (1776) (reprint of the Clarendon Press edition, Oxford 1976, with Edward Cannan's original index from 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frédéric Bastiat on the fallacy of trade deficits===
The 19th century economist and philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] expressed the idea that trade deficits actually were a manifestation of profit, rather than a loss. He proposed as an example to suppose that he, a Frenchman, exported French wine and imported British coal, turning a profit. He supposed he was in France, and sent a cask of wine which was worth 50 francs to England. The customhouse would record an export of 50 francs. If, in England, the wine sold for 70 francs (or the pound equivalent), which he then used to buy coal, which he imported into France, and was found to be worth 90 francs in France, he would have made a profit of 40 francs. But the customhouse would say that the value of imports exceeded that of exports and was trade deficit against the ledger of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bastiat: Selected Essays&quot;&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss13.html Bastiat: Selected Essays]&lt;/ref&gt;

By ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', Bastiat argued that the national trade deficit was an indicator of a successful economy, rather than a failing one. Bastiat predicted that a successful, growing economy would result in greater trade deficits, and an unsuccessful, shrinking economy would result in lower trade deficits. This was later, in the 20th century, affirmed by economist [[Milton Friedman]].

===John Maynard Keynes on the balance of trade===
In the last few years of his life, [[John Maynard Keynes]] was much preoccupied with the question of balance in international trade. He was the leader of the British delegation to the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]] in 1944 that established the [[Bretton Woods system]] of international currency management.

He was the principal author of a proposal — the so-called Keynes Plan —— for an [[International Clearing Union]]. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by 'creating' additional 'international money', and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because &quot;American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher= Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages=326–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]], then editor of [[The Economist]], &quot;If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons
|year=1948|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas were informed by events prior to the [[Great Depression]] when — in the opinion of Keynes and others — international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages= 368–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, ''An Outline of Money'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey|title=An Outline of Money|version= Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, since the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971, with the increasing influence of [[Monetarist]] schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns — and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses — have largely disappeared from [[mainstream economics]] discourse&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Krugman, P and Wells, R (2006). &quot;Economics&quot;, Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and Keynes' insights have slipped from view.&lt;ref&gt;although see Duncan, R (2005). &quot;The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures&quot;, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example,{{cite web|url= http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/|title=Clearing Up This Mess| date=2008-11-18|accessdate=2009-01-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090123161345/http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/| archivedate= 23 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milton Friedman on trade deficits===
In the 1980s, [[Milton Friedman]], the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist and father of [[Monetarism]], contended that some of the concerns of trade deficits are unfair criticisms in an attempt to push macroeconomic policies favorable to exporting industries.

Prof. Friedman argued that trade deficits are not necessarily as important as high exports raise the value of the currency, reducing aforementioned exports, and vice versa for imports, thus naturally removing trade deficits '''not due to investment'''. Since 1971, when the Nixon administration decided to abolish fixed exchange rates, America's Current Account accumulated trade deficits have totaled $7.75 Trillion as of 2010. This deficit exists as it is matched by investment coming in to the United States- purely by the definition of the balance of payments, any current account deficit that exists is matched by an inflow of foreign investment. 

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. had experienced high inflation and Friedman's policy positions tended to defend the stronger dollar at that time. He stated his belief that these trade deficits were not necessarily harmful to the economy at the time since the currency comes back to the country (country A sells to country B, country B sells to country C who buys from country A, but the trade deficit only includes A and B). However, it may be in one form or another including the possible tradeoff of foreign control of assets. In his view, the &quot;worst case scenario&quot; of the currency never returning to the country of origin was actually the best possible outcome: the country actually purchased its goods by exchanging them for pieces of cheaply made paper. As Friedman put it, this would be the same result as if the exporting country burned the dollars it earned, never returning it to market circulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideachannel.tv/ ''Free to Choose'' video series from PBS]&lt;/ref&gt; 

This position is a more refined version of the theorem first discovered by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/LFBooks/Hume/hmMPL28.html|author=Hume, David|title=Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary|version=Eugene F. Miller, ed.|publisher=Liberty Fund, Inc|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume argued that England could not permanently gain from exports, because hoarding gold (i.e., currency) would make gold more plentiful in England; therefore, the prices of English goods would rise, making them less attractive exports and making foreign goods more attractive imports. In this way, countries' trade balances would balance out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Hume.html| title=David Hume: The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|year=2008|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman believed that deficits would be corrected by free markets as floating currency rates rise or fall with time to encourage or discourage imports in favor of the exports, reversing again in favor of imports as the currency gains strength. In the real world, a potential difficulty is that currency markets are far from a free market, with government and central banks being major players, and this is unlikely to change within the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, recent developments have shown that the global economy is undergoing a fundamental shift. For many years, the U.S. has borrowed and bought while in general, the rest of the world has lent and sold. 

As of October 2007, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro, British pound, and many other currencies. For instance, the euro hit $1.42 in October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/business/worldbusiness/19euro.html?ref=worldbusiness|work=The New York Times|title=Dollar Hits a New Low, Oil Hits a New High|first=Carter|last=Dougherty|date= October 19, 2007|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strongest it has been since its birth in 1999. Against this backdrop, American exporters are finding quite favorable overseas markets for their products and U.S. consumers are responding to their general housing slowdown by slowing their spending. Furthermore, China, the Middle East, central Europe and Africa are absorbing more of the world's imports which in the end may result in a world economy that is more evenly balanced. All of this could well add up to a major readjustment of the U.S. trade deficit, which as a percentage of GDP, began in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj-2007&quot;&gt;Michael M. Phillips, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119024783913033237.html?mod=todays_us_page_one World Economy in Flux As America Downshifts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman contended that the structure of the balance of payments was misleading. In an interview with Charlie Rose, he stated that &quot;on the books&quot; the US is a net borrower of funds, using those funds to pay for goods and services. He essentially claimed that the foreign assets were not carried on the books at their higher, truer value.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Friedman presented his analysis of the balance of trade in ''[[Free to Choose]]'', widely considered his most significant popular work.

===Warren Buffett on trade deficits===
The successful American businessman and investor [[Warren Buffett]] was quoted in the Associated Press (January 20, 2006) as saying &quot;The U.S trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political turmoil... Right now, the rest of the world owns $3 trillion more of us than we own of them.&quot; 

In a more detailed 2003 Fortune article, Buffett proposed a tool called [[Import Certificates]] as a solution to the United States' problem and ensure [[balanced trade]]. &quot;The rest of
the world owns a staggering $2.5 trillion more of the U.S. than we own of other countries. Some of this $2.5 trillion is invested in claim checks—U.S. bonds, both governmental and private— and some in such assets as property and equity securities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/growing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical balance of trade==
Monetary balance of trade is different from physical balance of trade&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6542 Physical Trade Balance, OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; (which is expressed in amount of raw materials, known also as Total Material Consumption). Developed countries usually import a lot of primary raw materials from developing countries at low prices. Often, these materials are then converted into finished products, and a significant amount of value is added. Although for instance the EU (as well as many other developed countries) has a balanced monetary balance of trade, its physical trade balance (especially with developing countries) is negative, meaning that a lot less material is exported than imported. For this reason, activists talk about the issue of [[ecological debt]] which implies a sort of predatory economic system. The nature of the trade balance statistics is such that it conceals distorted material flow.

==United States trade deficit==

The U.S. has held a trade deficit starting late in the 1960s. Its trade deficit has been increasing at a large rate since 1997 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/gands.txt&lt;/ref&gt; (See chart) and increased by 49.8 billion dollars between 2005 and 2006, setting a record high of 817.3 billion dollars, up from 767.5 billion dollars the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0004.html#2008 FTD - Statistics - Country Data - U.S. Trade Balance with World (Seasonally Adjusted)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The graph indicates that, as [[Frédéric Bastiat]] predicted, the deficit slackened during recessions and grew during periods of expansion. Also of note, many economists calculate trade deficits and/or current account deficits as a percentage of GDP. The US last had a trade surplus in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://usinfo.org/enus/economy/trade/docs/06s1288.xls&lt;/ref&gt; Every year there has been a major reduction in economic growth, it is followed by a reduction in the US trade deficit.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj-2007&quot;/&gt;
