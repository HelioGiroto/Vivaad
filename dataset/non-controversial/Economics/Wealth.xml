{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}
'''Wealth''' is the [[:wikt:abundance|abundance]] of [[Value (economics)|valuable]] [[resource]]s or material [[Property|possessions]]. The [[word]] wealth is derived from the old English ''weal'', which is from an [[Indo-European]] word stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wealth |title=wealth |publisher=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed. |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |accessdate=February 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual, community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources is known as wealthy.

The concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of [[economics]], and clearly so for [[growth economics]] and [[development economics]] yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. At the most general level, economists may define wealth as &quot;anything of value&quot; which captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts.&lt;ref name=&quot;goulet&quot;&gt;Denis &quot;Authentic Development: Is it Sustainable?&quot;, pp. 189-205 in ''Building Sustainable Societies'', Dennis Pirages, ed., [[M. E. Sharpe]], ISBN 1-56324-738-0, ISBN 978-1-56324-738-5. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Defining wealth can be a [[normative]] process with various [[ethical]] implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/467637 |first=Anthony T. |last=Kronman |title=Wealth Maximization as a Normative Principle |publisher=[[The Journal of Legal Studies]] |volume= 9 |date=March 1980 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heilbroner&quot;&gt;[[Robert L. Heilbroner]], 1987 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|2008]]. ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 880-83.

The [[United Nations]] definition of ''inclusive wealth'' is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human and physical assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;wealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Sponsored by |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21557732 |title=Free exchange: The real wealth of nations |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/iwr |title=Inclusive Wealth Report - IHDP |publisher=Ihdp.unu.edu |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural capital includes land, forests, [[fossil fuels]], and minerals.  Human capital is the population's education and skills.  Physical (or &quot;manufactured&quot;) capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.

==Definition==
For definitions of &quot;wealth,&quot; see also ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and [[Max Weber]], ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

[[Adam Smith]], in his seminal work ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', described wealth as &quot;the annual produce of the land and labour of the society&quot;. This &quot;produce&quot; is, at its simplest, that which satisfies human needs and wants of [[utility]]. In popular usage, wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic [[Value (economics)|value]], or the state of controlling or possessing such items, usually in the form of [[money]], [[real estate]] and personal [[property (ownership right)|property]]. An individual who is considered wealthy, affluent, or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group. In economics, [[Wealth (economics)|net wealth]] refers to the value of [[assets]] owned minus the value of [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]] owed at a point in time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Wealth can be categorized into three principal categories: [[personal property]], including homes or automobiles; monetary savings, such as the accumulation of past [[income]]; and the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] wealth of income producing assets, including [[real estate]], [[stocks]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and [[business]]es.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} All these delineations make wealth an especially important part of [[social stratification]]. Wealth provides a type of [[social safety net]] of protection against an unforeseen decline in one’s living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership, business ownership, or even a college education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth Publishing 2002&quot;/&gt; {{Failed verification|date=September 2008}}

'Wealth' refers to some ''accumulation'' of resources (net asset value), whether abundant or not. 'Richness' refers to an ''abundance'' of such resources (income or flow). A wealthy individual, community, or nation thus has more accumulated resources (capital) than a poor one. The opposite of wealth is destitution. The opposite of richness is [[poverty]].

The term implies a [[social contract]] on establishing and maintaining [[ownership]] in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner. The concept of wealth is relative and not only varies between societies, but varies between different sections or regions in the same society. A personal [[net worth]] of US $10,000 in most parts of the United States would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale. However, such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished [[developing country|developing countries]].

Concepts of wealth also vary across time. Modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the [[sciences]] have enabled the poorest sectors of today's society to enjoy a [[standard of living]] equivalent if not superior to the wealthy of the not-too-distant past. This comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future; given this trend{{cn|date=July 2012}} of human advancement, it is likely that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations.

[[Industrialization]] emphasized the role of technology. Many jobs were automated. Machines replaced some workers while other workers became more specialized. [[Labour specialization]] became critical to economic success. However, [[physical capital]], as it came to be known, consisting of both the [[natural capital]] and the [[infrastructural capital]], became the focus of the ''analysis of wealth''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Adam Smith]] saw wealth creation as the combination of materials, labour, land, and technology in such a way as to capture a profit (excess above the cost of production).&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg1&quot;&gt;Smith, Adam. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3300 An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]''&lt;/ref&gt; The theories of [[David Ricardo]], [[John Locke]], [[John Stuart Mill]], in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call [[classical economics]].

[[Marxian]] economics (''see [[labor theory of value]]'') distinguishes in the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' between material wealth and human wealth, defining human wealth as &quot;wealth in human relations&quot;; land and labour were the source of all material wealth.

[[Buckminster Fuller]] defines wealth in the following manner: “Wealth is our organized capability to cope effectively with the environment in sustaining our healthy regeneration and decreasing both the physical and metaphysical restrictions of the forward days of our lives.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bfi.org/about-bucky/resources/books/operating-manual-spaceship-earth/chapter-6-synergy |title=R. Buckminster Fuller, 1968. '&amp;#39;Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth'&amp;#39;. Chapter 6: Synergy |publisher=Bfi.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic analysis==
In [[economics]], wealth in a commonly applied [[accounting]] sense is the [[net worth]] of a person, household, or nation, that is, the value of all [[asset]]s owned net of all [[Liability (accounting)|liabilities]] owed at a point in time. For national wealth as measured in the [[national accounts]], the net liabilities are those owed to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;• [[Paul A. Samuelson]] and [[William Nordhaus|William D.

Economic terminology distinguishes between two types of variables: [[stock and flow]]. Wealth, as measurable ''at a date'' in time, is a ''[[Stock and flow|stock]]'', like the value of an orchard on December 31 minus debt owed on the orchard. For a given amount of wealth, say at the beginning of the year, [[Income#Economic definitions|income]] from that wealth, as measurable ''over'' say a year is a ''[[Stock and flow|flow]]''. What marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time, like the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year.

In [[macroeconomic]] theory the '[[wealth effect]]' may refer to the increase in aggregate consumption from an increase in national wealth. One measure of it is the [[wealth elasticity of demand]]. It is the percentage change in the amount demanded of [[National Income and Product Accounts#Accounting for national product: the right side of the report|consumption]] for each one-percent change in wealth.

Wealth may be measured in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal or real values]], that is in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes. The assets include those that are tangible ([[land (economics)|land]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]) and ''financial'' (money, bonds, etc.). Measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as [[human capital]] and [[social capital]]. In economics, 'wealth' corresponds to the [[accounting]] term '[[net worth]]'. But analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting (such as in [[national accounts]]). An example of the latter is [[generational accounting]] of [[social security]] systems to include the [[present value]] projected future outlays considered as liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;• Jagadeesh Gokhale, 2008. &quot;Generational accounting.&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_G000203&amp;q=generational%20accounting&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract] and  [http://64.233.169.132/search?q=cache:oSyxrjT2jbgJ:www.cato.org/pubs/articles/gokhale-generational_accounting.pdf uncorrected proof.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Laurence J. Kotlikoff, 1992, ''Generational Accounting''. [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Macroeconomic questions include whether the issuance of government bonds affects [[investment]] and [[National Income and Product Accounts#Accounting for national product: the right side of the report|consumption]] through the [[wealth effect]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J. Barro]], 1974. &quot;Are Government Bonds Net Wealth?&quot;, ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', 8(6), pp. [http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Teaching_Folder/Econ_202b_F2000/papers/Barro,_Bonds_Net_Wealth.pdf#page=2 1095-1111.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Environmental assets]] are not usually counted in measuring wealth, in part due to the difficulty of valuation for a [[public good|non-market good]]. Environmental or [[green accounting]] is a method of [[national accounts|social accounting]] for formulating and deriving such measures on the argument that an educated valuation is superior to a value of zero (as the implied valuation of environmental assets).&lt;ref&gt;• Sjak Smulders, 2008. &quot;green national accounting,&quot; ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_G000196&amp;edition=current&amp;q=environment&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=5 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[United States National Research Council]], 1994.

==Sociological treatments==
{{POV-section|date=April 2010}}
{{Globalize|date=July 2011}}
&quot;Wealth provides an important mechanism in the intergenerational transmission of inequality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth Publishing 2002&quot;&gt;[[Dennis Gilbert|Gilbert, Dennis]]. The American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality . N.p.: [[Wadsworth Publishing]];, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 10% of the wealthiest people in America inherited family fortunes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} But the effect of inherited wealth can also be seen on a more modest level. For example, a couple who buy a house with financial help from their parents or a student who has his or her college education paid for; in both scenarios the participants are benefiting directly from the accumulated wealth of previous generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth Publishing 2002&quot;/&gt;

===Wealth and social class===
[[Social class]] is not identical to wealth, but the two concepts are related (particularly in [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]]), leading to the combined concept of [[Socioeconomic status]].

Partly as a result of different economic conditions of life, members of different [[social classes]] often have different value systems and view the world in different ways. As such, there exist different &quot;conceptions of social reality, different aspirations and hopes and fears, different conceptions of the desirable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aspects of Poverty. Ed. Ben B Seligman. New York: [[Thomas Y. Crowell Co.]], 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The way the various social classes in society view wealth vary and these diverse characteristics are a fundamental dividing line among the classes. According to Richard H Ropers, the [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] in the United States is inequitably distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Ropers, Richard H, Ph.D. Persistent Poverty: The American Dream Turned Nightmare. New York: Insight Books, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the United States federal government reported that the net worth of the top 1 percent of people in the United States was approximately equal to that of the bottom 90 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth Publishing 2002&quot;/&gt;

====The upper class====
[[Upper class]] values include higher education, and the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth, the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks. Children of the upper class are typically schooled on how to manage this power and channel this privilege in different forms. It is in large part by accessing various edifices of information,{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} associates, procedures and auspices that the upper class are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherraden, Michael 1991&quot;&gt;Sherraden, Michael. Assets and the Poor: A New American Welfare Policy. Armonk: [[M. E. Sharpe]], Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The middle class====
The middle class places a greater emphasis on income. The [[middle class]] views wealth as something for emergencies and it is seen as more of a cushion. This class comprises people that were raised with families that typically owned their own home, planned ahead and stressed the importance of education and achievement. They earn a significant amount of income and also have significant amounts of consumption. However there is very limited savings (deferred consumption) or investments, besides retirement [[pension]]s and homeownership. They have been socialized to accumulate wealth through structured, institutionalized arrangements. Without this set structure, asset accumulation would likely not occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherraden, Michael 1991&quot;/&gt;

====The lower class====
Those with the least amount of wealth are the poor. (see [[underclass]]) Wealth accumulation for this class is to some extent prohibited. People that receive [[AFDC]] transfers cannot own more than a trivial amount of assets, in order to be eligible and remain qualified for income transfers. Most of the institutions that the poor encounter discourage any accumulation of assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherraden, Michael 1991&quot;/&gt;

===Distribution===
{{Main|Distribution of wealth}}

Although precise data are not available, the total [[household wealth]] in the world, excluding [[human capital]], has been estimated at $125 [[10^12|trillion]] (USD 125 x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) in year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/events/past-events/2006-events/en_GB/05-12-2006/ |publisher=Wider.unu.edu |title= The World Distribution of Household Wealth |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Including human capital, the United Nations estimated it in 2008 to be $118 trillion in the United States alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;wealth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/iwr |title=Inclusive Wealth Report - IHDP |publisher=Ihdp.unu.edu |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 90% of global wealth is distributed in North America, Europe, and &quot;rich [[Asia-Pacific]]&quot; countries (not including India),&lt;ref&gt;James B. Davies, Susanna Sandström, Anthony Shorrocks, and Edward N. Wolff. (2008). [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/discussion-papers/2008/en_GB/dp2008-03/ The World Distribution of Household Wealth, p8]. UNU-WIDER.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1% of adults are estimated to hold 40% of world wealth, a number which falls to 32% when adjusted for [[purchasing power parity]].&lt;ref&gt;James B. Davies, Susanna Sandström, Anthony Shorrocks, and Edward N. Wolff. (2008). [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/discussion-papers/2008/en_GB/dp2008-03/ The World Distribution of Household Wealth]. UNU-WIDER.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth in the form of land==
In the western tradition, the concepts of owning land and accumulating wealth in the form of land were engendered in the rise of the first [[State (polity)|state]], for a primary service and power of government was, and is to this day, the awarding and [[adjudication]] of [[land use rights]].

Land ownership was also justified according to [[John Locke]]. He claimed that because we mix{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} our labour with the land, we thereby deserve the right to control the use of the land and benefit from the product of that land (but subject to his [[Lockean proviso]] of &quot;at least where there is enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot;).

Additionally, in developed countries post-[[agrarian society]] ([[industrial society]]) this argument has many critics (including those influenced by [[Georgist]] and [[geolibertarian]] ideas) who argue that since land, by definition, is not a product of human labor, any claim of [[private property]] in it is a form of theft; as [[David Lloyd George]] observed, &quot;to prove a legal title to land one must trace it back to the man who stole it.&quot;

Many older ideas have resurfaced in the modern notions of [[ecological stewardship]], [[bioregionalism]], [[natural capital]], and [[ecological economics]].

==Anthropological views==
[[Anthropology]] characterizes societies, in part, based on a society's concept of wealth, and the institutional structures and [[power (sociology)|power]] used to protect this wealth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Several types are defined below. They can be viewed as an evolutionary progression.  Many young adolescents have become wealthy from the inheritance of their families.  

===The interpersonal concept===
Early [[Hominidae|hominid]]s seem to have started with incipient ideas of wealth,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} similar to that of the [[great ape]]s. But as tools, [[clothing]], and other mobile [[infrastructural capital]] became important to survival (especially in hostile [[biome]]s), ideas such as the [[inheritance]] of wealth, political positions,  [[leadership]], and ability to control group movements (to perhaps reinforce such power) emerged. [[Neandertal]] societies had pooled [[funerary rite]]s and [[cave painting]] which implies at least a notion of shared assets that could be spent for social purposes, or preserved for social purposes. Wealth may have been collective.

===Accumulation of non-necessities===
[[Human]]s back to and including the [[Cro-Magnon]]s seem to have had clearly defined rulers and status hierarchies.  [[Archaeology|Digs]] in [[Russia]] have revealed elaborate funeral clothing on a pair of children buried there over 35,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This indicates a considerable accumulation of wealth by some individuals or families. The high [[artisan]] skill also suggest the capacity to direct [[labour specialization|specialized labor]] to tasks that are not of any obvious utility to the group's survival.

===Control of arable land===
The rise of [[irrigation]] and [[urbanization]], especially in ancient [[Sumer]] and later [[Egypt]], unified the ideas of wealth and control of [[Real property|land]] and [[agriculture]]. To feed a large stable population, it was possible and necessary to achieve universal [[cultivation]] and [[city-state]] protection. The notion of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the notion of [[war]] are said to have emerged at this time. Tribal cultures were formalized into what we would call feudal systems, and many rights and obligations were assumed by the [[monarchy]] and related [[aristocracy]]. Protection of [[infrastructural capital]] built up over generations became critical: [[city wall]]s, [[irrigation system]]s, [[sewage system]]s, [[aqueduct]]s, [[building]]s, all impossible to replace within a single generation, and thus a matter of social survival to maintain. The [[social capital]] of entire societies was often defined in terms of its relation to [[infrastructural capital]] (e.g. [[castle]]s or [[fort]]s or an allied [[monastery]], [[cathedral]] or [[temple]]), and [[natural capital]], (i.e. the [[Soil|land]] that supplied locally grown food). [[Agricultural economics]] continues these traditions in the analyses of modern [[agricultural policy]] and related ideas of wealth, e.g. the ark of taste model of agricultural wealth.

===The role of technology===

[[Industrialization]] emphasized the role of technology. Many jobs were automated. Machines replaced some workers while other workers became more specialized. [[Labour specialization]] became critical to economic success.  However, [[physical capital]], as it came to be known, consisting of both the [[natural capital]] (raw materials from nature) and the [[infrastructural capital]] (facilitating technology), became the focus of the '''analysis of wealth'''.  [[Adam Smith]] saw wealth creation as the combination of materials, labour, land, and technology in such a way as to capture a profit (excess above the cost of production).&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg1&quot;/&gt;
