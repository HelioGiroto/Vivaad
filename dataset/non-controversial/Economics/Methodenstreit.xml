      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7020">'''''Methodenstreit''''' (German for &quot;method dispute&quot;), in intellectual history beyond German-language discourse, was an [[economics]] controversy carried on for about a decade around 1890, between that field's [[Austrian School]] and the (German) [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]]. On an intellectual level it concerned whether any science (as opposed to only history) could explain the dynamics of human action; politically, it reflected conflict between the [[minarchism]] of the early Austrian School and the [[welfare state]] advocated by the Historical School.

In it, [[Carl Menger]] led the supporters of the Austrian School's view, and [[Gustav von Schmoller]] proponents of the Historical School's.

(In German-speaking countries, the original of this [[List of German expressions in English|Germanism]] is not specific to the one controversy—which is likely to be specified as ''Methodenstreit der Nationalökonomie'', i.e. &quot;''Methodenstreit'' of economics&quot;.)

== History ==

=== Background ===
{{certainty}}
The Historical School contended that economists could develop new and better social laws from the collection and study of statistics and historical materials, and distrusted theories not derived from historical experience. Thus, the German Historical School focused on specific dynamic institutions as the largest variable in changes in political economy.  The Historical School were themselves reacting against [[Determinism#Determinism_in_Western_tradition|materialist determinism]], the idea that human action could, and would (once science advanced enough), be explained as physical and chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mises, Ludwig von: [http://www.mises.org/hsofase/ch2sec3.asp &quot;The Historical Setting of the Austrian School of Economics&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian School, carefully founded and first developed by [[Carl Menger]] in the 1860ies, and published in 1871 as ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'' (English title: ''[[Principles of Economics]]''), by contrast believed that economics was the work of philosophical logic and could only ever be about developing rules from first principles&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; seeing human motives and social interaction as far too complex to be amenable to statistical analysis&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; and purporting their theories of human action to be universally valid.

=== Menger and the German Historical School ===

The first move was when [[Carl Menger]] attacked Schmoller and the German Historical School, in his 1883 book ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (Untersuchungen über die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der politischen Ökonomie insbesondere).'' Menger thought the best method of studying economics was through reason and finding general theories which applied to broad areas. Menger, as did the Austrians and other neo-classical economists, concentrated upon the subjective, atomistic nature of economics. He emphasized the subjective factors. He said the grounds for economics were built upon self-interest, [[marginalism|evaluation on the margin]], and incomplete knowledge. He said aggregative, collective ideas could not have adequate foundation unless they rested upon individual components. 

The direct attack on the German Historical School lead Schmoller to responded quickly with an unfavourable and quite hostile review of Menger's book.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Zur Methodologie der Staats- und Sozialwissenschaften&quot; in ''Jahrbuch für Gesetzgebung, Verwaltung und Volkswirtschaft im deutchen Reich'' 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; Menger accepted the challenge and replied in a passionate pamphlet,&lt;ref&gt;''Irrthümer des Historismus in der deutschen Nationalökonomie'', 1884&lt;/ref&gt; written in the form of letters to a friend, in which he (according to Hayek) &quot;ruthlessly demolished Schmoller's position&quot;. The encounter between the masters was soon imitated by their disciples. A degree of hostility not often equaled in scientific controversy developed.&lt;ref&gt;'Carl Menger'. Introduction by [[Friedrich A. Hayek]], printed in the English translation of Carl Menger's ''[[Principles of Economics]]'', New York University Press, 1981. page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

The term &quot;Austrian school of economics&quot; came into existence as a result of the ''Methodenstreit,'' when Schmoller used it in an unfavourable review of one of Menger's later books, intending to convey an impression of backwardness and [[obscurantism]] of [[Habsburg Austria]] compared to the more modern [[Prussia]]ns. A serious consequence of the hostile debate was that Schmoller went so far as to declare publicly that members of the &quot;abstract&quot; school were unfit to fill a teaching position in a German university, and his influence was quite sufficient to make this equivalent to a complete exclusion of all adherents to Menger's doctrines from academic positions in Germany. The result was that even thirty years after the close of the controversy Germany was still less affected by the new ideas now spreading elsewhere, than any other academically important country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related rivalry ==

Another famous — and somewhat related — ''Methodenstreit'' in the 1890s pitted the German social and economic historian [[Karl Lamprecht]] against several prominent political historians, particularly [[Friedrich Meinecke]], over Lamprecht's use of social scientific and psychological methods in his research. The dispute resulted in Lamprecht and his work being widely discredited among academic German historians. As a consequence, German historians pursued more political and ideological historical questions, while Lamprecht's style of [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] history was largely abandoned. Lamprecht's work remained influential elsewhere, however, particularly in the tradition of the French [[Annales School]].
