The second panel shows the two debt figures as a percentage of U.S. GDP (dollar value of U.S. economic production for that year). The top panel is deflated so every year is in 2010 dollars.]]

The '''United States public debt''' is the money borrowed by the [[federal government of the United States]] through the issue of [[Security (finance)|securities]] by the [[United States Treasury|Treasury]] and other federal government agencies. US [[government debt|public debt]] consists of two components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html#largefeddebt |title=Federal debt basics – How large is the federal debt? |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Debt held by the public'' includes Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government, including that held by individuals, corporations, the [[Federal Reserve System]] and foreign, state and local governments.
* ''Debt held by government accounts or intragovernmental debt'' includes non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts administered by the federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries, such as the [[Social Security Trust Fund]]. Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of these accounts that have been invested in Treasury securities.

Public debt increases or decreases as a result of the annual [[unified budget]] deficit or surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf |title=Historical Tables – Table 1.2 – Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) as Percentages of GDP: 1930–2017 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Office of Management and Budget]] |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal [[government budget deficit]] or surplus is the difference between government receipts and spending, ignoring intra-governmental transfers. However, some spending that is excluded from the deficit (supplemental appropriations) also adds to the debt.

Historically, the US has incurred debt during wars and recessions, but then debt subsequently declined afterwards. For example, debt held by the public as a share of [[GDP]] peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the next 30 years. In recent decades however, large budget deficits and the resulting increases in debt have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/index.html |title=Federal Debt: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 2012, debt held by the public was approximately $11.411 trillion or about 72% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $4.850 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $16.261 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2012/09/us-national-debt.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TreasPenny&quot;/&gt; As of July 2012, $5.3 trillion or approximately 48% of the debt held by the public was owned by foreign investors, the largest of which were China and Japan at just over $1.1 trillion each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt U.S. Treasury-Data Chart Center-Retrieved April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], averting a possible [[default (finance)|financial default]]. During June 2011, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] called for &quot;...large and rapid policy changes to put the nation on a sustainable fiscal course.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/122xx/doc12212/2011_06_22_summary.pdf CBO-2011 Long Term Budget Outlook]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Publicly Held Federal Debt 1790-2009.png|thumb|right|340px|U.S. federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to 2009]]
{{Main|History of the United States public debt}}

Except for about a year during 1835–1836, the United States has continuously held a public debt since the US Constitution legally went into effect on March 4, 1789. Debts incurred during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and under the [[Articles of Confederation]] amounted to $75,463,476.52 on January 1, 1791. From 1796 to 1811 there were 14 budget surpluses and 2 deficits. There was a sharp increase in the debt as a result of the [[War of 1812]]. In the 20 years following that war, there were 18 surpluses. The federal government actually paid off its debt entirely in January 1835, only to begin accruing debt anew by 1836 (the debt on January 1, 1836 was $37,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/history/1800.htm |title= Bureau of the Public Debt: The 19th Century |accessdate= July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/11/george-lemieux/fla-senator-says-jan-8-1835-only-day-us-has-been-d/ |title= PolitiFact: Fla. senator says Jan. 8, 1835, is the only day U.S. has been debt free |accessdate= July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sharp increase in the debt occurred as a result of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The debt was $65&amp;nbsp;million in 1860, but passed $1&amp;nbsp;billion in 1863 and reached $2.7&amp;nbsp;billion by the end of the war. During the following 47 years, there were 36 surpluses and 11 deficits. During this period 55% of the national debt was paid off. Debt increased again during [[World War I]] (1914–1918), reaching $25.5 billion at its conclusion. This was followed by 11 consecutive surpluses that saw the debt reduced by 36%.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Federal Debt&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Historical Data on the Federal Debt | url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/21728 | publisher=Congressional Budget Office | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | date=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next period of major increase in the national debt took place between 1930 and 1945. In 1930, debt held by the public stood at $15.05&amp;nbsp;billion or 16.5% of GDP. Decreased tax revenues and social programs enacted during the [[Great Depression]] increased the debt, and by 1939, the debt held by the public had increased to $39.65&amp;nbsp;billion or 43% of GDP. The buildup and involvement in [[World War II]] during the  [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] presidencies caused an even larger increase; debt held by the public had reached $251.43&amp;nbsp;billion or 112.% of GDP at its conclusion in 1945. [[Post–World War II economic expansion|Rapid economic growth after the war]] reduced debt as a percentage of GDP, and it reached a post-WWII low of 24.6% in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Federal Debt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/pdfs/federal-debt-public.pdf |title=Federal Debt Held by the Public as a Share of GDP (1797-2010) |format=PDF |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt held by the public relative to GDP rose rapidly again in the 1980s. President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Reaganomics|economic policies]] lowered tax rates and increased military spending, while congressional Democrats blocked attempts to reverse spending on social programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/us/politics/28default.html?pagewanted=all | work=New York Times | title=Q. and A. on the Debt Ceiling | date=2011-07-27 | accessdate=2011-12-26 | first1=Michael, Louise | last1=Cooper, Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis S.

ISBN 978-0-271-02260-4. p. 185-186&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, debt as a share of GDP increased from 26.2% in 1980 to 40.9% in 1988, and continued to rise during the presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]], reaching 48.3% of GDP in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Federal Debt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11766 |title=Congressional Budget Office – Historical Data on the Federal Debt |author= |work=cbo.gov |year=2010 |accessdate= January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt held by the public reached 49.5% of GDP at the beginning of [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]]'s first term. However, it fell to 34.5% of GDP by the end of Clinton's presidency due in part to decreased military spending, increased taxes (in [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990|1990]], [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|1993]] and [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997|1997]]), and increased tax revenue resulting from the [[Dot-com bubble]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Federal Debt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton/ FactCheck.org : The Budget and Deficit Under Clinton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-nbc-florida-debate/2012/01/23/gIQAEJCiMQ_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Glenn | last=Kessler | title=Fact checking the NBC Florida debate | date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/barbara-boxers-gross-rewriting-of-history/2011/06/30/AGFGVqsH_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Glenn | last=Kessler | title=Barbara Boxer's blatant rewriting of history | date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget controls instituted in the 1990s successfully restrained fiscal action by the Congress and the President and together with economic growth contributed to the budget surpluses at the end of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04485sp.pdf Federal Debt: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions: An Upadate] – [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, debt relative to GDP rose again due in part to the [[Bush tax cuts]] and increased military spending caused by the wars in the Middle-East and a new entitlement Medicare D program. During the presidency of [[George W. Bush]], debt held by the public increased from $3.339&amp;nbsp;trillion in September 2001 to $6.369&amp;nbsp;trillion by the end of 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;TreasPenny&quot;&gt;United States Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (December 2010).

===Change in debt position since 2001===
[[File:Cause of change in U.S. debt position 2001-2011.png|thumb|340px|Cause of change between CBO's 2001 projection of a $5.6 trillion surplus between 2002-2012 and the $6.1 trillion debt increase that actually occurred.]]

The [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] has summarized the cause of change between its January 2001 estimate of a $5.6 trillion cumulative surplus between 2002 and 2011 and the actual $6.1 trillion cumulative deficit that occurred, an unfavorable &quot;turnaround&quot; or debt increase of $11.7 trillion. Tax cuts and slower-than-expected growth reduced revenues by $6.1 trillion and spending was $5.6 trillion higher. Of this total, the CBO attributes 72% to legislated tax cuts and spending increases and 27% to economic and technical factors. Of the latter, 56% occurred from 2009 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/the-fiscal-legacy-of-george-w-bush/ NYT-Bruce Bartlett-The Fiscal Legacy of George W. Bush-June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baseline&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/publication/41463 CBO-Changes in CBO's Baseline Projections Since 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the projected and actual debt in 2011 can be largely attributed to:
* $3.5 trillion – Economic changes (including lower than expected tax revenues and higher safety net spending due to recession)
* $1.6 trillion – [[Bush Tax Cuts]] (EGTRRA and JGTRRA), primarily tax cuts but also some smaller spending increases
* $1.5 trillion – Increased defense baseline budget and non-defense discretionary spending under both the Bush and Obama administrations
* $1.4 trillion – Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
* $1.4 trillion – Incremental interest due to higher debt balances
* $0.9 trillion – Stimulus and tax cuts since 2008 (Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, ARRA and Tax Act of 2010)&lt;ref name=baseline /&gt;

Several other sources have used CBO data to summarize the results in various ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov/Where Debt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/26/infographic-where-does-our-national-debt-come |publisher=Office of Management and Budget|title=Where Does our National Debt Come From? |accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/opinion/sunday/24sun4.html How the Deficit Got This Big]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Fact_Sheets/Economic_Policy/drivers_federal_debt_since_2001.pdf The Great Debt Shift]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation and measurement==
===Public and government accounts===
[[File:Holders of the National Debt of the United States.gif|thumb|right|300px|Detailed breakdown of government holders of treasury debt and debt instruments used of the public portion.]]
[[File:Usa national debt 20 April 2012.JPG|thumb|300px|U.S. national debt live panel, in New York, April 20, 2012]]

The total or gross national debt is the sum of the &quot;debt held by the public&quot; and &quot;intragovernmental&quot; debt. As of October 2012, the &quot;debt held by the public&quot; was $11.35 trillion and the &quot;intragovernmental debt&quot; was $4.85 trillion, for a total of $16.2 trillion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np]&lt;/ref&gt;

The national debt can also be classified into marketable or non-marketable securities. As of March 2012, total marketable securities were $10.34 trillion while the non-marketable securities were $5.24 trillion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Most of the marketable securities are Treasury notes, bills, and bonds held by investors and governments globally. The non-marketable securities are mainly the &quot;government account series&quot; owed to certain government trust funds such as the [[Social Security Trust Fund]], which represented $2.7 trillion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2012/tr2012.pdf Social Security Trustees Report-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The non-marketable securities represent amounts owed to program beneficiaries. For example, in the case of the Social Security Trust Fund, the payroll taxes dedicated to Social Security were credited to the Trust Fund upon receipt, but spent for other purposes. If the government continues to run deficits in other parts of the budget, the government will have to issue debt held by the public to fund the Social Security Trust Fund, in effect exchanging one type of debt for the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/index.html |title=Social Security Trust Fund 2010 Report Summary |publisher=Ssa.gov |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other large intragovernmental holders include the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation's Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Medicare).

===Accounting treatment===
Only debt held by the public is reported as a liability on the consolidated financial statements of the United States government. Debt held by government accounts is an asset to those accounts but a liability to the Treasury; they offset each other in the consolidated financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html#difference |title=Federal debt basics – What is the difference between the two types of federal debt? |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deficit is presented on a [[Comparison of Cash Method and Accrual Method of accounting|cash]] rather than an [[accruals]] basis, although the accrual basis may provide more information on the longer-term implications of the government's annual operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/deficit/ |title=Measuring the Deficit: Cash vs. Accrual |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations excluded===
{{See also| Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac}}
Although not included in the debt figures reported by the government, the U.S. government has moved to more explicitly support the soundness of obligations of [[Freddie Mac]] and [[Fannie Mae]], starting in July 2008 via the [[Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008]], and the September 7, 2008 [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) conservatorship of both [[government sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs). The on- or off-balance sheet obligations of those two independent GSEs was just over $5&amp;nbsp;trillion at the time the conservatorship was put in place, consisting mainly of mortgage payment guarantees.&lt;ref name=agencies&gt;Barr, Colin (September 7, 2008). [http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/06/news/economy/fannie_freddie_paulson.fortune &quot;Paulson readies the 'bazooka'&quot;].  CNNMoney. Retrieved January 17, 2011.
&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the government will be required to pay these obligations depends on a variety of economic and housing market factors. The federal government provided over $110&amp;nbsp;billion to Fannie and Freddie by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/storysupplement/economy/bailouttracker/ |title=CNN Bailout Tracker-Viewed April 2011 |publisher=CNN  |date=November 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |first=David |last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guaranteed obligations excluded===
{{See also|Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program|Exchange Stabilization Fund}}
U.S. federal government guarantees are not included in the public debt total, until such time as there is a call on the guarantees. For example, the U.S. federal government in late-2008 guaranteed large amounts of obligations of mutual funds, banks, and corporations under several programs designed to deal with the problems arising from the [[late-2000s financial crisis]]. The funding of direct investments made in response to the crisis, such as those made under the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]], are included in the debt.

===Unfunded obligations excluded===
The U.S. government is obligated under current law to mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The  [[Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office (GAO)]] projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAOCitiz&quot;/&gt; The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8&amp;nbsp;trillion. This is the amount that would have had to be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7&amp;nbsp;trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2&amp;nbsp;trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Peterson Foundation (April 2010). [http://www.pgpf.org/Special-Topics/Download-the-Citizens-Guide.aspx &quot;Citizen's guide 2010:  Figure 10&quot;], p. 30. Peter G. Peterson Foundation [website]. Retrieved February 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt.

The  [[Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office (CBO)]] has indicated that: &quot;Future growth in spending per beneficiary for Medicare and Medicaid – the federal government’s major health care programs – will be the most important determinant of long-term trends in federal spending. Changing those programs in ways that reduce the growth of costs – which will be difficult, in part because of the complexity of health policy choices – is ultimately the nation’s central long-term challenge in setting federal fiscal policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Orzag, Peter R. (June 17, 2008). [http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/93xx/doc9385/06-17-LTBO_Testimony.pdf &quot;The long-term budget outlook and options for slowing the growth of health care costs&quot;].

===Measuring debt relative to gross domestic product===
[[File:Federal debt to GDP - 2000 to 2010.png|thumb|300px|right|2010 Budget: Total Debt $ and % to GDP 2000–2010]]
GDP is a measure of the total size and output of the economy. One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP. In the 2007 fiscal year, U.S. federal debt held by the public was approximately $5&amp;nbsp;trillion (36.8 percent of GDP) and total debt was $9&amp;nbsp;trillion (65.5 percent of GDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/pdf/hist.pdf |title=Historical Tables of the FY 2009 Budget |format=PDF |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debt held by the public represents money owed to those holding government securities such as Treasury bills and bonds. Total debt includes intra-governmental debt, which includes amounts owed to the Social Security Trust Funds (about $2.2&amp;nbsp;trillion in FY 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/tr08.pdf Social Security Trust Fund Report], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and Civil Service Retirement Funds. By August 2008, the total debt was $9.6&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/ |title=U.S. National Debt Clock |publisher=Brillig.com |date=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the 2010 U.S. budget, total national debt will nearly double in dollar terms between 2008 and 2015 and will grow to nearly 100% of GDP, versus a level of approximately 80% in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2010-SUMMARY/pdf/BUDGET-2010-SUMMARY.pdf 2010 Budget-Summary Tables S-13 and S-14]&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple government sources including the current and previous presidents, the GAO, Treasury Department, and CBO have said the United States is on an unsustainable fiscal path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/weekly_address/ |title=President's Radio Address – May&amp;nbsp;16, 2009 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ahead of predictions, total national debt reached 100% by the third quarter of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/04/us-debt-reaches-100-percent-countrys-gdp U.S. Debt Reaches 100 Percent of Country's GDP] August 4, 2011, FoxNews.com&lt;/ref&gt; If counted using the total public debt outstanding over the annual GDP in chained 2005 dollars, the ratio reached 115% on Feb. 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conscience-sociale.blogspot.com/2012/02/us-public-debt-to-gdp-ratio-is-115.html Conscience Sociale: US public debt to GDP ratio is 115 % !&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the debt ratio increases, the exchange value of the dollar may fall. Paying back debt with cheaper currency could cause investors (including other governments) to demand higher interest rates if they anticipate further dollar depreciation. Paying higher interest rates could slow domestic U.S. growth.

Higher debt increases interest payments on the debt, which already exceed $430&amp;nbsp;billion annually as discussed below, or about 15 cents of every tax dollar for 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/05/barack_obamas_risky_deficit_sp.html |title=Samuelson – Risky Deficit Spending |publisher=Realclearmarkets.com |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the CIA Factbook, nine countries have debt to GDP ratios over 100% for 2010, the largest of which is Japan at approximately 197.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2186rank.html |title=CIA Factbook 2010 |publisher=Cia.gov |date=November 20, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, a high public debt to GDP ratio may also slow economic growth. Economists [[Carmen Reinhart]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff]] calculated that countries with public debt above 90 percent of GDP grow by an average of 1.3 percentage points per year slower than less indebted countries. The public debt-to-GDP ratio in March 2010 is about 60 percent of GDP; CBO projects it will reach 90 percent around 2020 under policies in place in 2010. If growth slows, all of the economic challenges the United States faces will worsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/901330_burman_testimony.pdf |title=Statement of Leonard E.

===Calculating the annual change in debt===
[[File:Deficit to Change in Debt Comparison - 2008.png|thumb|300px|right|Comparison of deficits to change in debt in 2008]]

The annual change in debt is not equal to the &quot;total deficit&quot; typically reported in the media. Social Security payroll taxes and benefit payments, along with the net balance of the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], are considered &quot;off-budget&quot;, while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered &quot;on-budget.&quot;  The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998–FY2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls Table 1.1 – Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789–2017] Whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

In large part because of Social Security surpluses, the total deficit is smaller than the on-budget deficit. The surplus of Social Security payroll taxes over benefit payments is spent by the government for other purposes. However, the government credits the Social Security Trust fund for the surplus amount, adding to the &quot;intragovernmental debt.&quot; The total federal debt is divided into &quot;intragovernmental debt&quot; and &quot;debt held by the public.&quot;  In other words, spending the &quot;off budget&quot; Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the surplus reduces the &quot;total&quot; deficit reported in the media.

Certain spending called &quot;supplemental appropriations&quot; is outside the budget process entirely but adds to the national debt. Funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama administration. Certain stimulus measures and [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]] are also outside the budget process.

For example, in FY2008 an off-budget surplus of $183&amp;nbsp;billion reduced the on-budget deficit of $642&amp;nbsp;billion, resulting in a total federal deficit of $459&amp;nbsp;billion. Media often reported the latter figure. The national debt increased by $1,017&amp;nbsp;billion between the end of FY2007 and the end of FY2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist07z1.xls OMB, Historical Statistics, Table 7.1.]&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government publishes the total debt owed (public and intragovernmental holdings) at the end of each fiscal year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm |title=Treasurydirect.gov |publisher=Treasurydirect.gov |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since FY1957 the amount of debt held by the federal government has increased each year.

==Debt ceiling==&lt;!-- Incoming redirect(s): US debt ceiling --&gt;
{{See also|United States debt-ceiling crisis}}
[[File:US Public Debt Ceiling 1981-2010.png|thumb|300px|US debt ceiling at the end of each year from 1981 to 2010.]]
Under Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution, Congress has the sole power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. From the founding of the United States until 1917 Congress directly authorized each individual debt issuance separately. In order to provide more flexibility to finance the United States' involvement in [[World War I]], Congress modified the method by which it authorizes debt in the [[Second Liberty Bond Act]] of 1917.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 65-43, 40 Stat. 288, enacted September 24, 1917, Currently codified as amended as 31 U.S.C. § 3101.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this act Congress established an aggregate limit, or &quot;ceiling,&quot; on the total amount of bonds that could be issued.

The current debt ceiling, in which an aggregate limit is applied to nearly all federal debt, was substantially established by [[Public Debt Acts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/major-acts-congress/public-debt-acts |title=Public Debt Acts: Major Acts of Congress |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freegovreports.com/index.php/finance/193-a-brief-history-of-the-us-federal-debt-limit |title=A Brief History of the U.S. Federal Debt Limit |publisher=Freegovreports.com |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed in 1939 and 1941. The Treasury is authorized to issue debt needed to fund government operations (as authorized by each federal budget) up to a stated debt ceiling, with some small exceptions.

The process of setting the debt ceiling is separate and distinct from the regular process of financing government operations, and raising the debt ceiling does not have any direct impact on the budget deficit. The U.S. government proposes a federal budget every year, which must be approved by Congress. This budget details projected tax collections and outlays and, if there is a budget deficit, the amount of borrowing the government would have to do in that fiscal year. A vote to increase the debt ceiling is, therefore, usually treated as a formality, needed to continue spending that has already been approved previously by the Congress and the President. The  [[Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office (GAO)]] explains: &quot;The debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits or incur obligations. Rather, it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Government Accountability Office&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Debt Limit: Delays Create Debt Management Challenges and Increase Uncertainty in the Treasury Market |author=[[Government Accountability Office]] |url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-203 |date=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent redundancy of the debt ceiling has led to suggestions that it should be abolished altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2294209/|title=Debt ceiling crisis: The debt ceiling is a pointless, dangerous relic, and it should be abolished|first=Annie|last=Lowrey|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=May 16, 2011|accessdate=August 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59236.html|title=Moody's: Abolish the debt limit|first=Jennifer|last=Epstein|publisher=Politico|accessdate=August 1, 2011|date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1979, the House of Representatives passed a rule to automatically raise the debt ceiling when passing a budget, without the need for a separate vote on the debt ceiling, except when the House votes to waive or repeal this rule. The exception to the rule was invoked in 1995, which resulted in [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996|two government shutdowns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0104/Five-ways-Republicans-will-change-the-House/Repeal-of-the-Gephardt-rule| title= Repeal of the Gephardt rule| author=Gail Russell Chaddock| date=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the debt ceiling is reached, Treasury can declare a debt issuance suspension period and utilize &quot;extraordinary measures&quot;  to acquire funds to meet federal obligations but which do not require the issue of new debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geithner_20110404&quot;&gt;Letter to Congress of April 4, 2011, Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Treasury first used these measures on December 16, 2009, to remain within the debt ceiling, and avoid a government shutdown,&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5987341-503544.html |title=U.S. National Debt Tops Debt Limit |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also used it during the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis|debt-ceiling crisis of 2011]]. However, there are limits to how much can be raised by these measures.

The debt ceiling was increased on February 12, 2010, to $14.294&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|H.J.RES.|45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HRRES45&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HJ00045:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status – 111th Congress (2009–2010) – H.J.RES.45 – CRS Summary – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov | date = February 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/12/us-usa-obama-debt-sign-idUSTRE61B4AU20100212 |title=Obama signs debt limit-paygo bill into law |agency=Reuters | date = February 12, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2011 |first=Matt |last=Spetalnick}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 2011, Congress finally passed the [[2011 United States federal budget]], authorizing federal government spending for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year, which ends on September 30, 2011, with a deficit of $1.48&amp;nbsp;trillion, {{Citation needed|date = August 2011}}  without voting to increase the debt ceiling. The two Houses of Congress were unable to agree on a revision of the debt ceiling in mid-2011, resulting in the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis]]. The impasse was resolved with the passing on August 2, 2011, the deadline for a default by the U.S. government on its debt, of the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which immediately increased the debt ceiling to $14.694 trillion, required a vote on a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]], and established several complex mechanisms to further increase the debt ceiling and reduce federal spending.

On September 8, 2011, one of the complex mechanisms to further increase the debt ceiling took place as the Senate defeated a resolution to block a $500 billion automatic increase. The Senate's action allowed the debt ceiling to increase to $15.194 trillion, as agreed upon in the Budget Control Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/180471-senate-sinks-debt-ceiling-disapproval-bill?page=2#comments Senate sinks debt-ceiling disapproval bill]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the third increase in the debt ceiling in 19 months, the fifth increase since President Obama took office, and the twelfth increase in 10 years. The August 2 Act also created the [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction]] for the purpose of developing a set of proposals by November 23, 2011, to reduce federal spending by $1.2 trillion. The Act requires both houses of Congress to convene an &quot;up-or-down&quot; vote on the proposals as a whole by December 23, 2011. The Joint Select Committee met for the first time on September 8, 2011.

The debt ceiling was raised once more on January 30, 2012, to a new high of $16.394 trillion.

==Debt holdings==
[[File:Estimated ownership of treasury securities by year.gif|thumb|right|300px|Estimated ownership each year.]]
Because a large variety of people own the notes, bills, and bonds in the &quot;public&quot; portion of the debt, Treasury also publishes information that groups the types of holders by general categories to portray who owns United States debt. In this data set, some of the public portion is moved and combined with the total government portion, because this amount is owned by the Federal Reserve as part of United States monetary policy. (See [[Federal Reserve System]].)

As is apparent from the chart, a little less than half of the total national debt is owed to the &quot;Federal Reserve and intragovernmental holdings&quot;. The foreign and international holders of the debt are also put together from the notes, bills, and bonds sections. To the right is a chart for the data as of June 2008:

==Forecasting==
{{Further|United States federal budget}}
Tracking current levels of debt is a cumbersome but fairly straightforward process. Making future projections is much more difficult for a number of reasons. For example, before the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[George W. Bush administration]] projected in the 2002 budget that there would be a $1.288&amp;nbsp;trillion surplus from 2001 through 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President (April 9, 2001) [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy02/pdf/budget.pdf ''Fiscal year 2002:  Budget of the United States Government''], p. 224. Government Printing Office [website]. Retrieved February 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 Mid-Session Review this had changed to a projected four-year deficit of $851&amp;nbsp;billion, a swing of $2.138&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President (July 30, 2004). [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy05/pdf/05msr.pdf ''Fiscal year 2005:  Midsession review:  Budget of the U.S. Government''], p. 28.  GPO Access. Retrieved February 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter document states that 49% of this swing was due to &quot;economic and technical re-estimates&quot;, 29% was due to &quot;tax relief&quot; (mainly the [[Bush Tax Cuts]]), and the remaining 22% was due to &quot;war, homeland, and other enacted legislation&quot; (mainly expenditures for the [[War on Terror]], [[Iraq War]], and [[homeland security]]).

Projections between different groups will sometimes differ because they make different assumptions. For example, in August 2003, a [[Congressional Budget Office]] report projected a $1.4&amp;nbsp;trillion deficit from 2004 through 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Budget Office, Congress of the United States (August 2003). [http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/44xx/doc4493/08-26-Report.pdf &quot;The budget and economic outlook: An update&quot;], pp. 16–17.  Congressional Budget Office [website]. Retrieved February 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a mid-term and long-term joint analysis a month later by the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]], the [[Committee for Economic Development]], and the [[Concord Coalition]] stated that &quot;In projecting deficits, CBO follows mechanical 'baseline' rules that do not allow it to account for the costs of any prospective tax or entitlement legislation, no matter how likely the enactment of such legislation may be.&quot;  The analysis added in a proposed tax cut extension and [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] reform (enacted by a [[Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005|2005 act]]), prescription drug plan ([[Medicare Part D]], enacted in a [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|2003 act]]), and further increases in defense, homeland security, international, and domestic spending. According to the report, this &quot;adjusts CBO's official ten-year projections for more realistic assumptions about the costs of budget policies&quot;, raising the projected deficit from $1.4&amp;nbsp;trillion to $5&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Committee for Economic Development, and Concord Coalition (September 29, 2003).

The Office of Management and Budget forecasts that, by the end of fiscal year 2012, gross federal debt will total $16.3&amp;nbsp;trillion. Thus, the projected debt will equal 101% of projected gross domestic product, which represents a milestone in the U.S. economy. Public debt alone, which excludes amounts that the government owes its citizens via various trust funds, will be 67% of GDP by the end of fiscal 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Jacobson (March 26, 2010).

Historical analysis of government spending or debt relative to GDP can be misleading, according to the [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]], the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] and Treasury Department. This is because demographic shifts and per-capita spending are causing Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid expenditures to grow significantly faster than GDP. If this trend continues, government simulations under various assumptions project mandatory spending for these programs will exceed taxes dedicated to these programs by more than $40&amp;nbsp;trillion over the next 75 years on a present value basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAO Presentation-January 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/cghome/d08446cg.pdf |title=GAO-08-446CG U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing, presented by the Honorable David M.

According to the GAO, this will double debt-to-GDP ratios by 2040 and double them again by 2060, reaching 600% by 2080.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-94R |title=The Nation's Long-Term Fiscal Outlook: September 2008 Update |publisher=Gao.gov |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GAO simulation indicates that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid expenditures alone will exceed 20% of GDP by 2080, which is approximately the historical ratio of taxes collected by the federal government. In other words, these mandatory programs alone will take up all government revenues under this simulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAO Presentation-January 2008&quot;/&gt;

===CBO long-term scenarios===
[[File:CBO - Public Debt Scenarios - June 2011.png|thumb|350px|right|CBO-Public Debt Under &quot;Extended&quot; and &quot;Alternate&quot; Scenarios]]
The [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] reported during June 2011 two scenarios for how debt held by the public will change during the 2010–2035 time period. The &quot;extended baseline scenario&quot; assumes that the [[Bush tax cuts]] (extended by Obama) will expire per current law in 2012. It also assumes the alternative minimum tax (AMT) will be allowed to affect more middle-class families, Medicare reimbursement rates to doctors will go down, and that revenues will reach 23% of GDP by 2035, much higher than the historical average of 18%. Under this scenario, government spending on everything other than the major mandatory health care programs, Social Security, and interest on federal debt (activities such as national defense and a wide variety of domestic programs) would decline to the lowest percentage of GDP since before World War II. Under this scenario, public debt rises from 69% GDP in 2011 to 84% by 2035, with interest payments absorbing 4% of GDP vs. 1% in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/122xx/doc12212/2011_06_22_summary.pdf |title=CBO 2011 Long-Term Budget Outlook-June 2011 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBO estimated in August 2011 that if laws currently &quot;on the books&quot; were enforced without changes, meaning the &quot;extended baseline scenario&quot; described above is implemented along with deficit reductions from the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], the deficit would decline from 8.5% GDP in 2011 to around 1% GDP by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/123xx/doc12316/Update_SummaryforWeb.pdf CBO-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;alternative fiscal scenario&quot; more closely assumes the continuation of present trends, such as permanently extending the Bush tax cuts, restricting the reach of the AMT, and keeping Medicare reimbursement rates at the current level (the so-called &quot;Doc Fix&quot; versus declining by one-third as mandated under current law.) Revenues are assumed to remain around the historical average 18% GDP. Under this scenario, public debt rises from 69% GDP in 2011 to 100% by 2021 and approaches 190% by 2035.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

The CBO reported: &quot;Many budget analysts believe that the alternative fiscal scenario presents a more realistic picture of the nation’s underlying fiscal policies than the extended-baseline scenario does. The explosive path of federal debt under the alternative fiscal scenario underscores the need for large and rapid policy changes to put the nation on a sustainable fiscal course.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

A high debt level may affect interest rates, and economic growth, or inflation if currency devaluation is viewed as a solution to debt reduction. A variety of factors are placing increasing pressure on the value of the U.S. dollar, increasing the risk of devaluation or inflation and encouraging challenges to dollar's role as the world's [[reserve currency]].  The [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), the federal government's auditor, argues that the United States is on a fiscally &quot;unsustainable&quot; path and that politicians and the electorate have been unwilling to change this path.&lt;ref name=GAOCitiz&gt;Congress of the United States, Government Accountability Office (February 13, 2009).

Debt levels may also affect economic growth rates. Economists [[Kenneth Rogoff]] and [[Carmen Reinhart]] reported in 2010 that among the 20 advanced countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP).&lt;ref name=&quot;house.gov&quot;&gt;U.S. House of Representatives Republican Caucus (May 27, 2010).

The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication:
* A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur;
* If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged;
* Rising interest costs would force reductions in government programs;
* Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and
* An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010).

==Debates==
{{Main|Political debates about the United States federal budget#Debates about the public debt}}

Economists continue to debate about the level of debt relative to GDP that signals a &quot;red line&quot; or dangerous level, or if any such level exists. In January 2010, Economists [[Kenneth Rogoff]] and [[Carmen Reinhart]] stated that gross debt (i.e., debt held by the public plus intragovernmental debt) exceeding 90% of GDP might be an indicative danger level.&lt;ref&gt;Belsie, Laurent (April 2010).

Retrieved February 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] stated in April 2010 that &quot;Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability. But given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt, our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bernanke, Ben S.

Economists also debate the definition of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure.&lt;ref name=&quot;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; The [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;&gt;Horney, James R.

There is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental debt, which was approximately $4.6&amp;nbsp;trillion in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United States Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (April 30, 2010).

Retrieved February 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the CBPP argues: that &quot;large increases in [debt held by the public] can also push up interest rates and increase the amount of future interest payments the federal government must make to lenders outside of the United States, which reduces Americans’ income. By contrast, intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross debt) has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes (and pays interest on) to itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;/&gt;  However, if the U.S. government continues to run &quot;on budget&quot; deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program. This will result in &quot;debt held by the public&quot; replacing &quot;intragovernmental debt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11580/07-01-SSOptions_forWeb.pdf |title=CBO-Social Security Policy Options-July 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576510660976229354.html#articleTabs%3Darticle%26commentId%3D2977549 WSJ-A Short Primer on the National Debt-John Steele Gordon-August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;Fiscal years 1940–2009 GDP figures are derived from February 2011 Office of Management and Budget figures which contained revisions of prior year figures due to significant changes from prior GDP measurements. Fiscal years 1950–2010 GDP measurements are derived from December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be subject to revision, especially more recent years. The two measures in Fiscal Years 1980, 1990 and 2000–2009 diverge only slightly.

Absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP percent change to current findings (as of January 2011) found in revisions are stated to be 1.2% ± 1.8% or a 95% probability of being within the range of 0.0–3.0%, assuming the differences to occur according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference of 1.2%. E.g. with an advance report of a $500&amp;nbsp;billion increase of a $15&amp;nbsp;trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the range would be 0.0 to 3.0% different than 3.3% (500 ÷ 15,000) or $0 to $450&amp;nbsp;billion different than the hypothetical $500&amp;nbsp;billion.

Fiscal years 1940–1970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example, Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939 and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal years 1980–2010 begin October 1 of the previous year.

Intergovernmental debts before the Social Security Act are presumed to equal zero.
