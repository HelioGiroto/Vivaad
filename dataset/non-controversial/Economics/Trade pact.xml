{{trade bloc}}
A '''trade pact''' (also known as ''trade agreement'') is a wide ranging [[tax, tariff and trade]] pact that often includes [[investment]] guarantees. The most common trade pacts are of the [[preferential trade arrangement|preferential]] and [[free trade area|free trade]] types are concluded in order to reduce (or eliminate) [[tariff]]s, [[Import quota|quotas]] and other [[trade barrier|trade restrictions]] on items [[trade]]d between the signatories.

==Classification of trade pacts==
===By number and type of signatories===
A trade agreement is classified as ''bilateral'' (BTA) when signed between two sides, where each side could be a country (or other [[customs territory]]), a [[trade bloc]] or an informal group of countries (or other customs territories). A trade agreement signed between more than two sides (typically neighboring or in the same region) is classified as ''multilateral''.

There are a variety of trade agreements; with some being quite complex ([[European Union]]), while others are less intensive ([[North American Free Trade Agreement]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting level of [[economic integration]] depends on the specific type of trade pacts and policies adopted by the [[trade bloc]]:

#Separate
#* [[Trade and Investment Framework Agreement]] (TIFA)
#* [[Bilateral Investment Treaty]] (BIT)
#* [[Preferential Trade Arrangement]] (PTA) - limited scope and depth of tariffs reduction between the [[customs territory|customs territories]].
#** [[Free Trade Agreement]] establishing a Free Trade Area (FTA) - extensive reduction or elimination of tariffs on substantially all trade allowing for the [[free movement of goods|free movement]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] and in more advanced agreements also reduction of restrictions on [[investment]] and establishment allowing for the [[free movement of capital|free movement]] of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[free movement of services|free movement]] of [[Service (economics)|services]]
#*** [[Common market]] - FTA with significantly reduced or eliminated restrictions on the [[freedom of movement]] of all [[factors of production]], including [[free movement of workers|free movement]] of [[labour (economics)|labour]] and of [[capitalism|enterprise]]; and coordination in [[economic policy]]
#* [[Currency union]] - sharing the same [[currency]]
#Composite
#:* [[Customs union]] - FTA with [[common external tariff]]s of all signatories in respect to non-signatory countries
#:** [[Customs and monetary union]] - Customs union with Currency union
#:** [[Economic union]] - Customs union with Common market
#:*** [[Economic and monetary union]] (EMU) - Economic union with Currency Union
#:**** [[Fiscal Union]] - common coordination of substantial parts of the [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]] ''(proposed step between EMU and [[Complete economic integration]])''

===Special agreements===

* the now defunct [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] framework)

===By the World Trade Organization===
Typically the benefits and obligations of the trade agreements apply only to their signatories.

In the framework of the [[World Trade Organization]] a different agreement types are concluded (mostly during new member accessions), whose terms apply to all [[WTO accession and membership|WTO members]] on the so-called [[Most favoured nation|most-favored]] basis (MFN), which means that beneficial terms agreed bilaterally with one trading partner will apply also to the rest of the WTO members.

All agreements concluded outside of the WTO framework (and granting additional benefits beyond the WTO MFN level, but applicable only between the signatories and not to the rest of the WTO members) are called ''preferential'' by the WTO. According to WTO rules these agreements are subject to certain requirements such as notification to the WTO and general reciprocity (the preferences should apply equally to each of the signatories of the agreement) where unilateral preferences (some of the signatories gain preferential access to the market of the other signatories, without lowering their own tariffs) are allowed only under exceptional circumstances and as temporary measure.&lt;ref&gt;The [[European Union|EU]] got a WTO waiver to grant favourable access to its market for the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]] states, without requiring that in return they open their markets to competition from the EU. The WTO waiver already expired and currently the EU and the ACP states are negotiating [[Economic Partnership Agreements|WTO compliant reciprocial agreements]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade agreements called ''preferential'' by the WTO are also known as ''regional'' (RTA), despite not necessarily concluded by countries within a certain region. There are currently 205 agreements in force as of July 2007. Over 300 have been reported to the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/region_e/region_e.htm|title=Regional trade agreements|date=2007-7|publisher=[[WTO]]|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of FTA has increased significantly over the last decade. Between 1948 to 1994, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the predecessor to the WTO, received 124 notifications. Since 1995 over 300 trade agreements have been enacted.&lt;ref name=&quot;WTO Facts and figures&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/region_e/regfac_e.htm|title=Facts and figures|publisher=World Trade Organization|accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WTO is further classifying these agreements in the following types:
*''[[Good (economics)|Goods]] covering'':
**basic ''preferential trade agreement'' (a.k.a. ''partial scope agreement'')
**''free trade agreement''
**''customs union''
*''[[Service (economics)|Services]] covering'':
**''Economic Integration Agreement'' - any agreement, including a basic PTA, that covers also services

== Reaction ==
Trade pacts are frequently politically contentious since they may change economic customs and deepen interdependence with trade partners. Increasing efficiency through &quot;[[free trade]]&quot; is a common goal. For the most part, governments are supportive of further trade agreements.

There have been however some concerns expressed by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]. According to [[Pascal Lamy]], Director-General of the WTO, the proliferation of RTA “...is breeding concern — concern about incoherence, confusion, exponential increase of costs for business, unpredictability and even unfairness in trade relations.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the WTO is that while the typical trade agreements (called ''preferential'' or ''regional'' by the WTO) are useful to a degree, it is much more beneficial to focus on global agreements in the WTO framework such as the negotiations of the current [[Doha round]].

The [[anti-globalization movement]] opposes such agreements almost by definition, but some groups normally allied within that movement, e.g. [[green parties]], seek [[fair trade]] or [[safe trade]] provisions that moderate what they perceive to be the ill effects of [[globalization]].
