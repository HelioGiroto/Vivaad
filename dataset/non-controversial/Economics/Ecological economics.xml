'''Ecological economics''' is referred to as both a [[transdisciplinary]] and [[interdisciplinary]] field of academic research that aims to address the interdependence and [[coevolution]] of human [[economy|economies]] and natural [[ecosystem]]s over time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anastasios Xepapadeas |year=2008 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=ecological+economics&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Ecological economics |work=[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] 2nd Edition |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from [[environmental economics]], which is the [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] analysis of the environment, by its treatment of the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem and its emphasis upon preserving [[natural capital]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001). &quot;Ecological Economics: Themes, Approaches, and Differences with Environmental Economics,&quot; ''Regional Environmental Change'', 2(1), pp. [http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/mj2694/pdf/Bergh.pdf 13-23] (press '''+''').&lt;/ref&gt; One survey of German economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different [[schools of economic thought]], with ecological economists emphasizing &quot;strong&quot; [[sustainability]] and rejecting the proposition that natural capital can be substituted by human-made capital.&lt;ref&gt;Illge L, Schwarze R.

Ecological economics was founded as a modern movement in the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on history and development below). The related field of [[Green economy|green economics]] is, in general, a more politically applied form of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Paehlke R. (1995).

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and [[sustainable development]] guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber.

[http://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecological economists have questioned fundamental mainstream economic approaches such as [[cost-benefit analysis]], and the separability of economic values from scientific research, contending that economics is unavoidably [[Normative ethics|normative]] rather than [[Positive economics|positive]] (empirical).&lt;ref name=Victor2008&gt;Peter Victor.

== Nature and ecology ==
[[Image:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Environmental Scientist sampling water.]]
{{Main|Nature|Ecology}}

A simple [[circular flow of income]] diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of [[Production (economics)|production]]. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an &quot;environment's source function&quot;, and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The &quot;sink function&quot; describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Harris2006&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing &quot;cumulative pollutants&quot;.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} Pollutants affect human health and the health of the climate.

The economic value of natural capital and [[ecosystem services]] is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|9}} Ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in ''Nature'', the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global GDP was $27 trillion).&lt;ref name=Costanza1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Costanza R et al. | year = 1998 | title = The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital1 | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–15 | doi = 10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00020-2 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800998000202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the value went to [[nutrient cycling]]. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'' Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|129}}

The Earth's [[carrying capacity]] is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as [[Thomas Malthus]] pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study ''[[Limits to Growth]]''.  [[Diminishing returns]] suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as [[erosion]], an impending [[water crisis]], and [[soil salinity]] (from [[irrigation]]) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that [[industrial agriculture]], which exacerbates these problems, is not [[sustainable agriculture]], and are generally inclined favorably to [[organic farming]], which also reduces the output of carbon.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Global [[wild fisheries]] are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} The [[aquaculture]] or [[fish farm|farming]] of [[piscivorous]] fish, like [[salmon]], does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon farming]] has major [[Salmon farming issues|negative impacts]] on wild salmon, as well as the [[forage fish]] that need to be caught to feed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salmon Run&quot;&gt;

Since [[animal]]s are higher on the [[trophic level]], they are less efficient sources of food energy. Reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food, but as nations develop, they tend to adopt high-meat diets similar to that of the United States. [[Genetically modified food]] (GMF) a conventional solution to the problem, presents numerous problems &amp;ndash; [[Bt corn]] produces its own [[Bacillus thuringiensis]], but the pest resistance is believed to be only a matter of time.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|31}} The overall effect of GMF on yields is contentious, with the USDA and FAO acknowledging that GMFs do not necessarily have higher yields and may even have reduced yields.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Association.

[[Global warming]] is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies [[scientific opinion on climate change|expressing agreement]] on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an [[energy crisis]]. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained &amp;ndash; the [[Stern report]] is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of [[discounting]] and intergenerational equity.

Mainstream economics has attempted to become a value-free 'hard science', but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of utility, efficiency, and cost-benefits such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for sustainable development,&lt;ref&gt;Soderbaum P. (2004). [http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/politics_ideology.pdf Politics and Ideology in Ecological Economics]. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have goals similar to [[green politics]].

== Schools of thought ==
Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the ''European Society for Ecological Economics''.  An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.''

== Differentiation from mainstream schools ==
In ecological economics, natural capital is added to the typical [[capital asset]] analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. Ecological economics uses tools from [[mathematical economics]], but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological pessimists. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. (1989). What is ecological economics? ''Ecological Economics'' '''1''':1-7. [http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf Free full text].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive (&quot;dirty&quot;) bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.

==History and development==
Early interest in ecology and economics dates back to the 1960s and the work by [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[Herman Daly]], but the first meetings occurred in the 1980s. It began with a 1982 [http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/costanza.pdf symposium in Sweden] which was attended by people who would later be instrumental in the field, including Robert Costanza, Herman Daly, Charles Hall, Ann-Mari Jansson, Bruce Hannon, H.T. Odum, and David Pimentel. Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of ''Ecological Modeling'' to test the waters. A book entitled ''Ecological Economics'', by [http://unjobs.org/authors/juan-martinez-alier Juan Martinez-Alier], was published later that year.&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory&gt;Costanza R. (2003). [http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/costanza.pdf Early History of Ecological Economics and ISEE]. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; 1989 saw the foundation of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] and publication of its journal, ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'', by [[Elsevier]]. [[Robert Costanza]] was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, currently edited by Richard Howarth.

European conceptual founders include [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] (1971), [[K. William Kapp]] (1950)&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, K. W. (1950) ''The Social Costs of Private Enterprise''. New York: Shocken.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Polanyi]] (1944).&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, K. (1944) ''The Great Transformation''. New York/Toronto: Rinehart &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of [[E.F. Schumacher]], whose book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]] &amp;ndash; A Study of Economics as if People Mattered'' (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of [[Herman Daly]]'s comprehensive and persuasive ''Steady-State Economics'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F. 1973. ''Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered''. London: Blond and Briggs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daly, H. 1991. ''Steady-State Economics'' (2nd ed.). Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Other figures include ecologists [[C.S. Holling]], [[H.T. Odum]] and [[Robert Costanza]], biologist Gretchen Daily and physicist [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. CUNY geography professor [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] explicitly added ecological concerns to political economic literature. This parallel development in [[political economy]] has been continued by analysts such as sociologist [[John Bellamy Foster]].

The antecedents can be traced back to the [[Romantics]] of the 19th century as well as some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by [[Thomas Malthus]], while [[John Stuart Mill]] hypothesized that the &quot;stationary state&quot; of an economy was desirable, anticipating later insights of modern ecological economists, without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the dramatic post-World War II industrial expansion. As Martinez-Alier explores in his book the debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced into the 19th century e.g. Nobel prize-winning chemist, [[Frederick Soddy]] (1877–1956). Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth — a criticism echoed by his intellectual heirs in the now emergent field of ecological economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;ref=opinion Eric Zencey, a professor of historical and political studies at Empire State College. A version of this article appeared in print on April 12, 2009, on page WK9 of the New York edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] (1906–1994), who was among Daly's teachers at [[Vanderbilt University]], provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. His ''magnum opus'', ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'' (1971), has been highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu-Roegen, N. 1971. ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==

=== Methodology ===
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Laws of thermodynamics]]}}
A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and in knowledge of biological systems.  It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.

Ecological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.

The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.

There has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems''. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis''. Washington, D.C.: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity.  This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, D. J. (2006) Selling out on nature. Nature 443(7): 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in [[environmental ethics]] about how to structure a plural value system.

=== Allocation of resources ===
[[Resource economics|Resource]] and [[neoclassical economics]] focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources, and less on two other fundamental economic problems which are central to ecological economics: [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] ([[equity (economics)|equity]]) and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it is reliant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daly&quot;&gt;Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. ''Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications''. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological Economics also makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the [[quality of life]]) while arguing that [[neoclassical economics]] confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that, beyond modest levels, increased per-capita [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] (the typical economic measure of &quot;standard of living&quot;) does not necessarily lead to improvement in human well-being, while this same consumption can have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being.

=== Strong versus weak sustainability ===

Ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources, claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human-made capital—labor and technology.

The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.
There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the ‘entropy pessimists’, notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 2007. On the practical limits of substitution. Ecological Economics 61: 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the ''weak sustainability'' view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.

At the other extreme, the ''strong sustainability'' view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.

=== Energy economics ===
{{Main|Energy economics}}
A key concept of energy economics is [[net energy gain]], which recognizes that all energy requires energy to produce.  To be useful the energy return on energy invested (''[[EROEI]]'') has to be greater than one.  The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A.S. |authorlink=
|last2= Cleveland |first2=Cutler J.
|last3=Kaufmann |first3=Robert
|coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher= University Press of colorado |location= Niwot, Colorado |isbn=  |pages=|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological economics generally rejects the view of [[energy economics]] that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on [[biodiversity]] and [[creativity]] - or natural capital and [[individual capital]], in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of [[uneconomic growth]] and [[quality of life]]. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.

Thermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter A. Corning]] 1 *, Stephen J. Kline. (2000). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007254/ABSTRACT Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: Thermoeconomics and Control information ] Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Apr. 07, Volume 15, Issue 6 , Pages 453 – 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Corning|Corning, P.]] (2002). “[http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html Thermoeconomics – Beyond the Second Law]” – source: www.complexsystems.org&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermoeconomics are often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of [[industrial ecology]] to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ ''Exergy - a useful concept'' by Göran Wall]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''exergy'', was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

=== Energy accounting and balance ===
:Also see:''[[Net energy gain]]''
An [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of [[thermodynamics]], to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;Cutler&quot; /&gt; --&gt; The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus [[work done]], and transformations within the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml Environmental Decision making, Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R. &quot;Veblen and the Political Economy of the Engineer: the radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time,&quot; ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology (45:1) 1986, 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental services ===

A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R., d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Naeem, S., Limburg, K., Paruelo, J., O'Neill, R.V., Raskin, R., Sutton, P., and van den Belt, M. 1997. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. ''Nature'' 387: 253-260.&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the 'price' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context.  Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total [[GDP]] of the world at the time of the study.  This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some [[Environmental economics|environmental economists]] - for being inconsistent with assumptions of [[financial capital]] [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] - and ecological economists - for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators.&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, R.B. and Bode, C. 1998.  ''Next, the value of God, and other reactions.'' ''Ecological Economics'' 25: 37-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''See also [[ecosystem valuation]] and [[price of life]].''

The whole idea of treating ecosystems as goods and services to be valued in monetary terms remains controversial to some.  A common objection is that life is precious or priceless, but this demonstrably degrades to it being worthless under the assumptions of any branch of economics.  Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of every branch of economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different than other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.

Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]].  [[Biodiversity]] measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard.  The growing field of [[biodiversity finance]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944&lt;/ref&gt; began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2007/092007/koenig.html&lt;/ref&gt; or similar ones in the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  US news outlets treated the stories as a &quot;threat&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/ }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; to &quot;drill a park&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3980994&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a previously dominant view that NGOs and governments had the primary responsibility to protect ecosystems.  However [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm.

Commodification of other ecological relations as in [[carbon credit]] and direct payments to farmers to preserve [[ecosystem services]] are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity.  The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] achieved near-universal agreement in 2008&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panna.org/jt/agAssessment&lt;/ref&gt; that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging [[permaculture]] were the only practical way out of a food crisis.  The holdouts were all English-speaking countries that export [[GMO]]s and promote &quot;[[free trade]]&quot; agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network: The US, UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/04/17/do1702.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=GM crops can save us from food shortages | first=Bill | last=Emmott | date=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Externalities ===

Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling ''&quot;[[externalities]]&quot;'' is not warranted.  Juan Martinez Alier,&lt;ref&gt;Jose Maria Figueres Olson (Foreword), Robert Costanza (Editor), Olman Segura (Editor), Juan Martinez-Alier (Editor), Juan Martinez Alier (Author) (1996) &quot;Getting Down to Earth: Practical Applications Of Ecological Economics&quot; (Intl Society for Ecological Economics) (Island Press)&lt;/ref&gt;  for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet.  The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by Fred Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Fred &quot;Blueprint for a Greener Economy&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and by the recent [[Stern Report]] (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as Clive Spash).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts à la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted? Ecological Economics 63(4): 706-713]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning these externalities, [[Paul Hawken]] argues that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul (1994) &quot;The Ecology of Commerce&quot; (Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins in &quot;Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) &quot;Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution&quot; (Back Bay Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological-economic modeling ===

[[Mathematical model]]ing is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include&lt;ref&gt;Proops, J. , and Safonov, P. (eds.) (2004), Modelling in Ecological Economics, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faucheux, S., Pearce, D., and Proops, J. (eds.) (1995), Models of Sustainable Development, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;: [[evolutionary]], [[input/output model|input-output]], neo-Austrian modeling, [[entropy]] and [[thermodynamic]] models, [[multi-criteria decision analysis|multi-criteria]], and [[agent-based]] modeling, the environmental [[Kuznets curve]]. [[Systems Dynamics]] and [[GIS]] are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R., and Voinov, A. (eds.) (2004), Landscape Simulation Modeling. A Spatially Explicit, Dynamic Approach, Springer-Verlag New-York, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voinov, A. (2008) Systems Science and Modeling for Ecological Economics. Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;
