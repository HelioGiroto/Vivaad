The '''Black–Scholes''' model {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|l|æ|k|_|ˈ|ʃ|oʊ|l|z}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scholes|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scholes|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Black–Scholes–Merton''' is a [[mathematical model]] of a [[financial market]] containing certain [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] investment instruments. From the model, one can deduce the '''Black–Scholes formula''', which gives the price of [[option style|European-style]] [[option (finance)|options]]. The formula led to a boom in options trading and legitimised scientifically the activities of the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] and other options markets around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;mackenzie&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= An Engine, Not a Camera: How Financial Models Shape Markets|last= MacKenzie|first= Donald|authorlink=Donald Angus MacKenzie |year= 2006|publisher= MIT Press|location= Cambridge, MA| |isbn=0-262-13460-8 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; lt is widely used by options market participants.&lt;ref name=&quot;bodie-kane-marcus&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Investments|last= Bodie|first= Zvi|authorlink=Zvi Bodie |coauthors= Alex Kane, Alan J. Marcus|year= 2008|publisher= McGraw-Hill/Irwin|location= New York|edition=7th|isbn=978-0-07-326967-2 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|751}} Many empirical tests have shown the Black–Scholes price is “fairly close” to the observed prices, although there are well-known discrepancies such as the “[[Volatility smile|option smile]]”.&lt;ref name=&quot;bodie-kane-marcus&quot;/&gt;{{rp|770–771}}

The model was first articulated by [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]] in their 1973 paper, “The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities&quot;, published in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''. They derived a [[partial differential equation]], now called the '''Black–Scholes equation''', which governs the price of the option over time. The key idea behind the derivation was to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] perfectly the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently &quot;eliminate risk&quot;. This hedge is called [[delta hedging]] and is the basis of more complicated hedging strategies such as those engaged in by [[Wall Street]] [[investment bank]]s. The hedge implies there is only one right price for the option and it is given by the Black–Scholes formula.

[[Robert C. Merton]] was the first to publish a paper expanding the mathematical understanding of the options pricing model and coined the term Black–Scholes [[options pricing]] model. Merton and Scholes received the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] (''The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel'') for their work. Though ineligible for the prize because of his death in 1995, Black was mentioned as a contributor by the Swedish academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1997/press.html|title=Nobel prize foundation, 1997 Press release|accessdate=March 26, 2012|date=October 14, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
The Black–Scholes model of the market for a particular stock makes the following explicit assumptions:

*There is no [[arbitrage]] opportunity (i.e., there is no way to make a riskless profit).
*It is possible to borrow and lend cash at a known constant [[risk-free interest rate]].
*It is possible to buy and sell any amount, even fractional, of stock (this includes [[short selling]]).
*The above transactions do not incur any fees or costs (i.e., [[frictionless market]]).
*The stock price follows a [[geometric Brownian motion]] with constant drift and [[volatility (finance)|volatility]].
*The underlying security does not pay a [[dividend]].&lt;ref name=&quot;div_yield&quot; group=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;Although the original model assumed no dividends, trivial extensions to the model can accommodate a continuous dividend yield factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

From these assumptions, Black and Scholes showed that “it is possible to create a [[Hedge (finance)|hedged position]], consisting of a long position in the stock and a short position in the option, whose value will not depend on the price of the stock.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Black, Fischer|author2=Scholes, Myron|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637–654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of these assumptions of the original model have been removed in subsequent extensions of the model. Modern versions account for changing interest rates (Merton, 1976){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[transaction costs]] and taxes (Ingersoll, 1976){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, and dividend payout.&lt;ref name=&quot;merton 1973&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert|title=Theory of Rational Option Pricing|journal=Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science|volume=4|issue=1|pages=141–183|doi=10.2307/3003143.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
Let
:&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, be the price of the stock (please note as [[#Remarks on notation|below]]).
:&lt;math&gt;V(S,t)&lt;/math&gt;, the price of a derivative as a function of time and stock price.
:&lt;math&gt;C(S,t)&lt;/math&gt; the price of a European call option and &lt;math&gt;P(S,t)&lt;/math&gt; the price of a European put option.
:&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Strike price|strike]] of the option.
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the annualized [[risk-free interest rate]], [[Continuous compounding|continuously compounded]].
:&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, the [[drift rate]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, annualized.
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the volatility of the stock's returns; this is the square root of the [[quadratic variation]] of the stock's log price process.
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, a time in years; we generally use: now=0, expiry=T.
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;, the value of a [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]].

Finally we will use
&lt;math&gt;N(x)&lt;/math&gt; which denotes the [[standard normal]] [[cumulative distribution function]],
:&lt;math&gt;N(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{x} e^{-\frac{z^{2}}{2}}\, dz&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;N'(x)&lt;/math&gt; which denotes the standard normal [[probability density function]],
:&lt;math&gt;N'(x)=\frac{e^{-\frac{x^{2}}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi} }&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Black–Scholes equation==
[[Image:Stockpricesimulation.jpg|thumb|right|Simulated geometric Brownian motions with parameters from market data]]
As above, the '''Black–Scholes equation''' is a [[partial differential equation]], which describes the price of the option over time. The key idea behind the equation is that one can perfectly [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] the option by buying and selling the [[underlying]] asset in just the right way and consequently “eliminate risk&quot;. This hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price for the option, as returned by the Black–Scholes formula given in the [[Black scholes#Black–Scholes formula|next section]]. The Equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}S^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}+rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}-rV=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation===
The following derivation is given in [[John C. Hull|Hull's]] ''Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hull |first=John C. |year=2008| edition=7 |title=Options, Futures and Other Derivatives |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=0-13-505283-1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|287–288}}  That, in turn, is based on the classic argument in the original Black–Scholes paper.

Per the model assumptions above, the price of the [[underlying asset]] (typically a stock) follows a [[geometric Brownian motion]]. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{S} = \mu \,dt+\sigma \,dW\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]].  Note that ''W'', and consequently its infinitesimal increment ''dW'', represents the only source of uncertainty in the price history of the stock.  Intuitively, ''W(t)'' is a [[random process|process]] that &quot;wiggles up and down&quot; in such a random way that its expected change over any time interval is 0. (In addition, its [[variance]] over time ''T'' is equal to ''T''; see [[Wiener process#Basic properties|Wiener process: Basic properties]]); a good discrete analogue for ''W'' is a [[simple random walk]].  Thus the above equation states that the infinitesimal rate of return on the stock has an expected value of ''&amp;mu; dt'' and a variance of &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 dt &lt;/math&gt;.

The payoff of an option &lt;math&gt;V(S,T)&lt;/math&gt; at maturity is known. To find its value at an earlier time we need to know how &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; evolves as a function of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. By [[Itō's lemma]] for two variables we have

:&lt;math&gt;dV=\left(\mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}S^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}\right)dt+\sigma S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\,dW.&lt;/math&gt;

Now consider a certain portfolio, called the [[delta hedging|delta-hedge]] portfolio, consisting of being short  one option and long &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}&lt;/math&gt; shares at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  The value of these holdings is

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi= -V +\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}S.&lt;/math&gt;

Over the time period &lt;math&gt;[t,t+\Delta t]&lt;/math&gt;, the total profit or loss from changes in the values of the holdings is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \Pi= - \Delta V +\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\,\Delta S.&lt;/math&gt;

Now discretize the equations for ''dS/S'' and ''dV'' by replacing differentials with deltas:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = \mu S \,\Delta t+\sigma S\,\Delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V=\left(\mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}S^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}\right)\Delta t+\sigma S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\,\Delta W.&lt;/math&gt;

and appropriately substitute them into the expression for &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Pi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \Pi=\left(-\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}S^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}\right)\Delta t.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the &lt;math&gt;\Delta W&lt;/math&gt; term has vanished.  Thus uncertainty has been eliminated and the portfolio is effectively riskless.  The rate of return on this portfolio must be equal to the rate of return on any other riskless instrument; otherwise, there would be opportunities for arbitrage. Now assuming the risk-free rate of return is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; we must have over the time period &lt;math&gt;[t,t+\Delta t]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r\Pi\,\Delta t=\Delta \Pi.&lt;/math&gt;

If we now equate our two formulas for &lt;math&gt;\Delta\Pi&lt;/math&gt; we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(-\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}S^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}\right)\Delta t= r\left(-V+S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\right)\Delta t.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying, we arrive at the celebrated Black–Scholes partial differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}S^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}+rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}-rV=0.&lt;/math&gt;

With the assumptions of the Black–Scholes model, this second order partial differential equation holds for any type of option as long as its price function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is twice differentiable with respect to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and once with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  Different pricing formulae for various options will arise from the choice of payoff function at expiry and appropriate boundary conditions.

==Black–Scholes formula==
[[Image:optionpricesurface.jpg|thumb|right|Black–Scholes European call option [[pricing surface]]]]
The Black–Scholes formula calculates the price of [[European option|European]] [[Put option|put]] and [[call option]]s. This price is [[Consistency|consistent]] with the Black–Scholes equation [[Black–Scholes#The Black–Scholes equation and its derivation|as above]]; this follows since the formula can be obtained [[Equation solving#Differential equations|by solving]] the equation for the corresponding terminal and boundary conditions.

The value of a call option for a non-dividend paying underlying stock in terms of the Black–Scholes parameters is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
C(S,t) &amp;= N(d_1)~S-N(d_2)~K e^{-r(T-t)},\\
d_1 &amp;= \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S}{K}\right)+\left(r+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}\\
d_2 &amp;= \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S}{K}\right)+\left(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}} = d_{1}-\sigma\sqrt{T-t}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The price of a corresponding [[put option]] based on [[put-call parity]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
	P(S,t)	&amp;= Ke^{-r(T-t)}-S+C(S,t)\\
		&amp;= N(-d_{2})~K e^{-r(T-t)}-N(-d_{1})~S.
\end{align}\,&lt;/math&gt;

For both, as [[Black–Scholes#Notation|above]]:
* &lt;math&gt;N(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[standard normal distribution]]
* &lt;math&gt;T-t&lt;/math&gt; is the time to maturity
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[spot price]] of the underlying asset
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the strike price
* &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[risk free rate]] (annual rate, expressed in terms of [[continuous compounding]])
* &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of returns of the underlying asset

===Interpretation===
The terms &lt;math&gt;N(d_1), N(d_2)&lt;/math&gt; are the ''probabilities of the option expiring in-the-money'' under the equivalent exponential [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] probability measure ([[numéraire]]=stock) and the equivalent martingale probability measure (numéraire=risk free asset), respectively. The risk neutral probability density for the stock price &lt;math&gt;S_T \in (0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;p(S,T)=\frac{N^\prime(d_2(S_T))}{S_T \sigma\sqrt{T}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;d_2=d_2(K)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as above.

Specifically, &lt;math&gt;N(d_2)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the call will be exercised provided one assumes that the asset drift is the risk-free rate. &lt;math&gt;N(d_1)&lt;/math&gt;, however, does not lend itself to a simple probability interpretation. &lt;math&gt;SN(d_1)&lt;/math&gt; is correctly interpreted as the present value, using the risk-free interest rate, of the expected asset price at expiration, [[Conditional probability|given that]] the asset price at expiration is above the exercise price.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chance 99-02&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Don Chance|date=June 3, 2011|url=http://www.bus.lsu.edu/academics/finance/faculty/dchance/Instructional/TN99-02.pdf|format=PDF|title=Derivation and Interpretation of the Black–Scholes Model|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For related discussion – and graphical representation – see section [[Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation#Interpretation|&quot;Interpretation&quot;]] under [[Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation]].

The equivalent martingale probability measure is also called the [[Financial mathematics#Derivatives pricing: the Q world|risk-neutral probability measure]]. Note that both of these are ''probabilities'' in a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theoretic]] sense, and neither of these is the true probability of expiring in-the-money under the [[Financial mathematics#Risk and portfolio management: the P world|real probability measure]]. To calculate the probability under the real (“physical”) probability measure, additional information is required—the drift term in the physical measure, or equivalently, the [[market price of risk]].

===Derivation===
We now show how to get from the general Black–Scholes PDE to a specific valuation for an option. Consider as an example the Black–Scholes price of a call option, for which the PDE above has [[boundary condition]]s

:&lt;math&gt;C(0,t)=0\text{ for all }t\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C(S,t)\rightarrow S\text{ as }S\rightarrow\infty\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C(S,T)=\max\{S-K,0\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The last condition gives the value of the option at the time that the option matures. The solution of the PDE gives the value of the option at any earlier time, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}\left[\max\{S-K,0\}\right]&lt;/math&gt;. To solve the PDE we transform the equation into a [[heat equation|diffusion equation]] which may be solved using standard methods. To this end we introduce the change-of-variable transformation

:&lt;math&gt;\tau=T-t\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u=Ce^{r\tau}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x=\ln(S/K)+\left(r-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)\tau.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Black–Scholes PDE becomes a [[diffusion equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial\tau}=\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The terminal condition &lt;math&gt;C(S,T)=\max\{S-K,0\}&lt;/math&gt; now becomes an initial condition

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,0)=u_{0}(x) \equiv K(e^{\max\{x,0\}}-1).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using the standard method for solving a diffusion equation we have

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,\tau)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi\tau}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{u_{0}(y)\exp{\left(-\frac{(x-y)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}\tau}\right)}}\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

which, after some manipulations, yields

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,\tau)=Ke^{x+\sigma^{2}\tau/2}N(d_{1})-KN(d_{2})&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;d_{1}=\frac{(x+\frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}\tau)+\frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}\tau}{\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d_{2}=\frac{(x+\frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}\tau)-\frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}\tau}{\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Reverting &lt;math&gt;u,x,\tau&lt;/math&gt; to the original set of variables yields the above stated solution to the Black–Scholes equation.

====Other derivations====
{{See also|Martingale pricing}}
Above we used the method of arbitrage-free pricing (“[[Rational pricing#Arbitrage free pricing|delta-hedging]]”) to derive the Black–Scholes PDE, and then solved the PDE to get the valuation formula. It is also possible to derive the latter directly using a [[Risk neutrality]] argument. This method gives the price as the [[expected value|expectation]] of the option payoff under a particular [[probability measure]], called the [[risk-neutral measure]], which differs from the real world measure. For the underlying logic see section [[Rational pricing#Risk neutral valuation|&quot;risk neutral valuation&quot;]] under [[Rational pricing]] as well as section [[Mathematical finance#Derivatives pricing: the Q world|&quot;Derivatives pricing: the Q world]]&quot; under [[Mathematical finance]]; for detail, once again, see Hull.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull&quot;/&gt;{{rp|307–309}}

==The Greeks==
“[[Greeks (finance)|The Greeks]]” measure the sensitivity to change of the option price under a slight change of a single parameter while holding the other parameters fixed.  Formally, they are [[partial derivatives]] of the option price with respect to the independent variables (technically, one Greek, gamma, is a partial derivative of another Greek, called delta).

The Greeks are not only important for the mathematical theory of finance, but for those actively involved in trading.  Any trader worth his or her salt will know the Greeks and make a choice of which Greeks to hedge to limit exposure.  Financial institutions will typically set limits for the Greeks that their trader cannot exceed.  Delta is the most important Greek and traders will zero their delta at the end of the day.  Gamma and vega are also important but not as closely monitored.

The Greeks for Black–Scholes are given in [[Closed-form expression|closed form]] below.  They can be obtained by straightforward [[Differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] of the Black–Scholes formula.&lt;ref&gt; Although with significant algebra; see, for example, Hong-Yi Chen, Cheng-Few Lee and Weikang Shih (2010).

Note that the gamma and vega formulas are the same for calls and puts. This can be seen directly from [[put-call parity]].

In practice, some sensitivities are usually quoted in scaled-down terms, to match the scale of likely changes in the parameters. For example, rho is often reported multiplied by 10,000 (1bp rate change), vega by 100 (1 vol point change), and theta by 365 or 252 (1 day decay based on either calendar days or trading days per year).

==Extensions of the model==
The above model can be extended for variable (but deterministic) rates and volatilities. The model may also be used to value European options on instruments paying dividends. In this case, closed-form solutions are available if the dividend is a known proportion of the stock price. [[Option style|American options]] and options on stocks paying a known cash dividend (in the short term, more realistic than a proportional dividend) are more difficult to value, and a choice of solution techniques is available (for example [[Lattice model (finance)|lattices]] and [[Finite difference methods for option pricing|grids]]).

===Instruments paying continuous yield dividends===
For options on indexes, it is reasonable to make the simplifying assumption that dividends are paid continuously, and that the dividend amount is proportional to the level of the index.

The dividend payment paid over the time period &lt;math&gt;[t,t+dt)&lt;/math&gt; is then modelled as
:&lt;math&gt;qS_t\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
for some constant &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; (the [[dividend yield]]).

Under this formulation the arbitrage-free price implied by the Black–Scholes model can be shown to be
:&lt;math&gt;C(S_{0},t)=e^{-r(T-t)}(FN(d_1)-KN(d_2))\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;P(S_{0},t)=e^{-r(T-t)}(KN(-d_2)-FN(-d_1))\,&lt;/math&gt;
where now
:&lt;math&gt;F=S_{0} e^{(r-q)(T-t)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
is the modified forward price that occurs in the terms &lt;math&gt;d_{1},d_{2}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;d_{1}=\frac{\ln(F/K)+(\sigma^{2}/2)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma\sqrt{T-t}&lt;/math&gt;

Exactly the same formula is used to price options on foreign exchange rates, except that now ''q'' plays the role of the foreign risk-free interest rate and ''S'' is the spot exchange rate. This is the '''[[Garman–Kohlhagen model]]''' (1983).

===Instruments paying discrete proportional dividends===
It is also possible to extend the Black–Scholes framework to options on instruments paying discrete proportional dividends. This is useful when the option is struck on a single stock.

A typical model is to assume that a proportion &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; of the stock price is paid out at pre-determined times &lt;math&gt;t_{1},t_{2},\ldots&lt;/math&gt;. The price of the stock is then modelled as

:&lt;math&gt;S_t=S_{0}(1-\delta)^{n(t)}e^{ut+\sigma W_t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of dividends that have been paid by time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

The price of a call option on such a stock is again

:&lt;math&gt;C(S_{0},T)=e^{-rT}(FN(d_1)-KN(d_2))\,&lt;/math&gt;

where now

:&lt;math&gt;F=S_{0}(1-\delta)^{n(T)}e^{rT}\,&lt;/math&gt;

is the forward price for the dividend paying stock.

=== American options ===
The problem of finding the price of an [[American option]] is related to the [[optimal stopping]] problem of finding the time to execute the option.  Since the American option can be exercised at any time before the expiration date, the Black-Scholes equation becomes an inequality of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}S^{2}\frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}+rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}-rV \leq 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = André Jaun |url=http://www.lifelong-learners.com/opt/com/SYL/s6node6.php|title=The Black-Scholes equation for American options|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the terminal and (free) boundary conditions: &lt;math&gt;V(S,T) = H(S)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V(S,t) \geq H(S)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;H(S)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the payoff at stock price &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;

In general this inequality does not have a closed form solution, though an American call with no dividends is equal to a European call and the Roll-Geske-Whaley method provides a solution for an American call with one dividend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ødegaard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bernt Ødegaard |year=2003|url=http://finance.bi.no/~bernt/gcc_prog/recipes/recipes/node9.html#SECTION00920000000000000000|title=Extending the Black Scholes formula|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chance2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Don Chance|year=2008 |url=http://www.bus.lsu.edu/academics/finance/faculty/dchance/Instructional/TN98-01.pdf|title= Closed-Form American Call Option Pricing: Roll-Geske-Whaley|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the stochastic differential equation (which is valid for the value of any derivative) is split into two components: the European option value and the early exercise premium.

Here, if the underlying asset price is greater than or equal to the trigger price it is optimal to exercise, and the value must equal &lt;math&gt;S - X&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise the option “boils down to: (i) a European [[Barrier_option#Types|up-and-out]] call option… and (ii) a rebate that is received at the knock-out date if the option is knocked out prior to the maturity date.” The formula is readily modified for the valuation of a put option, using [[put call parity]]. This approximation is computationally inexpensive and the method is fast, with evidence indicating that the approximation may be more accurate in pricing long dated options than Barone-Adesi and Whaley.  &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.global-derivatives.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14 American options] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Black–Scholes in practice==
[[File:Crowd outside nyse.jpg|thumb|The normality assumption of the Black–Scholes model does not capture extreme movements such as [[stock market crashes]].]]
The Black–Scholes model disagrees with reality in a number of ways, some significant. It is widely employed as a useful approximation, but proper application requires understanding its limitations – blindly following the model exposes the user to unexpected risk.

Among the most significant limitations are:
* the underestimation of extreme moves, yielding [[tail risk]], which can be hedged with [[out-of-the-money]] options;
* the assumption of instant, cost-less trading, yielding [[liquidity risk]], which is difficult to hedge;
* the assumption of a stationary process, yielding [[volatility risk]], which can be hedged with volatility hedging;
* the assumption of continuous time and continuous trading, yielding gap risk, which can be hedged with Gamma hedging.
In short, while in the Black–Scholes model one can perfectly hedge options by simply Delta hedging, in practice there are many other sources of risk.

Results using the Black–Scholes model differ from real world prices because of simplifying assumptions of the model. One significant limitation is that in reality security prices do not follow a strict stationary [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]] process, nor is the risk-free interest actually known (and is not constant over time). The variance has been observed to be non-constant leading to models such as [[GARCH]] to model volatility changes. Pricing discrepancies between empirical and the Black–Scholes model have long been observed in options that are far [[out-of-the-money]], corresponding to extreme price changes; such events would be very rare if returns were lognormally distributed, but are observed much more often in practice.

Nevertheless, Black–Scholes pricing is widely used in practice,&lt;ref name = &quot;Wilmott Defence&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bodie-kane-marcus&quot;/&gt;{{rp|751}} for it is:

* easy to calculate
* a useful approximation, particularly when analyzing the direction in which prices move when crossing critical points
* a robust basis for more refined models
* reversible, as the model's original output -- price -- can be used as an input and one of the other variables solved for; the implied volatility calculated in this way is often used to quote option prices (that is, as a ''quoting convention'')

The first point is self-evidently useful.  The others can be further discussed:

Useful approximation: although volatility is not constant, results from the model are often helpful in setting up hedges in the correct proportions to minimize risk. Even when the results are not completely accurate, they serve as a first approximation to which adjustments can be made.

Basis for more refined models: The Black–Scholes model is ''robust'' in that it can be adjusted to deal with some of its failures. Rather than considering some parameters (such as volatility or interest rates) as ''constant,'' one considers them as ''variables,'' and thus added sources of risk. This is reflected in the [[Greeks (finance)|Greeks]] (the change in option value for a change in these parameters, or equivalently the partial derivatives with respect to these variables), and hedging these Greeks mitigates the risk caused by the non-constant nature of these parameters. Other defects cannot be mitigated by modifying the model, however, notably tail risk and liquidity risk, and these are instead managed outside the model, chiefly by minimizing these risks and by [[stress testing]].

Explicit modeling: this feature mean that, rather than ''assuming'' a volatility ''a priori'' and computing prices from it, one can use the model to solve for volatility, which gives the [[implied volatility]] of an option at given prices, durations and exercise prices. Solving for volatility over a given set of durations and strike prices one can construct an [[volatility surface|implied volatility surface]]. In this application of the Black–Scholes model, a [[coordinate transformation]] from the ''price domain'' to the ''volatility domain'' is obtained. Rather than quoting option prices in terms of dollars per unit (which are hard to compare across strikes and [[Tenor (finance)|tenors]]), option prices can thus be quoted in terms of implied volatility, which leads to trading of volatility in option markets.

===The volatility smile===
{{Main|Volatility smile}}
One of the attractive features of the Black–Scholes model is that the parameters in the model (other than the volatility) — the time to maturity, the strike, the risk-free interest rate, and the current underlying price – are unequivocally observable. All other things being equal, an option's theoretical value is a [[Monotonic function|monotonic increasing function]] of implied volatility.

By computing the implied volatility for traded options with different strikes and maturities, the Black–Scholes model can be tested. If the Black–Scholes model held, then the implied volatility for a particular stock would be the same for all strikes and maturities. In practice, the [[volatility smile|volatility surface]] (the 3D graph of implied volatility against strike and maturity) is not flat.

The typical shape of the implied volatility curve for a given maturity depends on the underlying instrument. Equities tend to have skewed curves: compared to [[at-the-money]], implied volatility is substantially higher for low strikes, and slightly lower for high strikes. Currencies tend to have more symmetrical curves, with implied volatility lowest [[at-the-money]], and higher volatilities in both wings. Commodities often have the reverse behavior to equities, with higher implied volatility for higher strikes.

Despite the existence of the volatility smile (and the violation of all the other assumptions of the Black–Scholes model), the Black–Scholes PDE and Black–Scholes formula are still used extensively in practice. A typical approach is to regard the volatility surface as a fact about the market, and use an implied volatility from it in a Black–Scholes valuation model. This has been described as using &quot;the wrong number in the wrong formula to get the right price.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Riccardo Rebonato|authorlink=Riccardo Rebonato|year=1999|title=Volatility and correlation in the pricing of equity, FX and interest-rate options|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-89998-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach also gives usable values for the hedge ratios (the Greeks).

Even when more advanced models are used, traders prefer to think in terms of volatility as it allows them to evaluate and compare options of different maturities, strikes, and so on.

===Valuing bond options===
Black–Scholes cannot be applied directly to [[bond (finance)|bond securities]] because of  [[pull to par|pull-to-par]]. As the bond reaches its maturity date, all of the prices involved with the bond become known, thereby decreasing its volatility, and the simple Black–Scholes model does not reflect this process. A large number of extensions to Black–Scholes, beginning with the [[Black model]], have been used to deal with this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andrew|last=Kalotay|authorlink=Andrew Kalotay|url=http://kalotay.com/sites/default/files/private/BlackScholes.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Problem with Black, Scholes et al.|journal=Derivatives Strategy|month=November|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Bond option#Valuation|Bond option: Valuation]].

===Interest-rate curve===
In practice, interest rates are not constant – they vary by [[Tenor (finance)|tenor]], giving an [[yield curve|interest rate curve]] which may be interpolated to pick an appropriate rate to use in the Black–Scholes formula. Another consideration is that interest rates vary over time. This volatility may make a significant contribution to the price, especially of long-dated options.This is simply like the interest rate and bond price relationship which is inversely related.

===Short stock rate===
It is not free to take a [[short (finance)|short stock]] position. Similarly, it may be possible to lend out a long stock position for a small fee. In either case, this can be treated as a continuous dividend for the purposes of a Black–Scholes valuation, provided that there is no glaring asymmetry between the short stock borrowing cost and the long stock lending income.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Criticism==
[[Espen Gaarder Haug]] and [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] argue that the Black–Scholes model merely recast existing widely used models in terms of practically impossible &quot;dynamic hedging&quot; rather than &quot;risk,&quot; to make them more compatible with mainstream [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Espen Gaarder Haug]] and [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] (2011). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012075 Option Traders Use (very) Sophisticated Heuristics, Never the Black–Scholes–Merton Formula]. ''Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization'', Vol. 77, No. 2, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments were made in an earlier paper by [[Emanuel Derman]] and Nassim Taleb.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emanuel Derman]] and [[Nassim Taleb]] (2005). [http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/qf-Illusions-dynamic.pdf The illusions of dynamic replication], ''Quantitative Finance'', Vol. 5, No. 4, August 2005, 323–326&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Paul Wilmott]] has defended the model.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wilmott Defence&quot;&gt;[[Paul Wilmott]] (2008): [http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2008/4/29/Science-in-Finance-IX-In-defence-of-Black-Scholes-and-Merton In defence of Black Scholes and Merton], [http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2008/7/23/Science-in-Finance-X-Dynamic-hedging-and-further-defence-of-BlackScholes Dynamic hedging and further defence of Black-Scholes]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Philippe Bouchaud]] argues: Reliance on models based on incorrect axioms has clear and large effects. The Black–Scholes model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jean-Philippe|last=Bouchaud|title=Economics needs a scientific revolution|journal=Nature|volume=455|date=October 30, 2008|page=1181|doi=10.1038/4551181a|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5306v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, which was invented in 1973 to price options, is still used extensively. But it assumes that the probability of extreme price changes is negligible, when in reality, stock prices are much jerkier than this. Unwarranted use of the model spiralled into the worldwide October 1987 crash; the Dow Jones index dropped 23% in a single day, dwarfing recent market hiccups.{{Citation needed|reason=The cause of the 1987 crash has been widely debated without specific resolve.|date=September 2011}} Using the [[Student's t-distribution]] in place of the normal distribution as basis for the valuation of options can better take in account extreme events.

==Remarks on notation==
'''The reader is warned of the inconsistent notation that appears in this article. Thus the letter &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is used as:'''
:(1) a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] denoting the current price of the stock
:(2) a real [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] denoting the price at an arbitrary time
:(3) a [[random variable]] denoting the price at maturity
:(4) a [[stochastic process]] denoting the price at an arbitrary time

It is also used in the meaning of (4) with a subscript denoting time, but here the subscript is merely a mnemonic.

In the partial derivatives, the letters in the numerators and denominators are, of course, real variables, and the partial derivatives themselves are, initially, real functions of real variables. But after the substitution of a stochastic process for one of the arguments they become stochastic processes.

The Black–Scholes PDE is, initially, a statement about the stochastic process &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, but when &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is reinterpreted as a real variable, it becomes an ordinary PDE. It is only then that we can ask about its solution.

The parameter &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; that appears in the discrete-dividend model and the elementary derivation is not the same as the parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; that appears elsewhere in the article. For the relationship between them see [[Geometric Brownian motion]].
