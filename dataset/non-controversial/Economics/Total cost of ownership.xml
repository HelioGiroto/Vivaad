      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6250">'''Total cost of ownership (TCO)''' is a financial estimate whose purpose is to help consumers and enterprise managers determine direct and indirect costs of a product or system.  It is a [[management accounting]] concept that can be used in [[full cost accounting]] or even [[ecological economics]] where it includes [[social costs]].
For manufacturing, as TCO is typically compared with doing business overseas, it goes beyond the initial manufacturing cycle time and cost to make parts. TCO includes a variety of [[cost of doing business]] items, for example, ship and re-ship, opportunity costs, while it also considers incentives developed for an alternative approach. Incentives and other variables include tax credits, common language, expediated delivery, customer oriented supplier visits. 

==Use of concept==
TCO, when incorporated in any financial benefit analysis, provides a cost basis for determining the total economic value of an investment. Examples include: [[return on investment]], [[internal rate of return]], [[economic value added]], return on information technology, and [[rapid economic justification]]. 

A TCO analysis includes [[total cost of acquisition]] and [[operating cost]]s. A TCO analysis is used to gauge the viability of any [[capital investment]]. An enterprise may use it as a product/process comparison tool.  It is also used by [[credit market]]s and [[financing]] agencies. TCO directly relates to an enterprise's asset and/or related systems total costs across all projects and processes, thus giving a picture of the [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] over time.

===Computer and software industries===
TCO analysis was popularized by the [[Gartner|Gartner Group]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=131837 About Gartner TCO]&lt;/ref&gt;  The roots of this concept date at least back to the first quarter of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.processor.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles%2Fp3012%2F06p12%2F06p12%2Easp&amp;guid=38EA5B42565B4C989AB66754B695F44C&amp;searchtype=&amp;WordList=&amp;bJumpTo=True TCO: What's Old is New]&lt;/ref&gt; Many different [[methodology|methodologies]] and software tools have been developed to analyze TCO. TCO tries to quantify the financial impact of deploying an information technology product over its [[Product life cycle management|life cycle]]. These technologies include [[software]] and hardware, and training.

Technology deployment can include the following as part of TCO:

* Computer hardware and programs
** Network hardware and software
** Server hardware and software
** Workstation hardware and software
** Installation and integration of hardware and software
** Purchasing research
** Warranties and licenses
** License tracking - compliance
** [[PC migration|Migration]] expenses
** Risks: susceptibility to vulnerabilities, availability of upgrades, patches and future licensing policies, etc.
* Operation expenses
** Infrastructure (floor space)
** Electricity (for related equipment, cooling, backup power)
** Testing costs
** Downtime, outage and failure expenses
** Diminished performance (i.e. users having to wait, diminished money-making ability)
** Security (including breaches, loss of reputation, recovery and prevention)
** Backup and recovery process
** Technology training
** Audit (internal and external)
** Insurance
** Information technology personnel
** [[Corporate title|Corporate management]] time
*Long term expenses
** Replacement
** Future upgrade or scalability expenses
** Decommissioning

In the case of comparing TCO of existing versus proposed solutions, consideration should put towards costs required to maintain the existing solution that may not necessarily be required for a proposed solution. Examples include cost of manual processing that are only required to support lack of existing automation, and extended support personnel.

===Transportation industry===
The TCO concept is widely used in the [[transportation]] industry.  For example, the TCO defines the cost of owning an [[automobile]] from the time of purchase by the owner, through its operation and maintenance to the time it leaves the possession of the owner. Comparative TCO studies between various models help consumers choose a car to fit their needs and budget.

Some of the key elements incorporated in the cost of ownership for a vehicle include&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/pricing/what-that-car-really-costs-to-own-4-08/overview/what-that-car-really-costs-to-own-ov.htm What that car really costs to own]&lt;/ref&gt;:
* [[Depreciation|Depreciation costs]]
* [[Fuel]] costs
* [[Insurance]]
* [[Financing]]
* [[Repairs]]
* Fees and taxes
* [[Maintenance, repair and operations|Maintenance]] costs
* [[Opportunity costs]]
* [[Downtime]] costs
