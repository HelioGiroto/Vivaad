A '''cash crop''' is an [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[crop]] which is grown for sale for profit. It is typically purchased by parties separate from a [[farm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/cropglossary.html | title=Ag 101: Crop Glossary | publisher=[http://www.epa.gov U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] | date=last updated: September 10, 2009 | accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term cash crop is applied exclusively to the agricultural production of [[plant]]s; animal agriculture is not a part of the terminology. The term is used to differentiate marketed crops from [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence crops]], which are those fed to the producer's own livestock or grown as food for the producer's family. In earlier times cash crops were usually only a small (but vital) part of a farm's total yield, while today, especially in the [[Developed country|developed countries]], almost all crops are mainly grown for revenue. In [[Least developed country|least developed countries]], cash crops are usually crops which attract demand in more developed nations, and hence have some export value.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Prices for major cash crops are set in [[commodity market]]s with global scope, with some local variation (termed as &quot;basis&quot;) based on [[Cargo|freight]] costs and local [[supply and demand]] balance. A consequence of this is that a nation, region, or individual producer relying on such a crop may suffer low prices should a [[bumper crop]] elsewhere lead to excess supply on the global markets. This system has been criticized by traditional farmers. [[Coffee]] is an example of a product that has been susceptible to significant commodity futures price variations.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN-Coffee&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/09/10/markets/coffee_prices/index.htm | title=Coffee prices on the rise | publisher=[http://money.cnn.com CNN Money] | date=September 10, 2010 | accessdate=April 3, 2012 | author=Ellis, Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg-Coffee&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-14/coffee-futures-fall-to-lowest-in-14-months-commodities-at-close.html | title=Coffee Futures Fall to Lowest in 14 Months: Commodities at Close | publisher=[http://www.bloomberg.com Bloomberg News] | date=February 14, 2012 | accessdate=April 3, 2012 | author=Galatola, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globalization==
Issues involving subsidies and trade barriers on such crops have become controversial in discussions of [[globalization]]. Many [[Developing country|developing countries]] take the position that the current international trade system is unfair because it has caused [[tariff]]s to be lowered in industrial goods while allowing for low tariffs and [[agricultural subsidies]] for agricultural goods.{{clarify|date=April 2012}} This makes it difficult for a developing nation to export its goods overseas, and forces developing nations to compete with imported goods which are exported from developed nations at artificially low prices. The practice of exporting at artificially low prices is known as [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bossche&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Van den Bossche| first = Peter| year = 2005| title = The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization| pages = 42| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge, UK| isbn= 978-0-511-12392-4| quote = Dumping, i.e. bringing a product onto the market of another country at a price less than the normal value of that product is condemned but not prohibited in WTO law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is illegal in most nations. Controversy over this issue led to the collapse of the [[Canc√∫n]] trade talks in 2003, when the [[Group of 22]] refused to consider agenda items proposed by the [[European Union]] unless the issue of agricultural subsidies was addressed.

==Per climate zones==
===Arctic===
The [[Climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]] is generally not conducive for the cultivation of cash crops. However, one potential cash crop for the [[Arctic]] is ''[[Rhodiola rosea]]'', a hardy plant used as a [[medicinal herb]] that grows in the Arctic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska Dispatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/medicinal-arctic-herb-alaskas-next-legal-cash-crop?page=full | title=Medicinal Arctic herb: Alaska's next (legal) cash crop? | publisher=[http://www.alaskadispatch.com/ Alaska Dispatch] | date=February 17, 2011 | accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently consumer demand for the plant, but the available supply is less than the demand (as of 2011).&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska Dispatch&quot;/&gt;

===Temperate===
Cash crops grown in regions with a [[temperate climate]] include many cereals ([[wheat]], [[rye]], [[maize|corn]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s), oil-yielding crops (e.g. [[oilseed rape]]), vegetables (e.g. [[potato]]es), tree fruit or top fruit (e.g. [[apple]]s, [[cherry|cherries]]) and soft fruit (e.g. [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]]).

[[File:Cameron Highland Tea Plantation 2012.JPG|thumb|right|A [[tea]] plantation in the [[Cameron Highlands]] in [[Malaysia]]]]

===Subtropical===
In regions with a [[subtropical climate]], [[cereal|grain]] crops (e.g. [[rice]], [[millet]]),  oil-yielding crops (e.g. [[soybean]]s) and some [[vegetable]]s and [[herb]]s are the predominant cash crops.

===Tropical===
In regions with a [[tropical climate]], [[coffee]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN-Coffee&quot;/&gt; [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[sugar cane]], [[banana]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[cotton]] and [[jute]] (a soft, shiny [[Fiber crop|vegetable fiber]] that can be spun into coarse, strong threads), are common cash crops. The [[oil palm]] is a tropical palm tree, and the fruit from it is used to make [[palm oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Reeves |first1=James B. |last2=Weihrauch |first2=John L. |author3=Consumer and Food Economics Institute |title=Composition of foods: fats and oils |series=Agriculture handbook 8-4 |year=1979 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Science and Education Administration |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=5301713 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 60 percent of African workers are employed in the agricultural sector, with about three-fifths of African farmers being [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} For example, in [[Burkina Faso]] 85% of its residents (over two million people) are reliant upon cotton production for income, and over half of the country's population lives in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba547 | title=Farm Subsidies: Devastating the World's Poor and the Environment | publisher=[http://www.ncpa.org/ National Center for Policy Analysis] | date=March 24, 2006 | accessdate=April 4, 2012 | author=Borders, Max Borders and Burnett, H.

These farms, typically operated by large corporations, cover tens of square kilometres and employ large numbers of laborers. Subsistence farms provide a source of food and a relatively small income for families, but generally fail to produce enough to make re-investment possible.

The situation in which African nations export crops while a significant amount of people on the continent struggle with hunger has been blamed on developed countries, including the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba547 | title=Farm Subsidies: Devastating the World's Poor and the Environment | publisher=[http://www.ncpa.org National Center for Policy Analysis] | date=March 24, 2006 | accessdate=April 6, 2012 | author=Borders, Max and Burnett, H. Sterling}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]] and the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} These countries protect their own agricultural sectors with high [[import tariff]]s and offer subsidies to their farmers,&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPA&quot;/&gt; which some have contended as leading to the overproduction of commodities such as cotton,&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPA&quot;/&gt; grain and milk.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The result of this is that the global price of such products is continually reduced until Africans are unable to compete in world markets,&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPA&quot;/&gt; except in cash crops that do not grow easily in temperate climates.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPA&quot;/&gt;

Cash cropping in the United States rose to prominence after the [[baby boomer]] generation and the end of World War II. It was seen as a way to feed the large population boom and continues to be the main factor in having an affordable food supply in the United States. According to the 1997 U.S. Census of Agriculture, 90% of the farms in the United States are still owned by families, with an additional 6% owned by a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/demographics.html | title=Ag 101: Demographics | publisher=[http://www.epa.gov U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] | date=last updated: September 10, 2009 | accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cash crop farmers have utilized precision agricultural technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://southeastfarmpress.com/equipment/alabama-growers-reap-big-savings-precision-ag | title=Alabama growers reap big savings with precision ag | publisher=[http://southeastfarmpress.com Southeast Farm Press] | date=February 2, 2011 | accessdate=April 3, 2012 | author=Creamer, Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined with time-tested practices to produce affordable food.
