      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10737">A '''cost overrun''', also known as a '''cost increase''' or '''budget overrun''', is an unexpected [[cost]] incurred in excess of a budgeted amount due to an underestimation of the actual cost during budgeting.  Cost overrun should be distinguished from [[cost escalation]], which is used to express an ''anticipated'' growth in a budgeted cost due to factors such as inflation.

Cost overrun is common in [[infrastructure]], [[building]], and [[technology]] projects. A comprehensive study of cost overrun published in the Journal of the American Planning Association in 2002 found that 9 out of ten construction [[projects]] had underestimated costs. Overruns of 50 to one hundred percent were also common.{{Synthesis-inline|date=October 2010}} Cost underestimation was found in each of 20 nations and five continents covered by the study, and cost underestimation had not decreased in the 70 years for which data were available.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucpwp&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

For [[IT projects]], an industry study by the Standish Group found that the average cost overrun was 43 percent; 71 percent of projects were over budget, exceeded time estimates, and had estimated too narrow a [[Scope (project management)|scope]]; and total waste was estimated at $55 billion per year in the US alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaos&quot;&gt;{{cite report

Many major construction projects have incurred cost overruns.  The [[Suez Canal]] cost 20 times as much as the earliest estimates; even the cost estimate produced the year before construction began underestimated the project's actual costs by a factor of three.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucpwp&quot;/&gt;  The [[Sydney Opera House]] cost 15 times more than was originally projected, and the [[Concorde]] supersonic aeroplane cost 12 times more than predicted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucpwp&quot;/&gt;  When Boston's &quot;[[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]]&quot; tunnel construction project was completed, the project was 275 percent ($11 billion) over budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;policy-planning&quot;&gt;{{cite report

The [[Channel Tunnel]] between the UK and France had a construction cost overrun of 80 percent, and a 140-percent [[financing]] cost overrun.&lt;ref name=&quot;policy-planning&quot;/&gt;

==Causes==
Three types of [[explanation]] for cost overrun exist: [[Technology|technical]], [[psychological]], and [[political]]-[[economic]]. Technical explanations account for cost overrun in terms of imperfect [[forecasting]] techniques, inadequate data, etc. Psychological explanations account for overrun in terms of [[optimism bias]] with forecasters. [[Scope creep]], where the requirements or targets rises during the project, is common. Finally, political-economic explanations see overrun as the result of [[strategic misrepresentation]] of scope or budgets.

All three explanations can be considered forms of [[risk]]. A project's budgeted costs should always include [[cost contingency]] funds to cover risks (other than scope changes imposed on the project). As has been shown in [[cost engineering]] research,&lt;ref name=&quot;hackney&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
poor [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]] and contingency estimating practices account for many project cost overruns. Numerous studies have found that the greatest cause of cost growth was poorly-defined scope at the time that the budget was established. The ''cost growth'', or overrun of the budget before [[cost contingency]] is added, can be predicted by rating the extent of scope definition, even on complex projects with new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Professor [[Bent Flyvbjerg]] of [[Oxford University]] and Martin Wachs of University of California, Los Angeles have shown that big public-works projects often have cost overruns due to strategic misrepresentation—&quot;that is, lying&quot;, as Flyvbjerg defines the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | title = Tunnel's cost may fool us all

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost overrun is typically calculated in one of two ways: either as a [[percentage]], namely actual cost minus budgeted cost, in percent of budgeted cost; or as a [[ratio]] of actual cost divided by budgeted cost. For example, if the budget for building a new bridge was $100 million, and the actual cost was $150 million, then the cost overrun may be expressed by the ratio 1.5, or as 50 percent.

[[Reference class forecasting]] was developed by Flyvbjerg to eliminate or reduce cost overruns and benefit shortfalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flyvbjerg |first=B. |year=2008 |url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/bt/Documents/Curbing%20Optimism%20Bias%20and%20Strategic%20Misrepresentation.pdf |title=Curbing Optimism Bias and Strategic Misrepresentation in Planning: Reference Class Forecasting in Practice |journal=European Planning Studies |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize winner in economics, calls Flyvbjerg's counsel to use reference class forecasting to de-bias estimates of costs and benefits, &quot;the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting.”&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kahneman, 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;
