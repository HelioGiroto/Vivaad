'''Opportunity cost''' is the cost of any [[activity]] measured in terms of the value of the next best alternative forgone (that is not chosen). It is the [[sacrifice]] related to the second best choice available to someone, or group, who has picked among several [[mutually exclusive]] choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Investopedia |title=Opportunity Cost |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opportunity cost is also the &quot;cost&quot; (as a lost benefit)  of the forgone products after making a choice. Opportunity cost is a key concept in [[economics]], and has been described as expressing &quot;the basic relationship between [[scarcity]] and [[utility|choice]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=opportunity+cost&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Opportunity cost |encyclopedia=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online |author=James M. Buchanan |authorlink=James M. Buchanan |year=2008 |edition=Second |accessdate=2010-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/alphabetic.cfm?letter=O#opportunitycost |title=Opportunity Cost |work=Economics A-Z  |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=2010-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real cost]] of [[Production possibilities frontier|output forgone]], lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides [[utility (economics)|utility]] should also be considered opportunity costs.

==Opportunity costs in consumption==
Opportunity cost is assessed in not only monetary or material terms, but also in terms of anything which is of value. For example, a person who desires to watch each of two television programs being broadcast simultaneously, and does not have the means to make a recording of one, can watch only one of the desired programs. Therefore, the opportunity cost of watching ''Dallas'' could be not enjoying the other program (such as ''Dynasty''). If an individual records one program while watching the other, the opportunity cost will be the time that the individual spends watching one program versus the other. In a restaurant situation, the opportunity cost of eating steak could be trying the salmon. The opportunity cost of ordering both meals could be twofold: the extra $20 to buy the second meal, and his reputation with his peers, as he may be thought of as greedy or extravagant for ordering two meals. A family might decide to use a short period of vacation time to visit Disneyland rather than doing household improvements. The opportunity cost of having happier children could therefore be a remodeled bathroom.

In [[environmental protection]], opportunity cost is also applicable. This has been demonstrated in the legislation that required the carcinogenic aromatics (mainly [[reformate]]) to be largely eliminated from gasoline. Unfortunately, this required refineries to install equipment at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars&amp;nbsp;– and pass the cost to the consumer. The absolute number of cancer cases attributed to exposure to gasoline, however, is low, estimated a few cases per year in the U.S.  Thus, the decision to require fewer aromatics has been criticized on the grounds of opportunity cost: the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on process redesign could have been spent on other, more fruitful ways of reducing deaths caused by cancer or automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Harold A. Wittcoff |author2=Bryan G. Reuben |author3=Jeffery S. Plotkin |year=2004 |page={{page needed|date=October 2011}} |title=Industrial Organic Chemicals |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-44385-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions (or strictly, the best one of them) are the opportunity cost of reduction of aromatics in gasoline.

The Opportunity Cost of consuming good y, relative to good x (y:x), can be calculated by the price of good y, relative to good x (Py/Px). For example, a movie (good x) costs $10 (Px) and bowling (good y) costs $20 (Py), the opportunity cost of going bowling is 2 movies (Py/Px = 20/10). That is the $20 spent on bowling could have been used to see two movies priced at $10. Conversely the opportunity cost of going to watch a movie is 0.5 (10/20) games of bowling. Units should be specified in the opportunity cost, for example if forgoing 3 party invitations to go out on a date you would not say &quot;I passed on 3 for this date&quot;, your date would need to know the units of the good forgone for the statement to make sense.

==Opportunity costs in production==
Opportunity costs may be assessed in the decision-making process of [[production (economics)|production]]. If the workers on a farm can produce either one million pounds of wheat or two million pounds of barley, then the opportunity cost of producing one pound of wheat is the two pounds of barley forgone (assuming the production possibilities frontier is linear). Firms would make rational decisions by weighing the sacrifices involved.

===Explicit costs===
Explicit costs are opportunity costs that involve direct monetary payment by producers. The opportunity cost of the [[factors of production]] not already owned by a producer is the price that the producer has to pay for them. For instance, a firm spends $100 on electrical power consumed, their opportunity cost is $100. The firm has sacrificed $100, which could have been spent on other factors of production.

===Implicit costs===
Implicit costs are the opportunity costs that in factors of production that a producer already owns. They are equivalent to what the factors could earn for the  firm in alternative uses, either operated within the firm or rent out to other firms. For example, a firm pays $300 a month all year for rent on a warehouse that only holds product for six months each year. The firm could rent the warehouse out for the unused six months, at any price (assuming a year-long lease requirement), and that would be the cost that could be spent on other factors of production.

==Non-monetary opportunity costs==
Opportunity costs are not always monetary units or being able to produce one good over another. The opportunity cost can also be unknown, or spawn a series of infinite sub opportunity costs.  For instance, an individual could choose not to ask a girl out on a date, in an attempt to make her more interested by playing hard to get, but the opportunity cost could be that they get completely ignored, which could lead to other opportunity costs.

==Evaluation==
Note that opportunity cost is not the ''sum'' of the available alternatives when those alternatives are, in turn, mutually exclusive to each other – it is the value of the ''next best'' use. The opportunity cost of a city's decision to build the hospital on its vacant land is the loss of the land for a sporting center, or the inability to use the land for a parking lot, or the money which could have been made from selling the land. Use for any one of those purposes would preclude the possibility to implement any of the other.

However, most opportunities are difficult to compare. Opportunity cost has been seen as the foundation of the [[marginal theory of value]] as well as the [[Time value of money|theory of time and money]].  In some cases, it may be possible to have more of everything by making different choices; for instance, when an economy is within its [[production possibility frontier]]. In microeconomic models this is unusual, because individuals are assumed to maximize [[utility]], but it is a feature of [[Keynesian]] macroeconomics. In these circumstances, opportunity cost is a less useful concept.

== History ==
The term was coined in 1914 by [[Friedrich von Wieser]] in his book &quot;{{lang|de|Theorie der gesellschaftlichen Wirtschaft}}&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedrich von Wieser |authorlink=Friedrich von Wieser |year=1927 |editor=A. Ford Hinrichs (translator) |url=http://mises.org/books/Social_Economics_Wieser.pdf |title=Social Economics |location=New York |publisher=Adelphi |accessdate=2011-10-07}}&lt;br /&gt;• {{cite book |author=Friedrich von Wieser |month=November |year=1914 |title=Theorie der gesellschaftlichen Wirtschaft |language=German |trans_title=Theory of Social Economics |postscript=. Original publication.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been many predecessors: [[Benjamin Franklin]] described the concept as &quot;time is money&quot; in his ''Advice to a Young Tradesman, Written by an Old One'' (1748), quoted by [[Max Weber]] in his ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905):
{{quotation|Remember, that ''time is money''.  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon ''that'' the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides.&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
Remember, that money is the ''prolific, generating nature''.  Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on.  Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds.  The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker.  He that kills a breeding sow, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation.  He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Franklin]], ''Advice to a Young Tradesman, Written by an Old One'' (1748), Italics in the original&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was also described in 1848 by [[Frédéric Bastiat]] in his essay &quot;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss1.html What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen]&quot;.
