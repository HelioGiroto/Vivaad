'''Operations research''', or '''operational research''' in British usage, is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/About-Operations-Research |title=About Operations Research |publisher=INFORMS.org |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be a sub-field of [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathontheweb.org/mathweb/mi-mathbyclass.html |title=Mathematics Subject Classification |publisher=American Mathematical Society |date= 23 May 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms '''management science''' and '''decision science''' are sometimes used as more modern-sounding synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/operations-research |title=Definition of Operations Research |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences, such as [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[mathematical optimization]], operations research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Because of its emphasis on human-technology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications, operations research has overlap with other disciplines, notably [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations management]], and draws on [[psychology]] and [[organization science]]. Operations Research is often concerned with determining the [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost) of some real-world objective. Originating in military efforts before World War II, its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;hsor.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsor.org/what_is_or.cfm |title=What is OR |publisher=HSOR.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Operational research (OR) encompasses a wide range of problem-solving techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decision-making and efficiency, such as [[simulation]], [[mathematical optimization]], [[queueing theory]] and other stochastic-process models, [[Markov Decision Process|Markov decision processes]], [[Econometrics|econometric methods]], [[data envelopment analysis]], [[neural networks]], [[Expert System|expert systems]], [[decision analysis]], and the [[analytic hierarchy process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos044.htm |title=Operations Research Analysts |publisher=Bls.gov |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all of these techniques involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the system. Because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these fields, OR also has strong ties to [[computer science]] and [[analytics]]. Operational researchers faced with a new problem must determine which of these techniques are most appropriate given the nature of the system, the goals for improvement, and constraints on time and computing power.

The major subdisciplines in modern operational research, as identified by the journal ''Operations Research'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.informs.org/site/OperationsResearch/index.php?c=10&amp;kat=Forthcoming+Papers |title=OR / Pubs / IOL Home |publisher=INFORMS.org |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:

==History==
As a formal discipline, operational research originated in the efforts of military planners during World War II. In the decades after the war, the techniques began to be applied more widely to problems in business, industry and society. Since that time, operational research has expanded into a field widely used in industries ranging from petrochemicals to airlines, finance, logistics, and government, moving to a focus on the development of mathematical models that can be used to analyse and optimize complex systems, and has become an area of active academic and industrial research.&lt;ref name=&quot;hsor.org&quot;/&gt;

===Historical origins===
In the World War II era, operational research was defined as &quot;a scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for decisions regarding the operations under their control.&quot;&lt;ref name=C67-3-4-48-para-1&gt;&quot;Operational Research in the British Army 1939–1945, October 1947, Report C67/3/4/48, UK National Archives file WO291/1301&lt;br /&gt;Quoted on the dust-jacket of: Morse, Philip M, and Kimball, George E, ''Methods of Operations Research'', 1st Edition Revised, pub MIT Press &amp; J Wiley, 5th printing, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for it included operational analysis (UK Ministry of Defence from 1962)&lt;ref name=PROCATWO291&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=109&amp;CATLN=2&amp;Highlight=&amp;FullDetails=True UK National Archives Catalogue for WO291] lists a War Office organisation called [[Army Operational Research Group]] (AORG) that existed from 1946 to 1962. &quot;In January 1962 the name was changed to Army Operational Research Establishment (AORE). Following the creation of a unified Ministry of Defence, a tri-service operational research organisation was established: the [[Defence Operational Research Establishment]] (DOAE) which was formed in 1965, and it absorbed the Army Operational Research Establishment based at West Byfleet.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and quantitative management.&lt;ref&gt;http://brochure.unisa.ac.za/myunisa/data/subjects/Quantitative%20Management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the formal start of the field, early work in operational research was carried out by individuals such as [[Charles Babbage]]. His research into the cost of transportation and sorting of mail led to England's [[Uniform Penny Post|universal &quot;Penny Post&quot;]] in 1840, and studies into the dynamical behaviour of railway vehicles in defence of the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]'s broad gauge.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Sodhi, &quot;What about the 'O' in O.R.?&quot; OR/MS Today, December, 2007, p. 12, http://www.lionhrtpub.com/orms/orms-12-07/frqed.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percy Bridgman]] brought operational research to bear on problems in physics in the 1920s and would later attempt to extend these to the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Bridgman, The Logic of Modern Physics, The MacMillan Company, New York, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; The modern field of operational research arose during World War II.

Modern operational research originated at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment|Bawdsey Research Station]] in the UK in 1937 and was the result of an initiative of the station's superintendent, [[Albert Percival Rowe|A. P. Rowe]]. Rowe conceived the idea as a means to analyse and improve the working of the UK's [[early warning radar]] system, [[Chain Home]] (CH). Initially, he analysed the operating of the radar equipment and its communication networks, expanding later to include the operating personnel's behaviour. This revealed unappreciated limitations of the CH network and allowed remedial action to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/682073/operations-research/68171/History#ref22348 |title=operations research (industrial engineering) :: History – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists in the United Kingdom including [[Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] (later Lord Blackett OM PRS), [[Cecil Gordon (scientist)|Cecil Gordon]], [[Conrad Hal Waddington|C. H. Waddington]], [[Owen Wansbrough-Jones]], [[Frank Yates]], [[Jacob Bronowski]] and [[Freeman Dyson]], and in the United States with [[George Dantzig]] looked for ways to make better decisions in such areas as [[logistics]] and training schedules. After the war it began to be applied to similar problems in industry.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War close to 1,000 men and women in Britain were engaged in operational research. About 200 operational research scientists worked for the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Blackett]] worked for several different organizations during the war. Early in the war while working for the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) he set up a team known as the &quot;Circus&quot; which helped to reduce the number of [[anti-aircraft artillery]] rounds needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft from an average of over 20,000 at the start of the [[Battle of Britain]] to 4,000 in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA94 pp. 91–94]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 Blackett moved from the RAE to the Navy, after first working with [[RAF Coastal Command]], in 1941 and then early in 1942 to the [[Admiralty]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA109 p. 96,109]&lt;/ref&gt; Blackett's team at Coastal Command's Operational Research Section (CC-ORS) included two future [[Nobel prize]] winners and many other people who went on to be pre-eminent in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; They undertook a number of crucial analyses that aided the war effort. Britain introduced the [[convoy]] system to reduce shipping losses, but while the principle of using warships to accompany merchant ships was generally accepted, it was unclear whether it was better for convoys to be small or large. Convoys travel at the speed of the slowest member, so small convoys can travel faster. It was also argued that small convoys would be harder for German [[U-boat]]s to detect. On the other hand, large convoys could deploy more warships against an attacker. Blackett's staff showed that the losses suffered by convoys depended largely on the number of escort vessels present, rather than on the overall size of the convoy. Their conclusion, therefore, was that a few large convoys are more defensible than many small ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familyheritage.ca/Articles/victory1943.html |title=&quot;Numbers are Essential&quot;: Victory in the North Atlantic Reconsidered, March–May 1943 |publisher=Familyheritage.ca |date=24 May 1943 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While performing an analysis of the methods used by [[RAF Coastal Command]] to hunt and destroy submarines, one of the analysts asked what colour the aircraft were. As most of them were from Bomber Command they were painted black for nighttime operations. At the suggestion of CC-ORS a test was run to see if that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in the grey North Atlantic skies. Tests showed that aircraft painted white were on average not spotted until they were 20% closer than those painted black. This change indicated that 30% more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the same number of sightings.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other work by the CC-ORS indicated that on average if the trigger depth of aerial-delivered [[depth charge]]s (DCs) were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet, the kill ratios would go up. The reason was that if a U-boat saw an aircraft only shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do no damage (because the U-boat wouldn't have had time to descend as far as 100 feet), and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20-foot kill zone of the charges was small. It was more efficient to attack those submarines close to the surface when the targets' locations were better known than to attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be guessed. Before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet, 1% of submerged U-boats were sunk and 14% damaged. After the change, 7% were sunk and 11% damaged. (If submarines were caught on the surface, even if attacked shortly after submerging, the numbers rose to 11% sunk and 15% damaged). Blackett observed &quot;there can be few cases where such a great operational gain had been obtained by such a small and simple change of tactics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(Kirby, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA103 pp. 102,103])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bomber Command's Operational Research Section (BC-ORS), analysed a report of a survey carried out by [[RAF Bomber Command]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For the survey, Bomber Command inspected all bombers returning from bombing raids over Germany over a particular period. All damage inflicted by German [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defences]] was noted and the recommendation was given that armour be added in the most heavily damaged areas. This recommendation was not adopted because the fact that the aircraft returned with these areas damaged indicated these areas were NOT vital, and adding armor weight to non-vital areas where damage is acceptable negatively affects aircraft performance. Their suggestion to remove some of the crew so that an aircraft loss would result in fewer personnel loss was also rejected by RAF command. Blackett's team made the logical recommendation that the armour be placed in the areas which were completely untouched by damage in the bombers which returned. They reasoned that the survey was biased, since it only included aircraft that returned to Britain. The untouched areas of returning aircraft were probably vital areas, which, if hit, would result in the loss of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dirty Little Secrets of the Twentieth Century | publisher=[[Harper Paperbacks]] | author=James F. Dunnigan | year=1999 | pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kammhuber Line Map - Agent Tegal.png|thumb|150px|left|Map of ''[[Kammhuber Line]]'']]
When Germany organised its air defences into the [[Kammhuber Line]], it was realised by the British that if the RAF bombers were to fly in a [[bomber stream]] they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew in individual cells directed to their targets by ground controllers. It was then a matter of calculating the statistical loss from collisions against the statistical loss from night fighters to calculate how close the bombers should fly to minimise RAF losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/thousands.html |title=RAF History – Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;exchange rate&quot; ratio of output to input was a characteristic feature of operational research. By comparing the number of flying hours put in by Allied aircraft to the number of U-boat sightings in a given area, it was possible to redistribute aircraft to more productive patrol areas. Comparison of exchange rates established &quot;effectiveness ratios&quot; useful in planning. The ratio of 60 [[Mine (naval)|mines]] laid per ship sunk was common to several campaigns: German mines in British ports, British mines on German routes, and United States mines in Japanese routes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proceedings&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Milkman, Raymond H. |title=Operations Research in World War II |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]] Proceedings |date=May 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operational research doubled the on-target bomb rate of [[B-29]]s bombing Japan from the [[Marianas Islands]] by increasing the training ratio from 4 to 10 percent of flying hours; revealed that wolf-packs of three United States submarines were the most effective number to enable all members of the pack to engage targets discovered on their individual patrol stations; revealed that glossy enamel paint was more effective camouflage for night fighters than traditional dull camouflage paint finish, and the smooth paint finish increased airspeed by reducing skin friction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proceedings&quot;/&gt;

On land, the operational research sections of the Army Operational Research Group (AORG) of the [[Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) were landed in [[Operation Overlord|Normandy in 1944]], and they followed British forces in the advance across Europe. They analysed, among other topics, the effectiveness of artillery, aerial bombing, and anti-tank shooting.

===After World War II===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
With expanded techniques and growing awareness of the field at the close of the war, operational research was no longer limited to only operational, but was extended to encompass equipment procurement, training, logistics and infrastructure.

==Problems addressed with operational research==
* [[Critical path analysis]] or [[project planning]]: identifying those processes in a complex project which affect the overall duration of the project
* [[Floorplanning]]: designing the layout of equipment in a factory or components on a [[computer chip]] to reduce [[manufacturing]] time (therefore reducing cost)
* [[Telecommunications network|Network optimization]]: for instance, setup of telecommunications networks to maintain quality of service during outages
* Allocation problems
* [[Facility location]]
* Assignment Problems:
** [[Assignment problem]]
** [[Generalized assignment problem]]
** [[Quadratic assignment problem]]
** [[Weapon target assignment problem]]
* [[Bayesian search theory]] : looking for a target
* [[Search theory|Optimal search]]
* [[Routing]], such as determining the routes of buses so that as few buses are needed as possible
* [[Supply chain management]]: managing the flow of raw materials and products based on uncertain demand for the finished products
* Efficient messaging and customer response tactics
* [[Automation]]: automating or integrating robotic systems in human-driven operations processes
* [[Globalization]]: globalizing operations processes in order to take advantage of cheaper materials, labor, land or other productivity inputs
* Transportation: managing [[freight]] transportation and delivery systems (Examples: [[Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping|LTL Shipping]], [[intermodal freight transport]])
* [[Scheduling algorithm|Scheduling]]:
** Personnel staffing
** Manufacturing steps
** [[Project management|Project tasks]]
** Network data traffic: these are known as [[queueing model]]s or queueing systems.
** Sports events and their television coverage
* Blending of raw materials in oil refineries
* Determining optimal prices, in many retail and B2B settings, within the disciplines of [[pricing science]]

Operational research is also used extensively in government where [[evidence-based policy]] is used.

==Management science==
In 1967 [[Stafford Beer]] characterized the field of management science as &quot;the business use of operations research&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stafford Beer]] (1967) ''Management Science: The Business Use of Operations Research''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern times the term management science may also be used to refer to the separate fields of [[organizational studies]] or [[corporate strategy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Like operational research itself, management science (MS) is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics devoted to optimal decision planning, with strong links with economics, business, engineering, and other [[sciences]]. It uses various [[scientific research]]-based principles, [[strategies]], and [[analytical method]]s including [[mathematical model]]ing, statistics and [[numerical algorithm]]s to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. In short, management sciences help businesses to achieve their goals using the scientific methods of operational research.

The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. Of course, the techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to military, medical, public administration, charitable groups, political groups or community groups.

Management science is concerned with developing and applying [[scientific modeling|models]] and [[concept]]s that may prove useful in helping to illuminate management issues and solve managerial problems, as well as designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence.&lt;ref name=&quot;LS&quot;&gt;[http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ What is Management Science?] Lancaster University, 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as Management science.&lt;ref name=&quot;UTK&quot;&gt;[http://bus.utk.edu/soms/information/whatis_msci.html What is Management Science?] The University of Tennessee, 2006. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techniques===
Some of the fields that have considerable overlap with Operations Research and Management Science include:

* [[Probability and statistics]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Policy analysis]]
* [[Simulation]]
* [[Social network]]/[[Transportation forecasting]] models
* [[Stochastic processes]]
* [[Supply chain management]]
{{multicol-end}}

===Applications of management science===
Applications of management science are abundant in industry as airlines, manufacturing companies, [[service organization]]s, military branches, and in government. The range of problems and issues to which management science has contributed insights and solutions is vast. It includes:&lt;ref name=&quot;LS&quot;/&gt;
* scheduling airlines, including both planes and crew,
* deciding the appropriate place to site new facilities such as a warehouse, factory or fire station,
* managing the flow of water from reservoirs,
* identifying possible future development paths for parts of the telecommunications industry,
* establishing the information needs and appropriate systems to supply them within the health service, and
* identifying and understanding the strategies adopted by companies for their information systems

Management science is also concerned with so-called ”soft-operational analysis”, which concerns methods for strategic planning, strategic decision support, and Problem Structuring Methods (PSM). In dealing with these sorts of challenges mathematical modeling and simulation are not appropriate or will not suffice. Therefore, during the past 30 years, a number of non-quantified modeling methods have been developed. These include:
* stakeholder based approaches including [[metagame analysis]] and drama theory
* [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] and various forms of [[influence diagram]]s.
* approaches using cognitive mapping
* the Strategic Choice Approach
* robustness analysis

In 2004 the US-based organization INFORMS began an initiative to market the OR profession better, including a website entitled ''The Science of Better''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceofbetter.org/ |title=The Science of Better |publisher=The Science of Better |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides an introduction to OR and examples of successful applications of OR to industrial problems. This initiative has been adopted by the Operational Research Society in the UK, including a website entitled ''Learn about OR''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnaboutor.co.uk/ |title=Learn about OR |publisher=Learn about OR |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
