      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6108">The '''Friedman rule''' is a [[monetary policy]] rule proposed by [[Milton Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Friedman (1969), ''The Optimum Quantity of Money,'' Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, Friedman advocated setting the [[nominal interest rate]] at zero. According to the logic of the Friedman rule, the [[opportunity cost]] of holding [[money]] faced by private agents should equal the [[social cost]] of creating additional [[fiat money]]. It is assumed that the [[marginal cost]] of creating additional money is zero (or approximated by zero). Therefore, nominal rates of interest should be zero. In practice, this means that the [[central bank]] should seek a rate of [[deflation]] equal to the [[real interest rate]] on [[government bond]]s and other safe assets, to make the nominal interest rate zero.

The result of this policy is that those who hold money don't suffer any loss in the value of that money due to [[inflation]]. The rule is motivated by [[long-run]] [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] considerations.

This is not to be confused with [[Friedman's k-percent rule]] which advocates a constant yearly expansion of the [[money supply|monetary base]].

== Friedman's argument ==

* The [[marginal benefit]] of holding additional money is the decrease in transaction costs represented by (for example) costs associated with the purchase of [[consumption goods]].
* With a positive nominal interest rate, people economise on their cash balances to the point that the [[marginal benefit]] (social and private) is equal to the [[marginal private cost]] (i.e., the nominal interest rate).
** This is not socially [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]], because the [[government]] can costlessly produce the cash until the supply is plentiful. A social optimum occurs when the nominal rate is zero (or deflation is at a rate equal to the real interest rate), so that the marginal social benefit and marginal social cost of holding money are equalized at zero.
* Thus, the Friedman Rule is designed to remove an [[inefficiency]], and by doing so, raise the mean of output.

== Use in economic theory ==
The Friedman rule has been shown to be the welfare maximizing monetary policy in many [[economic model]]s of money. It has been shown to be optimal in [[monetary economy|monetary economies]] with [[monopolistic competition]] (Ireland, 1996) and, under certain circumstances, in a variety of monetary economies where the government levies other distorting taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChariChristianoKehoe1996&quot;&gt;{{citation

These include economies with [[decreasing returns to scale]]; economies with imperfect [[Competition (economics)|competition]] where the government does not either fully tax [[monopoly profit]]s or set the tax equal to the labor [[income tax]]; economies with [[tax evasion]]; economies with [[sticky prices]]; and economies with downward nominal wage rigidity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Opt2010&quot;&gt;{{citation | last1 = Schmitt-Grohe | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Uribe | first2 = Martin | year = 2010 | title = The Optimal Rate of Inflation | journal = Handbook of Monetary Economics | volume = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While normally deviations from the Friedman Rule are typically small, if there is a significant foreign demand for a nations [[currency]], such as in the United States, the optimal rate of inflation is found to deviate significantly from what is called for by Friedman Rule in order to extract [[seigniorage]] revenue from foreign residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Opt2010&quot; /&gt; In the case of the United States, where over half of all [[U.S. dollar]]s are held overseas, the optimal rate of inflation is found to be anywhere from 2 to 10%, whereas the Friedman Rule would call for [[deflation]] of almost 4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Opt2010&quot; /&gt;

Recent results have also suggested that in order to achieve the goal of the Friedman Rule, namely to reduce the [[opportunity cost]] and monetary frictions associated with money, it may not be required that the nominal interest rate be set at zero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodford&quot;&gt;{{citation | last1 =Curdi | first1 = Vasco | last2 = Woodford | first2 = Michael | year = 2010 | title = 
The Central-Bank Balance Sheet as an Instrument of Monetary Policy | journal = NBER Working Paper 16208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the effects of [[financial intermediary|financial intermediaries]] and [[credit spread]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2012}} are taken into account, the welfare optimality implied by the Friedman Rule can instead be achieved by eliminating the interest rate differential between the policy nominal interest rate and the [[interest rate]] paid on [[Bank reserves|reserves]] by assuring that the rates are identical at all times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodford&quot; /&gt;
