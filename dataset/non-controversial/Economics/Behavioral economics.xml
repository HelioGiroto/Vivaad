      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46536">{{refimprove|date=August 2012}}'''Behavioral economics''' and the related field, '''behavioral finance''', study the effects of social, [[cognitive bias|cognitive]], and emotional factors on the [[economic]] [[decision making|decisions]] of individuals and institutions and the consequences for [[market price]]s, [[profit (economics)|returns]], and the [[allocation of resources|resource allocation]]. The fields are primarily concerned with the [[bounded rationality|bounds]] of [[rationality]] of [[homo economicus|economic agent]]s. [[Behavioral model]]s typically integrate insights from [[psychology]] with [[neo-classical economics|neo-classical economic theory]]. In so doing they cover a range of concepts, methods, and fields.&lt;ref&gt;Search of ''behavioural economics'' at (2008-) ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] Online''.[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=behavioural+economics+&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral analysts are not only concerned with the effects of [[market]] decisions but also with [[public choice]], which describes another source of economic decisions with related biases towards promoting self-interest.

There are three themes which are prevalent in behavioral finances:&lt;ref name= shefrin&gt;{{harvnb|Shefrin|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Heuristics]]: People often make decisions based on approximate [[rules of thumb]] and not strict logic.
*[[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]]: The collection of [[anecdote]]s and [[stereotype]]s that make up the mental emotional filters individuals rely on to understand and respond to events.
*[[Market anomaly|Market inefficiencies]]: These include ''[[price mechanism|mis-pricings]]'' and ''[[rationality|non-rational decision making]]''.

==Issues in behavioral economics==

===Behavioral finance===
The central issue in behavioral finance is explaining why market participants make systematic errors. Such errors affect prices and returns, creating market inefficiencies. It also investigates how other participants [[arbitrage]] such market inefficiencies.

Behavioral finance highlights inefficiencies such as under- or over-reactions to information as causes of [[market trend]]s (and in extreme cases of [[Economic bubble|bubble]]s and [[Stock market crash|crash]]es). Such reactions have been attributed to limited investor attention, overconfidence, overoptimism, mimicry ([[herding instinct]]) and noise trading. Technical analysts consider behavioral economics' academic cousin, behavioral finance, to be the theoretical basis for [[technical analysis]].&lt;ref name= kirkpatrick&gt;{{harvnb|Kirkpatrick|2007|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other key observations  include the asymmetry between decisions to acquire or keep resources, known as the &quot;bird in the bush&quot; paradox, and  [[loss aversion]], the unwillingness to let go of a valued possession. Loss aversion appears to manifest itself in investor behavior as a reluctance to sell shares or other equity, if doing so would result in a nominal loss.&lt;ref&gt;
Genesove &amp; Mayer, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It may also help explain why housing prices rarely/slowly decline to market clearing levels during periods of low demand.

Benartzi and Thaler (1995), applying a version of [[prospect theory]], claim to have solved the [[equity premium puzzle]], something conventional finance models have been unable to do so far.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Benartzi|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Experimental finance]] applies the experimental method, e.g. creating an artificial market by some kind of simulation software to study people's decision-making process and behavior in financial markets.

====Quantitative behavioral finance====
[[Quantitative behavioral finance]] uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases. In marketing research, a study shows little evidence that escalating biases impact marketing decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Escalation%20Bias.pdf | title = Escalation Bias: Does It Extend to Marketing? | author = J. Scott Armstrong, Nicole Coviello and Barbara Safranek | journal = Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, | volume = 21 | pages = 247–352 | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading contributors include [[Gunduz Caginalp]] (Editor of the [[Journal of Behavioral Finance]] from 2001–2004) and collaborators including 2002 Nobelist [[Vernon L. Smith|Vernon Smith]], David Porter, Don Balenovich,&lt;ref name= porter&gt;{{cite web |title= Dr. Donald A. Balenovich |publisher= Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Mathematics Department |url= http://www.ma.iup.edu/people/dabalen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimira Ilieva and Ahmet Duran,&lt;ref name= duran&gt;{{cite web |title= Ahmet Duran |publisher= Department of Mathematics, [[University of Michigan]]-Ann Arbor |url= http://www.umich.edu/~durana}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ray Sturm.&lt;ref name= sturm&gt;{{cite web |title= Dr Ray R. Sturm, CPA |publisher= College of Business Administration |url= http://www.bus.ucf.edu/rsturm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial models===
Some financial models used in money management and asset valuation incorporate behavioral finance parameters, for example:

* Thaler's model of price reactions to information, with two phases, underreaction-adjustment-overreaction, creating a price [[market trend|trend]]
:One characteristic of overreaction is that average returns  following announcements of good news is lower than following bad news. In other words, overreaction occurs if the market reacts too strongly or for too long to news, thus requiring adjustment in the opposite direction. As a result, outperforming assets in one period are likely to underperform in the following period.
* The [[stock valuation|stock image]] coefficient

====Criticisms====
Critics such as [[Eugene Fama]] typically support the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. They contend that behavioral finance is more a collection of anomalies than a true branch of [[finance]] and that these anomalies are either quickly priced out of the market or explained by appealing to [[market microstructure]] arguments. However, individual [[cognitive bias]]es are distinct from social biases; the former can be averaged out by the market, while the other can create positive [[feedback loop]]s that drive the market further and further from a &quot;[[fair price]]&quot; equilibrium. Similarly, for an anomaly to violate market efficiency, an investor must be able to trade against it and earn abnormal profits; this is not the case for many anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dimensional.com/famafrench/2009/08/fama-on-market-efficiency-in-a-volatile-market.html Fama on Market Efficiency in a Volatile Market&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific example of this criticism appears in some explanations of the [[equity premium puzzle]]. It is argued that the cause is [[barriers to entry|entry barriers]] (both practical and psychological) and that returns between stocks and bonds should equalize as electronic resources open up the stock market to more traders.&lt;ref&gt;See Freeman, 2004 for a review&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, others contend that most personal investment funds are managed through superannuation funds, minimizing the effect of these putative entry barriers. In addition, professional investors and fund managers seem to hold more bonds than one would expect given return differentials.

===Behavioral game theory===
Behavioral game theory is a subject that analyzes interactive [[Strategy (game theory)|strategic]] decisions and behavior using the [[methodology|methods]] of [[game theory]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Aumann|R.

=== Economic reasoning in non-human animals ===
A handful of [[comparative psychology|comparative psychologists]] at [[United States|American]] universities have attempted to demonstrate economic reasoning in non-human animals. Early attempts along these lines focus on the behavior of [[laboratory rat|rats]] and [[rock pigeon|pigeons]]. These studies draw on the tenets of [[behaviorism|behavioral psychology]], where the main goal is to discover analogs to human behavior in [[experiment|experimentally-tractable]] non-human animals. They are also methodologically similar to the work of [[Charles Ferster|Ferster]] and [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;skin&quot;&gt;Ferster, C.B. et al. (1957). Schedules of Reinforcement. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological similarities aside, early researchers in non-human economics deviate from [[behaviorism]] in their [[terminology]]. Although such studies are set up primarily in an [[operant conditioning chamber]], using food rewards for pecking/bar-pressing behavior, the researchers describe pecking and bar pressing not in terms of [[reinforcement]] and [[stimulus–response model|stimulus–response relationships]], but instead in terms of work, [[demand (economics)|demand]], [[budget]], and [[employment|labor]]. Recent studies have adopted a slightly different approach, taking a more [[evolution]]ary perspective, comparing economic behavior of humans to a species of non-human [[primate]], the [[capuchin monkey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;monkey&quot;&gt;Chen, M.K. et al. (2006). How basic are behavioral biases? Evidence from capuchin monkey trading behavior. J. Political Economy, 114 (3) 517-537.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The animal as a human analog ====
Many early studies of non-human economic reasoning were performed on rats and pigeons in an operant conditioning chamber. These studies looked at things like [[peck rate]](in the case of the pigeon) and [[bar-pressing rate]] (in the case of the rat) given certain conditions of reward. Early researchers claim, for example, that response pattern (pecking/bar pressing rate) is an appropriate analog to human [[labour supply|labor supply]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bat&quot;&gt;Battalio, R.C. et al. (1981). Income–leisure tradeoffs of animal workers. ''Am. Economic Review'', 71 (4) 621-632.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in this field advocate for the appropriateness of using animal economic behavior to understand the elementary components of human economic behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;kbook&quot;&gt;Kagel, J H. et al. (1995). ''Economic Choice Theory: An Experimental Analysis of Animal Behavior''. New York: Cambridge University Press Syndicate.&lt;/ref&gt; In a paper by Battalio, Green, and Kagel (1981, p 621),&lt;ref name=&quot;bat&quot; /&gt; they write
{{cquote|Space considerations do not permit a detailed discussion of the reasons why economists should take seriously the investigation of economic theories using nonhuman subjects....[Studies of economic behavior in non-human animals] provide a laboratory for identifying, testing, and better understanding general laws of economic behavior. Use of this laboratory is predicated on the fact that behavior as well as structure vary continuously across species, and that principles of economic behavior would be unique among behavioral principles if they did not apply, with some variation, of course, to the behavior of nonhumans.}}

==== Labor supply ====
The typical laboratory environment to study labor supply in pigeons is set up as follows. Pigeons are first deprived of food. Since the animals are hungry, food becomes highly desired. The pigeons are placed in an operant conditioning chamber and through [[shaping|orienting and exploring]] the environment of the chamber they discover that by pecking a small disk located on one side of the chamber, food is delivered to them. In effect, pecking behavior becomes [[reinforcement|reinforced]], as it is associated with food. Before long, the pigeon pecks at the disk (or stimulus) regularly.

In this circumstance, the pigeon is said to &quot;work&quot; for the food by pecking. The food, then, is thought of as the currency. The value of the currency can be adjusted in several ways, including the amount of food delivered, the rate of food delivery and the type of food delivered (some foods are more desirable than others).

Economic behavior similar to that observed in humans is discovered when the hungry pigeons stop working/work less when the reward is reduced. Researchers argue that this is similar to [[labour supply|labor supply]] behavior in humans. That is like humans (who, even in need, will only work so much for a given wage) the pigeons demonstrate decreases in pecking (work) when the reward (value) is reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;bat&quot; /&gt;

==== Demand ====
In human economics, a typical [[demand curve]] is negative. This means that as the price of a certain good increases, the amount that consumers are able to purchase decreases. Researchers studying demand curves in non-human animals such as rats observe that demand curves have [[slope|negative slopes]], consistent with the slope of human demand curves.

Researchers have studied demand in rats in a manner distinct from studying labor supply in pigeons. Specifically, say we have experimental subjects, rats, in an operant chamber and we require them to press a lever to receive a reward. The reward can be either food (reward pellets), water, or a commodity drink such as [[cherry cola]]. Unlike previous pigeon studies, where the work analog was pecking and the monetary analog was reward, in the studies on demand in rats, the monetary analog is bar pressing. Under these circumstances, the researchers claim that changing the number of bar presses required to obtain a commodity item is analogous to changing the price of a commodity item in human economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;kag&quot;&gt;Kagel, J.H. et al. (1981). Demand curves for animal consumers. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 96 (1), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, results of demand studies in non-human animals are that, as the bar-pressing requirement (cost) increases, the animal presses the bar the required number of times less often (payment).

==== Monkey trading behavior ====
Recent work on economic behavior in non-human animals has focused on capuchin monkey's and Gareth Bale. Here the researchers seem less inclined toward the [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] tradition of the laboratory animal-human behavior analog. Instead, they attempt to adopt a more [[evolution]]ary perspective, positing that economic reasoning might be basic, [[innate|unlearned]], and serve some [[adaptation|adaptive]] function.

One recent study &lt;ref name=&quot;monkey&quot; /&gt; involves the introduction of a [[currency]] system into a colony of captive capuchin monkeys. The currency is in the form of [[coin]]s and is redeemable for food and other purchasable items when exchanged with a researcher. Under these conditions, the researchers studied three features of monkey trading: [[demand]], [[loss aversion]], and [[risk aversion]].

In this study, monkeys are presented with an amount of money and are shown a certain amount of food or other goods. The monkeys must take the money and hand it to the experimenter in exchange for goods. In one condition of the experiment, after the monkey has paid for the goods, it has the option to take a sure amount of food now, or wait until the experimenter alters the amount of food presented. In this circumstance, the experimenter can either increase or decrease the amount of food given. Thus, this experimental setup allows the researchers to look at the gambling behavior of the animals. The experimenters can therefore ask the following questions: will the monkey take the sure amount of food? Will the monkey “gamble” by waiting until the experimenter changes the amount of food present? Does the decision of the animal depend on the circumstances? Results indicate that the monkeys are [[risk aversion|risk-averse]]: they prefer to take the initial amount of food than wait for the experimenter to change the amount presented.

The experimenters introduce several other manipulations, including changing the allocated budget, changing the cost of certain items, changing the items themselves. Specifically, the researchers found an increase in item purchase and consumption when that item decreases in value, a result consistent with those found in human economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;monkey&quot; /&gt;

Taken together, the results of this study indicate that capuchin monkeys are not only risk-averse, but are also sensitive to constructs such as price, budget, and payoff expectation. According to the researchers, the animals are not trained to behave in this way; these behaviors arise naturally in the trading environment. As a result, these researchers argue that basic economic behavior and reasoning might be unlearned, innate, and subject to [[natural selection]].

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
{{See also|Evolutionary economics}}
An [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective is that many of the seeming limitations in rational choice can be explained as being rational in the context of maximizing biological [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. Thus, when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death it may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains. It may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Paul H. Rubin and C. Monica Capra. The evolutionary psychology of economics. In {{cite doi|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the [[classical economics|classical period]], microeconomics was closely linked to psychology. For example, [[Adam Smith]] wrote ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'', which proposed psychological explanations of individual behavior, including concerns about fairness and [[justice (economics)|justice]],&lt;ref&gt;Nava Ashraf, Colin F. Camerer, and George Loewenstein (2005). &quot;Adam Smith, Behavioral Economist,&quot; ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 19(3), p. 142. [pp. [http://webserver1.pugetsound.edu/facultypages/gmilam/courses/econ291/readings/ASmithBenEcon.pdf 131-145].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote extensively on the psychological underpinnings of [[utility]]. However, during the development of [[neo-classical economics]] economists sought to reshape the discipline as a [[natural science]], deducing economic behavior from assumptions about the nature of economic agents. They developed the concept of [[homo economicus]], whose psychology was fundamentally rational. This led to unintended and unforeseen errors.

However, many important neo-classical economists employed more sophisticated psychological explanations, including [[Francis Edgeworth]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Irving Fisher]]. Economic psychology emerged in the 20th century in the works of [[Gabriel Tarde]],&lt;ref&gt;Tarde, G. [http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/tarde_gabriel/psycho_economique_t1/psycho_eco_t1.html Psychologie économique] (1902),&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Katona]]&lt;ref&gt;The Powerful Consumer: Psychological Studies of the American Economy. 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laszlo Garai]].&lt;ref&gt;Garai,L. [http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Identity_Economics.htm Identity Economics – An Alternative Economic Psychology.] 1990–2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expected utility]] and [[discounted utility]] models began to gain acceptance, generating testable [[hypotheses]] about decision making given [[uncertainty]] and [[intertemporal consumption]] respectively. Observed and repeatable anomalies eventually challenged those hypotheses, and further steps were taken by the Nobel prizewinner [[Maurice Allais]], for example in setting out the [[Allais paradox]], a decision problem he first presented in 1953 which contradicts the expected utility hypothesis.

[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
In the 1960s [[cognitive psychology]] began to shed more light on the brain as an information processing device (in contrast to [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] models). Psychologists in this field, such as Ward Edwards,&lt;ref name= ward&gt;{{cite web |title= Ward Edward Papers |publisher= Archival Collections |url=http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/collections/records/427home.html |accessdate= 2008-04-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080416235453/http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/libraries/collections/records/427home.html| archivedate= 16 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] began to compare their cognitive models of decision-making under risk and uncertainty to economic models of rational behavior. In [[mathematical psychology]], there is a longstanding interest in the transitivity of preference and what kind of measurement scale utility constitutes ([[R. Duncan Luce|Luce]], 2000).&lt;ref name = luce&gt;{{harvnb|Luce|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prospect theory===
In 1979, Kahneman and Tversky wrote ''[[Prospect theory]]: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk'', an important paper that used cognitive psychology to explain various divergences of economic decision making from neo-classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahneman|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospect theory is an example of [[generalized expected utility]] theory. Although not a conventional part of behavioral economics, generalized expected utility theory is similarly motivated by concerns about the descriptive inaccuracy of [[expected utility]] theory.

In 1968 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Laureate]] [[Gary Becker]] published ''Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach'', a seminal work that factored psychological elements into economic decision making. Becker, however, maintained strict consistency of preferences. Nobelist [[Herbert A. Simon]] developed the theory of [[Bounded Rationality]] to explain how people ''irrationally'' seek ''satisfaction'', instead of maximizing utility, as conventional economics presumed. [[Maurice Allais]] produced &quot;[[Allais Paradox]]&quot;, a crucial challenge to expected utility.

Psychological traits such as overconfidence, projection bias, and the effects of limited attention are now part of the theory. Other developments include a conference at the [[University of Chicago]],&lt;ref name= hogarth&gt;{{harvnb|Hogarth|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; a special behavioral economics edition of the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' ('In Memory of Amos Tversky') and Kahneman's 2002 Nobel for having &quot;integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty&quot;.&lt;ref name= kahneman&gt;{{cite web |title= Nobel Laureates 2002 |publisher= Nobelprize.org |url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/2002.html |accessdate= 2008-04-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080410071445/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/2002.html| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intertemporal choice===
Behavioral economics has also been applied to intertemporal choice. Intertemporal choice behavior is largely inconsistent, as exemplified by [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]]'s [[hyperbolic discounting]] (1975) which is one of the prominently studied observations, further developed by David Laibson, Ted O'Donoghue, and Matthew Rabin.  Hyperbolic discounting describes the tendency to discount outcomes in near future more than for outcomes in the far future. This pattern of discounting is dynamically inconsistent (or time-inconsistent), and therefore inconsistent with basic models of rational choice, since the rate of discount between time ''t'' and ''t+1'' will be low at time ''t-1'', when ''t'' is the near future, but high at time ''t'' when ''t'' is the present and time ''t+1'' the near future.

The pattern can actually be explained through models of [[subadditive discounting]] which distinguishes the delay and interval of discounting: people are less patient (per-time-unit) over shorter intervals regardless of when they occur.  Much of the recent work on intertemporal choice indicates that discounting is a constructed preference.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Discounting is influenced greatly by expectations, framing, focus, thought listings, mood, sign, glucose levels, and the scales used to describe what is discounted.  Some prominent researchers{{Who|date=June 2011}} question whether discounting, the major parameter of intertemporal choice, actually describes what people do when they make choices with future consequences.  Considering the variability of discount rates, this may be the case.

===Other areas of research===
Other branches of behavioral economics enrich the model of the utility function without implying inconsistency in preferences. Ernst Fehr, Armin Falk, and Matthew Rabin studied &quot;[[distributive justice|fairness]]&quot;, &quot;[[inequity aversion]]&quot;, and &quot;[[reciprocal altruism]]&quot;, weakening the neoclassical assumption of &quot;perfect [[selfishness]].&quot; This work is particularly applicable to wage setting. Work on &quot;intrinsic motivation&quot; by Gneezy and Rustichini and on &quot;identity&quot; by Akerlof and Kranton assumes agents derive utility from adopting personal and social norms in addition to conditional expected utility.

&quot;Conditional expected utility&quot; is a form of reasoning where the individual has an [[illusion of control]], and calculates the probabilities of external events and hence utility as a function of their own action, even when they have no causal ability to affect those external events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3791450 |author=Grafstein R |title=Rationality as Conditional Expected Utility Maximization |journal=Political Psychology|volume=16|issue=1 |pages=63–80 |year=1995 |jstor=3791450}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90015-T |author=Shafir E, Tversky A |title=Thinking through uncertainty: nonconsequential reasoning and choice|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=449–474|year=1992 |pmid=1473331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral economics caught on among the general public, with the success of books like [[Dan Ariely]]'s ''[[Predictably Irrational]].'' Practitioners of the discipline have studied quasi-public policy topics such as [[Broadband mapping in the United States|broadband mapping]].&lt;ref name=twsA2faa4&gt;{{cite web

==Criticisms==
Critics of behavioral economics typically stress the [[rationality]] of economic agents.&lt;ref&gt;
see Myagkov and Plott (1997) amongst others&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that experimentally observed behavior has limited application to market situations, as learning opportunities and competition ensure at least a close approximation of rational behavior.

Others note that cognitive theories, such as [[prospect theory]], are models of [[decision making]], not generalized economic behavior, and are only applicable to the sort of once-off decision problems presented to experiment participants or survey respondents.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Traditional economists are also skeptical of the experimental and survey-based techniques which behavioral economics uses extensively. Economists typically stress [[revealed preference]]s over stated preferences (from surveys) in the determination of economic value. Experiments and surveys are at risk of [[systemic bias]]es, strategic behavior and lack of incentive compatibility.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Rabin (1998)&lt;ref name= rabin&gt;{{harvnb|Rabin|1998|11–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; dismisses these criticisms, claiming that consistent results are typically obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight. Behavioral economists have also responded to these criticisms by focusing on field studies rather than lab experiments. Some economists see a fundamental schism between [[experimental economics]] and behavioral economics, but prominent behavioral and experimental economists tend to share techniques and approaches in answering common questions. For example, behavioral economists are actively investigating [[neuroeconomics]], which is entirely experimental and cannot be verified in the field.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Other proponents of behavioral economics note that neoclassical models often fail to predict outcomes in real world contexts. Behavioral insights can influence neoclassical models. Behavioral economists note that these revised models not only reach the same correct predictions as the traditional models, but also correctly predict some outcomes where the traditional models failed.{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}
