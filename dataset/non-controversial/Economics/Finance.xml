{{Finance sidebar}}
'''Finance''' is the study of how [[investors]] allocate their [[assets]] over time under conditions of certainty and uncertainty. A key point in finance, which affects decisions, is the [[time value of money]], which states that a unit of currency today is worth more than the same unit of currency tomorrow. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level, and expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub categories:  [[public finance]], [[corporate finance]] and [[personal finance]].

==Areas of finance==

===Personal finance===
{{Main|Personal finance}}
Questions in personal finance revolve around
*How can people protect themselves against unforeseen personal events, as well as those in the external economy?
*How can family assets best be transferred across generations (bequests and inheritance)?
*How does tax policy (tax subsidies and/or penalties) affect personal financial decisions?
*How does credit affect an individual's financial standing?
*How can one plan for a secure financial future in an environment of economic instability?

Personal financial decisions may involve paying for education, financing [[durable goods]] such as [[real estate]] and cars, buying [[insurance]], e.g. health and property insurance, investing and saving for [[retirement]].

Personal financial decisions may also involve paying for a loan, or debt obligations.
The six key areas of personal financial planning, as suggested by the Financial Planning Standards Board, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpsb.org/component/docman/doc_download/1008-financial-planning-curriculum-framework.html|title=Financial Planning Curriculum Framework|year=2011|publisher=Financial Planning Standards Board|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Financial position:''' is concerned with understanding the personal resources available by examining net worth and household cash flow.  Net worth is a person's balance sheet, calculated by adding up all assets under that person's control, minus all liabilities of the household, at one point in time.  Household cash flow totals up all the expected sources of income within a year, minus all expected expenses within the same year.  From this analysis, the financial planner can determine to what degree and in what time the personal goals can be accomplished.
# '''[[Insurance|Adequate protection]]:''' the analysis of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks.  These risks can be divided into liability, property, death, disability, health and long term care.  Some of these risks may be self-insurable, while most will require the purchase of an insurance contract.  Determining how much insurance to get, at the most cost effective terms requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance.  Business owners, professionals, athletes and entertainers require specialized insurance professionals to adequately protect themselves.  Since insurance also enjoys some tax benefits, utilizing insurance investment products may be a critical piece of the overall investment planning.
# '''Tax planning:''' typically the income tax is the single largest expense in a household.  Managing taxes is not a question of if you will pay taxes, but when and how much.  Government gives many incentives in the form of tax deductions and credits, which can be used to reduce the lifetime tax burden.  Most modern governments use a progressive tax.  Typically, as one's income grows, a higher marginal rate of tax must be paid.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Understanding how to take advantage of the myriad tax breaks when planning one's personal finances can make a significant impact.
# '''Investment and accumulation goals:''' planning how to accumulate enough money for large purchases, and life events is what most people consider to be financial planning.  Major reasons to accumulate assets include, purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement.

Achieving these goals requires projecting what they will cost, and when you need to withdraw funds.  A major risk to the household in achieving their accumulation goal is the rate of price increases over time, or [[inflation]].  Using net present value calculators, the financial planner will suggest a combination of asset earmarking and regular savings to be invested in a variety of investments.  In order to overcome the rate of inflation, the investment portfolio has to get a higher rate of return, which typically will subject the portfolio to a number of risks.  Managing these portfolio risks is most often accomplished using asset allocation, which seeks to diversify investment risk and opportunity.  This asset allocation will prescribe a percentage allocation to be invested in stocks, bonds, cash and alternative investments.  The allocation should also take into consideration the personal risk profile of every investor, since risk attitudes vary from person to person.
# '''Retirement planning''' is the process of understanding how much it costs to live at retirement, and coming up with a plan to distribute assets to meet any income shortfall. Methods for retirement plan include taking advantage of government allowed structures to manage tax liability including: individual ([[Individual retirement account|IRA]]) structures, or employer sponsored [[retirement plans]].
# '''[[Estate planning]]''' involves planning for the disposition of one's assets after death.  Typically, there is a tax due to the state or federal government at your death.  Avoiding these taxes means that more of your assets will be distributed to your heirs.  You can leave your assets to family, friends or charitable groups.

===Corporate finance===
{{Main|Corporate finance}}
[[Managerial finance|Managerial]] or [[corporate finance]] is the task of providing the funds for a corporation's activities (for [[small business]], this is referred to as [[SME finance]]). Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability, while attempting to maximize an entity's wealth and the value of its [[stock]], and generically entails three interrelated decisions. In the first, &quot;[[Corporate_finance#The_investment_decision|the investment decision]]&quot;, management must decide which &quot;projects&quot; (if any) to undertake. The discipline of [[capital budgeting]] is devoted to this question, and may employ standard [[business valuation]] techniques or even extend to [[real options valuation]]; see [[Financial_modeling#Accounting|Financial modeling]].  The second, &quot;[[Corporate_finance#The_financing_decision|the financing decision]]&quot; relates to how these investments are to be funded: capital here is provided by shareholders, in the form of [[Equity (finance)|equity]] (privately or via an [[initial public offering]]), [[creditor]]s, often in the form of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and the firm's operations ([[cash flow]]). Short-term funding or [[working capital]] is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit. The balance between these elements forms the company's [[capital structure]].  The third, &quot;[[Corporate_finance#The_dividend_decision|the dividend decision]]&quot;, requires management to determine whether any unappropriated profit is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements, or instead to be distributed to shareholders, and if so in what form.  Short term financial management is often termed &quot;[[working capital management]]&quot;, and relates to [[cash management|cash-]], [[inventory]]- and [[debtor]]s management. These areas often overlap with the firm's [[Accounting profession|accounting function]], however, [[financial accounting]] is more concerned with the reporting of historical financial information, while these financial decisions are directed toward the future of the firm.

Another business decision concerning finance is investment, or [[fund management]]. An investment is an acquisition of an [[asset]] in the hope that it will maintain or increase its value. In [[List of finance topics#Investment management|investment management]]{{spaced ndash}} in choosing a [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]{{spaced ndash}} one has to decide ''what'', ''how much'' and ''when'' to invest. To do this, a company must:
* Identify relevant objectives and constraints: institution or individual goals, time horizon, risk aversion and tax considerations;
* Identify the appropriate strategy: active versus passive hedging strategy
* Measure the portfolio performance

Financial management is duplicate with the financial function of the [[Accounting profession]]. However, [[financial accounting]] is more concerned with the reporting of historical financial information, while the financial decision is directed toward the future of the firm.

[[Financial risk management]], an element of corporate finance, is the practice of creating and protecting [[economic value]] in a [[business|firm]] by using [[financial instruments]] to manage exposure to [[financial risk|risk]], particularly [[credit risk]] and [[market risk]]. (Other risk types include [[Foreign exchange risk|Foreign exchange]], Shape, [[Volatility (finance)|Volatility]], Sector, [[Liquidity]], [[Inflation]] risks, etc.)  It focuses on when and how to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] using financial instruments; in this sense it overlaps with [[financial engineering]].  Similar to general [[risk management]], financial risk management requires identifying its sources, measuring it (see: [[Risk_measure#Well_known_risk_measures|Risk measure: Well known risk measures]]), and formulating plans to address these, and can be qualitative and quantitative. In the banking sector worldwide, the [[Basel Accords]] are generally adopted by internationally active banks for tracking, reporting and exposing operational, credit and market risks.

====Financial services====
{{Main|Financial services}}
An entity whose income exceeds its expenditure can lend or invest the excess income. On the other hand, an entity whose income is less than its expenditure can raise capital by borrowing or selling equity claims, decreasing its expenses, or increasing its income. The lender can find a borrower, a [[financial intermediary]] such as a [[bank]], or buy notes or bonds in the [[bond market]]. The lender receives interest, the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.

A bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders. A bank accepts deposits from lenders, on which it pays interest. The bank then lends these deposits to borrowers. Banks allow borrowers and lenders, of different sizes, to coordinate their activity.

Finance is used by individuals ([[personal finance]]), by governments ([[public finance]]), by businesses ([[corporate finance]]) and by a wide variety of other organizations, including schools and non-profit organizations. In general, the goals of each of the above activities are achieved through the use of appropriate financial instruments and methodologies, with consideration to their institutional setting.

Finance is one of the most important aspects of [[business management]] and includes decisions related to the use and acquisition of funds for the enterprise.

In corporate finance, a company's [[capital structure]] is the total mix of financing methods it uses to raise funds. One method is ''debt financing'', which includes bank loans and bond sales. Another method is ''[[equity financing]]'' - the sale of stock by a company to investors, the original shareholders of a share.  Ownership of a share gives the shareholder certain contractual rights and powers, which typically include the right to receive declared dividends and to vote the proxy on important matters (e.g., board elections).  The owners of both bonds and stock, may be ''[[institutional investors]]'' - financial institutions such as investment banks and [[pension fund]]s&amp;nbsp; or private individuals, called ''[[private investors]]'' or ''retail investors''.

===Public finance===
{{Main|Public finance}}
Public finance describes finance as related to sovereign states and sub-national entities (states/provinces, counties, municipalities, etc.) and related public entities (e.g. school districts) or agencies. It is concerned with:
* Identification of required expenditure of a public sector entity
* Source(s) of that entity's revenue
* The budgeting process
* Debt issuance ([[municipal bond]]s) for public works projects

Central banks, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]] banks in the [[United States]] and [[Bank of England]] in the [[United Kingdom]], are strong players in public finance, acting as [[lender of last resort|lenders of last resort]] as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System of the United States. Mission of the Federal Reserve System. [http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/mission.htm Federalreserve.gov] Accessed: 2010-01-16. (Archived by WebCite at [http://www.webcitation.org/5mpS52OAl Webcitation.org])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital==
{{Main|Financial capital}}

[[Capital (economics)|Capital]], in the financial sense, is the money that gives the business the power to buy goods to be used in the production of other goods or the offering of a service.
(The capital has two types of resources Equity and Debt)

The deployment of capital is decided by the budget. This may include the objective of business, targets set, and results in financial terms, e.g., the target set for sale, resulting cost, growth, required investment to achieve the planned sales, and financing source for the investment.

A budget may be long term or short term. Long term budgets have a time horizon of 5–10&amp;nbsp;years giving a vision to the company; short term is an annual budget which is drawn to control and operate in that particular year.

Budgets will include proposed fixed asset requirements and how these expenditures will be financed. Capital budgets are often adjusted annually and should be part of a longer-term Capital Improvements Plan.

A cash budget is also required. The working capital requirements of a business are monitored at all times to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to meet short-term expenses.

The cash budget is basically a detailed plan that shows all expected sources and uses of cash. The cash budget has the following six main sections:

# '''Beginning Cash Balance''' - contains the last period's closing cash balance.
# '''Cash collections''' - includes all expected cash receipts (all sources of cash for the period considered, mainly sales)
# '''Cash disbursements''' - lists all planned cash outflows for the period, excluding interest payments on short-term loans, which appear in the financing section. All expenses that do not affect cash flow are excluded from this list (e.g. depreciation, amortization, etc.)
# '''Cash excess or deficiency''' - a function of the cash needs and cash available. Cash needs are determined by the total cash disbursements plus the minimum cash balance required by company policy. If total cash available is less than cash needs, a deficiency exists.
# '''Financing''' - discloses the planned borrowings and repayments, including interest.

==Financial theory==

===Financial economics===
{{Main|Financial economics}}

Financial economics is the branch of [[economics]] studying the interrelation of financial [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], such as [[price]]s, [[interest rate]]s and shares, as opposed to those concerning the real economy. Financial economics concentrates on influences of [[Real vs. nominal in economics|real]] economic variables on financial ones, in contrast to pure finance.  It centres on [[decision making]] under [[uncertainty]] in the context of the [[financial market]]s, and the resultant [[economic model|economic]] and [[financial model]]s.  It essentially explores how [[homo economicus|rational investors]] would apply [[decision theory]] to the problem of [[investment]].  Here, the twin assumptions of [[rational pricing|rationality]] and [[efficient markets|market efficiency]] lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]]), and to the [[Black–Scholes]] theory for [[Valuation of options|option valuation]]; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold, or are extended. &quot;Financial economics&quot;, at least formally, also considers investment under &quot;[[certainty]]&quot; ([[Fisher separation theorem]], [[The Theory of Investment Value|&quot;theory of investment value&quot;]], [[Modigliani-Miller theorem]]) and hence also contributes to corporate finance theory. [[Financial Econometrics]] is the branch of Financial Economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.

Although closely related, the disciplines of economics and finance are distinctive. The “economy” is a social institution that organizes a society’s production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services,” all of which must be financed. 

Economists make a number of abstract assumptions for purposes of their analyses and predictions. They generally regard financial markets that function for the financial system as an efficient mechanism. Instead, financial markets are subject to human error and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Berezin, M. (2005). &quot;Emotions and the Economy&quot; in Smelser, N.J. and R. Swedberg (eds.) The Handbook of Economic Sociology, Second Edition. Princeton University Press: Princeton, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; New research discloses the mischaracterization of investment safety and measures of financial products and markets so complex that their effects, especially under conditions of uncertainty, are impossible to predict. The study of finance is subsumed under economics as financial economics, but the scope, speed, power relations and practices of the financial system can uplift or cripple whole economies and the well-being of households, businesses and governing bodies within them—sometimes in a single day.

===Financial mathematics===
{{Main|Financial mathematics}}
Financial mathematics is a field of [[applied mathematics]], concerned with [[financial market]]s. The subject has a close relationship with the discipline of financial economics, which is concerned with much of the underlying theory.  Generally, [[mathematical finance]] will derive, and extend, the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models suggested by financial economics. In terms of practice, mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the field of [[computational finance]] (also known as ''[[financial engineering]]''). Arguably, these are largely synonymous, although the latter focuses on application, while the former focuses on modeling and derivation (''see: [[Quantitative analyst]]'').  The field is largely focused on the modelling of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], although other important subfields include [[actuarial science|insurance mathematics]] and quantitative [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio problems]]. See [[Outline_of_finance#Mathematical_tools|Outline of finance: Mathematical tools]]; [[Outline_of_finance#Derivatives_pricing|Outline of finance: Derivatives pricing]].

===Experimental finance===
{{Main|Experimental finance}}

[[Experimental finance]] aims to establish different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and provide a lens through which science can analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions, and attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended. Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behaviour of people in artificial competitive market-like settings.

===Behavioral finance===
{{Main|Behavioral finance}}

[[Behavioral Finance]] studies how the psychology of investors or managers affects financial decisions and markets. Behavioral finance has grown over the last few decades to become central to finance.

Behavioral finance includes such topics as:
# Empirical studies that demonstrate significant deviations from classical theories.
# Models of how psychology affects trading and prices
# Forecasting based on these methods.
# Studies of experimental asset markets and use of models to forecast experiments.

A strand of behavioral finance has been dubbed Quantitative Behavioral Finance, which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation. Some of this endeavor has been led by [[Gunduz Caginalp]] (Professor of Mathematics and Editor of [[Journal of Behavioral Finance]] during 2001-2004) and collaborators including [[Vernon L. Smith|Vernon Smith]] (2002 Nobel Laureate in Economics), David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva, Ahmet Duran). Studies by Jeff Madura, Ray Sturm and others have demonstrated significant behavioral effects in stocks and exchange traded funds. Among other topics, quantitative behavioral finance studies behavioral effects together with the non-classical assumption of the finiteness of assets.

===Intangible asset finance===
{{Main|Intangible asset finance}}

Intangible asset finance is the area of finance that deals with intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, goodwill, reputation, etc.
