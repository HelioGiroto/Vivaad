The '''euro''' ([[currency sign|sign]]: [[euro sign|€]]; [[ISO 4217|code]]: '''EUR''') is the currency used by the [[Institutions of the European Union]] and is the official currency of the [[eurozone]], which consists of 17 of the 27 [[member states of the European Union]]: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Cyprus]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/lists/a/euro.htm|title= Euro Countries: 22 Countries use the Euro as their Official Currency|last=Rosenberg|first=Matt|publisher=About.com|date=23 May 2010|accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10264800.stm |title=EU ministers back Estonia bid to join euro |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currency is also used in a further [[International status and usage of the euro|five European countries]] and consequently used daily by some 332&amp;nbsp;million [[Europeans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00001&amp;tableSelection=1&amp;footnotes=yes&amp;labeling=labels&amp;plugin=1 |title=Total population as of 1 January |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, more than 175&amp;nbsp;million people worldwide—including 150&amp;nbsp;million people in Africa—use currencies [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the euro.

In July 2012, the euro fell below US$1.21 for the first time in two years, following concerns raised over Greek debt and Spain's troubled banking sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/global-markets/global-markets-tumble-on-spain-italy-worries/articleshow/13679369.cms | title= Global markets tumble on Spain, Italy worries| date=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
[[File:European Central Bank 041107.jpg|thumb|The [[European Central Bank|ECB]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, is in charge of the eurozone's monetary policy.]]
{{Main|European Central Bank|Maastricht Treaty|Euro Group}}
The euro is managed and administered by the [[Frankfurt]]-based [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and the [[Eurosystem]] (composed of the [[central bank]]s of the eurozone countries). As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole authority to set [[monetary policy]]. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of [[euro banknotes|notes]] and [[euro coins|coins]] in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems.

The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary [[convergence criteria]], although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Euro |publisher=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/index_en.htm |accessdate=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.

Since 1 January 2002, the national central banks (NCBs) and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheller&quot;&gt;The  European Central Bank history, role and functions by Hanspeter K. Scheller Second Revised Edition 2006, ISBN 92-899-0022-9 (print) ISBN 92-899-0027-X (online) page 103 at the pdf online version&lt;/ref&gt; Euro banknotes do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of the total value of banknotes issued by the Eurosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheller&quot;/&gt; In practice, the ECB’s banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of the euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares in the capital key of the ECB,&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheller&quot;/&gt; calculated using national share of European Union population and national share of European Union GDP, equally weighted.&lt;ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Coins and banknotes===
[[File:Euro coins.jpg|thumb|left|All euro coins have a common side, and a national side chosen by the issuing bank.]]
{{Main|Euro coins|Euro banknotes}}
The euro is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cents]] (sometimes referred to as '''euro cents''', especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts the plural forms of ''euro'' and ''cent'' are spelled without the ''s'', notwithstanding normal English usage.&lt;ref name=&quot;ec.europa.eu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication6336_en.pdf |title=Spelling of the words &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; in official Community languages as used in Community Legislative acts |accessdate=26 November 2008 |author=European Commission |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, normal English plurals are recommended and used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf |title=English Style Guide: A handbook for authors and translators in the European Commission |accessdate=16 November 2008 |author=European Commission Directorate-General for Translation |format=PDF}}; {{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm |title=Interinstitutional style guide, 7.3.3. Rules for expressing monetary units |accessdate=16 November 2008 |author=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many [[Linguistic issues concerning the euro|local variations]] such as 'centime' in France.

All circulating coins have a ''common side'' showing the denomination or value, and a map in the background. Due to the [[Languages of the European Union|linguistic plurality of Europe]], the Latin alphabet version of euro is used (as opposed to the less common Greek or Cyrillic) and [[Arabic numerals]] (other text is used on national sides in national languages, but other text on the common side is avoided). For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, that map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced. Beginning in 2007 or 2008 (depending on the country) the old map is being replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the Union like Norway. The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map. All common sides were designed by [[Luc Luycx]]. The coins also have a ''national side'' showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro.
[[File:2 euro coins.JPG|thumb|Right|The common and national sides of the €2 coin]]
The coins are issued in [[2 euro coins|€2]], [[1 euro coins|€1]], [[50 cent euro coins|50c]], [[20 cent euro coins|20c]], [[10 cent euro coins|10c]], [[5 cent euro coins|5c]], [[2 cent euro coins|2c]], and [[1 cent euro coins|1c]] denominations. In order to avoid the use of the two smallest coins, some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland (by law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[European Commission]] |title=Euro cash: five and familiar |url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/een/005/article_4324_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |date = January 2007|accessdate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is discouraged by the Commission, as is the practice of certain shops to refuse to accept high value euro notes.&lt;ref&gt;Pop, Valentina (22 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/?aid=29737 Commission frowns on shop signs that say: '€500 notes not accepted'], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[€2 commemorative coins|Commemorative coins]] with €2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector's coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/introducing_euro_practical_aspects/l25058_en.htm |title=Commission communication: The introduction of euro banknotes and coins one year after COM(2002) 747 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |author=European Commission |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=15 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design for the [[euro banknotes]] has common designs on both sides. The design was created by the Austrian designer [[Robert Kalina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;euro96&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/changeover/2002/photos/html/image12.en.html |title=Robert Kalina, designer of the euro banknotes, at work at the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in Vienna |publisher=European Central Bank |date= |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notes are issued in [[500 euro note|€500]], [[200 euro note|€200]], [[100 euro note|€100]], [[50 euro note|€50]], [[20 euro note|€20]], [[10 euro note|€10]], [[5 euro note|€5]]. Each banknote has its own colour and is dedicated to an artistic period of European architecture. The front of the note features windows or gateways while the back has bridges, symbolizing links between countries and with the future. While the designs are supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics, the initial designs by [[Robert Kalina]] were of specific bridges, including the [[Rialto]]  and the [[Pont de Neuilly]], and were subsequently rendered more generic; the final designs still bear very close similarities to their specific prototypes; thus they are not truly generic. The monuments looked similar enough to different national monuments to please everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmid |first=John |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/03/news/03iht-euro_ed3_.html |title=Etching the Notes of a New European Identity|work=International Herald Tribune |date=3 August 2001 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payments clearing, electronic funds transfer===
{{Main|Single Euro Payments Area}}
Capital within the EU may be transferred in any amount from one country to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R2560:EN:HTML|title=Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2001 on cross-border payments in euro |publisher=EUR-lex&amp;nbsp;– European Communities, Publications office, Official Journal L 344, 28 December 2001 P. 0013&amp;nbsp;– 0016 |accessdate=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.gov.uk/crossborder.asp |title=Cross border payments in the EU, Euro Information, The Official Treasury Euro Resource |publisher=United Kingdom Treasury |accessdate=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions, however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a [[clearing (finance)|clearing system]], [[TARGET]], for large euro transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/paym/target/html/index.en.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080121081217/http://www.ecb.int/paym/target/html/index.en.html |archivedate=21 January 2008 |title=TARGET |author=European Central Bank |accessdate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currency sign===
[[File:Euro logo plus character.png|thumb|The euro sign; [[logo]]type and handwritten]]
{{Main|Euro sign}}
A special [[euro sign|euro currency sign]] (€) was designed after a public survey had narrowed the original ten proposals down to two. The European Commission then chose the design created by the Belgian Alain Billiet. The official story of the design history of the euro sign is disputed by [[Arthur Eisenmenger]], a former chief graphic designer for the [[European Community|EEC]], who claims to have created it as a generic symbol of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4325292-102275,00.html |title=Inventor who coined euro sign fights for recognition |work=The Guardian |location=UK |first=Kate |last=Connolly |date=23 December 2001 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Inspiration for the € symbol itself came from the [[Epsilon|Greek epsilon]] (Є)&lt;ref group=note&gt;In the quotation, the [[epsilon]] is actually represented with the Cyrillic capital letter Ukrainian ye ([[Є]], [[Unicode|U+]]0404) instead of the technically more appropriate Greek lunate epsilon symbol ('''ϵ''', U+03F5).&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a reference to the cradle of European civilization&amp;nbsp;– and the first letter of the word Europe, crossed by two parallel lines to ‘certify’ the stability of the euro.|sign=[[European Commission]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ec.europa.eu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/cash/symbol/index_en.htm |title= How to use the euro name and symbol |publisher=European Commission |date= |accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The European Commission also specified a euro logo with exact proportions and foreground/background colour tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/notes_and_coins/symbol_en.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011043046/http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/notes_and_coins/symbol_en.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007 |title=The €uro: Our Currency |publisher=European Commission|accessdate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape, font designers made it clear that they intended to design their own variants instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jürgen |last=Siebert |url=http://www.fontshop.com/features/fontmag/002/02_euro/ |title=The Euro: From Logo to Letter |journal=Font Magazine |issue=2 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Typewriter]]s lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital 'C', backspacing and [[overstrike|overstriking]] it with the equal ('=') sign. Placement of the currency sign relative to the numeric amount varies from nation to nation, but for texts in English the symbol (and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]-standard &quot;EUR&quot;) should precede the amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm#position|title=Position of the ISO code or euro sign in amounts|date=5 February 2009|work=Interinstitutional style guide|publisher=Europa Publications Office|accessdate=10 January 2010|location=Bruxelles, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction of the euro==
{{Main|History of the euro}}
{{Euro adoption past|group=&quot;note&quot;}}
The euro was established by the provisions in the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]]. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet [[convergence criteria|strict criteria]], such as a budget [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] of less than three per cent of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than sixty per cent of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and [[interest]] rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union which would result in the introduction of the euro.

Economists who helped create or contributed to the euro include [[Fred Arditti]], [[Neil Dowling]], [[Wim Duisenberg]], [[Robert Mundell]], [[Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa]] and [[Robert Tollison]].{{Citation needed|reason=What are the criteria for inclusion in this list|date=December 2009}} (For [[macroeconomic]] theory, see [[#Optimal currency area|below]].)

The name &quot;euro&quot; was officially adopted in [[Madrid]] on 16 December 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;madrid1995&quot;/&gt; Belgian [[Esperantist]] [[Germain Pirlot]], a former teacher of French and history is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, suggesting the name &quot;euro&quot; on 4 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Germain Pirlot 'uitvinder' van de euro | url= http://www.ikso.net/vikipedio/artikeleuro.jpg | publisher=De Zeewacht | language= Dutch | date=16 February 2007 | accessdate=21 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to differences in national conventions for rounding and significant digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of triangulation via the euro. The ''definitive'' values of one euro in terms of the [[exchange rate]]s at which the currency entered the euro are shown on the right.

The rates were determined by the Council of the European Union,&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;by means of Council Regulation 2866/98 (EC) of 31 December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; it was not a currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the [[pound sterling]]) that day.

The procedure used to fix the irrevocable conversion rate between the [[Greek drachma]] and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;by Council Regulation 1478/2000 (EC) of 19 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The currency was introduced in non-physical form ([[traveller's cheque]]s, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as [[legal tender]] until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.

The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the [[Deutsche Mark|mark]] officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever (the latter in Austria, Germany, Ireland and Spain). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022.{{clear}}

==Direct and indirect usage==
{{Further|Eurozone|International status and usage of the euro|Enlargement of the eurozone}}
{{Eurozone Labelled Map}}

===Direct usage===
The euro is the sole currency of 17 [[European Union member states|EU member states]]: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Cyprus]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malta]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Spain]]. These countries comprise the &quot;[[eurozone]]&quot;, some 326&amp;nbsp;million people in total.

With all but two of the remaining EU members obliged to join, together with future members of the EU, the [[enlargement of the eurozone]] is set to continue. Outside the EU, the euro is also the sole currency of [[Montenegro]] and [[Kosovo]] and several European micro states ([[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]]) as well as in three overseas territories of EU states that are not themselves part of the EU ([[Mayotte]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]). Together this direct usage of the euro outside the EU affects over 3&amp;nbsp;million people.

It is also gaining increasing international usage as a trading currency, in Cuba,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Cuba to adopt Euro in foreign trade | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/210441.stm |publisher=BBC News  | date=8 November 1998 | accessdate=2 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= US row leads Syria to snub dollar | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4713622.stm |publisher=BBC News  | date=14 February 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various currencies pegged to the euro (see below). In 2009, Zimbabwe abandoned its [[Zimbabwean dollar|local currency]] and used major currencies instead, including the euro and the United States dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Zimbabwe: A Critical Review of Sterp | url= http://allafrica.com/stories/200904170690.html | date=17 April 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as reserve currency===
Since its introduction, the euro has been the second most widely held international [[reserve currency]] after the US dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency has increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period the share of the US dollar fell from 71% to 64% and the Yen fell from 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built on the status of the [[Deutsche Mark]] as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the [[International Monetary Fund]]&lt;ref name=&quot;external1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/cofer.pdf |title=Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER)&amp;nbsp;– Updated COFER tables include first quarter 2009 data. June&amp;nbsp;30, 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1&amp;nbsp;trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of all currency reserves in advanced economies, but a total of 31% of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies.

The possibility of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wage.wisc.edu/uploads/Working%20Papers/chinnfrankel_NBER_eurotopcurrency.pdf |title=Will the Euro Eventually Surpass the Dollar As Leading International Reserve Currency? |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Former [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] gave his opinion in September 2007 that it is &quot;absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Euro could replace dollar as top currency&amp;nbsp;– Greenspan | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSL1771147920070917 | accessdate=17 September 2007 | date=17 September 2007 |agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in the share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and since the beginning of the worldwide [[credit crunch]] related recession and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;external1&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|International status and usage of the euro}}

Outside the eurozone, a total of 23 countries and territories that do not belong to the EU have currencies that are directly pegged to the euro including 14 countries in mainland Africa ([[CFA franc]] and [[Moroccan dirham]]), two African island countries ([[Comorian franc]] and [[Cape Verdean escudo]]), three French Pacific territories ([[CFP franc]]) and another Balkan country, Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]]). On 28 July 2009, São Tomé and Príncipe signed an agreement with Portugal which will eventually tie its currency to the euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= S.Tomé e Princípe ancora-se ao euro |url=http://economia.publico.pt/Noticia/stome-e-principe-ancorase-ao-euro_1393438 |publisher=economia.publico.pt |date=27 July 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of Bosnia (which pegged its currency against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo) all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency is regarded as a safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.

Within the EU several currencies have a peg to the euro, in most instances as a precondition to joining the eurozone. The [[Bulgarian lev]] was formerly pegged to the Deutsche Mark, other EU member states have a direct peg due to ERM II: the [[Danish krone]], the [[Lithuanian litas]] and the [[Latvian lats]].

In total, over 150&amp;nbsp;million people in Africa use a currency pegged to the euro, 25&amp;nbsp;million people outside the eurozone in Europe and another 500,000 people on Pacific islands.

==Economics==

===Optimal currency area===
{{Further|Optimum currency area}}
In economics, an optimum currency area (or region) (OCA, or OCR) is a geographical region in which it would maximize economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by [[Robert Mundell]]: the [[Optimum currency area#OCA with stationary expectations|stationary expectations model]] and the [[Optimum currency area#OCA with international risk sharing|international risk sharing model]]. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro.&lt;ref&gt;A Plan for a European Currency, 1973 by Mundell&lt;/ref&gt; However, even before the creation of the single currency, there were concerns over diverging economies. Before the [[Late-2000s recession]] the chances of a state leaving the euro, or the chances that the whole zone would collapse, were considered extremely slim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1014341 |title=The Breakup of the Euro Area by Barry Eichengreen :: SSRN |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] led to former British foreign secretary [[Jack Straw]] claiming the Eurozone could not last in its current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13839381 |title=Greek debt crisis: Straw says eurozone 'will collapse' |publisher=BBC |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the Euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for ''The New Yorker'' explains it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The guiding principle of the currency, which opened for business in 1999, were supposed to be a set of rules to limit a country's annual deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product, and the total accumulated debt to sixty per cent of G.D.P. It was a nice idea, but by 2004 the two biggest economies in the euro zone, Germany and France, had broken the rules for three years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;John Lanchester, &quot;Euro Science,&quot; ''New Yorker'', 10 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Transaction costs and risks===
{{Most traded currencies|group=&quot;note&quot;}}
The most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g. [[credit card]]s, [[debit card]]s and [[cash machine]] withdrawals).

The absence of distinct currencies also removes [[exchange rate]] risks. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.

Financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more [[market liquidity|liquid]] and flexible than they were in the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone.

===Price parity===
Another effect of the common European currency is that differences in prices&amp;nbsp;– in particular in price levels&amp;nbsp;– should decrease because of the [[law of one price]]. Differences in prices can trigger [[arbitrage]], i.e. [[speculation|speculative]] trade in a [[commodity]] across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w8402 |title=Market Integration and Convergence to the Law of One Price: Evidence from the European Car Market |publisher=Nber.org |accessdate=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macroeconomic stability===
Low levels of inflation are the hallmark of stable and modern economies. Because a high level of inflation acts as a tax ([[seigniorage]]) and theoretically discourages investment, it is generally viewed as undesirable. In spite of the downside, many countries have been unable or unwilling to deal with serious inflationary pressures. Some countries have successfully contained them by establishing largely independent central banks. One such bank was the [[Bundesbank]] in Germany; as the European Central Bank is modelled on the Bundesbank,&lt;ref name=&quot;bundesbank&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of the Bundesbank: Lessons for the European Central Bank |last=de Haan |first=Jakob |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-21723-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=EaIV0OWlaokC |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is independent of the pressures of national governments and has a mandate to keep inflation low. Member countries that join the euro hope to enjoy the macroeconomic stability associated with low levels of inflation. The ECB (unlike the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] in the United States of America) does not have a second objective to sustain growth and employment.

Many national and corporate [[bond (finance)|bonds]] denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the [[nominal interest rate]] on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.

====Trade====
A 2009 consensus from the studies of the introduction of the euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.de/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp594.pdf |title=The euro's trade effects |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although one study suggested an increase of only 3%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/klaassen/index_files/trend27_forthcoming.pdf |title=The Euro Effect on Trade is not as Large as Commonly Thought|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another estimated 9 to 14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1079383 |title=SSRN-Estimating the Euro Effects on Trade with Propensity Score Matching by Pandej Chintrakarn |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[meta-analysis]] of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by [[publication bias]] and that the underlying effect may be negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/670658078011l5r1/ |title=Rose effect and the euro: is the magic gone? |work=Review of World Economics |date= |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Investment====
Physical investment seems to have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-financial-system.org/fileadmin/content/Dokumente_Events/second_conference/Dvorak.pdf |title=The Impact of the Euro on Investment: Sectoral Evidence|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding foreign direct investment, a study found that the intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afse.fr/docs/congres_2005/docs2005/Sousa.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5njSL0hxe|archivedate=22 February 2010 |title=Does the single currency affect FDI?|publisher=AFSE.fr |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.wu-wien.ac.at/rof/papers/pdf/Bris-Koskinen-Nilsson_Euro%20Effects.pdf |title=The Real Effects of the Euro: Evidence from Corporate Investments |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inflation====
The introduction of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Paolo Angelini | coauthors = Francesco Lippi | title = Did Prices Really Soar after the Euro Cash Changeover? Evidence from ATM Withdrawals | journal = International Journal of Central Banking | date = December 2007 | url = http://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb07q4a1.pdf | accessdate =23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Publikationen/Querschnittsveroeffentlichungen/WirtschaftStatistik/Preise/EuroBargeldeinfuehrung,property=file.pdf| title = Fünf Jahre nach der Euro-Bargeldeinführung&amp;nbsp;–War der Euro wirklich ein Teuro?| trans_title = Five years after the intrduction of euro cash&amp;nbsp;– Did the euro really make things more expensive?| author = Irmtraud Beuerlein| publisher = Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbaden| language = German| format =PDF | accessdate =23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the introduction of the euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the introduction of the euro. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121658067/abstract |title=The Euro Changeover and Its Effects on Price Transparency and Inflation |publisher=InterScience.Wiley.com |date= |accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/qjec.121.3.1103 |title=Quarterly Journal of Economics&amp;nbsp;– Abstract |publisher=MIT Press Journals |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exchange rate risk====
One of the advantages of the adoption of a common currency is the reduction of the risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates. It has been found that the introduction of the euro created &quot;significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms both in and outside of Europe&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VFG-4KB14MN-1&amp;_user=121712&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000009979&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=121712&amp;md5=9da59b5525252985a70618a2dafbc141 |title=The impact of the introduction of the Euro on foreign exchange rate risk exposures |work=Journal of Empirical Finance |publisher=ScienceDirect |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reductions in market risk &quot;were concentrated in firms domiciled in the eurozone and in non-Euro firms with a high fraction of foreign sales or assets in Europe&quot;.

====Financial integration====
The introduction of the euro seems to have had a strong effect on European financial integration. According to a study on this question, it has &quot;significantly reshaped the European financial system, especially with respect to the securities markets [...] However, the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant, even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/iiis/documents/discussion/pdfs/iiisdp139.pdf |title=The Euro and Financial Integration|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds, equity, and banking assets within the eurozone.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WMC-4TXF7WY-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=2c6125b54140decec22b1a1afcb622e0 |title=The geography of asset trade and the euro: Insiders and outsiders |work=Journal of the Japanese and International Economies |publisher=ScienceDirect |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On a global level, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios, with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=925858 |title=SSRN-Global Bond Portfolios and EMU by Philip R. Lane |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect on interest rates====
[[File:Long-term interest rates of eurozone countries since 1993.png|thumb|300px|Long-term interest rates of Euro countries, 1993–2012]]
The introduction of the euro has decreased the interest rates of most members countries, in particular those with a weak currency.  As a consequence the market value of firms from countries which previously had a weak currency has very significantly increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/hhn101 |title=The Euro and Corporate Valuations |publisher=Rfs.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries whose interest rates fell most as a result of the euro are Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eabcn.org/research/documents/lane.pdf |title=The Real Effects of EMU |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect of such low interest rates made it easier for banks within the countries in which interest rates fell and the countries themselves to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and increase their public deficit and levels of privately held consumer debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/opinion/2076100/redwood-origins-euro-crisis |title=Redwood: The origins of the euro crisis |publisher=Investmentweek.co.uk |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Late-2000s financial crisis]], governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks in order to prevent systemic failure of the banking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-global.org/2011/02/01/farewell-fair-weather-euro/ |title=Farewell, Fair-Weather Euro &amp;#124; IP&amp;nbsp;– Global-Edition |publisher=Ip-global.org |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.

====Price convergence====
The evidence on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction of the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecb.eu/events/pdf/conferences/emu/sessionV_Angeloni_Paper.pdf |title=Price setting and inflation dynamics: did EMU matter |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opus.zbw-kiel.de/volltexte/2009/7575/pdf/200906dkp.pdf |title=Price convergence in the EMU? Evidence from micro data |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found evidence of price convergence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.london.edu/hrey/IMRRtele.pdf |title=One TV, One Price? |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/835/1/MPRA_paper_835.pdf |title=One Market, One Money, One Price? |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular for cars.&lt;ref&gt;Gil-Pareja, Salvador, and Simón Sosvilla-Rivero, [http://www.fedea.es/pub/Papers/2005/dt2005-22.pdf &quot;Price Convergence in the European Car Market&quot;], FEDEA, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between
2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/hepdoc/macppr_4_2009.pdf |first=Ulrich |last=Fritsche |first2=Sarah |last2=Lein |first3=Sebastian |last3=Weber |title=Do Prices in the EMU Converge (Non-linearly)? |publisher=University of Hamburg, Department Economics and Politics Discussion Papers, Macroeconomics and Finance Series |month=April |year=2009 |accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tourism====
A study suggests that the introduction of the euro has had a positive effect on the amount of tourist travel within the EMU, with an increase of 6.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=983231 |title=SSRN-The Effect of EMU on Tourism by Salvador Gil-Pareja, Rafael Llorca-Vivero, José Martínez-Serrano |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European sovereign debt crisis==
{{main|European sovereign-debt crisis}}
[[File:Government surplus or deficit (EU-USA-OECD).png|thumb|Budget deficit of the euro area compared to USA and UK.]]
Following the US financial crisis in 2008, fears of a [[sovereign debt crisis]] developed in 2009 among fiscally conservative investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in [[2000s European sovereign debt crisis timeline|early 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216 |title= Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen |agency=Reuters   |author=George Matlock |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099 | title=Acropolis now | work=The Economist | date= 29 April 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included eurozone members [[Economy of Greece|Greece]],&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{Cite news| author=Brian Blackstone, Tom Lauricella, and Neil Shah | title = Global Markets Shudder: Doubts About U.S. Economy and a Debt Crunch in Europe Jolt Hopes for a Recovery |  work=The Wall Street Journal | date = 5 February 2010 | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704041504575045743430262982.html |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economy of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Economy of Portugal|Portugal]] and also some [[European Union|EU]] countries outside the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/world-mainmenu-26/europe-mainmenu-35/3274-greek-debt-crisis-worsens | title= Greek Debt Crisis Worsens | author=Bruce Walker |date=9 April 2010 |publisher=[[The New American]] |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iceland]], the country which experienced the largest [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis|crisis in 2008]] when its entire international banking system collapsed, has emerged less affected by the sovereign-debt crisis as the government was unable to bail the banks out.

According to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] in 2011, &quot;[I]f the [euro area] is treated as a single entity, its [economic and fiscal] position looks no worse and in some respects, rather better than that of the US or the UK&quot; and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area's government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the US. &quot;Moreover,&quot; they write, &quot;private-sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged Anglo-Saxon economies.&quot; The authors conclude that the crisis &quot;is as much political as economic&quot; and the result of the fact that the euro area lacks the support of &quot;institutional [[paraphernalia]] (and mutual bonds of solidarity) of a state&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/eiu2/images/EuroDebtPaperMarch2011.pdf |title=State of the Union: Can the euro zone survive its debt crisis?|page=4 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]] |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis continued with S&amp;P downgrading nine euro-area countries, including France, then downgrading the entire [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF) fund.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In May 2012, socialist [[François Hollande]] was elected as president of France and a month later the French socialist legislative position was strengthened, while German leader [[Angela Merkel]] &quot;has appeared to be floundering and been badly let down by her advisers in recent months&quot;, one commentator said. As such, &quot;serious discord between French and German monetary decision-makers was [comparable to that of] ... 1992–93, at the height of the crisis over the [[European Monetary System]], the forerunner to EMU&quot; ([[European Monetary Union]]). &quot;[H]itherto relatively dormant signs of [[Euroscepticism|euro skepticism]] in German public opinion and throughout industry have been multiplying in recent months, making Hollande’s proposals increasingly unpalatable to a broad swathe of German opinion.

NOTE
In this article, we only use the official ratings as featured on the ECB website: http://ecb.eu/ These ratings are updated every working day. Unofficial ratings from various sources, which may be updated more often, are estimates that often feature spectacular, even implausible changes and are hence more likely to offer a new record. Please don't add them here: a source claiming the dollar has lost 4% of its value in less than one day is meaningless.
--&gt;

===Flexible exchange rates===
The ECB targets interest rates rather than exchange rates and in general does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets, because of the implications of the [[Mundell–Fleming model]] which implies a central bank cannot maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, unless there are capital controls, because increasing the [[money supply]] results in a [[depreciation]] of the currency. In the years following the [[Single European Act]], the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or [[floating exchange rate|floating]].

===Against other major currencies===
The euro is one of the major [[Reserve currency|reserve currencies]] together with the US dollar, [[Japanese yen]], [[Pound sterling]] and [[Swiss franc]]. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (25 October vs the US Dollar, 26 October vs Japanese Yen, 3 May vs Pound Sterling). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs US Dollar, 23 July vs Japanese Yen, 29 December vs Pound Sterling). With the advent of the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global financial crisis]] the euro initially fell, only to regain later. Despite pressure due to the European sovereign-debt crisis the euro remained stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110822-701343.html |title= Euro Stable Despite Debt Crisis Says Schaeuble |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= 22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011 the euro's exchange rate index&amp;nbsp;– measured against currencies of the bloc's major trading partners&amp;nbsp;– was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/11/15/uk-markets-euro-mystery-idUKLNE7AE02520111115 |title= Puzzle over euro's 'mysterious' stability |work=[[Reuters]] |date= 15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic issues==
{{Main|Linguistic issues concerning the euro}}
The formal titles of the currency are ''euro'' for the major unit and ''cent'' for the minor (one hundredth) unit and for official use in most eurozone languages; according to the ECB, all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/conrep/cr200705en.pdf|title=European Central Bank, Covergence report May 2007|format=PDF|quote=The euro is the single currency of the member states that have adopted it. To make this singleness apparent, Community law requires a single spelling of the word ''euro'' in the nominative singular case in all Community and national legislative provisions, taking into account the existence of different alphabets.|accessdate=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages; e.g., those where there is no ''eu'' [[diphthong]]. Bulgaria has negotiated an exception; ''euro'' in the Cyrillic alphabet is spelled as eвро (''evro'') and not eуро (''euro'') in all official documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elena Koinova |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2007/10/19/656777_evro-dispute-over-portuguese-foreign-minister |title=&quot;Evro&quot; Dispute Over&amp;nbsp;– Portuguese Foreign Minister&amp;nbsp;– Bulgaria |publisher=The Sofia Echo |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek &quot;cent&quot; coins are denominated in &quot;lepto/a.&quot; Official practice for English-language EU legislation is to use the words euro and cent as both singular and plural,&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. &quot;Spelling of the words &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; in official community languages as used in community legislative acts&quot; (PDF). Retrieved 12 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; although the European Commission's [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] states that the plural forms ''euros'' and ''cents'' should be used in English.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see European Commission, Directorate General for Translation: English Style Guide section 20.9 ''&quot;'''The euro.''' Like 'pound', 'dollar' or any other currency name in English, the word 'euro' is written in lower case with no initial capital and, where appropriate, takes the plural 's' (as does 'cent').&quot;'' [http://ec.europa.eu/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf European Commission Directorate-General for Translation&amp;nbsp;– English Style Guide].&lt;/ref&gt;
