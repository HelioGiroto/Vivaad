'''Mathematical economics''' is the application of [[mathematical]] methods to represent economic theories and analyze problems posed in [[economics]].  It allows formulation and derivation of key relationships in a theory with clarity, generality, rigor, and simplicity. By convention, the [[Applied mathematics#Economics|applied methods]] refer to those beyond simple geometry, such as differential and integral [[calculus]], [[difference equations|difference]] and [[differential equations]], [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]], and [[mathematical programming]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Chiang&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Mathematics allows economists to form meaningful, testable propositions about many wide-ranging and complex subjects which could not be adequately expressed informally. Further, the language of mathematics allows economists to make clear, specific, [[Positive science|positive]] claims about controversial or contentious subjects that would be impossible without mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hal Varian|Varian, Hal]] (1997).  &quot;What Use Is Economic Theory?&quot; in A.

Formal economic modeling began in the 19th century with the use of [[differential calculus]] to  represent and explain economic behavior, such as [[utility]] maximization, an early economic application of [[mathematical optimization]]. Economics became more mathematical as a discipline throughout the first half of the 20th century, but introduction of new and generalized techniques in the period around the [[World War II|Second World War]], as in [[game theory]], would greatly broaden the use of mathematical formulations in economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;DebreuNeumann&quot;&gt;• [[Gérard Debreu|Debreu, Gérard]] ([1987] 2008). &quot;mathematical economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

This rapid systematizing of economics alarmed critics of the discipline as well as some noted economists.  [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Robert Heilbroner]], [[Friedrich Hayek]] and others have criticized the broad use of mathematical models for human behavior, arguing that some human choices are irreducible to mathematics.

==History==
{{main|History of economic thought}}
The use of mathematics in the service of social and economic analysis dates back to the 17th century.  Then, mainly in [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] universities, a style of instruction emerged which dealt specifically with detailed presentation of data as it related to public administration.  [[Gottfried Achenwall]] lectured in this fashion, coining the term [[statistics]].  At the same time, a small group of professors in England established a method of &quot;reasoning by figures upon things relating to government&quot; and referred to this practice as ''Political Arithmetick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpeter|first=J.A.|title=History of Economic Analysis|editor=Elizabeth B. Schumpeter|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1954|pages=209–212|isbn=978-0-04-330086-2|oclc=13498913|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xjWiAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Petty|Sir William Petty]] wrote at length on issues that would later concern economists, such as taxation, [[Velocity of money]] and [[Measures of national income and output|national income]], but while his analysis was numerical, he rejected abstract mathematical methodology.  Petty's use of detailed numerical data (along with [[John Graunt]]) would influence statisticians and economists for some time, even though Petty's works were largely ignored by English scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter (1954) p. 212-215&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematization of economics began in earnest in the 19th century.  Most of the economic analysis of the time was what would later be called [[classical economics]].  Subjects were discussed and dispensed with through [[algebra]]ic means, but calculus was not used.  More importantly, until [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]]'s ''[[The Isolated State]]'' in 1826, economists did not develop explicit and abstract models for behavior in order to apply the tools of mathematics.  Thünen's model of farmland use represents the first example of marginal analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Schnieder|first=Erich|title=Johann Heinrich von Thünen|journal=[[Econometrica]]|publisher=The Econometric Society|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–12|issn=0012-9682|oclc=35705710|jstor=1907947|doi= 10.2307/1907947|year= 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thünen's work was largely theoretical, but he also mined empirical data in order to attempt to support his generalizations.  In comparison to his contemporaries, Thünen built economic models and tools, rather than applying previous tools to new problems.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter (1954) p. 465-468&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile a new cohort of scholars trained in the mathematical methods of the [[physical science]]s  gravitated to economics, advocating and applying those methods to their subject,&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Mirowski]], 1991. &quot;The When, the How and the Why of Mathematical Expression in the History of Economics Analysis&quot;,  ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 5(1) pp. [http://www.fcs.edu.uy/multi/phes/mirowski_math_econ_JEP.pdf 145-157.]&lt;/ref&gt; and described today as moving from geometry to [[mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[E. Roy Weintraub|Weintraub, E. Roy]] (2008). &quot;mathematics and economics&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000372&amp;edition=current&amp;q=&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;
These included [[William Stanley Jevons|W.S. Jevons]] who presented paper on a &quot;general mathematical theory of political economy&quot; in 1862, providing an outline for use of the theory of [[marginal utility]] in political economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, W.S. (1866). &quot;Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy&quot;, ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'',  XXIX (June) pp. 282-87.

[http://www.adelinotorres.com/economia/STANLEY%20JEVONS_Teoria%20Matem%E1tica%20e%20Economia%20Politica.pdf PDF.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1871, he published ''The Principles of Political Economy'', declaring that  the subject as science &quot;must be mathematical simply because it deals with quantities.&quot; Jevons expected the only collection of statistics for price and quantities would permit the subject as presented to become an exact science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jevons|first=W.

&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, it was thought that utility was quantifiable, in units known as [[util]]s.&lt;ref&gt;While the concept of [[Cardinal utility|cardinality]] has fallen out of favor in [[neoclassical economics]], the differences between cardinal utility and [[ordinal utility]] are minor for most applications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cournot, Walras and [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] are considered the precursors to modern mathematical economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWE&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicola|first=PierCarlo|title=Mainstream Mathermatical Economics in the 20th Century|publisher=Springer|year=2000|pages=4|isbn=978-3-540-67084-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KR0Rbi8o4QQC|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Augustin Cournot====
Cournot, a professor of Mathematics,  developed a mathematical treatment in 1838 for [[duopoly]]—a market condition defined by competition between two sellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWE&quot;/&gt;  This treatment of competition, first published in ''[[Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Augustin Cournot (1838, tr. 1897) '' Researches nto the Mathematical Principles of Wealth''. Links to [http://books.google.com/books?id=AGoGpyJY_SAC description] and  [http://books.google.com/books?id=AGoGpyJY_SAC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPR9,M1 chapters.]&lt;/ref&gt; is referred to as [[Cournot competition|Cournot duopoly]]. It is assumed that both sellers had equal access to the market and could produce their goods without cost.  Further, it assumed that both goods were [[Homogeneous good|homogeneous]].  Each seller would vary her output based on the output of the other and the market price would be determined by the total quantity supplied.  The profit for each firm would be determined by multiplying their output and the per unit [[Market price]].  Differentiating the profit function with respect to quantity supplied for each firm left a system of linear equations, the simultaneous solution of which gave the equilibrium quantity, price and profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stability&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hotelling|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Hotelling|title=The Collected Economics Articles of Harold Hotelling|editor=Darnell, Adrian C.|publisher=Springer|year=1990|pages=51, 52|chapter=Stability in Competition|isbn=3-540-97011-8|oclc=20217006|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dYbbHQAACAAJ|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cournot's contributions to the mathematization of economics would be neglected for decades, but eventually influenced many of the [[Marginalism|marginalists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stability&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/cournot.htm|title=Antoine Augustin Cournot, 1801-1877|work=The History of Economic Thought Website|publisher=The New School for Social Research|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cournot's models of duopoly and [[Oligopoly]] also represent one of the first formulations of [[non-cooperative game]]s.  Today the solution can be given as a [[Nash equilibrium]] but Cournot's work preceded modern [[Game theory]] by over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbons|first=Robert|title=Game Theory for Applied Economists|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|year=1992|pages=14, 15|isbn=0-691-00395-5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_6qgHgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Léon Walras====
While Cournot provided a solution for what would later be called partial equilibrium, Léon Walras attempted to formalize discussion of the economy as a whole through a theory of [[General equilibrium|general competitive equilibrium]].  The behavior of every economic actor would be considered on both the production and consumption side.  Walras originally presented four separate models of exchange, each recursively included in the next.  The solution of the resulting system of equations (both linear and non-linear) is the general equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola, p. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, no general solution could be expressed for a system of arbitrarily many equations, but Walras's attempts produced two famous results in economics.  The first is [[Walras' law]] and the second is the principle of [[Walrasian auction|tâtonnement]].  Walras' method was considered highly mathematical for the time and Edgeworth commented at length about this fact in his review of ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'' (Elements of Pure Economics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgeworth|first=Francis Ysidro|authorlink=Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|date=September 5, 1889|title=The Mathematical Theory of Political Economy: Review of Léon Walras, Éléments d'économie politique pure|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=40|issue=1036|pages=434–436|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/040434a0|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/texts/edgeworth/edgewalras89.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walras' law was introduced as a theoretical answer to the problem of determining the solutions in general equilibrium.  His notation is different from modern notation but can be constructed using more modern summation notation.  Walras assumed that in equilibrium, all money would be spent on all goods: every good would be sold at the market price for that good and every buyer would expend their last dollar on a basket of goods.  Starting from this assumption, Walras could then show that if there were n markets and n-1 markets cleared (reached equilibrium conditions) that the nth market would clear as well.  This is easiest to visualize with two markets (considered in most texts as a market for goods and a market for money).  If one of two markets has reached an equilibrium state, no additional goods (or conversely, money) can enter or exit the second market, so it must be in a state of equilibrium as well.  Walras used this statement to move toward a proof of existence of solutions to general equilibrium but it is commonly used today to illustrate market clearing in money markets at the undergraduate level.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Walter; Snyder, Christopher, p. 350-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tâtonnement (roughly, French for ''groping toward'') was meant to serve as the practical expression of Walrasian general equilibrium.  Walras abstracted the marketplace as an auction of goods where the auctioneer would call out prices and market participants would wait until they could each satisfy their personal reservation prices for the quantity desired (remembering here that this is an auction on ''all'' goods, so everyone has a reservation price for their desired basket of goods).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/rdixon/wlaw.html|title=Walras Law and Macroeconomics|last=Dixon|first=Robert|work=Walras Law Guide|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Melbourne|accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080417102559/http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/rdixon/wlaw.html |archivedate = April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when all buyers are satisfied with the given market price would transactions occur.  The market would &quot;clear&quot; at that price—no surplus or shortage would exist.  The word ''tâtonnement'' is used to describe the directions the market takes in ''groping toward'' equilibrium, settling high or low prices on different goods until a price is agreed upon for all goods.  While the process appears dynamic, Walras only presented a static model, as no transactions would occur until all markets were in equilibrium.

Edgeworth introduced mathematical elements to Economics explicitly in ''[[Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences]]'', published in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rima|first=Ingrid H.|title=Modern Economic Thought|editor=Weintraub, Sidney|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1977|pages=10, 11|chapter=Neoclassicism and Dissent 1890-1930|isbn=0-8122-7712-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=s7cJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5=onepage&amp;q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He adopted [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[felicific calculus]] to economic behavior, allowing the outcome of each decision to be converted into a change in utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heilbroner|first=Robert L.|authorlink=Robert Heilbroner|title=The Worldly Philosophers |publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|date=1953 [1999]|edition=Seventh|pages=172–175, 313|isbn=978-0-684-86214-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=N_3cj4urgJcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this assumption, Edgeworth built a model of exchange on three assumptions: individuals are self-interested, individuals act to maximize utility, and individuals are &quot;free to recontract with another independently of...any third party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edgeworth|first=Francis Ysidro|title=Mathematical Psychics|publisher=Kegan Paul [A.

Given two individuals, the set of solutions where the both individuals can maximize utility is described by the ''contract curve'' on what is now known as an [[Edgeworth Box]].  Technically, the construction of the two-person solution to Edgeworth's problem was not developed graphically until 1924 by [[Arthur Lyon Bowley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowley|first=Arthur Lyon|title=The Mathematical Groundwork of Economics: an Introductory Treatise|publisher=Clarendon Press [Kelly]|location=Oxford|date=1924 [1960]|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_cgkAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contract curve of the Edgeworth box (or more generally on any set of solutions to Edgeworth's problem for more actors) is referred to as the [[Core (economics)|core]] of an economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillies|first=D.

Edgeworth devoted considerable effort to insisting that mathematical proofs were appropriate for all schools of thought in economics.  While at the helm of ''[[The Economic Journal]]'', he published several articles criticizing the mathematical rigor of rival researchers,  including [[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman]], a noted skeptic of mathematical economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Lawrence S.|year=2003|title=The Seligman-Edgeworth Debate about the  Analysis of Tax Incidence: The Advent of  Mathematical Economics, 1892–1910 |journal=History of Political Economy|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=35|issue=2|pages=207, 212, 219, 234–237|issn=0018-2702|doi=10.1215/00182702-35-2-205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The articles focused on a back and forth over [[tax incidence]] and responses by producers.  Edgeworth noticed that a monopoly producing a good that had jointness of supply but not jointness of demand (such as first class and economy on an airplane, if the plane flies, both sets of seats fly with it) might actually lower the price seen by the consumer for one of the two commodities if a tax were applied.  Common sense and more traditional, numerical analysis seemed to indicate that this was preposterous.  Seligman insisted that the results Edgeworth achieved were a quirk of his mathematical formulation.  He suggested that the assumption of a continuous demand function and an infinitesimal change in the tax resulted in the paradoxical predictions.  [[Harold Hotelling]] later showed that Edgeworth was correct and that the same result (a &quot;diminution of price as a result of the tax&quot;) could occur with a discontinuous demand function and large changes in the tax rate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hotelling|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Hotelling|title=The Collected Economics Articles of Harold Hotelling|editor=Darnell, Adrian C.|publisher=Springer|year=1990|pages=94–122|chapter=Note on Edgeworth's Taxation Phenomenon and Professor Garver's Additional Condition on Demand Functions|isbn=3-540-97011-8|oclc=20217006|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dYbbHQAACAAJ|accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern mathematical economics==
From the later-1930s, an array of new mathematical tools from the differential calculus and differential equations, [[convex set]]s, and [[graph theory]] were deployed to advance  economic theory in a way similar to new mathematical methods earlier applied to physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;DebreuNeumann&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herstein|first=I.N.|month=October | year=1953|title=Some Mathematical Methods and Techniques in Economics|journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|volume=11|issue=3|pages=249, 252, 260|issn=1552-4485}} [Pp.

===Differential calculus===
{{Main|Foundations of Economic Analysis|Differential calculus}}
{{See also|Pareto efficiency|Walrasian auction}}

[[Vilfredo Pareto]] analyzed [[microeconomics]] by treating decisions by economic actors as attempts to change a given allotment of goods to another, more preferred allotment.  Sets of allocations could then be treated as [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] (Pareto optimal is an equivalent term) when no exchanges could occur between actors that could make at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholson|first=Walter|coauthors=Snyder, Christopher|title=Intermediate Microeconomics and Its Applications|publisher=Thompson|year=2007|edition=10th|pages=364, 365|chapter=General Equilibrium and Welfare|isbn=0-324-31968-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pareto's proof is commonly conflated with Walrassian equilibrium or informally ascribed to [[Adam Smith]]'s [[Invisible hand]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jolink, Albert|chapter=What Went Wrong with Walras?|title=From Walras to Pareto|editor=Backhaus, Juergen G.; Maks, J.A.

In the landmark treatise ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' (1947), [[Paul Samuelson]] identified a common paradigm and mathematical structure across multiple fields in the subject, building on previous work by [[Alfred Marshall]]. ''Foundations'' took mathematical concepts from  physics and applied them to economic problems. This broad view (for example, comparing [[Le Chatelier's principle]] to [[Walrasian auction|tâtonnement]]) drives the fundamental premise of mathematical economics: systems of economic actors may be modeled and their behavior described much like any other system. This extension followed on the work of the marginalists in the previous century and extended it significantly. Samuelson approached the problems of applying individual utility maximization over aggregate groups with [[comparative statics]], which compares two different [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] states after an [[exogenous]] change in a variable. This and other methods in the book provided the foundation for mathematical economics in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Samuelson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metzler|first=Lloyd |authorlink=Lloyd Metzler |year=1948|title=Review of ''Foundations of Economic Analysis''|journal=American Economic Review|volume=38|issue=5|pages=905–910|issn=0002-8282|jstor=1811704|publisher=The American Economic Review, Vol. 38, No. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear models===
{{See also|Linear algebra|Linear programming|Perron–Frobenius theorem}}

Restricted models of general equilibrium were formulated  by [[John von Neumann]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neumann1937&quot;&gt;Neumann, J. von (1937). &quot;Über ein ökonomisches Gleichungssystem und ein Verallgemeinerung
des Brouwerschen Fixpunktsatzes&quot;, ''Ergebnisse eines Mathematischen Kolloquiums'', 8, pp. 73-83,  translated and published in 1945-46, as &quot;A Model of General Equilibrium&quot;, ''Review of Economic Studies'', 13, pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier versions, the models of von Neumann had inequality constraints. For his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of [[Brouwer's fixed point theorem]]. Von Neumann's model of an expanding economy considered the [[generalized eigenvalue problem|matrix pencil]]&amp;nbsp;'' '''A''' - λ '''B''' '' with nonnegative matrices&amp;nbsp;'''A''' and '''B'''; von Neumann sought [[probability vector|probability]] [[generalized eigenvector|vector]]s&amp;nbsp;''p'' and&amp;nbsp;''q'' and a positive number&amp;nbsp;''λ'' that would solve the [[complementarity theory|complementarity]] equation
:'' p&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;('''A''' - λ&amp;nbsp;'''B''')&amp;nbsp;q = 0'',
along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency. In this model, the ([[transpose]]d) probability vector ''p'' represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the &quot;intensity&quot; at which the production process would run.  The unique [[generalized eigenvalue problem|solution]] ''λ'' represents the [[economic growth|rate of growth]] of the economy, which equals the [[interest rate]]. Proving the existence of a positive growth rate and proving that the growth rate equals the interest rate were remarkable achievements, even for von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;For this problem to have a unique solution, it suffices that the nonnegative matrices&amp;nbsp;'''A''' and&amp;nbsp;'''B''' satisfy an [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|irreducibility condition]], generalizing that of the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]] of nonnegative matrices, which considers the (simplified) [[eigenvalue|eigenvalue problem]]
:'' '''A''' - λ '''I''' q = 0'',
where the nonnegative matrix''&amp;nbsp;'''A''''' must be square and where the [[diagonal matrix]]''&amp;nbsp;'''I''' ''is the [[identity matrix]]. Von Neumann's irreducibility condition was called the &quot;whales and [[wrangler (profession)|wrangler]]s&quot; hypothesis by David Champernowne, who provided a verbal and economic commentary on the English translation of von Neumann's article. Von Neumann's hypothesis implied that every economic process used a positive amount of every economic good. Weaker &quot;irreducibility&quot; conditions were given by [[David Gale]] and by [[John George Kemeny|John Kemeny]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]], and [[Gerald L. Thompson]] in the 1950s and then by [[Stephen M. Robinson]] in the&amp;nbsp;1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Gale. ''The theory of linear economic models''.

====Input-output economics====
{{Main|Input-output model}}

In 1936, the Russian–born economist [[Wassily Leontief]] built his model of [[Input-output model|input-output analysis]] from the 'material balance' tables constructed by Soviet economists, which themselves followed earlier work by the [[physiocrat]]s.  With his model, which described a system of production and demand processes, Leontief described how changes in demand in one [[economic sector]] would influence production in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Screpanti|first=Ernesto|coauthors=Zamagni, Stefano|title=An Outline of the History of Economic Thought|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|year=1993|pages=288–290|isbn=0-19-828370-9|oclc=57281275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Leontief  estimated the coefficients of his simple models, to address economically interesting questions. &lt;!-- Leontief's work made him a hero to [[George B. Dantzig]], the inventor of the [[simplex algorithm]] of [[linear programming]]. --&gt; In [[production set|production economics]], &quot;Leontief technologies&quot; produce outputs using constant proportions of inputs, regardless of the price of inputs, reducing the value of Leontief models for understanding economies but allowing their parameters to be estimated relatively easily. In contrast, the von Neumann model of an expanding economy allows for choice of techniques, but the coefficients must be estimated for each technology.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gale]].

The solution process includes satisfying general [[Mathematical optimization#Classification of critical points and extrema|necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality]]. For optimization problems, [[Mathematical optimization#Notation|specialized notation]] may be used as to the function and its input(s).

[[Linear programming]] was developed to aid the allocation of resources in firms and in industries during the 1930s in Russia and during the 1940s in the United States. During the [[Berlin airlift|Berlin airlift (1948)]], linear programming was used to plan the shipment of supplies to prevent Berlin from starving after the Soviet  blockade.&lt;ref&gt;M.

:Minimize &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) subject to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) ≤ 0 and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''(&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) = 0 where
:&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;) is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] to be minimized
:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;'') (&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; = 1, ..., &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;) are the functions of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; ''inequality [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]]''
:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;) (&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; = 1, ..., &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;) are the functions of the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; equality constraints.

In allowing inequality constraints, the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Kuhn–Tucker approach]] generalized the classic method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], which (until then) had  allowed only equality constraints.&lt;ref&gt;• Intriligator, Michael D.

====Variational calculus and optimal control====
{{See also|Calculus of variations|Optimal control|Dynamic programming}}

''Economic dynamics'' allows for changes in economic variables over time, including in [[dynamic systems]].  The problem of finding optimal functions for such changes is studied in [[variational calculus]] and in [[optimal control theory]].  Before the Second World War, [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]] and [[Harold Hotelling]] used the calculus of variations to that end.

====Functional analysis====
{{See also|Functional analysis|Convex set|Supporting hyperplane|Hahn–Banach theorem|Fixed point theorem|Dual space|}}

It was in the course of proving of the existence of an optimal equilibrium in his 1937 model of [[economic growth]] that [[John von Neumann]] introduced [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] methods to include [[topology]] in economic theory, in particular,  [[fixed point theorem|fixed-point theory]] through his generalization of [[Brouwer's fixed-point theorem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DebreuNeumann&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neumann1937&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McLennan, 2008. &quot;fixed point theorems&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

In introducing the [[Arrow–Debreu model]] in 1954, they proved the existence (but not the uniqueness) of an equilibrium and also proved that every Walras equilibrium is [[Pareto efficient]]; in general, equilibria need not be unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=E.

In Russia, the mathematician [[Leonid Kantorovich]] developed economic models in [[Riesz space|partially ordered vector space]]s, that emphasized the duality between quantities and prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=L.&amp;nbsp;V|last=Kantorovich|authorlink=Leonid Kantorovich|chapter=&quot;My journey in science (supposed report to the Moscow Mathematical Society)&quot; [expanding ''Russian Math.

Even in finite dimensions, the concepts of functional analysis have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying the role of prices as [[normal vector]]s to a [[supporting hyperplane|hyperplane supporting]] a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities. However, problems of describing optimization over time or under uncertainty require the use of infinite–dimensional function spaces, because agents are choosing among functions or [[stochastic process]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;LK08&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aliprantis |first1=Charalambos&amp;nbsp;D.|authorlink1=Charalambos D.

===Differential decline and rise===
{{See also|Global analysis|Baire category|Sard's lemma}}

[[John von Neumann]]'s work on [[functional analysis]] and [[topology]] in broke new ground in mathematics and economic theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neumann1937&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NeumannMorgenstern&quot;&gt;Neumann, John von, and Oskar Morgenstern (1944) ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'', Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt; It also left advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications of differential calculus. In particular, general equilibrium theorists used [[general topology]], [[convex geometry]], and [[mathematical optimization|optimization theory]] more than differential calculus, because the approach of differential calculus had failed to establish the existence of an equilibrium. 

However, the decline of differential calculus should not be exaggerated, because differential calculus has always been used in graduate training and in applications. Moreover, differential calculus has returned to the highest levels of mathematical economics, [[general equilibrium theory]] (GET), as practiced by the &quot;[[jet set|GET-set]]&quot; (the humorous designation due to [[Jacques H. Drèze]]). In the 1960s and 1970s, however, [[Gérard Debreu]] and [[Stephen Smale]] led a revival of the use of differential calculus in mathematical economics. In particular, they were able to prove the existence of a general equilibrium, where earlier writers had failed, because of their novel mathematics: [[Baire category]] from [[general topology]] and [[Sard's lemma]] from [[differential topology]]. Other economists asssociated with the use of differential analysis include Egbert Dierker, [[Andreu Mas-Colell]], and [[Yves Balasko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mas-Colell|first=Andreu|authorlink=Andreu Mas-Colell|year=1985|title=The Theory of general economic equilibrium: A ''differentiable'' approach|series=Econometric Society monographs|publisher=Cambridge&amp;nbsp;UP|isbn=0-521-26514-2|mr=1113262|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yves Balasko]]. ''Foundations of the Theory of General Equilibrium'', 1988, ISBN 0-12-076975-1.&lt;/ref&gt; These advances have changed the traditional narrative of the history of mathematical economics, following von Neumann, which celebrated the abandonment of differential calculus.

===Game theory===
{{Main|Game Theory}}
{{See also|Cooperative game|Noncooperative game|John von Neumann|Theory of Games and Economic Behavior|John Forbes Nash, Jr.}}

John von Neumann, working with [[Oskar Morgenstern]] on the [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior|theory of games]], broke new mathematical ground in 1944 by extending [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] methods related to [[convex set]]s and [[topology|topological]] [[fixed point theorem (economics)|fixed-point theory]] to economic analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;DebreuNeumann&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NeumannMorgenstern&quot;/&gt; Their work thereby avoided the traditional [[differential calculus]], for which the [[maximum]]–operator did not apply to non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work in [[cooperative game|cooperative game theory]], game theorists [[Lloyd S. Shapley]], [[Martin Shubik]], [[Hervé Moulin]], [[Nimrod Megiddo]], [[Bezalel Peleg]] influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the [[Shapley value|fair prices]] in cooperative games and [[Shapley value#Shapley-Shubik index|fair values]] for [[voting theory|voting game]]s led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in public–works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used in designing the water distribution system of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.

Earlier [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] theory had bounded only the ''range'' of bargaining outcomes and in special cases, for  example [[bilateral monopoly]] or along the [[contract curve]] of the [[Edgeworth box]].&lt;ref&gt;Creedy, John (2008). &quot;Francis Ysidro (1845–1926)&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition.

Following von Neumann's program, however, [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] used fixed–point theory to prove conditions under which the [[Bargaining#Game theory|bargaining problem]] and [[noncooperative game]]s can generate a unique [[Nash equilibria|equilibrium]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;• Nash, John F., Jr. (1950). &quot;The Bargaining Problem&quot;, ''Econometrica'', 18(2),  pp. [http://www.stern.nyu.edu/networks/Nash_The_Bargaining_Problem.pdf 155-162].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Serrano, Roberto (2008). &quot;bargaining&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition.

===Agent-based computational economics===
[[Agent-based computational economics]] (ACE) as a named field is relatively recent, dating from about the 1990s as to published work. It studies economic processes, including whole [[economy|economies]], as [[dynamic systems]] of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agents]] over time. As such, it falls in the [[paradigm]] of [[complex adaptive system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;• Kirman, Alan (2008).  &quot;economy as a complex system&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics '', 2nd Edition.

==Econometrics==
{{main|Econometrics}}
Between the world wars, advances in [[mathematical statistics]] and a cadre of mathematically trained economists &lt;!-- and  [[probability theory]] --&gt; led to [[econometrics]], which was the name proposed for the discipline of advancing economics by using mathematics and statistics. Within economics, &quot;econometrics&quot; has often been used for statistical methods in economics, rather than mathematical economics. Statistical econometrics features the application of linear regression and time series analysis to economic data.

[[Ragnar Anton Kittil Frisch|Ragnar Frisch]] coined the word &quot;econometrics&quot; and helped to found both the [[Econometric Society]] in 1930 and the journal ''[[Econometrica]]'' in 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrow bio of Frisch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arrow|first=Kenneth J.|authorlink=Kenneth Arrow|month=April | year=1960|title=The Work of Ragnar Frisch, Econometrician|journal=[[Econometrica]]|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|volume=28|issue=2|pages=175–192|jstor=1907716|issn=0012-9682|doi=10.2307/1907716}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bjerkholt|first=Olav|month=July | year=1995|title=Ragnar Frisch, Editor of Econometrica 1933-1954|journal=[[Econometrica]]|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|volume=63|issue=4|pages=755–765|issn=0012-9682|jstor=1906940|doi=10.2307/2171799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A student of Frisch's, [[Trygve Haavelmo]] published ''The Probability Approach in Econometrics'' in 1944, where he asserted that precise statistical analysis could be used as a tool to validate mathematical theories about economic actors with data from complex sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lange|first=Oskar|year=1945|title=The Scope and Method of Economics|journal=Review of Economic Studies|publisher=The Review of Economic Studies Ltd.|volume=13|issue=1|pages=19–32|issn=0034-6527|jstor=2296113|doi=10.2307/2296113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This linking of statistical analysis of systems to economic theory was also promulgated by the Cowles Commission (now the [[Cowles Foundation]]) throughout the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aldrich|first=John|month=January | year=1989|title=Autonomy|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|volume=41|issue=1, History and Methodology of Econometrics |pages=15–34|issn=0030-7653 |jstor=2663180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earlier work in econometrics===
The roots of modern econometrics can be traced to the American economist [[Henry Ludwell Moore|Henry L. Moore]].  Moore studied agricultural productivity and attempted to fit changing values of productivity for plots of corn and other crops to a curve using different values of elasticity.  Moore made several errors in his work, some from his choice of models and some from limitations in his use of mathematics.  The accuracy of Moore's models also was limited by the poor data for national accounts in the United States at the time.  While his first models of production were static, in 1925 he published a dynamic &quot;moving equilibrium&quot; model designed to explain business cycles—this periodic variation from overcorrection in supply and demand curves is now known as the [[cobweb model]].  A more formal derivation of this model was made later by [[Nicholas Kaldor]], who is largely credited for its exposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Roy J.|title=A History of Econometrics|publisher=North-Holland|series=Contributions to Economic Analysis|pages=13–19|isbn=978-0-444-70267-8|oclc=230844893|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
[[Image:Islm.svg|thumb|300 px|The [[IS/LM model]] is a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] model designed to make predictions about the intersection of &quot;real&quot; economic activity (e.g. spending, [[Measures of national income and output|income]], savings rates) and decisions made in the financial markets ([[Money supply]] and [[Liquidity preference]]).  The model is no longer widely taught at the graduate level but is common in undergraduate macroeconomics courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colander|first=David C.|authorlink=David Colander|year=2004|title=The Strange Persistence of the IS-LM Model|journal=History of Political Economy|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=36|issue=Annual Supplement|doi=10.1215/00182702-36-Suppl_1-305|pages=305–322|issn=0018-2702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Much of classical economics can be presented in simple geometric terms or elementary mathematical notation. Mathematical economics, however, conventionally makes use of [[calculus]] and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]] in economic analysis in order to make powerful claims that would be more difficult without such mathematical tools. These tools are prerequisites for formal study, not only in mathematical economics but in contemporary economic theory in general. Economic problems often involve so many variables that [[mathematics]] is the only practical way of attacking and solving them.  [[Alfred Marshall]] argued that every economic problem which can be quantified, analytically expressed and solved, should be treated by means of mathematical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brems|first=Hans|date=Oct., 1975|title=Marshall on Mathematics|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|publisher=University of Chicago Press|volume=18|issue=2|pages=583–585|issn=0022-2186|jstor=725308|doi=10.1086/466825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics has become increasingly dependent upon mathematical methods and the mathematical tools it employs have become more sophisticated.  As a result, mathematics has become considerably more important to professionals in economics and finance. Graduate programs in both economics and finance require strong undergraduate preparation in mathematics for admission and, for this reason, attract an increasingly high number of [[mathematician]]s. [[applied mathematics|Applied mathematicians]] apply mathematical principles to practical problems, such as economic analysis and other economics-related issues, and many economic problems are often defined as integrated into the scope of applied mathematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dow&quot;/&gt;

This integration results from the formulation of economic problems as stylized models with clear assumptions and falsifiable predictions.  This modeling may be informal or prosaic, as it was in [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', or it may be formal, rigorous and mathematical.

Broadly speaking, formal economic models may be classified as [[stochastic process|stochastic]] or deterministic and as discrete or continuous.  At a practical level, quantitative modeling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frigg|first=R.|coauthors=Hartman, S.|title=Models in Science|editor=Edward N. Zalta |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|location=Stanford, California|date=February 27, 2006|issn=1095-5054|series=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#OntWhaMod|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Stochastic|Stochastic models]] are formulated using [[stochastic process]]es. They model economically observable values over time. Most of [[econometrics]] is based on [[statistics]] to formulate and test [[hypotheses]] about these processes or estimate parameters for them. Between the World Wars, [[Herman Wold]] developed a [[Wold decomposition|representation]] of stationary stochastic processes in terms of [[autoregressive]] models and a determinist trend. Wold and [[Jan Tinbergen]] applied time-series analysis to economic data. Contemporary research on [[time series]] [[statistics]] consider additional formulations of stationary processes, such as  [[autoregressive moving average model]]s. More general models include  [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) models and generalized ARCH ([[GARCH]]) models.

* [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|Non-stochastic mathematical models]] may be purely qualitative (for example, models involved in some aspect of [[social choice]] theory) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with [[hyperbolic coordinates]], and/or specific forms of [[Function (mathematics)|functional relationships]] between variables).  In some cases economic predictions of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only in a qualitative sense: for example, if the [[price]] of an item increases, then the [[demand]] for that item will decrease.  For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.

* [[Qualitative economics|Qualitative models]] are occasionally used. One example is qualitative [[scenario planning]] in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

Friedrich Hayek contended that the use of formal techniques projects a scientific exactness that does not appropriately account for informational limitations faced by real economic agents. &lt;!-- CITATION NEEDED for this: Hayek's concern did not extend to a general critique of mathematical tools in economics. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

{{quote|I guess the scientific approach began to penetrate and soon dominate the profession in the past twenty to thirty years. This came about in part because of the &quot;invention&quot; of mathematical analysis of various kinds and, indeed, considerable improvements in it. This is the age in which we have not only more data but more sophisticated use of data. So there is a strong feeling that this is a data-laden science and a data-laden undertaking, which, by virtue of the sheer numerics, the sheer equations, and the sheer look of a journal page, bears a certain resemblance to science . . . That one central activity looks scientific. I understand that. I think that is genuine. It approaches being a universal law. But resembling a science is different from being a science.}}
Heilbroner stated that &quot;some/much of economics is not naturally quantitative and therefore does not lend itself to mathematical exposition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beed &amp; Owen, 584&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing predictions of mathematical economics===

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] discussed the scientific standing of economics in the 1940s and 1950s. He argued that mathematical economics suffered from being tautological. In other words, insofar that economics became a mathematical theory, mathematical economics ceased to rely on empirical refutation  but rather relied on [[mathematical proof]]s and disproof.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boland&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boland|first=L.

Sharing Popper's concerns about assumptions in economics generally, and not just mathematical economics, [[Milton Friedman]] declared that &quot;all assumptions are unrealistic&quot;.  Friedman proposed judging economic models by their predictive performance rather than by the match between their assumptions and reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|It is a great fault of symbolic pseudo-mathematical methods of formalising a system of economic analysis ... that they expressly assume strict independence between the factors involved and lose their cogency and authority if this hypothesis is disallowed; whereas, in ordinary discourse, where we are not blindly manipulating and know all the time what we are doing and what the words mean, we can keep ‘at the back of our heads’ the necessary reserves and qualifications and the adjustments which we shall have to make later on, in a way in which we cannot keep complicated partial differentials ‘at the back’ of several pages of algebra which assume they all vanish. Too large a proportion of recent ‘mathematical’ economics are merely concoctions, as imprecise as the initial assumptions they rest on, which allow the author to lose sight of the complexities and interdependencies of the real world in a maze of pretentious and unhelpful symbols.}}

===Defense of mathematical economics===

In response to these criticisms, Paul Samuelson argued that mathematics is a language, repeating a thesis of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]. In economics, the language of mathematics is sometimes necessary for representing substantive problems. Moreover, mathematical economics has led to conceptual advances in economics.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson (1952). &quot;Economic Theory and Mathematics&amp;nbsp;— An Appraisal&quot;, ''American Economic Review'', 42(2), pp. [http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p00b/p0061.pdf 56, 64-65] (press '''+''').&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Samuelson gave the example of [[microeconomics]], writing that &quot;few people are ingenious enough to grasp [its] more complex parts... ''without'' resorting to the language of mathematics, while most ordinary individuals can do so fairly easily ''with'' the aid of mathematics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Bushaw and [[Robert W. Clower|R.W. Clower]] (1957). ''Introduction to Mathematical Economics'', p. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3513586;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=11;num=vii vii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists state that mathematical economics deserves support just like other forms of mathematics, particularly its neighbors in [[mathematical optimization]] and [[mathematical statistics]] and increasingly in [[theoretical computer science]]. Mathematical economics and other mathematical sciences have a history in which theoretical advances have regularly contributed to the reform of the more applied branches of economics. In particular, following the program of [[John von Neumann]], game theory now provides the foundations for describing much of applied economics, from  statistical decision theory (as &quot;games against nature&quot;) and econometrics to general equilibrium theory and industrial organization. In the last decade, with the rise of the internet, mathematical economicists and optimization experts and computer scientists have worked on problems of pricing for on-line services --- their contributions using mathematics from cooperative game theory, nondifferentiable optimization, and combinatorial games.

[[Robert M. Solow]] concluded that mathematical economics was the core &quot;[[infrastructure]]&quot; of contemporary economics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Economics is no longer a fit conversation piece for ladies and gentlemen. It has become a technical subject. Like any technical subject it attracts some people who are more interested in the technique than the subject. That is too bad, but it may be inevitable. In any case, do not kid yourself: the technical core of economics is indispensable infrastructure for the political economy. That is why, if you consult [a reference in contemporary economics]  looking for enlightenment about the world today, you will be led to technical economics, or history, or nothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Wide, Wide World Of Wealth (''The New Palgrave:  A Dictionary of Economics'''.
