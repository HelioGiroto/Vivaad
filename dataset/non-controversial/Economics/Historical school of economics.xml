      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7318">The '''Historical school of economics''' was an [[economic methodology|approach]] to academic [[economics]] and to [[public administration]] that emerged in 19th century in [[Germany]], and held sway there until well into the 20th century.

The Historical school held that [[history]] was the key source of knowledge about human actions and economic matters, since economics was culture-specific, and hence not generalizable over space and time. The School rejected the universal validity of economic [[theorem]]s. They saw economics as resulting from careful empirical and historical analysis instead of from logic and mathematics. The School also preferred [[reality]], historical, political, and social as well as economic, to [[mathematical model]]ling.

Most members of the school were also ''Sozialpolitiker'' (Social Policy-ers), i.e. concerned with social reform and improved conditions for the common man during a period of heavy [[industrialization]]. They were more disparagingly referred to as ''Kathedersozialisten,'' rendered in English as &quot;Socialists of the Chair&quot; (compare [[armchair revolutionary]]), due to their position as professors (depicted sitting in chairs).

The Historical School can be divided into three tendencies:&lt;ref&gt;Shionoya, Yuichi. (2005). ''The Soul of the German Historical School'' Springer, p 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Older, led by [[Wilhelm Roscher]], [[Karl Knies]], and [[Bruno Hildebrand]];
* the Younger, led by [[Gustav von Schmoller]], and also including [[Etienne Laspeyres]], [[Karl Bücher]], [[Adolph Wagner]], [[Georg Friedrich Knapp]] and to some extent [[Lujo Brentano]];
* the Youngest, led by [[Werner Sombart]] and including, to a very large extent, [[Max Weber]].

Predecessors included [[Friedrich List]].&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca Gl. [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/list.htm Friedrich List, 1789-1846]. New School.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Historical school largely controlled appointments to Chairs of Economics in German universities, as many of the advisors of [[Friedrich Althoff]], head of the university department in the [[Prussia]]n Ministry of Education 1882-1907, had studied under members of the School. Moreover, Prussia was the intellectual powerhouse of Germany and so dominated academia, not only in central Europe, but also in the [[United States]] until about 1900, because the American economics profession was led by holders of German Ph.Ds. The Historical school was involved in the [[Methodenstreit]] (&quot;strife over method&quot;) with the [[Austrian School]], whose orientation was more theoretical and aprioristic.

== Influence in the Anglosphere ==
In the [[Anglosphere]] (English speaking countries), the Historical school is perhaps the least known and least understood approach to the [[history of economic thought|study of economics]], because it differs radically from the now-dominant Anglo-American analytical point of view. Yet the Historical school forms the basis—both in theory and in practice—of the [[social market economy]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} for many decades the dominant economic paradigm in most countries of continental [[Europe]]. The Historical school is also a source of [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s dynamic, change-oriented, and [[innovation]]-based economics. Although his writings could be critical of the School, Schumpeter's work on the role of innovation and entrepreneurship can be seen as a continuation of ideas originated by the Historical School, especially the work of von Schmoller and Sombart.

== English school ==
{{see|English historical school of economics}}
Although not nearly as famous as its German counterpart, there was also an [[English historical school of economics|English Historical School]], whose figures included [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. It was this school that heavily critiqued the deductive approach of the classical economists, especially the writings of [[David Ricardo]]. This school revered the inductive process and called for the merging of historical fact with those of the present period. Included in this school are:  [[William Whewell]], [[Richard Jones (economist)|Richard Jones]], [[Walter Bagehot]], [[Thorold Rogers]], [[Arnold Toynbee]] and [[William Cunningham (economist)|William Cunningham]] just to name a few.
