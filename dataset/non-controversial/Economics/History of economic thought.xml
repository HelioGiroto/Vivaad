[[File:Wealth of Nations title.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' is widely considered to be the first work in modern economics.]]

The '''history of economic thought''' deals with different thinkers and theories in the subject that became [[political economy]] and [[economics]] from the [[ancient world]] to the present day.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} It encompasses many disparate [[schools of economic thought]].
Greek writers such as the philosopher [[Aristotle]] examined ideas about the art of wealth acquisition and questioned whether property is best left in private or public hands.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In medieval times, [[Scholasticism|scholars]] such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that it was a [[Morality|moral]] obligation of businesses to sell goods at a [[just price]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Scottish [[philosopher]] [[Adam Smith]] is often cited as the father of modern economics for his [[treatise]] ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-05-14 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/07/08/reviews/010708.08mattict.html |title=Who Is the Real Adam Smith? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-07-08 |author=Mattick, Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HoaasMadigan1999&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hoaas  | first1 = David J.  | last2 = Madigan | first2 = Lauren J.  | author1-link = David J.

Cambridge University Press. 1997. ISBN 978-0-521-57701-4 p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; 

Smith's successors included such [[Classical economics|classical economists]] as the [[Thomas Malthus|Rev. Thomas Malthus]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[John Stuart Mill]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} They examined ways the landed, capitalist and labouring classes produced and distributed national output and [[Model (economics)|modeled]] the effects of [[An Essay on the Principle of Population|population]] and [[international trade]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In London, [[Karl Marx]] castigated the capitalist system, which he described as exploitative and alienating.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} From about 1870, [[neoclassical economics]] attempted to erect a positive, mathematical and scientifically grounded field above normative politics.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

After the wars of the early twentieth century, [[John Maynard Keynes]] led a reaction against what has been described as [[laissez faire|governmental abstention]] from economic affairs, advocating interventionist fiscal policy to stimulate economic demand and growth.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} With a world divided between the [[capitalism|capitalist]] first world, the [[communist]] second world, and the poor of the [[third world]], the [[post-war consensus]] broke down.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Others like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]] warned of ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' and [[socialism]], focusing their theories on what could be achieved through better [[Monetarism|monetary policy]] and deregulation.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} 

As [[Keynesian]] policies seemed to falter in the 1970s there emerged the so-called [[New classical macroeconomics|New Classical]] school, with prominent theorists such as [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] and [[Edward Prescott]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Governmental economic policies from the 1980s were challenged, and [[Development economics|development economists]] like [[Amartya Sen]] and [[Information economics|information economists]] like [[Joseph Stiglitz]] introduced new ideas to economic thought in the twenty-first century.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Early economic thought==
{{Main|Ancient economic thought|Fan Li|Chanakya|Qin Shihuang|Wang Anshi|Muqaddimah|Arthashastra|Economics of Mahavira}}
The earliest discussions of economics date back to ancient times (e.g. [[Chanakya]]'s [[Arthashastra]] or [[Xenophon]]'s [[Oeconomicus]]). Back then, and until the industrial revolution, economics was not a separate discipline but part of philosophy. In [[Ancient Athens]], a slave based society but also one developing an embryonic model of democracy,&lt;ref&gt;David Held, ''Models of Democracy'' (Polity, 2006) 3rd Ed., p.11 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]]'s book ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' contained references to specialization of labour and production. But it was his pupil Aristotle that made some of the most familiar arguments, still in economic discourse today.

===Aristotle===
{{Main|Aristotle|Politics (Aristotle)|Nicomachean Ethics}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]] and his pupil, [[Aristotle]], have had an enduring effect on [[Western philosophy]].]]
Aristotle's ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (c.a. 350 BC) was mainly concerned to analyse different forms of a state ([[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], [[Constitution|constitutional government]], [[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]]) as a critique of Plato's advocacy of a ruling class of &quot;philosopher-kings&quot;. In particular for economists, Plato had drawn a blueprint of society on the basis of common ownership of resources. Aristotle viewed this model as an oligarchical [[anathema]]. In ''Politics'', Book II, Part V, he argued that,

{{quote|Property should be in a certain sense common, but, as a general rule, private; for, when everyone has a distinct interest, men will not complain of one another, and they will make more progress, because every one will be attending to his own business... And further, there is the greatest pleasure in doing a kindness or service to friends or guests or companions, which can only be rendered when a man has private property. These advantages are lost by excessive unification of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Book II, Part V&quot;&gt;Aristotle (350BC) ''Politics'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html Book II, Part V]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though Aristotle certainly advocated there be many things held in common, he argued that not everything could be, simply because of the &quot;wickedness of human nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Book II, Part V&quot;/&gt; &quot;It is clearly better that property should be private&quot;, wrote Aristotle, &quot;but the use of it common; and the special business of the legislator is to create in men this benevolent disposition.&quot; In ''Politics'' Book I, Aristotle discusses the general nature of households and market exchanges. For him there is a certain &quot;art of acquisition&quot; or &quot;wealth-getting&quot;. Money itself has the sole purpose of being a medium of exchange, which means on its own &quot;it is worthless... not useful as a means to any of the necessities of life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle (350BC) ''Politics'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html Book I, Part IX]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, points out Aristotle, because the &quot;instrument&quot; of money is the same many people are obsessed with the simple accumulation of money. &quot;Wealth-getting&quot; for one's household is &quot;necessary and honourable&quot;, while exchange on the retail trade for simple accumulation is &quot;justly censured, for it is dishonourable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle (350BC) ''Politics'' [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html Book I, Part X]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the people he stated they as a whole thought  acquisition of wealth (chrematistike) as being either the same as, or a principle of oikonomia (''household management'' - oikonomos),&lt;ref&gt;Book I, Part III]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; &quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ekqCOGr1_NAC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=household+management+-+Ancient+Greek&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z-PwoYOk53&amp;sig=F--uWoo7imbz7pCrJtHWgUexIRo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BM6FT5i8OYqY1AXg89ixBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=household%20management%20-%20Ancient%20Greek&amp;f=false |author=M.

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas|Scholasticism|Duns Scotus|Ibn Khaldun|Islamic economic jurisprudence}}

[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 052.jpg|thumb|St [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that raising prices in response to high demand was a type of theft.]]
[[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) was an Italian theologian and writer on economic issues. He taught in both [[Cologne]] and Paris, and was part of a group of Catholic scholars known as the [[Schoolmen]], who moved their enquiries beyond theology to philosophical and scientific debates. In the treatise ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' Aquinas dealt with the concept of a [[just price]], which he considered necessary for the reproduction of the social order. Bearing many similarities with the modern concept of long run equilibrium a just price was supposed to be one just sufficient to cover the [[costs of production]], including the maintenance of a worker and his family. He argued it was immoral for sellers to raise their prices simply because buyers were in pressing need for a product.

Aquinas discusses a number of topics in the format of questions and replies, substantial tracts dealing with Aristotle's theory. Questions 77 and 78 concern economic issues, mainly relate to what a [[just price]] is, and to the fairness of a seller dispensing faulty goods. Aquinas argued against any form of cheating and recommended compensation always be paid in lieu of good service. Whilst human laws might not impose sanctions for unfair dealing, [[divine law]] did, in his opinion. One of Aquinas' main critics&lt;ref name=&quot;Mochrie 2005 p.5&quot;&gt;Mochrie (2005) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Duns Scotus]] (1265–1308) in his work ''[[Sententiae]]'' (1295). 

Originally from [[Duns]] Scotland, he taught in Oxford, Cologne and Paris. Scotus thought it possible to be more precise than Aquinas in calculating a just price, emphasising the costs of labour and expenses – though he recognised that the latter might be inflated by exaggeration, because buyer and seller usually have different ideas of what a just price comprises. If people did not benefit from a transaction, in Scotus' view, they would not trade. Scotus defended merchants as performing a necessary and useful social role, transporting goods and making them available to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mochrie 2005 p.5&quot;/&gt;

==Mercantilists and nationalism==
{{Main|Mercantilism}}

[[File:Lorrain.seaport.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1638 painting of a French seaport during the heyday of [[mercantilism]].]]
{{See also|Charles Davenant|Josiah Child|James Denham-Steuart|Grotius|Niccolò Machiavelli}}

From the [[Localism (politics)|localism]] of the Middle Ages, the waning [[feudalism|feudal]] lords, new national economic frameworks began to be strengthened. From 1492 and explorations like [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages, new opportunities for trade with the [[New World]] and Asia were opening. New powerful monarchies wanted a powerful state to boost their status. Mercantilism was a political movement and an economic theory that advocated the use of the state's [[military]] power to ensure local markets and supply sources were [[protectionism|protected]]. 

Mercantile theorists thought [[international trade]] could not benefit all countries at the same time. Because money and [[gold]] were the only source of riches, there was a limited quantity of resources to be shared between countries. Therefore, [[tariff]]s could be used to encourage exports (meaning more money comes into the country) and discourage imports (sending wealth abroad). In other words a positive [[balance of trade]] ought to be maintained, with a surplus of exports. The term mercantilism was not in fact coined until the late 1763 by [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau]] and popularised by [[Adam Smith]], who vigorously opposed its ideas.

===Thomas Mun===
{{Main|Thomas Mun}}
English businessman Thomas Mun (1571–1641) represents early mercantile policy in his book ''England's Treasure by Foraign Trade'' . Although it was not published until 1664 it was widely circulated as a manuscript before then. He was a member of the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]] and also wrote about his experiences there in ''A Discourse of Trade from England unto the East Indies'' (1621). 

According to Mun, trade was the only way to increase England's treasure (i.e., national wealth) and in pursuit of this end he suggested several courses of action. Important were frugal consumption to increase the amount of goods available for export, increased utilisation of land and other domestic natural resources to reduce import requirements, lowering of export duties on goods produced domestically from foreign materials, and the export of goods with [[Price elasticity of demand|inelastic]] demand because more money could be made from higher prices.

===Philipp von Hörnigk===
{{Main|Philipp von Hörnigk}}

[[File:Österreich uber alles wann es nur will.jpg|thumb|200px|The title page to [[Philipp von Hörnigk]] statement of mercantilist philosophy.]]
Philipp von Hörnigk (1640–1712, sometimes spelt ''Hornick'' or ''Horneck'') was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and became an Austrian civil servant writing in a time when his country was constantly threatened by [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars|Ottoman invasion]]. In ''Österreich Über Alles, Wann es Nur Will'' (1684, ''Austria Over All, If She Only Will'') he laid out one of the clearest statements of mercantile policy. He listed nine principal rules of national economy.

{{quote|To inspect the country's soil with the greatest care, and not to leave the [[agriculture|agricultural]] possibilities of a single corner or clod of earth unconsidered... All commodities found in a country, which cannot be used in their natural state, should be worked up within the country... Attention should be given to the population, that it may be as large as the country can support... [[gold]] and silver once in the country are under no circumstances to be taken out for any purpose... The inhabitants should make every effort to get along with their domestic products... [Foreign commodities] should be obtained not for gold or silver, but in exchange for other domestic wares... and should be imported in unfinished form, and worked up within the country... Opportunities should be sought night and day for selling the country's [[trade surplus|superfluous goods]] to these foreigners in manufactured form... No [[imports|importation]] should be allowed under any circumstances of which there is a sufficient supply of suitable quality at home.}}

[[Nationalism]], self-sufficiency and national power were the basic policies proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Fusfeld (1994) p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Baptiste Colbert===
{{Main|Jean-Baptiste Colbert}}

Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683) was Minister of Finance under King [[Louis XIV of France]]. He set up national [[guild]]s to regulate major industries. Silk, linen, tapestry, furniture manufacture and wine were examples of the crafts in which France specialised, all of which came to require membership of a guild to operate in. These remained until the [[French revolution]]. According to Colbert, &quot;It is simply, and solely, the abundance of money within a state [which] makes the difference in its grandeur and power.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==British enlightenment==
{{See also|Age of enlightenment|Scottish enlightenment|Thomas Hobbes|William Petty}}

Britain had gone through some of its most troubling times through the 17th century, enduring not only political and religious division in the [[English Civil War]], King [[Charles I of England|Charles I's]] execution and the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian dictatorship]], but also the [[Great Plague of London|plagues]] and [[Great Fire of London|fires]]. The monarchy was restored under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who had catholic sympathies, but his successor [[James II of England|King James II]] was swiftly ousted. Invited in his place were Protestant [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]], who assented to the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] ensuring that the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] was dominant in what became known as the [[Glorious revolution]]. The upheaval had seen a number of huge scientific advances, including [[Robert Boyle]]'s discovery of the [[Boyle's law|gas pressure constant]] (1660) and Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s publication of ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), which described the three laws of motion and his [[law of universal gravitation]]. All these factors spurred the advancement of economic thought. For instance, [[Richard Cantillon]] (1680–1734) consciously imitated Newton's forces of inertia and gravity in the natural world with human reason and market competition in the economic world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fusfeld 1994 p.21&quot;&gt;Fusfeld (1994) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Essay on the Nature of Commerce in General'', he argued rational self-interest in a system of freely adjusting markets would lead to order and mutually compatible prices. Unlike the mercantilist thinkers however, wealth was found not in trade but in human [[Labour theory of value|labour]]. The first person to tie these ideas into a political framework was [[John Locke]].

===John Locke===
[[File:JohnLocke.png|right|thumb|[[John Locke]] combined [[philosophy]], [[politics]] and [[economics]] into [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics|one]] coherent framework.]]
{{Main|John Locke}}

[[John Locke]] (1632–1704) was born near Bristol and educated in London and Oxford. He is considered one of the most significant philosophers of his era mainly for his critique of [[Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes']] defense of absolutism in ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) and the development of [[social contract theory]]. Locke believed that people contracted into society which was bound to protect their rights of property.&lt;ref&gt;Locke (1689) [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt; He defined property broadly to include people's lives and liberties, as well as their wealth. When people combined their labour with their surroundings, then that created property rights. In his words from his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'' (1689),

{{quote|God hath given the world to men in common... Yet every man has a property in his own person. The labour of his body and the work of his hands we may say are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.&lt;ref&gt;Locke (1689) [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#Chap. V. Of_Property.|Chapter 5, sections 26–27]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Locke was arguing that not only should the government cease interference with people's property (or their &quot;lives, liberties and estates&quot;) but also that it should positively work to ensure their protection. His views on price and money were laid out in a letter to a [[Member of Parliament]] in 1691 entitled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money'' (1691). Here Locke argued that the &quot;price of any commodity rises or falls, by the proportion of the number of buyers and sellers&quot;, a rule which &quot;holds universally in all things that are to be bought and sold.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Locke (1691) ''Considerations'' Part I, Thirdly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dudley North===
{{Main|Dudley North (economist)}}
[[File:Dudley North.jpg|thumb|[[Dudley North (economist)|Dudley North]] argued that the results of mercantile policy would be undesirable.]]
Dudley North (1641–1691) was a wealthy merchant and landowner. He worked as an official for the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]] and was opposed to most mercantile policy. In his ''Discourses upon trade'' (1691), which he published anonymously, he argued that the assumption of needing a favourable trade balance was wrong. Trade, he argued, benefits both sides, it promotes [[specialisation (functional)|specialisation]], the [[division of labour]] and produces an increase in wealth for everyone. Regulation of trade interfered with these benefits by reducing the flow of wealth.

===David Hume===
{{Main|David Hume}}

[[David Hume]] (1711–1776) agreed with North's philosophy and denounced [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] assumptions. His contributions were set down in ''Political Discourses'' (1752), later consolidated in his ''Essays, Moral, Political, Literary'' (1777). Added to the fact that it was undesirable to strive for a favourable [[balance of trade]] it is, said Hume, in any case impossible. 

Hume held that any surplus of [[export]]s that might be achieved would be paid for by imports of gold and silver. This would increase the [[money supply]], causing prices to rise. That in turn would cause a decline in exports until the balance with imports is restored.

Similarly disenchanted with regulation on trademarks inspired by mercantilism, a Frenchman name [[Vincent de Gournay]] (1712–1759) is reputed to have asked why it was so hard to ''[[laissez faire]], laissez passer'' (free enterprise, free trade). He was one of the early physiocrats, a word from Greek meaning &quot;government of nature&quot;, who held that agriculture was the source of wealth. As historian [[David B. Danbom]] wrote, the Physiocrats &quot;damned cities for their artificiality and praised more natural styles of living. They celebrated farmers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Danbom (1997) Rural Development Perspectives, vol. 12, no. 1 [http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/rdp/rdp1096/rdp1096d.pdf p.15] ''[[Why Americans Value Rural Life]]'' by David B. Danbom&lt;/ref&gt; Over the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century big advances in [[natural science]] and [[anatomy]] were being made, including the discovery of [[blood circulation]] through the human body. This concept was mirrored in the physiocrats' economic theory, with the notion of a [[circular flow of income]] throughout the economy.

[[François Quesnay]] (1694–1774) was the court physician to King [[Louis XV of France]]. He believed that trade and industry were not sources of wealth, and instead in his book, ''[[Tableau économique]]'' (1758, Economic Table) argued that agricultural surpluses, by flowing through the economy in the form of rent, wages and purchases were the real economic movers. Firstly, said Quesnay, regulation impedes the flow of income throughout all [[social classes]] and therefore economic development. Secondly, taxes on the productive classes, such as [[farmer]]s, should be reduced in favour of rises for unproductive classes, such as [[landowner]]s, since their luxurious way of life distorts the income flow.

[[Jacques Turgot]] (1727–1781) was born in Paris and from an old [[Normans|Norman]] family. His best known work, ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses'' (1766, ''Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth'') developed Quesnay's theory that [[land (economics)|land]] is the only source of [[wealth]]. Turgot viewed society in terms of three classes: the productive agricultural class, the salaried artisan class (''classe stipendice'') and the landowning class (''classe disponible''). He argued that only the net product of land should be taxed and advocated the complete freedom of [[commerce]] and [[industry]]. 

In August 1774, Turgot was appointed to be Minister of Finance and in the space of two years introduced many anti-mercantile and anti-feudal measures supported by the King. A statement of his guiding principles, given to the King were &quot;no [[bankruptcy]], no [[tax]] increases, no borrowing.&quot; Turgot's ultimate wish was to have a single tax on land and abolish all other indirect taxes, but measures he introduced before that were met with overwhelming opposition from landed interests. Two [[edict]]s in particular, one suppressing [[corvée]]s (charges from farmers to aristocrats) and another renouncing privileges given to guilds inflamed influential opinion. He was forced from office in 1776.

==Adam Smith and ''The Wealth of Nations''==
[[File:Adamsmithout.jpg|thumb|right|Adam Smith, the father of modern [[political economy]].]]

{{See also|Industrial revolution|Anders Chydenius}}

[[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790) is popularly seen as the father of modern political economy. His publication of the ''[[An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776 happened to coincide not only with the [[American Revolution]], shortly before the Europe wide upheavals of the [[French Revolution]], but also the dawn of a new [[industrial revolution]] that allowed more wealth to be created on a larger scale than ever before. Smith was a Scottish moral philosopher, whose first book was ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759). He argued in it that people's ethical systems develop through personal relations with other individuals, that right and wrong are sensed through others' reactions to one's behaviour. This gained Smith more popularity than his next work, ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', which the general public initially ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fusfeld 1994 p.24&quot;&gt;Fusfeld (1994) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Smith's [[Political economy|political economic]] [[magnum opus]] was successful in circles that mattered.

===Context===
[[Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], the [[Tory]] [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]] in the late 1780s based his tax proposals on Smith's ideas and advocated [[free trade]] as a devout disciple of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hague (2004) p.187, 292&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was appointed a commissioner of [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|customs]] and within twenty years Smith had a following of new generation writers who were intent on building the [[science]] of political economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fusfeld 1994 p.24&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Edmund Burke2 c.jpg|thumb|[[Edmund Burke]].]]

Smith expressed an affinity himself to the opinions of [[Edmund Burke]], known widely as a political philosopher, a [[Member of Parliament]].

{{quote|Burke is the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do without any previous communication having passed between us.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen (1898) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Burke was an established political economist himself, with his book ''[[Thoughts and Details on Scarcity]]''. He was widely critical of liberal politics, and condemned the [[French Revolution]] which began in 1789. In ''Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (1790) he wrote that the &quot;age of chivalry is dead, that of sophisters, economists and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever.&quot; Smith's contemporary influences included [[François Quesnay]] and [[Jacques Turgot]] whom he met on a stay in Paris, and David Hume, his Scottish compatriot. The times produced a common need among thinkers to explain social upheavals of the [[Industrial revolution]] taking place, and in the seeming chaos without the feudal and monarchical structures of Europe, show there was order still.

|-

Smith argued for a &quot;[[system of natural liberty]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1776 p&quot;&gt;Smith (1776) p.533&lt;/ref&gt; where individual effort was the producer of social good. Smith believed even the selfish within society were kept under restraint and worked for the good of all when acting in a competitive market. Prices are often unrepresentative of the true value of goods and services. Following [[John Locke]], Smith thought true value of things derived from the amount of labour invested in them.

{{quote|Every man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to enjoy the necessaries, conveniencies, and amusements of human life. But after the [[division of labour]] has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a very small part of these with which a man's own labour can supply him. The far greater part of them he must derive from the labour of other people, and he must be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which he can command, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities. The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN2.html#B.I,%20Ch.5,%20Of%20the%20Real%20and%20Nominal%20Price%20of%20Commodities Book I, Chapter 5], para 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the butchers, the brewers and the bakers acted under the restraint of an open market economy, their pursuit of self-interest, thought Smith, paradoxically drives the process to correct real life [[price]]s to their just values. His classic statement on competition goes as follows.

{{quote|When the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short of the effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay... cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want... Some of them will be willing to give more. A [[competition]] will begin among them, and the market price will rise... When the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual [[demand]], it cannot be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the [[renting|rent]], wages and [[profit (accounting)|profit]], which must be paid to bring it thither... The market price will sink...&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN2.html#B.I,%20Ch.7,%20Of%20the%20Natural%20and%20Market%20Price%20of%20Commodities Book I, Chapter 7], para 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Smith believed that a market produced what he dubbed the &quot;progress of opulence&quot;. This involved a chain of concepts, that the [[division of labour]] is the driver of economic efficiency, yet it is limited to the widening process of markets. Both labour division and market widening requires more intensive [[Capital accumulation|accumulation of capital]] by the entrepreneurs and leaders of business and industry. The whole system is underpinned by maintaining the security of [[property]] rights.

===Limitations===
[[File:Wealth of Nations title.jpg|thumb|Adam Smith's title page of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.]]

Smith's vision of a free market economy, based on secure property, capital accumulation, widening markets and a division of labour contrasted with the mercantilist tendency to attempt to &quot;regulate all evil human actions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 1776 p&quot;/&gt; Smith believed there were precisely three legitimate functions of government. The third function was...

{{quote|...erecting and maintaining certain public works and certain public institutions, which it can never be for the interest of any individual or small number of individuals, to erect and maintain... Every system which endeavours... to draw towards a particular species of industry a greater share of the capital of the society than what would naturally go to it... retards, instead of accelerating, the progress of the society toward real wealth and greatness.}}

In addition to the necessity of public leadership in certain sectors Smith argued, secondly, that [[cartel]]s were undesirable because of their potential to limit production and quality of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN4.html#B.I,%20Ch.10,%20Of%20Wages%20and%20Profit%20in%20the%20Different%20Employments%20of%20Labour%20and%20Stock Book I, Chapter 10], para 82&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, Smith criticised government support of any kind of [[monopoly]] which always charges the highest price &quot;which can be squeezed out of the buyers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN2.html#B.I,%20Ch.7,%20Of%20the%20Natural%20and%20Market%20Price%20of%20Commodities Book I, Chapter 7], para 26&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of [[monopoly]] and the potential for [[cartel]]s, which would later form the core of [[competition law]] policy, could distort the benefits of free markets to the advantage of businesses at the expense of [[consumer sovereignty]].

==Classical political economy==
{{Main|Classical economics}}
{{See also|Thomas Edward Cliffe Leslie|Walter Bagehot|Thorold Rogers}}

The [[classical economists]] were referred to as a group for the first time by [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1936) Chapter 1, footnote&lt;/ref&gt; One unifying part of their theories was the [[labour theory of value]], contrasting to value deriving from a [[general equilibrium]] of supply and demand. These economists had seen the first economic and social transformation brought by the Industrial Revolution: rural depopulation, precariousness, poverty, apparition of a working class. 

They wondered about the population growth, because the [[demographic transition]] had begun in Great Britain at that time. They also asked many fundamental questions, about the source of value, the causes of economic growth and the role of money in the economy. They supported a free-market economy, arguing it was a natural system based upon freedom and property. However, these economists were divided and did not make up a unified current of thought.

A notable current within classical economics was [[underconsumption]] theory, as advanced by the [[Birmingham School (economics)|Birmingham School]] and Malthus in the early 19th century. These argued for government action to mitigate unemployment and economic downturns, and was an intellectual predecessor of what later became [[Keynesian economics]] in the 1930s. Another notable school was [[Manchester capitalism]], which advocated free trade, against the previous policy of [[mercantilism]].

===Jeremy Bentham===
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham}}
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jeremy Bentham]] believed in &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number&quot;.]]

Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) was perhaps the most radical thinker of his time, and developed the concept of [[utilitarianism]]. Bentham was an [[atheist]], a [[prison reform]]er, [[animal rights]] activist, believer in [[universal suffrage]], [[free speech]], [[free trade]] and [[health insurance]] at a time when few dared to argue for any. He was schooled rigorously from an early age, finishing university and being called to the bar at 18. His first book, ''A Fragment on Government'' (1776) published anonymously was a trenchant critique of [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries of the laws of England]]''. This gained wide success until it was found that the young Bentham, and not a revered Professor had penned it. In ''The Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (1791) Bentham set out his theory of utility.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham (1791) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Bentham/bnthPML1.html#Chapter%20I,%20Of%20the%20Principle%20of%20Utility Chapter I], para I&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of [[Law|legal]] policy must be to decrease misery and suffering so far as possible while producing the greatest happiness for the greatest number.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham (1791) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Bentham/bnthPML2.html#Chapter%20II,%20Of%20Principles%20Adverse%20to%20That%20of%20Utility Chapter II], para I&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham even designed a comprehensive methodology for the calculation of aggregate happiness in society that a particular law produced, a [[felicific calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentham (1791) Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt; Society, argued Bentham, is nothing more than the total of individuals,&lt;ref&gt;Bentham (1791) Chapter I, para IV&lt;/ref&gt; so that if one aims to produce net social good then one need only to ensure that more pleasure is experienced across the board than pain, regardless of numbers. 

For example, a law is proposed to make every bus in the city [[wheel chair]] accessible, but slower moving as a result than its [[Routemaster|predecessors]] because of the [[Bendy bus|new design]]. Millions of bus users will therefore experience a small amount of displeasure (or &quot;pain&quot;) in increased traffic and journey times, but a minority of people using wheel chairs will experience a huge amount of pleasure at being able to catch public transport, which outweighs the aggregate displeasure of other users. 

Interpersonal comparisons of utility were allowed by Bentham, the idea that one person's vast pleasure can count more than many others' pain. Much criticism later showed how this could be twisted, for instance, would the [[felicific calculus]] allow a vastly happy dictator to outweigh the dredging misery of his exploited populus? Despite Bentham's methodology there were severe obstacles in measuring people's happiness.

===Jean-Baptiste Say===
{{Main|Jean-Baptiste Say}}
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Say.gif|thumb|[[Say's law]], that supply always equals demand, was unchallenged until the 20th century.]]
[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] (1767–1832) was a Frenchman, born in [[Lyon]] who helped to popularise Adam Smith's work in France.&lt;ref&gt;Fusfeld (1994) p.47&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''A Treatise on Political Economy'' (1803) contained a brief passage, which later became orthodoxy in political economics until the [[Great Depression]] and known as [[Say's Law]] of markets. Say argued that there could never be a general deficiency of demand or a general glut of commodities in the whole economy. People produce things, said Say, to fulfill their own wants, rather than those of others. Production is therefore not a question of supply, but an indication of producers demanding goods. 

Say agreed that a part of the income is saved by the households, but in the long term, savings are invested. Investment and consumption are the two elements of demand, so that production ''is'' demand, so it is impossible for production to outrun demand, or for there to be a &quot;general glut&quot; of supply. Say also argued that money was neutral, because its sole role is to facilitate exchanges: therefore, people demand money only to buy commodities. Say said that &quot;money is a veil&quot;. 

To sum up these two ideas, Say said &quot;products are exchanged for products&quot;. At most, there will be different economic sectors whose demands are not fulfilled. But over time supplies will shift, businesses will retool for different production and the market will correct itself. An example of a &quot;general glut&quot; could be unemployment, in other words, too great a supply of workers, and too few jobs. Say's Law advocates would suggest that this necessarily means there is an excess demand for other products that will correct itself. This remained a foundation of economic theory until the 1930s. Say's Law was first put forward by [[James Mill]] (1773–1836) in English, and was advocated by [[David Ricardo]], [[Henry Thornton (reformer)|Henry Thornton]]&lt;ref&gt;Thornton (1802) ''The Paper Credit of Great Britain''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Stuart Mill]]. However two political economists, Thomas Malthus and [[Sismondi]], were unconvinced.

===Thomas Malthus===
[[File:Thomas Malthus.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Malthus]] cautioned law makers on the effects of poverty reduction policies.]]
{{Main|Thomas Malthus}}

[[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) was a [[Tory]] minister in the United Kingdom Parliament who, contrasting to Bentham, believed in strict government abstention from social ills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/malthus_thomas.shtml Historical figures – Thomas Malthus (1766–1834)], BBC&lt;/ref&gt; Malthus devoted the last chapter of his book ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1820) to rebutting Say's law, and argued that the economy could stagnate with a lack of &quot;effectual demand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/malthus.htm|title=Thomas Robert Malthus, 1766–1834|publisher=The History of Economic Thought Website|quote=Malthus denied the validity of Say's Law and argued that there could be a &quot;general glut&quot; of goods. Malthus believed that economic crises were characterized by a general excess supply caused by insufficient consumption.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other words, wages if less than the total costs of production cannot purchase the total output of industry and that this would cause prices to fall. Price falls decrease incentives to invest, and the spiral could continue indefinitely. Malthus is more notorious however for his earlier work, ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. This argued that intervention was impossible because of two factors. &quot;Food is necessary to the existence of man&quot;, wrote Malthus. &quot;The passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state&quot;, he added, meaning that the &quot;power of the population is infinitely greater than the power in the Earth to produce subsistence for man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://desip.igc.org/malthus/principles.html &quot;Rationale and Core Principles&quot;], The International Society of Malthus&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless growth in population is checked by &quot;misery and vice&quot;. Any increase in wages for the masses would cause only a temporary growth in population, which given the constraints in the supply of the Earth's produce would lead to misery, vice and a corresponding readjustment to the original population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutscience.org/malthus-faq.htm Who is Thomas Malthus?], ALL About Science&lt;/ref&gt; However more labour could mean more economic growth, either one of which was able to be produced by an accumulation of capital.

===David Ricardo===
{{Main|David Ricardo}}
[[File:Portrait of David Ricardo by Thomas Phillips.jpg|thumb|200px|[[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] is renowned for his law of [[comparative advantage]].]]
[[David Ricardo]] (1772–1823) was born in London. By the age of 26, he had become a wealthy stock market trader and bought himself a constituency seat in Ireland to gain a platform in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament's]] [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/stead.ricardo ''David Ricardo''], Economic History Services&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo's best known work is his ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', which contains his critique of barriers to international trade and a description of the manner the income is distributed in the population. Ricardo made a distinction between the workers, who received a wage fixed to a level at which they can survive, the landowners, who earn a rent, and capitalists, who own capital and receive a profit, a residual part of the income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/ric.html David Ricardo's Contributions to Economics], The Victorian Web&lt;/ref&gt; 

If population grows, it becomes necessary to cultivate additional land, whose fertility is lower than that of already cultivated fields, because of the law of decreasing productivity. Therefore, the cost of the production of the wheat increases, as well as the price of the wheat: The rents increase also, the wages, indexed to inflation (because they must allow workers to survive) too. Profits decrease, until the capitalists can no longer invest. The economy, Ricardo concluded, is bound to tend towards a [[Steady state economy|steady state]].

To postpone the steady state, Ricardo advocates to promote international trade to import wheat at a low price to fight landowners. The [[Corn Laws]] of the UK had been passed in 1815, setting a fluctuating system of tariffs to stabilise the price of [[wheat]] in the domestic market. Ricardo argued that raising tariffs, despite being intended to benefit the incomes of farmers, would merely produce a rise in the prices of rents that went into the pockets of landowners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Ricardo.html &quot;David Ricardo&quot;], Library of Economics and Liberties&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, extra labour would be employed leading to an increase in the cost of wages across the board, and therefore reducing exports and profits coming from overseas business. Economics for Ricardo was all about the relationship between the three &quot;factors of production&quot;: [[Land (economics)|land]], [[Workforce|labour]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Ricardo demonstrated mathematically that the [[gains from trade]] could outweigh the perceived advantages of protectionist policy. The idea of [[comparative advantage]] suggests that even if one country is inferior at producing all of its goods than another, it may still benefit from opening its borders since the inflow of goods produced more cheaply than at home, produces a gain for domestic consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/ricardo.htm David Ricardo, 1772–1823], The History of Economic Thought Website&lt;/ref&gt; According then to Ricardo, this concept would lead to a shift in prices, so that eventually England would be producing goods in which its comparative advantages were the highest.

===John Stuart Mill===
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]], weaned on the philosophy of Jeremy Bentham, wrote the most authoritative economics text of his time.]]
{{Main|Principles of Political Economy|John Stuart Mill}}

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) was the dominant figure of political economic thought of his time, as well as being a [[Member of Parliament]] for the seat of [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]], and a leading political philosopher. Mill was a child prodigy, reading Ancient Greek from the age of 3, and being vigorously schooled by his father [[James Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/milljs.htm John Stuart Mill: Overview], The Internet Encyclopedia of Pholosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] was a close mentor and family friend, and Mill was heavily influenced by [[David Ricardo]]. Mill's textbook, first published in 1848 and titled ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' was essentially a summary of the economic wisdom of the mid nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Pressman (2006) p.44&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Principles of Political Economy'' was used as the standard texts by most universities well into the beginning of the twentieth century. On the question of [[economic growth]] Mill tried to find a middle ground between Adam Smith's view of ever expanding opportunities for trade and technological innovation and Thomas Malthus' view of the inherent limits of population. In his fourth book Mill set out a number of possible future outcomes, rather than predicting one in particular. The first followed the Malthusian line that population grew quicker than supplies, leading to falling wages and rising profits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/mill.htm John Stuart Mill, 1806–1873], The History of Economic Thought: &quot;Happily, there is nothing in the laws of Value which remains for the present or any future writer to clear up; the theory of the subject is complete: the only difficulty to be overcome is that of so stating it as to solve by anticipation the chief perplexities which occur in applying it.&quot; (Mill's quote)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second, per Smith, said if capital accumulated faster than population grew then [[real wage]]s would rise. Third, echoing [[David Ricardo]], should capital accumulate and population increase at the same rate, yet technology stay stable, there would be no change in real wages because supply and demand for labour would be the same. However growing populations would require more land use, increasing food production costs and therefore decreasing profits. The fourth alternative was that technology advanced faster than population and capital stock increased.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedy of Philosophy – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/ John Stuart Mill] section ''Political Economy''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The result would be a prospering economy. Mill felt the third scenario most likely, and he assumed technology advanced would have to end at some point.&lt;ref&gt;Pressman (2006) p.45&lt;/ref&gt; But on the prospect of continuing economic growth, Mill was more ambivalent.

{{quote|I confess I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on; that the trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels, which form the existing type of social life, are the most desirable lot of human kind, or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases of industrial progress.&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1871) Book 4, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mill is also credited with being the first person to speak of supply and demand as a relationship rather than mere quantities of goods on markets,&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1965) pp. 1–15&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of [[opportunity cost]] and the rejection of the [[Wage-fund doctrine|wage fund doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;Pressman (2006) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitalism and Marx==
{{Main|Marxian economics}}
[[File:Marx old.jpg|left|thumb|Karl Marx provided a fundamental critique of classical economics, based on the [[labour theory of value]].]]
Just as the term &quot;mercantilism&quot; had been coined and popularised by its critics, like [[Adam Smith]], so was the term &quot;capitalism&quot; or ''Kapitalismus'' used by its dissidents, primarily [[Karl Marx]]. Karl Marx (1818–1883) was, and in many ways still remains the pre-eminent socialist economist. His combination of political theory represented in the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' and the [[Dialectical materialism|dialectic theory of history]] inspired by [[Friedrich Hegel]] provided a revolutionary critique of [[capitalism]] as he saw it in the nineteenth century. The [[socialist]] movement that he joined had emerged in response to the conditions of people in the new industrial era and the classical economics which accompanied it. He wrote his magnum opus ''[[Das Kapital]]'' at the [[British Museum]]'s library.

===Context===
{{Main|Robert Owen|Pierre Proudhon|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels 1856.jpg|thumb|right|With Marx, [[Friedrich Engels]] coauthored the Communist Manifesto, and the second volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]''.]]
[[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858) was one industrialist who determined to improve the conditions of his workers. He bought textile mills in [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]] where he forbade children under ten to work, set the workday from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. and provided evening schools for children when they finished. Such meagre measures were still substantial improvements and his business remained solvent through higher productivity, though his pay rates were lower than the national average.&lt;ref&gt;In 1819 this was 9 shillings, 11 pence; Fusfeld (1994) p.57&lt;/ref&gt; He published his vision in ''The New View of Society'' (1816) during the passage of the [[Factory Acts]], but his attempt from 1824 to begin a new utopian community in [[New Harmony, Indiana]] ended in failure.
One of Marx's own influences was the French anarchist/socialist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. While deeply critical of capitalism and in favour of workers' associations to replace it, he also objected to those contemporary socialists who idolized centralised state-run association. In ''System of Economic Contradictions'' (1846) Proudhon made a wide-ranging critique of capitalism, analysing the contradictory effects of machinery, competition, property, monopoly and other aspects of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon (1846) [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/pjproudhon/system-of-economic-contradictions-1 ''Volume 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon (1846) [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/pjproudhon/system-of-economic-contradictions-2 ''Volume 2'']&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of capitalism, he argued for a mutualist system &quot;based upon equality, – in other words, the organisation of labour, which involves the negation of political economy and the end of property.&quot; In his book ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) he argue that property is [[theft]], a different view than the classical [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], who had written that &quot;partial taxation is a mild form of robbery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1848) Book V, Chapter II; Interestingly Mill amended his wording from the 3rd edition in 1852, see [http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:aXLDmW7H4uUJ:www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/ellis.pdf+%22a+mild+form+of+robbery%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk]; see generally, ''Variations in the Editions of J.S. Mill's Principles of Political Economy'', M.A. Ellis, Economic Journal, vol. 16, June 1906, pp. 291–302.&lt;/ref&gt; However, towards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier views. In the posthumously published ''Theory of Property'', he argued that &quot;property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, Frederick. ''Social Philosophy in France'', A History of Philosophy, Volume IX, Image/Doubleday, 1994, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Friedrich Engels]], a published radical author, released a book titled ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]''&lt;ref&gt;Engels (1845) [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm ''Die Lage der arbeitenden Klassen von England in 1844'']&lt;/ref&gt; describing people's positions as &quot;the most unconcealed pinnacle of social misery in our day.&quot; After Marx died, it was Engels that completed the second volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' from Marx's notes.

===''Das Kapital''===
[[File:Kapital titel bd1.png|thumb|left|The title page of the first edition of ''Capital'' in [[German language|German]].]]
{{Main|Das Kapital|Capital, Volume I|Karl Marx}}

Karl Marx begins ''Das Kapital'' with the concept of commodities. Before capitalist societies, says Marx, the mode of production was based on [[slavery]] (e.g. in [[ancient Rome]]) before moving to [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[serfdom]] (e.g. in [[mediaeval Europe]]). As society has advanced, economic bondage has become looser, but the current nexus of labour exchange has produced an equally erratic and unstable situation allowing the conditions for [[revolution]]. People buy and sell their labour in the same way as people buy and sell goods and services. People themselves are disposable [[commodities]]. As he wrote in the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'',

{{quote|The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another... The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.}}

And furthermore from the first page of ''Das Kapital'',

{{quote|The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as an immense accumulation of commodities,&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1859) ''Zur Kritik der Politischen Oekonomie'', Berlin, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.}}

Marx's use of the word &quot;commodity&quot; is tied into an extensive [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] discussion of the nature of material wealth, how the objects of wealth are perceived and how they can be used. The concept of a commodity contrasts to objects of the natural world. When people mix their labour with an object it becomes a &quot;commodity&quot;. In the natural world there are trees, [[diamond]]s, [[iron ore]] and people. In the economic world they become chairs, [[Ring (finger)|rings]], [[factory|factories]] and workers. However, says Marx, commodities have a dual nature, a dual value. He distinguishes the [[use value]] of a thing from its [[exchange value]], which can be entirely different.&lt;ref&gt;In Marx's words, &quot;the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use value.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The use value of a thing derives from the amount of labour used to produce it, says Marx, following the classical economists in the [[labour theory of value]]. However, Marx did not believe labour only was the source of use value in things. He believed value can derive too from natural goods and refined his definition of use value to &quot;[[socially necessary labour time]]&quot; (the time people need to produce things when they are not lazy or inefficient).&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1867) Volume I, Part I, Chapter 1, para 14. In Marx's words, &quot;The labour time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, people subjectively inflate the value of things, for instance because there's a [[Commodity-fetishism|commodity fetish]] for glimmering diamonds,&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1867) Volume I, Part I, Chapter 1, Section 4, para 123&lt;/ref&gt; and oppressive power relations involved in commodity production. These two factors mean exchange values differ greatly. An oppressive power relation, says Marx applying the use/exchange distinction to labour itself, in work-wage bargains derives from the fact that employers pay their workers less in &quot;exchange value&quot; than the workers produce in &quot;use value&quot;. The difference makes up the capitalist's [[Profit (economics)|profit]], or in Marx's terminology, &quot;[[surplus value]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1867) Volume I, Part III, Chapter 9, Section 1&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, says Marx, capitalism is a system of [[exploitation]].

[[File:Panic of 1873 bank run.jpg|thumb|right|Marx explained the [[Boom and bust|booms and busts]], like the [[Panic of 1873]], as part of an inherent instability in capitalist economies.]]

Marx's work turned the [[labour theory of value]], as the classicists used it, on its head. His dark irony goes deeper by asking what is the socially necessary labour time for the production of labour (i.e. working people) itself. Marx answers that this is the bare minimum for people to subsist and to reproduce with skills necessary in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1867) Volume I, Part II, Chapter VI, para 10. In Marx's words, &quot;Therefore the labour-time requisite for the production of labour-power reduces itself to that necessary for the production of those means of subsistence; in other words, the value of labour-power is the value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; People are therefore [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]] from both the fruits of production and the means to realise their potential, psychologically, by their oppressed position in the labour market. But the tale told alongside exploitation and alienation is one of [[capital accumulation]] and [[economic growth]]. Employers are constantly under pressure from market competition to drive their workers harder, and at the limits invest in labour displacing technology (e.g. an assembly line packer for a robot). This raises profits and expands growth, but for the sole benefit of those who have private property in these [[means of production]]. The working classes meanwhile face progressive immiseration, having had the product of their labour exploited from them, having been alienated from the tools of production. And having been fired from their jobs for machines, they end unemployed. Marx believed that a [[reserve army of the unemployed]] would grow and grow, fuelling a downward pressure on wages as desperate people accept work for less. But this would produce a deficit of [[demand]] as the people's [[Purchasing power|power to purchase]] products lagged. There would be a glut in unsold products, production would be cut back, profits decline until capital accumulation halts in an [[economic depression]]. When the glut clears, the economy again starts to boom before the next cyclical bust begins. With every [[boom and bust]], with every capitalist crisis, thought Marx, tension and [[Class conflict|conflict]] between the increasingly polarised classes of capitalists and workers heightens. Moreover smaller firms are being gobbled by larger ones in every business cycle, as power is concentrated in the hands of the few and away from the many. Ultimately, led by the [[Communist party]], Marx envisaged a revolution and the creation of a classless society. How this may work, Marx never suggested. His primary contribution was not in a blue print for how society would be, but a criticism of what he saw it was.

===After Marx===
{{Main|Karl Kautsky|Rosa Luxemburg|Beatrice Webb|John A. Hobson|R. H. Tawney|Paul Sweezy}}

The first volume of ''Das Kapital'' was the only one Marx alone published. The second and third volumes were done with the help of [[Friedrich Engels]], and Karl Kautsky, who had become a friend of Engels, saw through the publication of volume four.

Marx had begun a tradition of economists who concentrated equally on political affairs. Also in Germany, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] was a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], who later turned towards the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] because of their stance against the First World War. [[Beatrice Webb]] in England was a socialist, who helped found both the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) and the [[Fabian Society]].

==Neoclassical thought==
{{Main|Neoclassical economics|Marginalism|Mathematical economics}}
{{See also|Léon Walras|Alexander del Mar|John Bates Clark|Irving Fisher|William Ashley (economic historian)|Enrico Barone|Maffeo Pantaleoni}}

In the 1860s, a revolution took place in economics. The new ideas were that of the [[Marginalist]] school. Writing simultaneously and independently, a Frenchman ([[Léon Walras]]), an Austrian ([[Carl Menger]]) and an Englishman ([[Stanley Jevons]]) were developing the theory, which had some antecedents. Instead of the price of a good or service reflecting the labor that has produced it, it reflects the marginal usefulness (utility) of the last purchase. This meant that in equilibrium, people's preferences determined prices, including, indirectly the price of labor.

This current of thought was not united, and there were three main schools working independently. The [[Lausanne school]], whose two main representants were Walras and [[Vilfredo Pareto]], developed the theories of [[general equilibrium]] and [[Pareto efficiency|optimality]]. The main written work of this school was Walras' ''Elements of Pure Economics''. The [[Neoclassical economics|Cambridge school]] appeared with Jevons' ''Theory of Political Economy'' in 1871. This English school has developed the theories of the partial equilibrium and has insisted on markets' failures. The main representatives were [[Alfred Marshall]], [[Stanley Jevons]] and [[Arthur Pigou]]. The [[Austrian school|Vienna school]] was made up of Austrian economists Menger, [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and [[Friedrich von Wieser]]. They developed the theory of capital and has tried to explain the presence of economic crises. It appeared in 1871 with Menger's ''Principles of Economics''.

===Marginal utility===
{{Main|Marginal utility theory|Carl Menger|Stanley Jevons|Léon Walras}}
[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|right|thumb|[[William Stanley Jevons]] helped popularise marginal utility theory.]]
Carl Menger (1840–1921), an [[Austrian School|Austrian economist]] stated the basic principle of marginal utility in ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre''&lt;ref&gt;Menger, Carl (1871) ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'',[http://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp full text in html]&lt;/ref&gt; (1871, ''[[Principles of Economics]]''). Consumers act rationally by seeking to maximise satisfaction of all their preferences. People allocate their spending so that the last unit of a commodity bought creates no more than a last unit bought of something else. [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]] (1835–1882) was his English counterpart, and worked as tutor and later professor at [[Owens College]], Manchester and [[University College, London]]. He emphasised in the ''Theory of Political Economy'' (1871) that at the margin, the satisfaction of goods and services decreases. An example of the [[Diminishing returns|theory of diminishing returns]] is that for every orange one eats, the less pleasure one gets from the last orange (until one stops eating). Then [[Léon Walras]] (1834–1910), again working independently, generalised marginal theory across the economy in ''Elements of Pure Economics'' (1874). Small changes in people's preferences, for instance shifting from beef to mushrooms, would lead to a mushroom price rise, and beef price fall. This stimulates producers to shift production, increasing mushrooming investment, which would increase market supply and a new price equilibrium between the products – e.g. lowering the price of mushrooms to a level between the two first levels. For many products across the economy the same would go, ''if'' one assumes markets are competitive, people choose on self-interest and no cost in shifting production.

Early attempts to explain away the periodical crises of which Marx had spoken were not initially as successful. After finding a statistical correlation of [[sunspot]]s and business fluctuations and following the common belief at the time that sunspots had a direct effect on weather and hence agricultural output, Stanley Jevons wrote,

{{quote|when we know that there is a cause, the variation of the solar activity, which is just of the nature to affect the produce of agriculture, and which does vary in the same period, it becomes almost certain that the two series of phenomena— credit cycles and solar variations—are connected as effect and cause.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons (1878) p.334&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mathematical analysis===

[[File:Alfred Marshall.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Alfred Marshall]] wrote the main alternative textbook to John Stuart Mill of the day, ''Principles of Economics'' (1882)]]
Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) was an Italian economist, best known for developing the concept of an economy that would permit maximizing the utility level of each individual, given the feasible utility level of others from production and exchange.  Such a result came to be called &quot;[[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]]&quot;. Pareto devised mathematical representations for such a resource allocation, notable in abstracting from institutional arrangements and monetary measures of [[Wealth#Economic analysis|wealth]] or [[distribution of income|income]] [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;• Alan Kirman (2008). &quot;Pareto, Vilfredo (1848–1923)&quot;, Efficiency or ‘Pareto optimality', ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_P000026&amp;edition=current&amp;q=pareto&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• Pareto (1897).

Translation of French edition from 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Marshall is also credited with an attempt to put economics on a more mathematical footing. He was the first Professor of Economics at the [[University of Cambridge]] and his work, ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP.html ''Principles of Economics''], by Alfred Marshall, at the Library of Economics and Liberty&lt;/ref&gt; coincided with the transition of the subject from &quot;[[political economy]]&quot; to his favoured term, &quot;[[economics]]&quot;. He viewed maths as a way to simplify economic reasoning, though had reservations, revealed in a letter to his student [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]].

{{quote|(1) Use mathematics as shorthand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry. (2) Keep to them till you have done. (3) Translate into English. (4) Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life. (5) Burn the mathematics. (6) If you can't succeed in 4, burn 3. This I do often.&lt;ref&gt;Buchholz (1989) p.151&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coming after the marginal revolution, Marshall concentrated on reconciling the classical labour theory of value, which had concentrated on the supply side of the market, with the new marginalist theory that concentrated on the consumer demand side. Marshalls graphical representation is the famous [[supply and demand]] graph, the &quot;Marshallian cross&quot;. He insisted it is the intersection of ''both'' supply ''and'' demand that produce an equilibrium of price in a competitive market. Over the long run, argued Marshall, the costs of production and the price of goods and services tend towards the lowest point consistent with continued production. [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]] in ''[[Wealth and Welfare]]'' (1920), insisted on the existence of [[market failure]]s. Markets are inefficient in case of [[externality|economic externalities]], and the State must interfere. However, Pigou retained free-market beliefs, and in 1933, in the face of the economic crisis, he explained in ''[[The Theory of Unemployment]]'' that the excessive intervention of the state in the labor market was the real cause of massive [[unemployment]], because the governments had established a minimal wage, which prevented the wages from adjusting automatically. This was to be the focus of attack from Keynes.

==Austrian school==
{{Main|Austrian school|Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk|Friedrich Hayek|Carl Menger|Ludwig von Mises|Friedrich von Wieser}}

While the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth were dominated increasingly by mathematical analysis, the followers of [[Carl Menger]], in the tradition of [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], followed a different route, advocating the use of deductive logic instead. This group became known as the Austrian School, reflecting the Austrian origin of many of the early adherents. [[Thorstein Veblen]] in 1900, in his ''Preconceptions of Economic Science'', contrasted neoclassical [[marginalism|marginalist]]s in the tradition of [[Alfred Marshall]] from the philosophies of the Austrian school.&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein Bunde; &quot;The Preconceptions of Economic Science&quot; Pt III, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' v14 (1900).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colander&quot; &gt;Colander, David; ''The Death of Neoclassical Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mises,hayek,shumpe.jpg|Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich von Hayek, and Joseph Schumpeter|right|thumb]]
[[Joseph Alois Schumpeter]] (1883–1950) was an Austrian economist and political scientist most known for his works on [[business cycles]] and [[innovation]]. He insisted on the role of the entrepreneurs in an economy. In ''Business Cycles: A theoretical, historical and statistical analysis of the Capitalist process''(1939), Schumpeter made a synthesis of the theories about business cycles. He suggested that those cycles could explain the economic situations. According to Schumpeter, capitalism necessarily goes through long-term cycles, because it is entirely based upon scientific inventions and innovations. A phase of expansion is made possible by innovations, because they bring [[productivity|productivity gains]] and encourage entrepreneurs to invest. However, when investors have no more opportunities to invest, the economy goes into recession, several firms collapse, closures and bankruptcy occur. This phase lasts until new innovations bring a [[creative destruction]] process, i.e. they destroy old products, reduce the employment, but they allow the economy to start a new phase of growth, based upon new products and new [[factors of production]].&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Roncaglia. ''The wealth of ideas: a history of economic thought''. Cambridge University Press. 2005. ISBN 978-0-521-84337-9. p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] (1881–1973) was an Austrian economist who contributed the idea of [[praxeology]], &quot;The science of human action&quot;.  Praxeology views economics as a series of voluntary trades that increase the satisfaction of the involved parties. Mises also argued that socialism suffers from an unsolvable [[economic calculation problem]], which according to him, could only be solved through [[free market]] [[price mechanism]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Mises' outspoken [[criticisms of socialism]] had a large influence on the economic thinking of [[Friedrich von Hayek]] (1899–1992), who, while initially sympathetic to socialism, became one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlBiography of F. A. Hayek (1899-1992)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mises.org/about/3234 |title=Biography of F. A. Hayek (1899–1992) |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In echoes of Smith's &quot;system of natural liberty&quot;, Hayek argued that the market is a &quot;spontaneous order&quot; and actively disparaged the concept of &quot;[[social justice]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Law, legislation and liberty'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek believed that all forms of collectivism (even those theoretically based on voluntary cooperation) could only be maintained by a central authority. In his book, ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944) and in subsequent works, Hayek claimed that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn would lead towards [[totalitarianism]]. Hayek attributed the birth of civilization to [[private property]] in his book ''[[The Fatal Conceit]]'' (1988). According to him, [[price signals]] are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate [[tacit knowledge]] or [[dispersed knowledge]] to each other, to solve the [[economic calculation problem]]. Along with his contemporary [[Gunnar Myrdal]], Hayek was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1974.

==Depression and reconstruction==
[[Alfred Marshall]] was still working on his last revisions of his ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'' at the outbreak of the First World War (1914–1918). The new twentieth century's climate of optimism was soon violently dismembered in the trenches of the Western front, as the civilised world tore itself apart. For four years the production of Britain, Germany and France was geared entirely towards the [[war economy]]'s industry of death. In 1917 Russia crumbled into revolution led by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s Bolshevik party. They carried Marxist theory as their saviour, and promised a broken country &quot;peace, bread and land&quot; by collectivising the means of production. Also in 1917, the United States of America entered the war on the side of France and Britain, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] carrying the slogan of &quot;making the world safe for democracy&quot;. He devised a peace plan of [[Fourteen Points]]. In 1918 Germany launched a spring offensive which failed, and as the allies counter-attacked and more millions were slaughtered, Germany slid into [[German Revolution|revolution]], its interim government suing for peace on the basis of Wilson's Fourteen Points. Europe lay in ruins, financially, physically, psychologically, and its future with the arrangements of the [[Versailles conference]] in 1919. [[John Maynard Keynes]] was the representative of [[Her Majesty's Treasury]] at the conference and the most vocal critic of its outcome.

===John Maynard Keynes===
[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|left|thumb|John Maynard Keynes (right) with his American counterpart [[Harry Dexter White|Harry White]] at the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods conference]].]]
{{Main|John Maynard Keynes|The Economic Consequences of the Peace}}
John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) was born in Cambridge, educated at [[eton college|Eton]] and supervised by both [[A. C. Pigou]] and [[Alfred Marshall]] at [[Cambridge University]]. He began his career as a lecturer, before working in the British government during the Great War, and rose to be the British government's financial representative at the [[Versailles conference]]. His observations were laid out in his book ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace''&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP.html ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace''] at The Library of Economics and Liberty&lt;/ref&gt; (1919) where he documented his outrage at the collapse of the Americans' adherence to the [[Fourteen Points]]&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP3.html#Chapter%203 Chapter III], para 20&lt;/ref&gt; and the mood of vindictiveness that prevailed towards Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP.html Chapter V], para 43&lt;/ref&gt; Keynes quit from the conference and using extensive economic data provided by the conference records, Keynes argued that if the victors forced [[war reparations]] to be paid by the defeated Axis, then a world financial crisis would ensue, leading to a second world war.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP6.html#Chapter%206 Chapter VI], para 4&lt;/ref&gt; Keynes finished his treatise by advocating, first, a reduction in reparation payments by Germany to a realistically manageable level, increased intra-governmental management of continental coal production and a free trade union through the [[League of Nations]];&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1919) [http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Keynes/kynsCP7.html#Chapter%207 Chapter VII], para 7&lt;/ref&gt; second, an arrangement to set off debt repayments between the Allied countries;&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1919) Chapter VII, para 30&lt;/ref&gt; third, complete reform of international currency exchange and an international loan fund;&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1919) Chapter VII, para 48&lt;/ref&gt; and fourth, a reconciliation of trade relations with Russia and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1919) Chapter VII, para 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was an enormous success, and though it was criticised for false predictions by a number of people,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Etienne Mantioux (1946) ''The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes''&lt;/ref&gt; without the changes he advocated, Keynes' dark forecasts matched the world's experience through the [[Great Depression]] which ensued in 1929, and the descent into a new outbreak of war in 1939. World War I had been the &quot;war to end all wars&quot;, and the absolute failure of the peace settlement generated an even greater determination to not repeat the same mistakes. With the defeat of [[fascism]], the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods conference]] was held to establish a new economic order. Keynes was again to play a leading role.

===''The General Theory''===
[[File:GT Palgrave.jpg|right|thumb|The title page to Keynes' ''General Theory''.]]
{{Main|The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money}}

During the Great Depression, Keynes had published his most important work, ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money'' (1936). The depression had been sparked by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], leading to massive rises in unemployment in the United States, leading to debts being recalled from European borrowers, and an economic domino effect across the world. Orthodox economics called for a tightening of spending, until business confidence and profit levels could be restored. Keynes by contrast, had argued in ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'' (1923) that a variety of factors determined economic activity, and that it was not enough to wait for the long run market equilibrium to restore itself. As Keynes famously remarked,

{{quote|...this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1923) Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On top of the [[Money supply|supply of money]], Keynes identified the [[propensity to consume]], inducement to invest, the marginal efficiency of capital, liquidity preference and the multiplier effect as variables which determine the level of the economy's output, employment and level of prices. Much of this esoteric terminology was invented by Keynes especially for his ''General Theory'', though some simple ideas lay behind. Keynes argued that if [[savings]] were being kept away from [[investment]] through [[financial market]]s, total spending falls. Falling spending leads to reduced incomes and unemployment, which reduces savings again. This continues until the desire to save becomes equal to the desire to invest, which means a new &quot;equilibrium&quot; is reached and the spending decline halts. This new &quot;equilibrium&quot; is a depression, where people are investing less, have less to save and less to spend.

Keynes argued that employment depends on total spending, which is composed of consumer spending and business investment in the [[private sector]]. Consumers only spend &quot;passively&quot;, or according to their income fluctuations. Businesses, on the other hand, are induced to invest by the expected rate of return on new investments (the benefit) and the rate of interest paid (the cost). So, said Keynes, if business expectations remained the same, and government reduces interest rates (the costs of borrowing), investment would increase, and would have a multiplied effect on total spending. [[Interest rate]]s, in turn, depend on the quantity of money and the desire to hold money in bank accounts (as opposed to investing). If not enough money is available to match how much people want to hold, interest rates rise until enough people are put off. So if the quantity of money were increased, while the desire to hold money remained stable, interest rates would fall, leading to increased investment, output and employment. For both these reasons, Keynes therefore advocated low interest rates and easy credit, to combat unemployment.

But Keynes believed in the 1930s, conditions necessitated public sector action. Deficit spending, said Keynes, would kick-start economic activity. This he had advocated in an open letter to U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' (1933). The [[New Deal]] programme in the U.S. had been well underway by the publication of the ''General Theory''. It provided conceptual reinforcement for policies already pursued. Keynes also believed in a more egalitarian distribution of income, and taxation on [[unearned income]] arguing that high rates of savings (to which richer folk are prone) are not desirable in a developed economy. Keynes therefore advocated both monetary management and an active fiscal policy.

During the Second World War, Keynes acted as advisor to [[HM Treasury]] again, negotiating major loans from the US. He helped formulate the plans for the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]] and an [[International Trade Organisation]]&lt;ref&gt;This was not accepted by the United States Congress at the time, but arose later through the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] of 1947 and the [[World Trade Organisation]] of 1994&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods conference]], a package designed to stabilise world economy fluctuations that had occurred in the 1920s and create a level trading field across the globe. Keynes passed away little more than a year later, but his ideas had already shaped a new global economic order, and all Western governments followed the Keynesian prescription of deficit spending to avert crises and maintain full employment. 

One of Keynes' pupils at Cambridge was [[Joan Robinson]], who contributed to the notion that [[competition]] is seldom perfect in a market, an indictment of the theory of markets setting prices. In ''The Production Function and the Theory of Capital'' (1953) Robinson tackled what she saw to be some of the circularity in orthodox economics. Neoclassicists assert that a competitive market forces producers to minimise the costs of production. Robinson said that costs of production are merely the prices of inputs, like [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Capital goods get their value from the final products. 

And if the price of the final products determines the price of capital, then it is, argued Robinson, utterly circular to say that the price of capital determines the price of the final products. Goods cannot be priced until the costs of inputs are determined. This would not matter if everything in the economy happened instantaneously, but in the real world, price setting takes time – goods are priced before they are sold. Since capital cannot be adequately valued in independently measurable units, how can one show that capital earns a return equal to the contribution to production? 

[[Piero Sraffa]] came to England from [[Italian Empire|fascist Italy]] in the 1920s, and worked with Keynes in Cambridge. In 1960 he published a small book called ''Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities'', which explained how technological relationships are the basis for production of goods and services. Prices result from wage-profit tradeoffs, collective bargaining, labour and management conflict and the intervention of government planning. Like Robinson, Sraffa was showing how the major force for price setting in the economy was not necessarily market adjustments.

==The &quot;American Way&quot;==
After World War II, the United States had become the pre-eminent global economic power. Europe and the Soviet Union lay in ruins and the [[British Empire]] was at its end. Until then, American economists had played a minor role. The [[institutional economists]] had been largely critical of the &quot;American Way&quot; of life, especially regarding [[conspicuous consumption]] of the [[Roaring Twenties]] before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. After the war, however, a more orthodox body of thought took root, reacting against the lucid debating style of Keynes, and re-mathematizing the profession. The orthodox centre was also challenged by a more radical group of scholars based at the University of Chicago. They advocated &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;, looking back to 19th century-style non-interventionist governments.

===Institutionalism===
[[File:Veblen3a.jpg|right|thumb|Thorsten Veblen came from a Norwegian immigrant family in rural mid-western America.]]
{{Main|Institutional economics|Thorsten Veblen|Adolf Berle|Henry George|John Dewey|Wesley Mitchell|Herbert A. Simon}}
[[Thorsten Veblen]] (1857–1929), who came from rural mid-western America and worked at the [[University of Chicago]], is one of the best known early critics of the &quot;American Way&quot;. In ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' (1899) he scorned [[Materialism|materialistic]] culture and wealthy people who [[Conspicuous consumption|conspicuously consumed]] their riches as a way of demonstrating success and in ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]'' (1904) Veblen distinguished production for people to use things and production for pure profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These two books, focusing on criticism first of [[consumerism]], and second of profiteering, did not advocate change. However, in 1911, Veblen joined the faculty of the [[University of Missouri]], where he had support from [[Herbert Davenport]], the head of the economics department. Veblen remained at [[Columbia, Missouri]] through 1918. In that year, he moved to New York to begin work as an editor of a magazine called ''The Dial'', and then in 1919, along with [[Charles A. Beard]], [[James Harvey Robinson]] and [[John Dewey]], helped found the New School for Social Research (known today as [[The New School]]). He was also part of the [[Technical Alliance]],&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R. &quot;Veblen and the Political Economy of the Engineer: the radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time&quot;, ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology (45:1) 1986, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; created in 1919 by [[Howard Scott]]. From 1919 through 1926 Veblen continued to write and to be involved in various activities at The New School. During this period he wrote ''The Engineers and the Price System (1921).&lt;ref&gt;[http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/%7Eecon/ugcm/3ll3/veblen/Engineers.pdf ''The Engineers and the Price System'', 1921.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John R. Commons]] (1862–1945) also came from mid-Western America. Underlying his ideas, consolidated in ''Institutional Economics'' (1934) was the concept that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging interests. There are monopolies, large corporations, labour disputes and fluctuating business cycles. They do however have an interest in resolving these disputes. Government, thought Commons, ought to be the mediator between the conflicting groups. Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions.

[[File:Adolf Augustus Berle NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolf Augustus Berle, Jr.]] with [[Gardiner Means]] was a foundational figure of modern [[corporate governance]].]]

The [[Great Depression]] was a time of significant upheaval in the States. One of the most original contributions to understanding what had gone wrong came from a [[Harvard University]] [[lawyer]], named [[Adolf Berle]] (1895–1971), who like [[John Maynard Keynes]] had resigned from his diplomatic job at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] and was deeply disillusioned by the [[Versailles Treaty]]. In his book with [[Gardiner C. Means]], ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932), he detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account. [[Board of directors|Directors]] of companies are held to account to the [[shareholder]]s of companies, or not, by the rules found in [[company law]] statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in [[Delaware corporation|Delaware]]) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority of shareholders in big [[public company|public companies]] were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, divided and conquered. Berle served in President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s administration through the depression, and was a key member of the so-called &quot;[[Brain trust]]&quot; developing many of the [[New Deal]] policies. In 1967, Berle and Means issued a revised edition of their work, in which the preface added a new dimension. It was not only the separation of controllers of companies from the owners as shareholders at stake. They posed the question of what the corporate structure was really meant to achieve.

{{quote|Stockholders toil not, neither do they spin, to earn [dividends and share price increases]. They are beneficiaries by position only. Justification for their inheritance... can be founded only upon social grounds... that justification turns on the distribution as well as the existence of wealth. Its force exists only in direct ratio to the number of individuals who hold such wealth. Justification for the stockholder's existence thus depends on increasing distribution within the American population. Ideally the stockholder's position will be impregnable only when every American family has its fragment of that position and of the wealth by which the opportunity to develop individuality becomes fully actualized.&lt;ref&gt;Berle (1967) p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===John Kenneth Galbraith===
{{Main|John Kenneth Galbraith}}
[[File:JohnKennethGalbraithOWI.jpg|right|thumb|[[John K. Galbraith]] began his career as a high flying &quot;new dealer&quot;, in the administration of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]]. An interview from the early 1990s is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNgfIH5pyxg here].]]
After the war, [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] (1908–2006) became one of the standard bearers for pro-active government and liberal-democrat politics. In ''[[The Affluent Society]]'' (1958), Galbraith argued voters reaching a certain material wealth begin to vote against the common good. He argued that the &quot;[[conventional wisdom]]&quot; of the conservative consensus was not enough to solve the problems of social inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith (1958) Chapter 2; n.b. though Galbraith claimed to coin the phrase &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;, the phrase is used several times in [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s book ''The Instinct of Workmanship''.&lt;/ref&gt; In an age of big business, he argued, it is unrealistic to think of markets of the classical kind. They set prices and use [[advertising]] to create artificial demand for their own products, distorting people's real preferences. Consumer preferences actually come to reflect those of corporations—a &quot;dependence effect&quot;—and the economy as a whole is geared to irrational goals.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith (1958) Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' Galbraith argued that economic decisions are planned by a private-bureaucracy, a [[technostructure]] of experts who manipulate [[marketing]] and [[public relations]] channels. This hierarchy is self-serving, profits are no longer the prime motivator, and even managers are not in control. Because they are the new planners, corporations detest risk, require steady economic and stable markets. They recruit governments to serve their interests with fiscal and monetary policy, for instance adhering to monetarist policies which enrich money-lenders in the City through increases in interest rates. While the goals of an affluent society and complicit government serve the irrational technostructure, public space is simultaneously impoverished. Galbraith paints the picture of stepping from penthouse villas onto unpaved streets, from landscaped gardens to unkempt public parks. In ''[[Economics and the Public Purpose]]'' (1973) Galbraith advocates a &quot;new socialism&quot; as the solution, [[Nationalization|nationalising]] military production and public services such as [[health care]], introducing disciplined salary and price controls to reduce inequality.

===Paul Samuelson===
{{Main|Paul Samuelson|Neoclassical synthesis|Positive economics}}
[[File:Paul Samuelson.gif|thumb|left|[[Paul Samuelson]] wrote the best selling economics texts.]]
In contrast to Galbraith's linguistic style, the post-war economics profession began to synthesise much of [[Keynes]]' work with mathematical representations. Introductory university economics courses began to present economic theory as a unified whole in what is referred to as the [[neoclassical synthesis]]. &quot;[[Positive economics]]&quot; became the term created to describe certain trends and &quot;laws&quot; of economics that could be objectively observed and described in a value-free way, separate from &quot;[[Normative economics|normative economic]]&quot; evaluations and judgments. The best selling textbook writer of this generation was [[Paul Samuelson]] (1915–2009). His [[Ph.D.]] dissertation was an attempt to show that mathematical methods could [[mathematical problem|represent]] a core of testable economic theory. It was published as ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' in 1947. Samuelson started with two assumptions. First, people and firms will act to [[rational choice theory|maximise]] their self-interested goals. Second, markets tend towards an [[market equilibrium|equilibrium]] of prices, where demand matches supply. He extended the mathematics to describe equilibrating behaviour of economic systems, including that of the then new [[macroeconomic theory]] of [[John Maynard Keynes]]. Whilst [[Richard Cantillon]] had imitated [[Isaac Newton]]'s mechanical physics of inertia and gravity in competition and the market,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fusfeld 1994 p.21&quot;/&gt; the [[physiocrats]] had copied the body's blood system into circular flow of income models, [[William Jevons]] had found growth cycles to match the periodicity of [[sunspot]]s, Samuelson adapted [[thermodynamics]] formulae to economic theory. Reasserting economics as a hard science was being done in the United Kingdom also, and one celebrated &quot;discovery&quot;, of [[A. W. Phillips]], was of a correlative relationship between inflation and unemployment. The workable policy conclusion was that securing full employment could be traded-off against higher inflation. Samuelson incorporated the idea of the [[Phillips curve]] into his work. His introductory textbook [[Economics (textbook)|''Economics'']] was influential and widely adopted. It became the most successful economics text ever. Paul Samuelson was awarded the new [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1970 for his merging of mathematics and political economy.

===Kenneth Arrow===
{{Main|Kenneth Arrow}}
[[File:Kenneth Arrow, Stanford University.jpg|thumb|right|Kenneth Arrow, interview (1/09) on the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muUjNWIeDZg here].]]
[[Kenneth Arrow]] (born 1921) is Paul Samuelson's brother-in-law. His first major work, forming his doctoral dissertation at [[Columbia University]] was ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'' (1951), which brought economics into contact with political theory. This gave rise to [[social choice theory]] with the introduction of his &quot;[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Possibility Theorem]]&quot;. In his words,

{{quote|If we exclude the possibility of interpersonal comparisons of utility, then the only methods of passing from individual tastes to social preferences which will be satisfactory and which will be defined for a wide range of sets of individual orderings are either imposed or dictatorial.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Arrow, &quot;A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare&quot; (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This sparked widespread discussion over how to interpret the different conditions of the theorem and what implications it had for democracy and voting. Most controversial of his four (1963) or five (1950/1951) conditions is the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]].

In the 1950s, Arrow and [[Gérard Debreu]] developed the [[Arrow–Debreu model]] of [[General equilibrium|general equilibria]]. In 1971 Arrow with [[Frank Hahn]] co-authored ''General Competitive Analysis'' (1971), which reasserted a theory of general equilibrium of prices through the economy. In 1969 the [[Sveriges Riksbank|Swedish Central Bank]] began awarding a prize in economics, as an analogy to the [[Nobel prize]]s awarded in Chemistry, Physics, Medicine as well as Literature and Peace (though Alfred Nobel never endorsed this in his will). With [[John Hicks]], Arrow won the [[Bank of Sweden prize]] in 1972, the youngest recipient ever. The year before, US President [[Richard Nixon]]'s had declared that &quot;[[We are all Keynesians now]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;In 1971, announcing wage and price controls. This was actually lifted from a comment by [[Milton Friedman]] in 1965 which formed a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842353-3,00.html article] title, Friday, Dec. 31, 1965. See below.&lt;/ref&gt; The irony was that this was the beginning of a new revolution in economic thought.

==Monetarism and the Chicago school==
{{Main|Monetarism|Chicago school (economics)}}
{{See also|Monetarism|Gary Becker|George Stigler|Frank Knight|Robert E. Lucas|Robert Fogel}}

The interventionist monetary and fiscal policies that the orthodox post-war economics recommended came under attack in particular by a group of theorists working at the [[University of Chicago]], which came to be known as the [[Chicago School (economics)|Chicago School]]. This more conservative strand of thought reasserted a &quot;[[Libertarianism|libertarian]]&quot; view of market activity, that people are best left to themselves, free to choose how to conduct their own affairs.

===Ronald Coase===
{{Main|Ronald Coase|Law and economics}}
Ronald Coase (born 1910) is the most prominent economic analyst of law and the 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner. His first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms ([[company law|companies]], partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s. [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''The Problem of Social Cost'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of an old [[Law|legal]] case about [[nuisance]] named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial [[bargaining|bargain]] about who moves house that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase (1960) IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase (1960) V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase (1960) VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milton Friedman===

{{Main|Milton Friedman}}

Milton Friedman (1912–2006) stands as one of the most influential economists of the late twentieth century. He won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, among other things, for ''A Monetary History of the United States'' (1963). Friedman argued that the Great Depression had been caused by the [[Federal Reserve]]'s policies through the 1920s, and worsened in the 1930s. Friedman argues that laissez-faire government policy is more desirable than government intervention in the economy. Governments should aim for a neutral monetary policy oriented toward long-run [[economic growth]], by gradual expansion of the money supply. He advocates the [[quantity theory of money]], that general prices are determined by money. Therefore active monetary (e.g. easy credit) or fiscal (e.g. tax and spend) policy can have unintended negative effects. In ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (1967) Friedman wrote:

{{quote|There is likely to be a lag between the need for action and government recognition of the need; a further lag between recognition of the need for action and the taking of action; and a still further lag between the action and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman (1967) p.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Friedman was also known for his work on the consumption function, the [[permanent income hypothesis]] (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Charlie Rose Show|airdate=2005-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to rise later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the [[Phillips curve]] and the concept of the [[natural rate of unemployment]] (1968). This critique associated his name with the insight that a government that brings about higher inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections in the labour market.

==Global times==

===Amartya Sen===
{{Main|Amartya Sen|Development economics}}
Amartya Sen (born 1933) is a leading development and welfare economist and has expressed considerable skepticism on the validity of neo-classical assumptions. He was highly critical of [[rational expectations]] theory, and devoted his work to development and human rights. He won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1998.

[[File:Joseph Stiglitz.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Stiglitz has both been successful as an economist and a popular author. He talks about his book ''[[Making Globalization Work]]'' [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzhD7KVs-R4 here].]]

===Joseph E. Stiglitz===
{{Main|Joseph E. Stiglitz|George Akerlof|Information economics}}
Joseph Stiglitz (born 1943) Received the Nobel Prize in 2001 for his work in [[information economics]].  He has served as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and as chief economist for the [[World Bank]]. Stiglitz has taught at many universities, including Columbia, Stanford, Oxford, Manchester, Yale, and MIT.  In recent years he has become an outspoken critic of global economic institutions. He is a popular and academic author. In ''Making Globalization Work'' (2007), he offers an account of his perspectives on issues of international economics.

{{quote|The fundamental problem with the neoclassical model and the corresponding model under market socialism is that they fail to take into account a variety of problems that arise from the absence of perfect information and the costs of acquiring information, as well as the absence or imperfections in certain key risk and capital markets. The absence or imperfection can, in turn, to a large extent be explained by problems of information.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz (1996) p.5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Paul Krugman at the German National Library in Frankfurt.jpg|right|thumb|Paul Krugman at the [[German National Library]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]]]]

===Paul Krugman===
{{Main|Paul Krugman|International economics}}
Paul Krugman (born 1953) is a contemporary economist. His textbook ''International Economics'' (2007) appears on many undergraduate reading lists. Well known as a representative of progressivism, he writes a biweekly column on economics, American [[economic policy]], and [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] more generally in the ''[[New York Times]]''.  He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008 for his work on [[New Trade Theory]] and [[economic geography]].

==Contemporary economic thought==

===Macroeconomics since the Bretton Woods era===
{{Further|History of macroeconomic thought}}
From the 1970s onwards Friedman's monetarist critique of Keynesian macroeconomics formed the starting point for a number of trends in macroeconomic theory opposed to the idea that government intervention can or should stabilise the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Manikw, N. Greg. &quot;A Quick Refresher Course in Macroeconomics.&quot; ''Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 28'', No. 4. (Dec., 1990), pp. 1647.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] criticized Keynesian thought for its inconsistency with microeconomic theory.  [[Lucas critique|Lucas's critique]] set the stage for a neoclassical school of macroeconomics, [[New Classical economics]] based on the foundation of classical economics. Lucas also popularized the idea of [[rational expectations]],&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, 1647–1648.&lt;/ref&gt; which was used as the basis for several new classical theories including the [[Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, 1649.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard model for new classical economics is the [[real business cycle theory]], which sought to explain observed fluctuations in output and employment in terms of real variables such as changes in technology and tastes. Assuming competitive markets, real business cycle theory implied that cyclical fluctuations are optimal responses to variability in technology and tastes, and that macroeconomic stabilisation policies must reduce welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, 1653.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynesian economics made a comeback among mainstream economists with the advent of [[New Keynesian]] macroeconomics. The central theme of new Keynesianism was the provision of a microeconomic foundation for Keynesian macroeconomics, obtained by identifying minimal deviations from the standard microeconomic assumptions which yield Keynesian macroeconomic conclusions, such as the possibility of significant welfare benefits from macroeconomic stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, 1655.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Akerlof]]'s '[[menu cost]]s' arguments, showing that, under imperfect competition, small deviations from rationality generate significant (in welfare terms) price stickiness, are good example of this kind of work.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, 1657.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists have combined the methodology of real business cycle theory with theoretical elements, like sticky prices, from new Keynesian theory to produce the [[new neoclassical synthesis]].  [[Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium]] (DSGE) models, large systems of microeconomic equations combined into models of the general economy, are central to this new synthesis.  The synthesis dominates present day economics.
