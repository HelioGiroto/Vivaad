# the right to enforcement of property rights.

In economics, property usually refers to ownership (rights to the proceeds of output generated) and control over the use of the [[means of production]]. They may be owned [[Private property|privately]], by the [[Public property|state]], [[Cooperative|by those who use it]], or [[Common ownership|held in common by society]].

The concept of property rights as used by economists and legal scholars (see [[property]] for the legal concept) are related but distinct. The distinction is largely seen in the economists' focus on the ability of an individual or collective to control the use of the good. For example, a thief who has stolen a good would not be considered to have legal ([[de jure]]) property right to the good, but would be considered to have economic ([[de facto]]) property right to the good.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Property-rights regimes==
Property rights to a good must be defined, their use must be monitored, and possession of rights must be enforced. The costs of defining, monitoring, and enforcing property rights are  termed [[transaction costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Measurement Costs and the Organization of Markets|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|date=|first=Yoram|last=Barzel|coauthors=|volume=25|issue=1|pages=27–48|id= |format=|accessdate=2007-01-28|month=April|year=1982|doi=10.1086/467005|issn=0022-2186|jstor=725223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Douglas Allen, |title=What are Transaction Costs? (Research in Law and Economics) |publisher=Jai Pr |location= |year=1991 |isbn=0-7623-1115-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of transaction costs, various forms of property rights institutions will develop. Each institutional form can be described by the distribution of rights. The following list is ordered from no property rights defined to all property rights being held by individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Daniel W. Bromley, |title=Environment and Economy: Property Rights and Public Policy |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year= 1991|isbn=1-55786-087-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Open access ([[res nullius]])
# State property
# Common property
# Private property

[[Open-access property]] is property that is not owned by anyone. It is non-[[excludable]] (no one can exclude anyone else from using it) and non-[[rivalry (economics)|rival]] (one person's use of it does not prevent others from simultaneously using it). Open-access property is not managed by anyone, and access to it is not controlled. There is no constraint on anyone using open-access property (excluding people is either impossible or prohibitively costly). The [[tragedy of the commons]] should be called the tragedy of open access. 'Open-access property may exist because ownership has never been established, because the state has legislated it, or because no effective controls are in place, or feasible, i.e., the cost of exclusion outweighs the benefits. The state can sometimes effectively convert open access property into private, common or public property by legislating to define rights and enforce them'.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ&quot;&gt;Guerin, K. (2003). ''Property Rights and Environmental Policy: A New Zealand Perspective''. Wellington, New Zealand: NZ Treasury&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of open-access property are the atmosphere or ocean fisheries.

[[State property]] (also known as [[public property]]) is property that is owned by all, but its access and use is controlled by the state. An example is a national park.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ&quot;/&gt;

[[Common property]] or ''collective property'' is property that is owned by a group of individuals. Access, use, and exclusion are controlled by the joint owners. True commons can break down, but, unlike open-access property, common property owners have greater ability to manage conflicts through shared benefits and enforcement.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ&quot;/&gt;

[[Private property]] is both excludable and rival. Private property access, use, exclusion and management are controlled by the private owner or a group of legal owners.

==Property rights and the environment==
Implicit or explicit property rights can be created by regulating the environment, either through prescriptive [[Command and control (government)|command and control]] approaches (e.g. limits on input/output/discharge quantities, specified processes/equipment, audits) or by more flexible [[market-based instruments]] (e.g. taxes, transferable permits or quotas).&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ&quot;/&gt;

It has been proposed by Ronald Coase (Jnl of Law and Economics, 5 October 1960) that clearly defining and assigning property rights would resolve environmental problems by internalizing externalities and relying on incentives of private owners to conserve resources for the future. However, this assumes that it is possible to internalize all environmental benefits, that owners will have perfect information, that scale economies are manageable, transaction costs are bearable, and that legal frameworks operate efficiently.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ&quot;/&gt; Strengthening markets and creating and strengthening property rights could reduce, but not eliminate, such problems.
