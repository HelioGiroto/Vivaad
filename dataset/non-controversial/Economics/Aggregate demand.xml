In [[macroeconomics]], '''aggregate demand''' ('''AD''') is the total demand for final goods and services in the economy (Y) at a given time and [[price level]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is the amount of goods and services in the economy that will be purchased at all possible price levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It is often cited that the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping because at lower price levels a greater quantity is demanded. While this is correct at the microeconomic, single good level, at the aggregate level this is incorrect. The aggregate demand curve is in fact downward sloping as a result of three distinct effects: [[Pigou effect|Pigou's wealth effect]], [[Keynes effect|the Keynes' interest rate effect]] and the [[Mundell–Fleming model|Mundell-Fleming exchange-rate effect]].

==Components ==
An aggregate demand curve is the sum of individual demand curves for different sectors of the economy. The aggregate demand is usually described as a linear sum of four separable demand sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =
http://www.tutor2u.net/economics/content/topics/ad_as/ad-as_notes.htm | title = aggregate demand (AD) | accessdate = 2007-11-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071109072803/http://www.tutor2u.net/economics/content/topics/ad_as/ad-as_notes.htm| archivedate= 9 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;  AD = C + I + G + (X-M)  \ &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; C \ &lt;/math&gt; is consumption (may also be known as consumer spending) = &lt;math&gt;a_c + b_c(Y - T)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt; I \ &lt;/math&gt; is Investment,
* &lt;math&gt; G \ &lt;/math&gt; is Government spending,
* &lt;math&gt; NX = X - M \ &lt;/math&gt; is Net export,
** &lt;math&gt; X \ &lt;/math&gt; is total exports, and
** &lt;math&gt; M \ &lt;/math&gt; is total imports = &lt;math&gt;a_m + b_m(Y - T)&lt;/math&gt;.

These four major parts, which can be stated in either [[Real vs. nominal in economics|'nominal' or 'real']] terms, are: 

* personal consumption expenditures ('''C''') or &quot;consumption,&quot; demand by households and unattached individuals; its determination is described by the [[consumption function]]. The consumption function is C= a + (mpc)(Y-T)
** a is [[autonomous consumption]], mpc is the [[marginal propensity to consume]], (Y-T) is the disposable income.

* [[Gross (economics)|gross]] private domestic [[investment]] ('''I'''), such as spending by business firms on [[factory]] construction. This includes all [[private sector]] spending aimed at the production of some future [[consumable]].
** In [[Keynesian]] economics, not all of gross private domestic investment counts as part of aggregate demand. Much or most of the investment in inventories can be due to a short-fall in demand (unplanned inventory accumulation or &quot;general over-production&quot;).  The Keynesian model forecasts a decrease in national output and income when there is unplanned investment.  (Inventory accumulation would correspond to an excess supply of products; in the [[National Income and Product Accounts]], it is treated as a purchase by its producer.) Thus, only the ''planned'' or intended or desired part of investment ('''I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''') is counted as part of aggregate demand. (So, '''I''' does not include the 'investment' in running up or depleting inventory levels.)
** Investment is affected by the output and the [[interest rate]] (i). Consequently, we can write it as I(Y,i). Investment has positive relationship with the output and negative relationship with the interest rate. For example, an increase in the interest rate will cause aggregate demand to decline.  Interest costs are part of the cost of borrowing and as they rise, both firms and households will cut back on spending.  This shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left.  This lowers equilibrium GDP below potential GDP.  As production falls for many firms, they begin to lay off workers, and unemployment rises.  The declining demand also lowers the price level.  The economy is in recession.

* gross [[government]] investment and consumption expenditures ('''G''').
* [[Net worth|net]] [[exports]] ('''NX''' and sometimes ('''X-M''')), i.e., net demand by the rest of the world for the country's output.

In sum, for a single country at a given time, aggregate demand ('''D''' or '''AD''') = '''C''' + '''I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''' + '''G''' + '''(X-M)'''. 

These [[macrovariables]] are constructed from varying types of [[microvariables]] from the price of each, so these variables are denominated in (real or nominal) [[currency]] terms.

== Aggregate demand curves ==
Understanding of the aggregate demand curve depends on whether it is examined based on changes in demand as income changes, or as price change.

===Keynesian cross===
{{main|Keynesian cross}}

===Aggregate demand-aggregate supply model===
{{main|AD-AS model}}

Sometimes, especially in textbooks, &quot;aggregate demand&quot; refers to an entire demand curve that ''looks'' like that in a typical [[Marshallian demand|Marshallian]] [[supply and demand]] diagram. 

[[File:AS + AD graph.svg|right|thumb|300px|Aggregate supply/demand graph]]

Thus, that we could refer to an &quot;aggregate quantity demanded&quot; ('''Y&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''' = '''C''' + '''I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''' + '''G''' + '''NX''' in real or inflation-corrected terms) at any given aggregate average price level (such as the [[GDP deflator]]), '''P'''.  

In these diagrams, typically the '''Y&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''' rises as the average price level ('''P''') falls, as with the '''AD''' line in the diagram. The main theoretical reason for this is that if the nominal [[money]] supply ('''M&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/s&gt;''') is constant, a falling '''P''' implies that the [[Real vs. nominal in economics|real]] money supply ('''M&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/s&gt;'''/'''P''')rises, encouraging lower [[interest rate]]s and higher spending. This is often called the &quot;[[Keynes effect]].&quot; 
                   
Carefully using ideas from the [[theory]] of [[supply and demand]], [[aggregate supply]] can help determine the extent to which increases in aggregate demand lead to increases in real [[output (economics)|output]] or instead to increases in prices ([[inflation]]). In the diagram, an increase in any of the components of '''AD''' (at any given '''P''') shifts the '''AD''' curve to the right. This increases both the level of real production ('''Y''') and the average price level ('''P''').

But different levels of economic activity imply different mixtures of output and price increases. As shown, with very low levels of [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] [[gross domestic product]] and thus large amounts of unemployed resources, most economists of the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian school]] suggest that most of the change would be in the form of output and employment increases. As the economy gets close to [[potential output]] ('''Y*'''), we would see more and more price increases rather than output increases as '''AD''' increases. 

Beyond '''Y*''', this gets more intense, so that price increases dominate. Worse, output levels greater than '''Y*''' cannot be sustained for long. The '''AS''' is a ''short-term'' relationship here. If the economy persists in operating above potential, the '''AS''' curve will shift to the left, making the increases in real output transitory.

At low levels of '''Y''', the world is more complicated. First, most modern industrial economies experience few if any falls in prices. So the '''AS''' curve is unlikely to shift down or to the right. Second, when they do suffer price cuts (as in Japan), it can lead to disastrous [[deflation (economics)|deflation]].

==Debt==
A [[Post-Keynesian]] theory of aggregate demand emphasizes the role of [[debt]], which it considers a fundamental component of aggregate demand;&lt;ref name=&quot;dw41&quot;&gt;''[http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2009/12/01/debtwatch-no-41-december-2009-4-years-of-calling-the-gfc/ Debtwatch No 41, December 2009: 4 Years of Calling the GFC],'' [[Steve Keen]], December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the contribution of change in debt to aggregate demand is referred to by some as the '''{{visible anchor|credit impulse}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/paper=1595980 Credit and Economic Recovery: Demystifying Phoenix Miracles], Michael Biggs, Thomas Mayer, Andreas Pick, March 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Aggregate demand is ''spending,'' be it on consumption, investment, or other categories. Spending is related to income via:
:Income – Spending = Net Savings
Rearranging this yields:
:Spending = Income – Net Savings = Income + Net Increase in Debt
In words: what you spend is what you earn, plus what you borrow: if you spend $110 and earned $100, then you must have net borrowed $10; conversely if you spend $90 and earn $100, then you have net savings of $10, or have reduced debt by $10, for net change in debt of –$10.

If debt grows or shrinks slowly as a percentage of GDP, its impact on aggregate demand is small; conversely, if debt is significant, then changes in the dynamics of debt growth can have significant impact on aggregate demand. Change in debt is tied to the ''level'' of debt:&lt;ref name=&quot;dw41&quot; /&gt; if the overall debt level is 10% of GDP and 1% of loans are not repaid, this impacts GDP by 1% of 10% = 0.1% of GDP, which is statistical noise. Conversely, if the debt level is 300% of GDP and 1% of loans are not repaid, this impacts GDP by 1% of 300% = 3% of GDP, which is significant: a change of this magnitude will generally cause a [[recession]]. Similarly, changes in the repayment rate (debtors paying down their debts) impact aggregate demand in proportion to the level of debt. Thus, as the level of debt in an economy grows, the economy becomes more sensitive to debt dynamics, and credit bubbles are of macroeconomic concern. Since write-offs and savings rates both spike in recessions, both of which result in shrinkage of credit, the resulting drop in aggregate demand can worsen and perpetuate the recession in a [[vicious cycle]].

This perspective originates in, and is intimately tied to, the [[debt-deflation]] theory of [[Irving Fisher]], and the notion of a [[credit bubble]] (credit being the flip side of debt), and has been elaborated in the Post-Keynesian school.&lt;ref name=&quot;dw41&quot; /&gt; If the overall level of debt is rising each year, then aggregate demand exceeds Income by that amount. However, if the level of debt stops rising and instead starts falling (if &quot;the bubble bursts&quot;), then aggregate demand falls short of income, by the amount of net savings (largely in the form of debt repayment or debt writing off, such as in bankruptcy). This causes a sudden and sustained drop in aggregate demand, and this shock is argued to be the proximate cause of a class of economic crises, properly [[financial crises]]. Indeed, a fall in the level of debt is not necessary – even a ''slowing'' in the rate of debt growth causes a drop in aggregate demand (relative to the higher borrowing year).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;However much you borrow and spend this year, if it is less than last year, it means your spending will go into recession.&quot; Dhaval Joshi, RAB Capital, quoted in
[http://www.smh.com.au/business/noughty-boys-on-trading-floor-led-us-into-debtladen-fantasy-20091222-lbs4.html Noughty boys on trading floor led us into debt-laden fantasy]&lt;/ref&gt; These crises then end when credit starts growing again, either because most or all debts have been repaid or written off, or for other reasons as below.

From the perspective of debt, the Keynesian prescription of government [[deficit spending]] in the face of an economic crisis consists of the government net ''dis''-saving (increasing its debt) to compensate for the shortfall in private debt: it replaces private debt with public debt. Other alternatives include seeking to restart the growth of private debt (&quot;reflate the bubble&quot;), or slow or stop its fall; and [[debt relief]], which by lowering or eliminating debt stops credit from contracting (as it cannot fall below zero) and allows debt to either stabilize or grow – this has the further effect of redistributing wealth from creditors (who write off debts) to debtors (whose debts are relieved).

==Criticisms==
[[Austrian School|Austrian theorist]] [[Henry Hazlitt]] argued that aggregate demand is a meaningless concept in economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hazlitt |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Hazlitt |year=1959 |title=The Failure of the 'New Economics': An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies |url=http://www.mises.org/books/failureofneweconomics.pdf |ref= harv |publisher=D. Van Nostrand}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Hayek]], another Austrian theorist, argued that Keynes' study of the aggregate relations in an economy is fallacious, as recessions are caused by micro-economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Collected Works of F.A.
