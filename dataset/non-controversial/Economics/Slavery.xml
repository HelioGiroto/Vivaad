'''Slavery''' is a system under which people are treated as [[property]] to be bought and sold, and are [[Unfree labour|forced to work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Brace|title=The Politics of Property: Labour, Freedom and Belonging|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=osZnIiqDd4sC&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=May 31, 2012|year=2004|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-1535-3|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves can be held against their will from the time of their capture, purchase or birth, and deprived of the right to leave, to refuse to work, or to demand [[Remuneration|compensation]].

In pre-industrial societies, slaves and their labour were economically extremely important. Slaves and serfs made up around three-quarters of the world's population at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Forsythe (2009). &quot;''[http://books.google.cz/books?id=1QbX90fmCVUC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 1]''&quot;. Oxford University Press. p. 399. ISBN 0195334027 — &quot;The fact remained that at the beginning of the nineteenth century an estimated three-quarters of all people alive were trapped in bondage against their will either in some form of slavery or serfdom. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern mechanised societies, there is less need for sheer massive manpower; [[Norbert Wiener]] wrote that &quot;mechanical labor has most of the economic properties of slave labor, though&amp;nbsp;... it does not involve the direct demoralizing effects of human cruelty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norbert Wiener|title=Cybernetics Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NnM-uISyywAC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=May 31, 2012|year=1961|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-73009-9|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The English word ''slave'' comes from [[Old French]] ''sclave'', from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''sclavus'', from the [[Byzantine Greek]] σκλάβος.

The word σκλάβος, in turn, comes from the [[Slav#Ethnonym|ethnonym ''Slav'']], because in some wars in early mediaeval times many Slavs were captured and enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition 1989, ''s. v.'' 'slave'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe History of Europe - Middle Ages - Growth and innovation - Demographic and agricultural growth]&lt;/ref&gt; An older theory connected it to the Greek verb ''skyleúo'' 'to strip a slain enemy'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kluge&quot;&gt;F. Kluge, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache''. 1891, ''s. v.'' 'Sklave'.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chattel slavery ===

Chattel slavery, so named because people are treated as the [[personal property]], chattels, of an owner and are bought and sold as commodities, is the original form of slavery. When taking these chattels across national borders it is referred to as [[human trafficking]] especially when these slaves provide sexual services.&lt;ref name=&quot;newint&quot; /&gt;

=== Bonded labor ===
{{main|Bonded labor}}

[[Debt bondage]] or bonded labor occurs when a person pledges himself or herself against a loan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bales2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Bales|title=New slavery: a reference handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8Cw6EsO59aYC|accessdate=March 11, 2011|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-815-6|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The services required to repay the debt, and their duration, may be undefined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bales2004&quot; /&gt; Debt bondage can be passed on from generation to generation, with children required to pay off their parents' debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bales2004&quot; /&gt; It is the most widespread form of slavery today.&lt;ref name=&quot;newint&quot; /&gt;

=== Forced labor ===
{{main|Forced labor}}

[[Forced labor]] occurs when an individual is forced to work against his or her will, under threat of violence or other punishment, with restrictions on their freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;newint&quot; /&gt; It is also used to describe all types of slavery and may also include institutions not commonly classified as slavery, such as [[serfdom]], [[conscription]] and [[penal labour|penal labor]].

=== Early history ===

Evidence of slavery predates written records, and has existed in many [[culture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slavery&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Historical survey&gt; Slave-owning societies]&quot;. ''Encyclopædia Britannica. ''&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistoric graves from about 8000 BC in Lower Egypt suggest that a Libyan people enslaved a [[Bushmen|San]]-like tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh: ''The Slave Trade'' Simon and Schuster; Rockefeller Centre; New York, New York; 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery is rare among [[hunter-gatherer]] populations, as it is a system of social stratification. Mass slavery also requires economic surpluses and a high population density to be viable. Due to these factors, the practice of slavery would have only proliferated after the invention of agriculture during the [[Neolithic Revolution]] about 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Britannica|title=Slavery|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548305/slavery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest known records slavery is treated as an established institution. The [[Code of Hammurabi]] (ca. 1760 BC), for example, prescribed death for anyone who helped a slave to escape or who sheltered a fugitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsu. edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |title=Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi|quote=e. g. Prologue, &quot;the shepherd of the oppressed and of the slaves&quot;. Code of Laws #7, &quot;If any one buy from the son or the slave of another man&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew [[Bible]] refers uncritically to slavery as an established institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slavery&quot; /&gt;

Slavery was known in almost every ancient civilization, and society, including [[Sumer]], [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient China]], the [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Assyria]], [[Bronze Age India|Ancient India]], [[Ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Islam]]ic [[Caliphate]], the [[Hebrews]] in Palestine, and the [[List of pre-Columbian cultures|pre-Columbian civilizations]] of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slavery&quot; /&gt; Such institutions included [[debt bondage|debt-slavery]], punishment for crime, the enslavement of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], [[child abandonment]], and the birth of slave children to slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Demography, Geography and the Sources of Roman Slaves, by W. V. Harris: The Journal of Roman Studies, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical Antiquity ===

[[File:Fathers of the Redemption.jpg|thumb|The work of the [[Mercedarians]] was in ransoming Christians slaves held in Muslim hands (1637).]]

Records of [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slavery in Ancient Greece]] go as far back as [[Mycenaean Greece]]. It is certain that [[Classical Athens]] had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{De

''Britannica Student Encyclopædia. ''&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Roman Republic]] expanded outward, [[Roman slavery|entire populations were enslaved]], thus creating an ample supply from all over Europe and the Mediterranean. [[Greeks]], [[Illyrians]], [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Germanic peoples|Germans]], [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], [[Thracians]], [[Gauls]], [[Jews]], [[Arab people|Arabs]], and many more were slaves used not only for labour, but also for amusement (e. g. [[gladiator]]s and [[sexual slavery|sex slaves]]). This oppression by an elite minority eventually led to [[slave rebellion|slave revolts]] (see [[Roman Servile Wars]]); the [[Third Servile War]] led by [[Spartacus]] being the most famous and severe. By the late Republican era, slavery had become a vital economic pillar in the wealth of Rome, as well as a very significant part of Roman society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dl.ket.org/latinlit/mores/slaves/ |title=Slavery in Ancient Rome |publisher=Dl.ket.org |date=|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the least, some 25% of the population of [[Ancient Rome]] was enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/slavery_01.shtml |title=Resisting Slavery in Ancient Rome |publisher=BBC News |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, slaves represented 35% or more of
[[Italy]]'s population.&lt;ref&gt;Schiavone Aldo (2000), ''The End of the Past. Ancient Rome and the Modern West'', Cambridge Mass.: Harvard University Press, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; In the city of [[Rome]] alone, under the [[Roman Empire]], there were about 400,000 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/wc1/lectures/12romanday.html The Romans at Work and Play] ''Western New England College. ''&lt;/ref&gt; During the millennium from the emergence of the Roman Empire to its eventual decline, at least 100 million people were captured or sold as slaves throughout the Mediterranean and its hinterlands.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/050704.pdf The Roman slave supply]&quot; [[Walter Scheidel]].

[[Spain in the Middle Ages|Medieval Spain]] and [[History of Portugal|Portugal]] were the scene of almost constant [[Muslim]] invasion of the predominantly [[Christian]] area.

Although the trans-Atlantic slave trade ended shortly after the American Revolution, slavery remained a central economic institution in the Southern states of the [[United States]], from where slavery expanded with the westward movement of population.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Newman, ''Transformation of American abolitionism: fighting slavery in the early Republic'' chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Peter Kolchin wrote, &quot;By breaking up existing families and forcing slaves to relocate far from everyone and everything they knew&quot; this migration &quot;replicated (if on a reduced level) many of [the] horrors&quot; of the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;Kolchin p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Ira Berlin]] called this forced migration the Second [[Middle Passage]]. Characterizing it as the &quot;central event&quot; in the life of a slave between the [[American Revolution]] and the Civil War, Berlin wrote that whether they were uprooted themselves or simply lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, &quot;the massive deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berlin pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, 500,000 slaves had grown to 4 million. As long as slavery expanded, it remained profitable and powerful and was unlikely to disappear. Although complete statistics are lacking, it is estimated that 1,000,000 slaves moved west from the [[Old South]] between 1790 and 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolchin p p. 582&quot;&gt;Berlin pp. 168–169. Kolchin p. 96. Kolchin notes that Fogel and Engerman maintained that 84% of slaves moved with their families but &quot;most other scholars assign far greater weight&amp;nbsp;... to slave sales. &quot; Ransome (p. 582) notes that Fogel and Engermann based their conclusions on the study of some counties in Maryland in the 1830s and attempt to extrapolate that as reflective of the entire South over the entire period.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the slaves were moved from [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]]. Michael Tadman, in a 1989 book ''Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in the Old South'', indicates that 60–70% of interregional migrations were the result of the sale of slaves. In 1820 a child in the Upper South had a 30% chance to be sold south by 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolchin p p. 582&quot; /&gt;

Slavery has existed, in one form or another, through the whole of recorded [[history of the world|human history]] — as have, in various periods, movements to free large or distinct groups of slaves.

The Greek [[Stoics]] advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings, and consistently critiqued slavery as against the law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcía L.

The Spanish colonization of the Americas sparked a discussion about the right to enslave native Americans. A prominent critic of [[slavery in the Spanish New World colonies]] was [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who opposed the enslavement of Native Americans, and later also of Africans in America.

One of the first protests against the enslavement of Africans came from German and Dutch [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in Pennsylvania in 1688. One of the most significant milestones in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world occurred in [[England]] in 1772, with British judge [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], whose opinion in [[Somersett's Case]] was widely taken to have held that slavery was illegal in England. This judgement also laid down the principle that slavery contracted in other jurisdictions (such as the American colonies) could not be enforced in England.&lt;ref&gt;S. M.Wise, ''Though the Heavens May Fall'', Pimlico (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1777, [[Vermont]] became the first portion of what would become the United States to abolish slavery (at the time Vermont was an independent nation). In 1794, under the Jacobins, [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] abolished slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/5913/Abolition-Movement.html Abolition Movement]. ''Online Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; There were celebrations in 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Abolition of the slave trade in the United Kingdom through the work of the British [[Anti-Slavery Society]].
[[File:Joseph Jenkins Roberts.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], born in Virginia, was the first president of [[Liberia]], which was founded in 1822 for freed American slaves.]]
[[William Wilberforce]] received much of the credit although the groundwork was an anti-slavery essay by [[Thomas Clarkson]]. Wilberforce was also urged by his close friend, Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger]], to make the issue his own, and was also given support by reformed Evangelical [[John Newton]]. The [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] was passed by the British Parliament on March 25, 1807, making the slave trade illegal throughout the [[British Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090128205546/royalnavy.mod. uk/history/battles/royal-navy-and-the-slave-trade/ Royal Navy and the Slave Trade]&quot;. The National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilberforce also campaigned for abolition of slavery in the British Empire, which he lived to see in the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. After the 1807 act abolishing the slave trade was passed, these campaigners switched to encouraging other countries to follow suit, notably France and the British colonies. In 1839, the world's oldest international human rights organization, [[Anti-Slavery International]], was formed in Britain by [[Joseph Sturge]], which campaigned to outlaw slavery in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=9462&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Anti-Slavery International] UNESCO.

''BBC – Devon – Abolition''&lt;/ref&gt; Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against &quot;the usurping King of [[Lagos]]&quot;, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS |title=The West African Sqron and slave trade |publisher=Pdavis.nl |date=|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], abolitionist pressure produced a series of small steps towards emancipation. After January 1, 1808, the importation of slaves into the United States was prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/opinion/30foner.html Foner, Eric. &quot;Forgotten step towards freedom, &quot;] ''New York Times. '' December 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but not the [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|internal slave trade]], nor involvement in the international slave trade externally. Legal slavery persisted; and those slaves already in the U. S. were [[Emancipation Proclamation|legally emancipated]] only in 1863. Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the [[Underground Railroad]]. Violence soon erupted, with the anti-slavery forces led by [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], and [[Bleeding Kansas]], involving anti-slavery and pro-slavery settlers, became a symbol for the nationwide clash over slavery. By 1860 the total number of slaves reached almost four million, and the [[American Civil War]], beginning in 1861, led to the end of slavery in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itd.nps.gov/cwss/manassas/social/introsoc.htm Social Aspects of the Civil War]. Department of the Interior National Park Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863 Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which freed slaves held in the Confederate States; the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution]] (1865) prohibited slavery throughout the country.

In the 1860s, [[David Livingstone]]'s reports of atrocities within the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa stirred up the interest of the British public, reviving the flagging abolitionist movement. The Royal Navy throughout the 1870s attempted to suppress &quot;this abominable Eastern trade&quot;, at [[Zanzibar]] in particular. In 1905, the French abolished indigenous slavery in most of [[French West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.yale.edu/agrarianstudies/colloqpapers/16peterson.pdf Slave Emancipation and the Expansion of Islam, 1905-1914]&quot;. p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which declared freedom from slavery is an internationally recognized [[human rights|human right]]. Article 4 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states:
{{quote|No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/modern/law.shtml|title=The law against slavery|work=Religion &amp; Ethics – Ethical issues|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=October 05, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Groups such as the [[American Anti-Slavery Group]], [[Anti-Slavery International]], [[Free the Slaves]], the [[Anti-Slavery Society]], and the Norwegian Anti-Slavery Society continue to campaign to rid the world of slavery.

Economists have attempted to model the circumstances under which slavery (and variants such as [[serfdom]]) appear and disappear. One observation is that slavery becomes more desirable for landowners where land is abundant but labour is scarce, such that rent is depressed and paid workers can demand high wages. If the opposite holds true, then it becomes more costly for landowners to have guards for the slaves than to employ paid workers who can only demand low wages due to the amount of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|coauthors=Robert Paul Thomas|title=The Rise and Fall of the Manorial System: A Theoretical Model|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=December 1971|volume=31|issue=4|pages=777–803|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2117209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, first slavery and then serfdom gradually decreased in Europe as the population grew, but were reintroduced in the Americas and in Russia as large areas of new land with few people became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Domar|first=Evsey D.|title=The Causes of Slavery or Serfdom: A Hypothesis|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=March 1970|volume=30|issue=1|pages=18–32|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2116721}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his books, ''[[Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery|Time on the Cross]]'' and ''Without Consent or Contract: the Rise and Fall of American Slavery, '' [[Robert Fogel]] maintains that slavery was in fact a profitable method of production, especially on bigger plantations growing cotton that fetched high prices in the world market. It gave whites in the South higher average incomes than those in the North, but most of the money was spent on buying slaves and plantations.

[[File:Juliao14.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Slave being whipped in [[Brazil]], during the heyday of gold exploration in [[Minas Gerais]] (1770).]]

Slavery is more common when the labour done is relatively simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large scale growing of a single crop. It is much more difficult and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a [[gang system]] of labor to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labor that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made his or her performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lagerlöf, Nils-Petter |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/372.html |title=Slavery and other property rights |publisher=Ideas. repec.org |date=November 12, 2006 |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics since the 18th century have argued that slavery tends to retard technological advancement, since the focus is on increasing the number of slaves doing simple tasks rather than upgrading the efficiency of labour. Because of this, theoretical knowledge and learning in Greece—and later in Rome—was not applied to ease physical labour or improve manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=223811|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423152702/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=223811|archivedate=April 23, 2008 |title=Technology |publisher=History.com |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]] made the argument that free labor was economically better than slave labor, and argued further that slavery in Europe ended during the Middle Ages, and then only after both the church and state were separate, independent and strong institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John R. McKivigan|author2=Mitchell Snay|title=Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e-unV4v5puYC&amp;pg=PA68|accessdate=May 31, 2012|date=November 1, 1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2076-2|pages=68–}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is nearly impossible to end slavery in a free, democratic and republican forms of governments since many of its legislators or political figures were slave owners, and would not punish themselves, and that slaves would be better able to gain their freedom when there was centralized government, or a central authority like a king or the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles L. Griswold|title=Adam Smith and the Virtues of Enlightenment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WRcU_GJAc9gC&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=May 31, 2012|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62891-4|pages=198–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments appear later in the works of [[Auguste Comte]], especially when it comes to Adam Smith's belief in the [[separation of powers]] or what Comte called the &quot;separation of the spiritual and the temporal&quot; during the Middle Ages and the end of slavery, and Smith's criticism of masters, past and present. As Smith stated in the Lectures on Jurisprudence, &quot;The great power of the clergy thus concurring with that of the king set the slaves at liberty. But it was absolutely necessary both that the authority of the king and of the clergy should be great. Where ever any one of these was wanting, slavery still continues. &quot;

The weighted average global sales price of a slave is calculated to be approximately $340, with a high of $1,895 for the average trafficked sex slave, and a low of $40 to $50 for debt bondage slaves in part of Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dhaliwal&quot; /&gt;
Worldwide slavery is a criminal offense but slave owners can get very high returns for their risk.&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;slavery1&quot;/&lt;/ref&gt; According to researcher [[Siddharth Kara]], the profits generated worldwide by all forms of slavery in 2007 were $91.2 billion. That is second only to drug trafficking in terms of global criminal enterprises. The weighted average annual profits generated by a slave in 2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labor and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dhaliwal&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kara |first= Siddharth|title=Sex Trafficking – Inside the Business of Modern Slavery |publisher= Columbia University Press|date=October 2008|isbn=978-0-231-13960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately forty percent of all slave profits each year are generated by trafficked sex slaves, representing slightly more than 4 percent of the world's 29 million slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dhaliwal&quot; /&gt;

[[Robert E. Wright]] has developed a [[Conceptual model|model]] that helps to predict when [[firms]] (individuals, companies) will be more likely to use slaves rather than wage workers, [[indentured servants]], family members, or other types of [[laborers]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright, Fubarnomics (Buffalo, N. Y.: Prometheus, 2010), 83-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apologies ==

&lt;!-- The file name has a letter space between &quot;Zanzibar&quot; &amp; &quot;. jpg&quot; – don't &quot;fix&quot; it! --&gt;[[File:Monument to slaves in Zanzibar .jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Monument to slaves in [[Zanzibar]]]]
On May 21, 2001, the [[National Assembly of France]] passed the [[Christiane Taubira|Taubira]] law, recognizing slavery as a [[crime against humanity]]. Apologies on behalf of African nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in Africa even before the first Europeans arrived and the [[Atlantic slave trade]] was performed with a high degree of involvement of several African societies. The black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local African societies and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Adu Boahen, Topics In West African History p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, as already mentioned in this article, slavery persists in several areas of [[West Africa]] until the present day.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is adequate evidence citing case after case of African control of segments of the trade. Several African nations such as the Calabar and other southern parts of Nigeria had economies depended solely on the trade. African peoples such as the Imbangala of Angola and the Nyamwezi of Tanzania would serve as middlemen or roving bands warring with other African nations to capture Africans for Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africawithin.com/kwaku/afrikan_involvement.htm |title=Afrikan Involvement In Atlantic Slave Trade, By Kwaku Person-Lynn, Ph.

Several historians have made important contributions to the global understanding of the African side of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. By arguing that African merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves, many historians argue for African agency and ultimately a shared responsibility for the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=13661080113274 João C.

The issue of an apology is linked to [[reparations for slavery]] and is still being pursued by a number of entities across the world. For example, the Jamaican Reparations Movement approved its declaration and action Plan.

In September 2006, it was reported that the UK government might issue a &quot;statement of regret&quot; over slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5369858.stm What the papers say], ''BBC News'', September 22, 2006 &lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a &quot;public statement of sorrow&quot; from [[Tony Blair]] on November 27, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6185176.stm Blair 'sorrow' over slave trade], ''BBC News'', November 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and a formal apology on March 14, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6451793.stm Blair 'sorry' for UK slavery role] BBC. Retrieved February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2007 the [[Virginia|state of Virginia]] resolved to 'profoundly regret' and apologize for its role in the institution of slavery. Unique and the first of its kind in the U. S., the apology was unanimously passed in both Houses as Virginia approached the 400th anniversary of the founding of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], where the first slaves were imported into North America in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6394981.stm |title=Virginia 'sorry' for slavery role |publisher=BBC News |date=February 25, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liverpool]], which was a large slave trading port, apologized in 1999. On August 24, 2007, Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] of [[London]], United Kingdom apologized publicly for Britain's role in colonial [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. &quot;You can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the wealth they created from slavery, &quot; he said pointing towards the financial district. He claimed that London was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. Specifically, London outfitted, financed, and insured many of the ships, which helped fund the building of London's docks. [[Jesse Jackson]] praised Livingstone, and added that reparations should be made, one of his common arguments.&lt;ref name=&quot;jump&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=477337&amp;in_page_id=1770 |title=Livingstone breaks down in tears at slave trade memorial |publisher=Daily Mail|date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2008, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a resolution apologizing for American slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93059465 Congress Apologizes for Slavery, Jim Crow] NPR. Retrieved October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the [[US Senate]] passed a resolution apologizing to African-Americans for the &quot;fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5580749/Barack-Obama-praises-Senate-slavery-apology.html Barack Obama praises Senate slavery apology]&quot;. Telegraph. June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reparations ===
{{Main|Reparations for slavery}}

There have been movements to achieve reparations for those formerly held as slaves, or sometimes their descendants. Claims for reparations for being held in slavery are handled as a [[Private law|civil law]] matter in almost every country. This is often decried as a serious problem, since former slaves' relative lack of money means they often have limited access to a potentially expensive and futile [[Service of process|legal process]]. Mandatory systems of fines and reparations paid to an as yet undetermined group of claimants from fines, paid by unspecified parties, and collected by authorities have been proposed by advocates to alleviate this &quot;civil court problem. &quot; Since in almost all cases there are no living ex-slaves or living ex-slave owners these movements have gained little traction. In nearly all cases the [[judiciary|judicial system]] has ruled that the [[statute of limitations]] on these possible claims has long since expired.

The word ''slavery'' is often used as a pejorative to describe any activity in which one is coerced into performing.

* Many argue that [[Conscription|military drafts]] and other forms of coerced government labour constitute state-operated slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2346 An Idea Not Worth Drafting: Conscription is Slavery] by Peter Krembs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidkopel.com/NRO/2001/Nationalized-Slavery.htm Nationalized Slavery; A policy Italy should dump] by [[Dave Kopel]] refers to both the military and [[national service]] requirements of Italy as slavery.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some [[socialists]], including [[Noam Chomsky]], view [[Wage slavery|total and immediate wage dependence]] as a form of slavery.
* Some [[libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] view government [[tax]]ation as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;E. g., {{cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/story/410|last=Machan|first=Tibor R.|title=Tax Slavery|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|date=April 13, 2000|accessdate=October 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some proponents of [[animal rights]] apply the term ''slavery'' to the condition of some or all human-owned animals, arguing that their status is comparable to that of human slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSpiegel&quot;&gt;Spiegel, Marjorie.
