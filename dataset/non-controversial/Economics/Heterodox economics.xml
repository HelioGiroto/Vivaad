'''Heterodox economics''' refers to methodologies or [[schools of economic thought]] that are considered outside of &quot;[[mainstream economics]],&quot; and often represented by expositors as contrasting with or going beyond [[neoclassical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred E. Foldvary, ed., 1996. ''Beyond Neoclassical Economics: Heterodox Approaches to Economic Theory'', Edward Elgar. Description and contents [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/beyond-neoclassical-economics-fred-e-foldvary/1001678359?ean=9781858983950#product-commentaries-1 B&amp;N.com links].&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream economists sometimes assert that it has little or no influence on the vast majority of academic economists in the English speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;Among these economists, [[Robert M. Solow]] names [[Austrian economics|Austrian]], [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]], [[Marxist economics|Marxist]], and [[neo-Ricardianism|neo-Ricardian]] schools as on &quot;dissenting fringes of academic economics&quot;. Solow continued that &quot;In economics, nevertheless, there is usually a definite consensus — there is one now.&quot; Further:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was an important and influential thinker, and Marxism has been a doctrine with intellectual and practical influence. The fact is, however, that most serious English-speaking economists regard Marxist economics as an irrelevant dead end.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{harv|Solow|1988}}&lt;p&gt;[[George Stigler]] similarly noted the professional marginality of the  &quot;[[neo-Ricardianism|neo-Ricardian]]&quot; economists (who follow [[Piero Sraffa]]):
&quot;economists working in the Marxian-Sraffian tradition represent a small minority of modern economists, and ... their writings have virtually no impact upon the professional work of most economists in major English-language universities.&quot; {{harv|Stigler|1988|p=1733}}
&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Mainstream economics&quot; may be called  ''[[Orthodoxy#Critical uses|orthodox]]'' or  ''conventional'' economics by its critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry&quot;&gt;C. Barry, 1998. ''Political-economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Praeger.{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Heterodox economics&quot; is an umbrella term used to cover various approaches, schools, or traditions. These include [[Socialist economics|socialist]], [[Marxian economics|Marxian]],  [[institutional economics|institutional]], [[evolutionary economics|evolutionary]], [[Austrian School|Austrian]], [[Feminist economics|feminist]],&lt;ref&gt;In the order listed at [[JEL classification codes#History of economic thought, methodology, and heterodox approaches JEL: B Subcategories]],  JEL: B5 - Current Heterodox Approaches.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social economics|social]], [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]],&lt;ref name= &quot;Lee2008&quot;&gt;Frederic S.

A recent review documents several prominent groups of heterodox economists since at least the 1990s as working together with a resulting increase in coherence across different constituents.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lee2008&quot;/&gt; Along these lines, the International Confederation of Associations for Pluralism in Economics (ICAPE) does not define &quot;heterodox economics&quot; and has avoided defining its scope. ICAPE defines its mission as &quot;promoting [[pluralism in economics]].&quot;

In defining a common ground in the &quot;critical commentary,&quot;  one writer described fellow heterodox economists as trying  to do three things: (1) identify shared ideas that generate a pattern of heterodox critique across topics and chapters of introductory macro texts; (2) give special attention to ideas that link methodological differences to policy differences; and (3) characterize the common ground in ways that permit distinct paradigms to develop common differences with textbook economics in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Steve |last1=Cohn |year=2003 |title=Common Ground Critiques of Neoclassical Principles Texts |journal=Post-Autistic Economics Review |issue=18, article 3 |url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/heterodoxeconomics/Cohn18.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study suggests four key factors as important to the study of economics by self-identified heterodox economists: history, natural systems, uncertainty, and power.&lt;ref&gt;Mearman, Andrew (2011). &quot;Who Do Heterodox Economists Think They Are?&quot; ''[[American Journal of Economics and Sociology]],'' 70(2): [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1536-7150.2011.00774.x/full 480–510].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A number of heterodox schools of economic thought challenged the dominance of [[neoclassical economics]] after the neoclassical revolution of the 1870s. In addition to socialist critics of capitalism, heterodox schools in this period included advocates of various forms of [[mercantilism]], such as the [[American School (economics)|American School]] dissenters from neoclassical [[methodology]] such as the [[Historical school of economics|historical school]], and advocates of unorthodox monetary theories such as [[Social credit]]. Other heterodox schools active before and during the [[Great Depression]] included [[Technocracy]] and [[Georgism]].

Physical scientists and biologists were the first individuals to use energy flows to explain social and economic development. [[Joseph Henry]], an American physicist and first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, remarked that the &quot;fundamental principle of political economy is that the physical labor of man can only be ameliorated by… the transformation of matter from a crude state to a artificial condition...by expending what is called power or energy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cutler J. Cleveland, [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biophysical_economics &quot;Biophysical economics&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Earth'', Last updated: September 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Zencey, 2009. &quot;Mr. Soddy’s Ecological Economy&quot;,] ''The New York Times'', April 12, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion p. WK 9.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise, and absorption into the mainstream of [[Keynesian economics]], which appeared to provide a more coherent policy response to [[unemployment]] than unorthodox monetary or trade policies contributed to the decline of interest in these schools.

After 1945, the [[neoclassical synthesis]] of Keynesian and neoclassical economics resulted in a clearly defined mainstream position based on a division of the field into microeconomics (generally neoclassical but with a newly developed theory of [[market failure]]) and macroeconomics (divided between Keynesian and monetarist views on such issues as the role of monetary policy).  Austrians and post-Keynesians who dissented from this synthesis emerged as clearly defined heterodox schools. In addition, the Marxist and institutionalist schools remained active.

Up to 1980 the most notable themes of heterodox economics in its various forms included:
#rejection of the [[Methodological individualism|atomistic individual conception]] in favor of a socially embedded individual conception;
#emphasis on time as an irreversible historical process;
#reasoning in terms of mutual influences between individuals and social structures.

From approximately 1980 [[mainstream economics]] has been significantly influenced by a number of new research programs, including  [[behavioral economics]], [[complexity economics]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[experimental economics]], and [[neuroeconomics]]. As a consequence, some heterodox economists, such as John B. Davis, proposed that the definition of heterodox economics has to be adapted to this new, more complex reality:&lt;ref name=DAVIS&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John B. |last1=Davis |year=2006 |title=The Nature of Heterodox Economics |journal=Post-Autistic Economics Review |issue=40 |pages=23–30 |url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue40/Davis40.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::...heterodox economics post-1980 is a complex structure, being composed out of two broadly different kinds of heterodox work, each internally differentiated with a number of research programs having different historical origins and orientations: the traditional left heterodoxy familiar to most and the 'new heterodoxy' resulting from other science imports.&lt;ref name=DAVIS/&gt;

==Rejection of neoclassical economics==
There is no single &quot;heterodox economic theory&quot;; there are many different &quot;heterodox theories&quot; in existence. What they all share, however, is a rejection of the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical orthodoxy]] as representing the appropriate tool for understanding the workings of economic and social life.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The reasons for this rejection may vary. Some of the elements commonly found in heterodox critiques are listed below.

===Criticism of the neoclassical model of individual behavior===

One of the most broadly accepted principles of [[neoclassical economics]] is the assumption of the &quot;rationality of economic agents&quot;. Indeed, for a number of economists, the notion of rational maximizing behavior is taken to be synonymous with economic behavior (Becker 1976, Hirshleifer 1984). When some economists' studies do not embrace the rationality assumption, they are seen as placing the analyses outside the boundaries of the [[Neoclassical economics]] discipline (Landsberg 1989, 596). [[Neoclassical economics]] begins with the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' assumptions that agents are [[rationality|rational]] and that they seek to maximize their [[Methodological individualism|individual]] [[utility]] (or [[Profit (economics)|profits]]) subject to environmental constraints. These assumptions provide the backbone for [[rational choice theory]].

Many heterodox schools are critical of the [[homo economicus]] model of human behavior used in standard neoclassical model. A typical version of the critique is that of Satya Gabriel&lt;ref name=HETTHEORY&gt;Satya J. Gabriel 2003. &quot;Introduction to Heterodox Economic Theory.&quot; (blog), June 4, [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/sgabriel/heterodox_defined.htm] Satya J. Gabriel is a Professor of [[Economics]] at [[Mount Holyoke College]]}{{self-published inline|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Neoclassical economic theory is grounded in a particular conception of human psychology, agency or decision-making.  It is assumed that all human beings make economic decisions so as to maximize pleasure or utility.  Some heterodox theories reject this basic assumption of neoclassical theory, arguing for alternative understandings of how economic decisions are made and/or how human psychology works.  It is possible to accept the notion that humans are pleasure seeking machines, yet reject the idea that economic decisions are governed by such pleasure seeking.  Human beings may, for example, be unable to make choices consistent with pleasure maximization due to social constraints and/or coercion.  Humans may also be unable to correctly assess the choice points that are most likely to lead to maximum pleasure, even if they are unconstrained (except in budgetary terms) in making such choices.  And it is also possible that the notion of pleasure seeking is itself a meaningless assumption because it is either impossible to test or too general to refute.  Economic theories that reject the basic assumption of economic decisions as the outcome of pleasure maximization are heterodox.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shiozawa emphasizes that economic agents act in a complex world and therefore impossible for them to attain maximal utility point. They instead behaves as if there are a repertories of many ready made rules, one of which they chose according to relvant situation.&lt;ref&gt;Shiozawa, Y. 2004 Evolutinary Economics in the 21st Century: A Manifest, ''Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review'', '''1'''(1): 5-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the neoclassical model of market equilibrium===
In microeconomic theory, cost-minimization by consumers and by firms implies the existence of [[supply and demand]] correspondences for which [[market clearing]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] prices exist, if there are large numbers of consumers and producers. Under convexity assumptions or under some marginal-cost pricing rules, each equilibrium will be [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]]: In large economies, non-convexity also leads to quasi-equilibria that are nearly efficient.

However, the concept of market equilibrium has been criticized by Austrians, post-Keynesians and others, who object to applications of microeconomic theory to real-world markets, when such markets are not usefully approximated by microeconomic models. Heterodox economists assert that micro-economic models rarely capture reality.

Mainstream microeconomics may be defined in terms of optimization and equilibrium, following the approaches of [[Paul Samuelson]] and [[Hal Varian]]. On the other hand, heterodox economics may be labeled as falling into the [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] of institutions, history, and social structure.&lt;ref name=LAWSON&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawson |pages=483–505 |first1=T. |volume=30 |year=2005 |title=The nature of heterodox economics |journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics |doi=10.1093/cje/bei093 |url=http://www.bresserpereira.org.br/Terceiros/05.5.Heterodox_Economics.pdf |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DOW&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10427710050025367 |first1=S. C. |last1=Dow |year=2000 |title=Prospects for the Progress in Heterodox Economics |journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=157–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most recent developments==
Over the past two decades, the intellectual agendas of heterodox economists have taken a decidedly [[Epistemological pluralism|pluralist]] turn. Leading heterodox thinkers have moved beyond the established paradigms of Austrian, Feminist, Institutional-Evolutionary, Marxian, Post Keynesian, Radical, Social, and Sraffian economics—opening up new lines of analysis, criticism, and dialogue among dissenting schools of thought. This cross-fertilization of ideas is creating a new generation of scholarship in which novel combinations of heterodox ideas are being brought to bear on important contemporary and historical problems, such as socially-grounded reconstructions of the individual in economic theory; the goals and tools of economic measurement and professional ethics; the complexities of policymaking in today's global political economy; and innovative connections among formerly separate theoretical traditions (Marxian, Austrian, feminist, ecological, Sraffian, institutionalist, and post-Keynesian) (for a review of post-Keynesian economics, see Lavoie (1992); Rochon (1999)).

[[David Colander]], an advocate of [[complexity economics]], argues that the ideas of heterodox economists are now being discussed in the mainstream without mention of the heterodox economists, because the tools to analyze institutions, uncertainty, and other factors have now been developed by the mainstream. He suggests that heterodox economists should embrace rigorous mathematics and attempt to work from within the mainstream, rather than treating it as an enemy.&lt;ref&gt;David Colander, 2007. [http://ideas.repec.org/p/mdl/mdlpap/0724.html Pluralism and Heterodox Economics: Suggestions for an “Inside the Mainstream” Heterodoxy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy economics]] relating to [[thermoeconomics]], is a broad [[science|scientific]] subject area which includes topics related to [[energy supply|supply]] and [[energy demand|use]] of [[energy]]. Thermoeconomists argue that economic systems always involve [[matter]], [[energy]], [[entropy]], and [[information]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baumarter&quot; &gt;Stefan Baumgarter, 2004. [http://www.eco.uni-heidelberg.de/ng-oeoe/research/papers/Baumgaertner%202004%20ModEE.pdf Thermodynamic Models], Modeling in Ecological Economics (Ch. 18)&lt;/ref&gt; Thermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of [[energy]] in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]] but in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corning |first1=Peter A. |last2=Kline |first2=Stephen J. |title=Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: 'Thermoeconomics' and 'Control information' |journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science |volume=15 |pages=453–482 |year=1998 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1743(199811/12)15:6&lt;453::AID-SRES201&gt;3.0.CO;2-U |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Corning. 2002. “[http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html Thermoeconomics – Beyond the Second Law]” – source: www.complexsystems.org&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermoeconomics are often discussed in the field of [[ecological economics]], which itself is related to the fields of [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]].
