In public policy, a '''living wage''' or '''subsistence wage''' is the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet basic needs (for an extended period of time or for a lifetime). These needs include shelter (housing) and other incidentals such as clothing and nutrition. In some nations such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]], this standard generally means that a person working forty hours a week, with no additional income, should be able to afford a specified quality or quantity of housing, [[food]], [[utilities]], [[transport]], [[health care]], and [[recreation]], although in many cases [[child care]], [[education]], saving for [[retirement]], and less commonly [[legal fees]] and [[insurance]] may cost a family more than food, utilities, transport, or health care. In addition to this definition, living wage activists further define &quot;living wage&quot; as the wage equivalent to the [[poverty line]] for a family of four. 

The living wage differs from the [[minimum wage]] in that the latter is set by law and can fail to meet the requirements of a living wage - or is so low that borrowing or application for top-up benefits is necessary. It differs somewhat from [[basic needs]] in that the basic needs model usually measures a minimum level of consumption, without regard for the source of the income. 

Living wage is defined by the wage that can meet the basic needs to maintain a safe, decent standard of living within the community and have the ability to save for future needs and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/magazine/15wage.html?pagewanted=all[[America (magazine)|America]]|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The particular amount that must be earned per hour to meet these needs varies depending on location and family circumstances. Currently the minimum wage across the US is $7.25, which in most areas is well below living wage due to high [[rent]] or [[house price]]s in cities and [[automobile dependency|automobile dependent]] arrangements of grocery stores, jobs, housing, and services in suburbs and outlying areas, causing combined housing and transportation cost to be high both in the city and in the outlying areas.  In 1990 the first living wage campaigns were launched by community initiatives in the US addressing increasing poverty faced by workers and their families. They argued that employee, employer, and the community win with a living wage. Employees would be more willing to work, helping the employer reduce worker turnover ratio and it would help the community when the citizens have enough to have a decent life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vibrantcalgary.com/uploads/pdfs/VCC_Living_Wage_Fact_Sheet_August_2009.pdf[[America (magazine)|America]]|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Poverty threshold]] is the income necessary for a household to be able to consume a low cost, nutritious diet and purchase non-food necessities in a given country. Poverty lines and living wages are measured differently.  Poverty lines are measured by [[Household|household unit]]s  and living wage is based on individual workers.

A related concept is that of a [[family wage]] – one sufficient to not only support oneself, but also to raise a family.

== Catholic Social Teaching ==

In 1891, [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued a papal bull entitled ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'', which is considered the Catholic Church's first expression of a view supportive of a living wage.  The Church recognized that wages should be sufficient to support a family.  This position has been widely supported by the church since that time, and has been reaffirmed by the papacy on multiple occasions, such as by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1931 ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'' and again in 1961, by [[Pope John XXIII]] writing in the encyclical ''[[Mater et Magistra]].'' More recently, [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote:
* ''&quot;Hence in every case a just wage is the concrete means of verifying the whole socioeconomic system and, in any case, of checking that it is functioning justly&quot;'' - ''[[Laborem Exercens]]'', 1981 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=4928|title=The Living Wage and Catholic Social Teaching|last=William P.|first=Quigley|date=28 August 2006|work=[[America (magazine)|America]]|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporters ==

Activists argue that a wage is more than just compensation for labor.  It is a means of securing a living and it leads to public policies that address both the level of the wage and its decency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clary, B. 2009&quot;&gt;Clary, B. (2009). Smith and Living Wages: Arguments in Support of a Mandated Living Wage. American Journal Of Economics &amp; Sociology, 68(5), 1063-1084. {{doi|10.1111/j.1536-7150.2009.00653.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


In his [[Wealth of Nations]], Adam Smith recognized that rising real wages lead to the &quot;improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of people&quot; and are therefore an advantage to society.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;([1776] 1976). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth and a system of liberty were the means by which the laboring poor were able to secure high wages and an acceptable standard of living. Rising real wages are secured by growth through increasing productivity against stable price levels, i.e. prices not affected by inflation. A system of liberty, secured through political institutions whereupon even the &quot;lower ranks of people&quot; could to secure the opportunity for higher wages and an acceptable standard of living. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*&quot;Servants, labourers and workmen of different kinds, make up the far greater part of every great political society. But what improves the circumstances of the greater part can never be regarded as an inconvenience to the whole. No society can surely be ﬂourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, cloathed and lodged.&quot;
::::Smith WN, I .viii.36  &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to living wage advocates Smith advocated that labor should receive an equitable share of what labor produces; According to Smith, this equitable share amounts to more than subsistence.  Smith equated the interests of labor and the interests of land with overarching societal interests. He reasoned that as wages and rents rise, as a result of higher productivity, societal growth will occur thus increasing the quality of life for the greater part of its members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clary, B. 2009&quot;/&gt;

Activists argue that the greater good for society is achieved through justice.  They argue that government should in turn attempt to align the interests of those pursuing profits with the interests of the labor in order to produce societal advantages for the majority of society.  Smith argued that higher productivity and overall growth led to higher wages that in turn led to greater benefits for society.  Based on his writings, one can infer that Smith would support a living wage commensurate with the overall growth of the economy. Political institutions can create a system of liberty for individuals to ensure opportunity for higher wages through higher production and thus stable growth for society.

Today, one of major supporting groups for the Living Wage is the Universal Living Wage group.  The group currently has over 1,500 followers and continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;http://universallivingwage.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
The national and international living wage movements are supported by many [[trade union|labor (trade) unions]] and community action groups such as [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]].

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], the 1907 [[Harvester Judgment]] ruled that an employer was obliged to pay his employees a wage that guaranteed them a standard of living which was reasonable for &quot;a human being in a civilised community&quot; to live in &quot;frugal comfort estimated by current... standards,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/law/harvester.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of the employer's capacity to pay. Justice Higgins established a wage of 7/- ([[Coins of the Australian pound#Australian .C2.A3sd|7 shillings]]) per day or 42/- per week as a 'fair and reasonable' minimum wage for unskilled workers. The judgment was later overturned but remains influential.  From the Harvester Judgement arose the Australian industrial concept of the '''basic wage'''.  For most skilled workers, in addition to the Basic Wage they received a [[margin (Australian industrial relations)|margin]] on top of the basic wage, in proportion to a court or commission's judgement of a group of worker's skill levels.  In 1913, to compensate for the rising cost of living, the basic wage was increased to 8/- per day, the first increase since the minimum was set. The first [[Retail Price Index]] in Australia was published late in 1912, the [[A Series Index]]. From 1934, the basic wage was [[indexation (Australian industrial relations)|indexed]] against the [[C Series Index]] of household prices.  The concept of a basic wage was repeatedly challenged by employer groups through the [[Basic wage cases]] and [[Metal Trades Award cases]] where the employers argued that the basic wage and margin ought to be replaced by a &quot;total wage&quot;.  The basic wage system remained in place in Australia until 1967.  It was also adopted by some state tribunals and was in use in some states during the 1980s.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the state of [[Maryland]] and several municipalities and local governments have enacted ordinances which set a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum that requires all jobs to meet the living wage for that region. This usually works out to be $3 to $7 above the federal minimum wage. However, [[San Francisco, California]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] have notably passed very wide-reaching living wage ordinances.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} U.S. cities with living wage laws include [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Albuquerque]] in [[New Mexico]]; [[San Francisco]], [[California]]; and [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072700197.html|title=Chicago Council Passes 'Living Wage' Act|author=Bellandi, Deanna|accessdate=2007-10-12|date=2006-07-27|publisher=The Washington Post Company|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Chicago, Illinois]] also passed a [[2006_Chicago_Big_Box_Ordinance|living wage ordinance]] in 2006, but it was vetoed by Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/employment/2006-09-11-chicago-wage_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Mayor vetoes Chicago's 'living wage' ordinance aimed at big retailers | date=September 11, 2006 | accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living wage laws typically cover only businesses that receive state assistance or have contracts with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Living Wage: Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/issueguides_livingwage_livingwagefaq |format=factsheet |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effort began in 1994 when an alliance between a labor union and religious leaders in [[Baltimore]] launched a successful campaign requiring city service contractors to pay a living wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;The National Movement.&quot; The Living Wage Resource Center. |url=http://livingwagecampaign.org |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to this effort, community advocates have won similar ordinances in cities such as [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], San Francisco, and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. In 2007, there were at least 140 living wage ordinances in cities throughout the United States and more than 100 living wage campaigns underway in cities, counties, states, and college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Living Wage Wins |url=http://www.acorn.org |format=news release |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although these ordinances are recent, a number of studies have attempted to measure the impact of these policies on wages and employment. Researchers have had difficulty measuring the impact of this policies because it is difficult to isolate a control group for comparison. A notable study defined the control group as the subset of cities that attempted to pass a living wage law but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Adams and David Neumark, &quot; The Effects of Living Wage Laws: Evidence from Failed and Derailed Living Wage Campaigns, &quot; ''Journal of Urban Economics'' 58( September 2005): 177-202.&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison indicates that living wages raise the average wage level in cities, however, it reduces the likelihood of employment for individuals in the bottom percentile of wage distribution.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], many campaigning organisations have responded to the low level of the National Minimum Wage by asserting the need for it to be increased to a level more comparable to a living wage. For instance, the Mayor of London's office hosts a Living Wage Unit which monitors the level needed for a living wage in London (which has considerably higher living costs than the rest of the UK). Other organisations with an interest in living wage issues include the Living Wage Campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Living Wage Campaign |url=http://www.livingwage.org.uk/index.html |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church Action on Poverty &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Church Action on Poverty |url=http://www.church-poverty.org.uk/campaigns/LivingWage/ |accessdate=2008-06-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Scottish Low Pay Unit. [[The Guardian]] newspaper columnist [[Polly Toynbee]] is also a major supporter of the campaign for a living wage. The charity London Citizens is campaigning for a living wage to be implemented across [[London]]. The activist group Bloomsbury Fightback! are campaigning for a living wage to be implemented across the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://bloomsburyfightback.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/no-poverty-wages-write-to-the-vc-of-the-university-of-london], http://bloomsburyfightback.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/no-poverty-wages-write-to-the-vc-of-the-university-of-london.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader, [[Ed Miliband]] actively supports the living wage saying that the living wage 'can make Britain both a fairer and more prosperous place'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Living Wage Campaign |url=http://livingwage.edmiliband.org |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party has implemented the living wage in some [[local councils]] which it controls, such as in [[Birmingham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-18392068 | work=BBC News | title=Birmingham City Council plans to introduce 'living wage' | date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cardiff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18694130 | work=BBC News | title=Cardiff council low paid get £1,500 'living wage' rise | date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; councils.

==Impact==
Research shows that minimum wage laws and living wage legislation impact poverty differently: evidence demonstrates that living wage legislation reduces poverty. &lt;ref name&gt;Clain, S. (2008). How Living Wage Legislation Affects U.S. Poverty Rates. Journal Of Labor Research, 29(3), 205-218. {{doi|10.1007/s12122-007-9028-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The parties impacted by minimum wage laws and living wage laws differ as  living wage legislation generally applies to a more limited sector of the population. It is estimated that workers who qualify for the living wage legislation are currently between 1-2% of the bottom quartile of wage distribution. &lt;ref name&gt;Clain, S. (2008). How Living Wage Legislation Affects U.S. Poverty Rates. Journal Of Labor Research, 29(3), 205-218. {{doi|10.1007/s12122-007-9028-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One must consider that the impact of living wage laws depends heavily on the degree to which these ordinances are enforced. 

&quot;There is evidence that living wage ordinances modestly reduce the poverty rates in locations in which these ordinances are enacted.However, there is no evidence that state minimum wage laws do so.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Neumark D, Adams S (2003a) Do living wage ordinances reduce urban poverty? J Hum Resour 38:490–521 (Summer)&lt;/ref&gt; With minimum wage laws, the increased costs are passed to employers who in turn charge consumers higher prices if possible. Faced with higher prices, consumers purchase fewer goods thus leading to a redistribution among low wage workers. Those impacted by living wage legislation are typically low wage employees who are selling services to the local governments.

==Living Wage Estimates==
As of 2003, there are 122 living wage ordinances in American cities and an additional 75 under discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anker, R. 2006&quot;&gt;Anker, R. (2006). Living wages around the world: A new methodology and internationally comparable estimates.International Labour Review, 145(4), 308-338.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 23 of the [[United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that &quot; Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and for his family an existence worthy of human dignity.&quot; In addition to legislative acts,  many corporations have adopted voluntary codes of conduct. The [[Sullivan Principles]] in South Africa an example of a voluntary code of conduct which state that firms should compensate workers to at least cover their basic needs.

==Living Wage Social Movements==
===New York City Living Wage===
The proposed law will inform taxpayer of where their investment dollars go and will hold developers to more stringent employment standards. The proposed act will require developers who receive substantial tax-payer funded subsidies to pay employees a minimum living wage. The law is designed to raise quality of life and stimulate local economy.  Specifically the proposed act will guarantee that workers in large developmental projects  will receive a wage of at least $10.00 an hour. The living wage will get indexed so that it keeps up with cost of living increases. Furthermore the act will require that employees who do not receive health insurance from their employer will receive an additional $1.50 an hour to subsidize their healthcare expenses. Workers employed at a subsidized development will also be entitled to the living wage guarantee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Folbre&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/a-new-york-city-living-wage/|title=A New York City ‘Living Wage’? A New York City ‘Living Wage’? A New York City ‘Living Wage’?|last=Folbre|first=Nancy|date=23 May 2011|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many city officials have opposed living wage requirements because they believe that they restrict business climate thus making cities less appealing to potential industries. Logistically cities must hire employees to administer the ordinance.  Conversely  advocates for the legislation have acknowledged that when wages aren’t sufficient, low-wage workers are often forced to rely on [[public assistance]] in the form of [[food stamps]] or [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Folbre&quot; /&gt;

James Parrott of the [[Fiscal Policy Institute]] testified during a May 2011 New York City Council meeting that real wages for low-wage workers in the city have declined substantially over the last 20 years, despite dramatic increases in average education levels. A [http://www.fiscalpolicy.org/TopTenReasonsALivingWageMakesSenseForNYC_20110505.pdf report] by  the Fiscal Policy Institute indicated that business tax subsidies have grown two and a half times faster than overall New York City tax collections and asks why these public resources are invested in poverty-level jobs. Mr. Parrott testified that [[income inequality]] in New York City exceeds that of other large cities, with the highest-earning 1 percent receiving 44 percent of all income.

===The Harvard Living Wage Campaign===

[[Harvard University]] students began organizing a campaign to combat the issue of low living wages for Harvard workers beginning in 1998. After failed attempts to get a meeting with Harvard president [[Neil Rudenstine]], The Living Wage Campaign began to take action. As the movement gained momentum, The Living Wage Campaign held rallies with the support of students, alumni, faculty, staff, community members and organizations. Most importantly, the rallies gained the support of the Harvard workers, strengthening the campaign's demands for a higher wage. After various measures trying to provoke change among the administration, the movement took its most drastic measure. Approximately fifty students occupied the office of the president and university administrators in 2001 for a three week sit-in. While students were in the office of the president, supporters would sleep outside the building to show solidarity. At the end of the sit-in, dining hall workers were able to agree on a contract to raise the pay of workers. After the sit-in, The Living Wage Campaign sparked unions, contract and service workers to begin negotiating for fair wages.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Brief History of the Living Wage Debate at Harvard.&quot; The Harvard Living Wage Campaign. http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~pslm/livingwage/portal.html (accessed November 28, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miami University Living Wage Campaign===

The [[Miami University]] Living Wage Campaign began after it became known that Miami University wage was 18-19% below the market value. In 2003 the members of the Miami University Fair Labor Coalition began marching for university staff wages. After negotiations fail with the university and the [[American Federation of State and County Municipal Employees]] (AFSCME), workers went on strike. For two weeks workers protested and students created a tent city as a way of showing support for the strikers. Eventually more students, faculty and community members came out to show support. Even the union president at the time also went on a hunger strike as another means of protesting wages. In late 2003 the union was able to make an agreement with the university for gradual raises totaling about 10.25%.  There was still an ongoing push for Miami University to adopt a living wage police.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Our History.&quot; Fair Labor Action Coalition. http://www.musfs.org/ (accessed November 28, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johns Hopkins University===
 
The Student Labor Action Committee (SLAC) of [[Johns Hopkins University]] took action by conducting a sit-in until the administration listen to their demands. In 1999, after a petition with thousands of signatures, John’s Hopkins president, William R. Brody raised the hourly wage (to only $7.75) but did not include healthcare benefits nor would the wage adjust for inflation. The sit-in began in early 2000 to meet the demands of students for the university to adopt a living wage. A few weeks later, a settlement was made with the administration. SLAC now just ensures that the living wage policy is implemented.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Johns Hopkins University.&quot; Student Worker Solidarity Resource Center. http://www.livingwageaction.org/campaigns_hopkins.htm (accessed November 28, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swarthmore Living Wage and Democracy Campaign===
 
Starting in 2000, the Living Wage and Democracy Campaign of [[Swarthmore College]] began as small meetings between students and staff to voice concerns about their wages the lack of respect. Over the next two years the Living Wage and Democracy Campaign voiced concerns to the university administration. As a response in 2002, the wage is increased from $6.66 to $9 an hour. While the campaign was pleased with this first step, the believed the college still had a long way to go. The college president, Al Bloom created the Ad Hoc Committee to help learn what the living wage was and released a committee report.

Launched in 2009, [http://asiafloorwage.org/ Asia Floor Wage] is a loose coalition of labour and other groups seeking to implement a Living Wage throughout Asia, with a particular focus on the garment industry. There are member associations in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Hong Kong S.A.R., India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey as well as supporters in Europe and North America. The campaign targets multinational employers who do not pay their developing world workers a living wage.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Asia Floor Wage campaign – Decent income for garment workers in Asia.&quot; Bettina Musiolek, October 2011. http://www.eu-china.net/web/cms/upload/pdf/materialien/2011_Musiolek-Asia_Floor_Wage.pdf (accessed January 20, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Virginia Living Wage Campaign===

[http://www.LivingWageAtUVA.org The Living Wage Campaign] at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], composed of University students, faculty, staff, and community members, began in 1995 during the administration of University President [[John Casteen]] and continues under the administration of President [[Teresa Sullivan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LWCUVA&quot;&gt;The Living Wage Campaign at The University of Virginia, [http://www.livingwageatuva.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/keeping-our-promises-2010.pdf &quot;Keeping Our Promises 2010&quot;], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has demanded that the university raise wages to meet basic standards of cost-of-living in the Charlottesville area, as calculated by the nonpartisan [[Economic Policy Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LWCUVA&quot; /&gt;

In 2000, the campaign succeeded in persuading university administrators to raise the wage floor from $6.10 to $8.19; however, this wage increase soon fell to [[inflation]] and [[cost-of-living]] increases, and only applied to direct employees, not contracted workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;LWCUVA&quot; /&gt; In the spring of 2006, the campaign garnered national media attention when 17 students staged a sit-in in the university president's office in Madison Hall. A professor was arrested on the first day of the protest. The 17 students were arrested after 4 days of protest and later acquitted at trial.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Provence, [http://www.readthehook.com/79409/news-protesters-acquitted-arrests-timing-all &quot;NEWS- Protesters acquitted: In arrests, timing is all&quot;], The Hook, May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nell  Boeschenstein [http://www.c-ville.com/Article/Courts_Crime/Judge_dismisses_case_against_Living_Wage_Protesters/?z_Issue_ID=1332905060864098 &quot;Judge dismisses case against &quot;Living Wage&quot; Protesters&quot;], C-VILLE Weekly, May 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 2010, the campaign has staged a series of rallies and other events to draw attention to the necessity of the living wage for UVA employees. They have also met with members of the administration numerous times, including with the president.&lt;ref name=&quot;LWCUVA&quot; /&gt;  In making the argument for a living wage, the campaign has claimed that continuing to pay low wages is inconsistent with the University's values of the &quot;Community of Trust.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LWCUVA&quot; /&gt; They have also noted that University President Sullivan's 2011 co-written textbook, ''The Social Organization of Work'', states that, &quot;Being paid a living wage for one’s work is a necessary condition for self-actualization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Teresa. [http://books.google.com/books?id=tfJCCU6k-4AC&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;vq=living%20wage&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=living%20wage&amp;f=false The Social Organization of Work] Google Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After rallies and meetings in the spring of 2011, President Sullivan posted a &quot;Commitment to Lowest-Paid Employees&quot; on the University President's website including a letter addressed to the Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;University of Virginia President, [http://www.virginia.edu/president/commitment.html &quot;Commitment to Lowest Paid Workers&quot;], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the university still does not pay a living wage. 

On February 8, 2012, the Campaign released a series of demands to University administrators calling for a living wage policy at the University. These demands included a requirement that the University &quot;explicitly address&quot; the issue by Feb. 17. Although University President Teresa Sullivan did respond to the demands in a mass email sent to the University community shortly before the end of the day on February 17, the Campaign criticized her response as &quot;intentionally misleading&quot; and vowed to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/2012/feb/08/uva-living-wage-campaign-threatens-action-ar-1674692/|title=UVa Living Wage Campaign threatens 'action' | Daily Progress|last=Davis|first=Megan|date=8 February 2012|work=[[The Daily Progress]]|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, the campaign announced that at least 12 students would begin a hunger strike to publicize the plight of low-paid workers and compel the university to raise wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2012/feb/20/12-uva-students-go-hunger-strike-protest-employee--ar-1702202/|title=12 U.Va. students go on hunger strike to protest employee pay | Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=20 February 2012|work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several student organizations and community groups pledged their support to the campaign during the strike. As the action progressed other students joined the strike, by the end 26 students had participated in multiple days of the fast. Over 75 individuals participated in day long solidarity fasts. The hunger strike garnered significant national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/28/uva-hunger-strike-living-wage_n_1307063.html|title=University Of Virginia Students On Day 11 Of Hunger Strike For Hourly Employees Pay Raise|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=28 February 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mellisa|first=Harris-Perry|title=Foot Soldiers|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46979745/#46613522|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=MSNBC|date=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After 13 days the hunger strike came to a close without public concessions from the administration. Shortly after the end of the strike Charlottesville's city council voted to raise the base pay for municipal employees to $13/hour, the same wage that the strikers were asking the University of Virginia to pay. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moomaw|first=Graham|title=Charlottesville OKs 'living-wage' bump to $13|url=http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/2012/jul/17/charlottesville-approves-living-wage-pay-bump-ar-2063286/|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=The Daily Progress|date=17 July, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
