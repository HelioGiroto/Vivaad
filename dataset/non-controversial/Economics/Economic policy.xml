'''Economic policy''' refers to the actions that [[government]]s take in the [[economics|economic field]]. It covers the systems for setting [[interest rate]]s and [[government budget]] as well as the [[labor market]], [[nationalization|national ownership]], and many other areas of government interventions into the economy.

Such policies are often influenced by international institutions like the [[International Monetary Fund]] or [[World Bank]] as well as [[political]] beliefs and the consequent [[policy|policies]] of [[political parties|parties]].

==Types of economic policy==
Almost any aspect of government has an economic aspect and so many terms are used. A few example of types of economic policy include:
*Macroeconomic stabilization policy tries to keep the [[money supply]] growing, but not so quick that it results in excessive inflation.
*[[Trade|Trade policy]] refers to [[tariffs]], [[trade agreement]]s and the international institutions that govern them.
*Policies designed to create [[Economic growth]]
**Policies related to [[development economics]],
*[[Redistribution (economics)|Redistribution]] of income, property, or wealth
*[[Regulation]]
*[[Anti-trust]]
*[[Industrial policy]]
*Technology-based Economic Development Policy &lt;ref&gt;Walter Plosila, &quot;State Science- and Technology-Based Economic Development Policy: History, Trends and Developments, and Future Directions,&quot; Economic Development Quarterly, Vol. 18, No. 2, May 2004, pp. 113-126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macroeconomic stabilization policy==
[[Stabilization policy]] attempts to stimulate an economy out of recession or constrain the [[money supply]] to prevent excessive inflation.
*[[Fiscal policy]], often tied to [[Keynesian economics]], uses government spending and taxes to guide the economy.
**[[Fiscal stance]]: The size of the deficit or surplus
**[[Tax|Tax policy]]: The taxes used to collect government income.
**[[Government spending]] on just about any area of government
*[[Monetary policy]] controls the value of currency by lowering the supply of money to control inflation and raising it to stimulate economic growth. It is concerned with the amount of [[money]] in circulation and, consequently, [[interest rate]]s and [[inflation]].
**[[Interest rate]]s, if set by the Government
**[[Incomes policies]] and [[price controls]] that aim at imposing non-monetary controls on inflation
**[[Reserve requirements]] which affect the [[money multiplier]]

==Tools and goals==
Policy is generally directed to achieve particular objectives, like targets for [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], or [[economic growth]]. Sometimes other objectives, like [[military spending]] or [[nationalization]] are important.

These are referred to as the '''policy goals''': the outcomes which the economic policy aims to achieve.

To achieve these goals, governments use '''policy tools''' which are under the control of the government. These generally include the [[interest rate]] and [[money supply]], [[tax]] and government spending, tariffs, exchange rates, [[labor market]] regulations, and many other aspects of government.

===Selecting tools and goals===

Government and central banks are limited in the number of goals they can achieve in the short term. For instance, there may be pressure on the government to reduce inflation, reduce unemployment, and reduce interest rates while maintaining currency stability. If all of these are selected as goals for the short term, then policy is likely to be incoherent, because a normal consequence of reducing inflation and maintaining currency stability is increasing unemployment and increasing interest rates.

===Demand-side vs. supply-side tools===

This dilemma can in part be resolved by using microeconomics, [[supply-side]] policy to help adjust markets. For instance, unemployment could potentially be reduced by altering laws relating to [[trade unions]] or [[unemployment insurance]], as well as by macroeconomic ([[demand-side]]) factors like interest rates.

==Discretionary policy vs policy rules==
For much of the 20th century, governments adopted [[discretionary policy|discretionary policies]] like [[demand management]] designed to correct the [[business cycle]]. These typically used fiscal and monetary policy to adjust inflation, output and unemployment.

However, following the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s, policymakers began to be attracted to [[policy rule]]s. 

A discretionary policy is supported because it allows policymakers to respond quickly to events. However, discretionary policy can be subject to [[dynamic inconsistency]]: a government may say it intends to raise interest rates indefinitely to bring inflation under control, but then relax its stance later. This makes policy non-credible and ultimately ineffective.

A rule-based policy can be more credible, because it is more transparent and easier to anticipate. Examples of rule-based policies are fixed [[exchange rate]]s, [[interest rate rule]]s, the [[stability and growth pact]] and the [[Golden Rule (fiscal policy)|Golden Rule]]. Some policy rules can be imposed by external bodies, for instance the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] for currency. 

A compromise between strict discretionary and strict rule-based policy is to grant discretionary power to an independent body. For instance, the [[Federal Reserve Bank]], [[European Central Bank]], [[Bank of England]] and [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] all set interest rates without government interference, but do not adopt rules.

Another type of non-discretionary policy is a set of policies which are imposed by an international body. This can occur (for example) as a result of intervention by the [[International Monetary Fund]].

==Economic policy through history==
{{main|Economic history}}
The first economic problem was how to gain the [[Resource (economics)|resources]] it needed to be able to perform the functions of an early government: the [[military]], [[road]]s and other projects like building the [[Pyramids]].

Early governments generally relied on [[tax]] in kind and [[forced labor]] for their economic resources. However, with the development of [[money]] came the first policy choice. A government could raise money through taxing its citizens. However, it could now also [[coin|debase the coinage]] and so increase the [[money supply]]. 

Early civilizations also made decisions about whether to permit and how to tax [[trade]]. Some early civilizations, such as [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] adopted a '''closed currency policy''' whereby foreign merchants had to exchange their coin for local money. This effectively levied a very high [[tariff]] on foreign trade.

By the early modern age, more policy choices had been developed. There was considerable debate about [[mercantilism]] and other restrictive trade practices like the [[Navigation Acts]], as trade policy became associated with both national wealth and with foreign and colonial policy.

Throughout the 19th Century, [[monetary standard]]s became an important issue. [[Gold]] and [[silver]] were in supply in different proportions. Which metal was adopted influenced the wealth of different groups in society.

===The first fiscal policy===
With the accumulation of private capital in the Renaissance, states developed methods of financing [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s without debasing their coin. The development of [[capital markets]] meant that a government could borrow money to finance war or expansion while causing less economic hardship. 

This was the beginning of modern [[fiscal policy]].

The same markets made it easy for private entities to raise [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] or sell [[shares]] to fund private initiatives.

===Business cycles===
The [[business cycle]] became a predominant issue in the 19th century, as it became clear that industrial output, employment, and profit behaved in a [[economic cycle|cyclical]] manner. One of the first proposed policy solutions to the problem came with the work of [[Keynes]], who proposed that fiscal policy could be used actively to ward off depressions, recessions and slumps.  The [[Austrian school]] argues that central banks create the business cycle.
