      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7684">'''New classical macroeconomics''', sometimes simply called '''new classical economics''', is a school of thought in [[macroeconomics]] that builds its analysis entirely on a [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] framework. Specifically, it emphasizes the importance of rigorous foundations based on [[microeconomics]], especially [[rational expectations]].

New classical macroeconomics strives to provide neoclassical microeconomic foundations for macroeconomic analysis. This is in contrast with its rival [[New Keynesian economics|new Keynesian]] school that uses [[microfoundations]] such as [[Sticky (economics)|price stickiness]] and [[imperfect competition]] to generate macroeconomic models similar to earlier, Keynesian ones.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1.

== History ==

Classical economics is the term used for the first modern school of economics. The publication of [[Adam Smith]]'s the [[Wealth of Nations]] in 1776 is considered to be the birth of the school. Perhaps the central idea behind it is on the ability of the market to be self-correcting as well as being the most superior institution in allocating resources. The central assumption implied is: that all individuals maximize their economic activity.

The so-called [[marginal revolution]] that occurred in Europe, led by [[Carl Menger]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], and [[Léon Walras]], gave rise to what is known as [[neoclassical economics]]. This neoclassical formulation had also been formalized by [[Alfred Marshall]]. However, it was the [[general equilibrium]] of Walras that helped solidify the research in economic science as a mathematical and deductive enterprise, the essence of which is still neoclassical and makes up what is currently found in mainstream economics textbooks to this day.

The neoclassical school dominated the field up until the [[Great Depression]]. Then, however, with the  publication of [[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]] by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in 1936, certain neoclassical assumptions were rejected. Keynes proposed an aggregated framework to explain macroeconomic behavior, leading thus to the current distinction between micro- and [[macroeconomics]]. Of particular importance in Keynes' theories was his explanation of economic behavior as also being led by &quot;animal spirits&quot;. In this sense, it limited the role for the so-called rational (maximizing) agent.

The Post-World War II period saw the widespread implementation of Keynesian economic policy in the United States and Western European countries. Its dominance in the field by the 1970s was best reflected by the controversial statement attributed to ex-President [[Richard Nixon]] and economist [[Milton Friedman]]: &quot;[[We are all Keynesians now]]&quot;.

Problems arose in the 1970s and early 1980s when [[stagflation]] occurred.  Stagflation occurs when unemployment and inflation are both high at the same time.   The decade of the 1970s saw rising oil prices caused by an [[OPEC]] oil embargo on the United States.  This oil embargo caused both high [[inflation]] and steep economic downturn that in turned caused high [[unemployment]]. Keynesians were puzzled by the outbreak of stagflation because the original [[Phillips curve]] ruled out concurrent high inflation and high unemployment.

The New Classical school emerged in the 1970s as a response to the failure of Keynesian economics to explain [[stagflation]]. New Classical and monetarist criticisms led by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]] and [[Milton Friedman]] respectively forced the rethinking of Keynesian economics. In particular, Lucas made the [[Lucas critique]] that cast doubt on Keynesian model. This strengthened the case for macro models to be based on microeconomics. Meanwhile, Friedman before the stagflation proposed that the Phillips curve did not exist and would fail. He theorized of an existence of a [[NAIRU|natural rate of unemployment]] that contradicts the then accepted relationship between inflation and unemployment rate. The stagflation of the 1970s seemed to proved him right.

After the 1970s and the apparent failure of Keynesian economics, the New Classical school became the dominant school in Macroeconomics. This was captured by the fact that the new concepts and ideas which emerged from New Classical economics such as [[rational expectations]] were accepted by the opposing new Keynesian school except for the fact that the latter still maintained the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy. Both the New Classical and the New Keynesian schools now form the basis of mainstream macroeconomics.

== Foundation and assumptions ==

New classical economics is based on [[Walras' law|Walrasian assumptions]]. All agents are assumed to maximize [[utility]] on the basis of [[rational expectations]]. At any one time, the economy is assumed to have a unique [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] at [[full employment]] or [[potential output]] achieved through price and wage adjustment. In other words, the [[market clearing|market clears]] at all times.

New classical economics has also pioneered the use of [[representative agent]] models. Such models have recently received severe neoclassical criticism, pointing to the clear disjuncture between microeconomic behavior and macroeconomic results, as indicated by Kirman (1992), and the [[fallacy of composition]]. In some ways, this critique is akin to the [[Cambridge capital controversy]].

The concept of [[rational expectations]] was originally used by [[John Muth]], and was popularized by Lucas. One of the most famous new classical models is the [[real business cycle]] model, developed by [[Edward C. Prescott]] and [[Finn E. Kydland]].
