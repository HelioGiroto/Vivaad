'''Full-reserve banking''', also known as '''100% reserve banking''', is a [[bank]]ing practice in which the full amount of each [[Deposit account|depositor's]] funds are kept in [[bank reserves|reserve]], as [[cash]] or other highly liquid assets. In other words, funds deposited are not [[Loan|lent out]] by the bank if the depositor has the legal right to immediately withdraw their funds.  Some proposals for full reserve banking systems do not place such restrictions on deposits that are not available [[demand deposit|on demand]], where savers can entrust their money with a bank in [[time deposit]]s or in 'investment' accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Program_for_Monetary_Reform |title=A Program for Monetary Reform, Douglas, Paul H.; Hamilton, Earl J.; Fisher, Irving; King, Willford I.; Graham, Frank D.; Whittlesey, Charles R. (July 1939)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Full-reserve banking was practiced historically by the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] and some other early banks but was displaced by [[fractional reserve banking]] after 1800.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/books/desoto.pdf ''Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles''], Jesus Huerta de Soto, First English edition (2006), pp. 98-114&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals for full-reserve banking have been made by various economists, including [[Murray Rothbard|Murray N.

==History==
{{Details|Fractional reserve banking#History}}

==Debate over full-reserve banking==
During the [[Great Depression]], [[Chicago economists]] suggested [[monetary reform]]s, including a call to end the [[fractional-reserve banking]] in two 1933 memorandum that came to be known as the &quot;[[Chicago plan]]&quot;. After an apparent recovery in the mid-1930s, America was again in [[Recession of 1937-1938|recession]] and in 1939 economists circulated a draft proposal titled ''[[A Program for Monetary Reform]]'' calling once more for an end to fractional-reserve banking.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Mainstream economists]] seldom discuss the merits of full-reserve banking; some who have examined the issue have argued that the costs and inconvenience of a full-reserve banking system would outweigh any benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond-Dybvig&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Diamond  |first=Douglas W |coauthors=Philip H.

Furthermore, the proposal is likely to be ineffective in increasing stability since it will be impossible to control the institutions that will enter in the vacuum left when banks can no longer create liquidity. Fortunately, the political realities make it unlikely that this radical and imprudent proposal will be adopted. |doi=10.1086/296314 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_07_3_white.pdf''], LAWRENCE H.

(October 2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream economists generally believe that the costs and inconvenience of full-reserve banking would outweigh any benefits. Since banks would not receive profits from lending out deposits, depositors would have to pay banks for keeping their money safe and providing checking and other banking services. Such a system would be difficult to implement and would likely be rejected by the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen 1993 703–717&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.org&quot;/&gt; Additionally, 100% reserve banking would prevent banks from lending funds deposited into demand accounts. This would displace lending activity into unregulated institutions, potentially destabilizing the financial system; unregulated institutions (such as [[high-yield debt]] issuers) would take over the role of financial intermediation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond-Dybvig&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diamond |first=Douglas |coauthors=Philip Dybvig |title=Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity |journal=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review |year=2000 |month=Winter |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=14-23 |url=http://minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr2412.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The case for full reserve==
According to proponents, full reserve banking would also eliminate the need for a [[lender of last resort]], such as a [[central bank]], which is normally needed to support the banking system in times of [[systemic risk]] or [[financial contagion]], as these financial risks would not exist in a full-reserve banking environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae1_3_8.pdf Free Banking and Fractional Reserve Banking], Jörg Guido Hülsmann, Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics (Vol. 1, No. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; This requires that the resources available to the banks issuing credit money and demand deposits would be sufficient to convert ''all'' currency at once if so required. It was a central component in [[Social Credit]] proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theuniversityconcourse.com/VIII,1,9-30-2002/Heydorn.htm Social credit a distributist reform of the financial system] by Oliver Heydorn&lt;/ref&gt;

Were the [[United States]] to adopt full-reserve, all currency would be created by the federal government, and as a result all [[seigniorage]] revenue would also accrue to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worthpublishers.com/html/staticcontent/nonstandard/include/0716771616/Krugman2e_Econ_Ch30.pdf], Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, Macroeconomics 2nd Ed. Worth Publishers, Page 808&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the current US system, where a large proportion of the currency supply is in the form of demand deposits created by private banks.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, pg 802&lt;/ref&gt; When the Federal Reserve creates currency and uses it to buy treasury bills, it collects seigniorage revenue in the form of interest payments which it then returns to the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04283.pdf] GAO Report 04-283, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, in 2002 the United States earned $24.495 billion in this manner).&lt;ref&gt;GAO Report, pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; When a private bank creates currency, the government cannot collect any seigniorage from it. Since the Federal Reserve has a target for the size of the currency stock, any currency created by private banks is currency that is not created by the Fed and thus constitutes lost seigniorage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worthpublishers.com/html/staticcontent/nonstandard/include/0716771616/Krugman2e_Econ_Ch30.pdf] Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, Macroeconomics 2nd Ed. Worth Publishers, Page 816&lt;/ref&gt;  Some consider this an illegitimate &quot;privatization&quot; of what should be a public good, with these profits (i.e. taxes) being retained by the government to finance essential social services and capital works.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last= Brown |first= Ellen H. |title= Web of Debt |url= http://books.google.com/?id=ILMGrEC524UC |accessdate= 2007-12-15 |year= 2007 |publisher= Third Millennium Press |location= Baton Rouge, Louisiana |isbn= 0-9795608-0-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;death&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last= Rowbotham |first= Michael |title= The Grip of Death: A Study of Modern Money, Debt Slavery and Destructive Economics | year= 1998 |publisher= Jon Carpenter Publishing |isbn= 978-1-897766-40-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;monetary.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.monetary.org/lostscienceofmoney.html Stephen A. Zarlenga, ''The Lost Science of Money'' AMI (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Austrian School]] of economics, full-reserve banking would eliminate (or at least greatly reduce) the financial risks associated with [[bank run]]s, as the bank would have all the [[money]] in reserve needed to pay depositors, regardless whether depositors actually claimed their money.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Mystery of Banking&quot;&gt;[http://www.mises.org/Books/mysteryofbanking.pdf ''The Mystery of Banking''], Murray Rothbard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Case for a 100% Gold Dollar&quot;&gt;[http://mises.org/story/1829 The Case for a 100% Gold Dollar], Murray Rothbard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FBFB&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/RAE9_1_1.pdf Free Banking and the Free Bankers], Jörg Guido Hülsmann, Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics (Vol. 9, No. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because fractional-reserve banking necessarily increases the [[money supply]], which according to the [[Austrian School]] causes [[Austrian business cycle theory|business cycles]], economists from this school consider this aspect of fractional-reserve banking to have deleterious and destabilizing effects on the economy over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Mystery of Banking&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Case for a 100% Gold Dollar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FBFB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;100% Reserves Now&quot;&gt;[http://mises.org/story/3237 100% Reserves Now], Lucas M. Engelhardt&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued by these economists that, in contrast to fractional-reserve banking, full-reserve banking ''guarantees'' a stable money supply, which ensures that the [[means of exchange]] is not debased over time.  This improves the efficiency of the [[price mechanism]], promotes saving and the deferral of consumption, provides much greater confidence in the financial system and in the integrity of all commercial transactions and therefore encourages sustainable, non-speculative, productive investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Mystery of Banking&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Case for a 100% Gold Dollar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FBFB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;100% Reserves Now&quot;/&gt;

Some advocates believe that full-reserve banking should apply only to demand but not to [[time deposits]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1118 Money Multiplier: Myth or Reality], Frank Shostak, 16 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==The case against full reserve==
[[Fractional reserve banking]] allows for [[maturity transformation]], which mainstream economists (such as [[J. Bradford DeLong]] and [[Paul Krugman]]) have argued is an important function of the financial system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/03/the-maturity-transformation-and-liquidity-transformation-and-safety-transformation-industtry.html The Maturity Transformation Industry], Brad de Long&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current examples==
There are currently no examples of full reserve banking with an established history of operation. However, a variety of organizations aspire to provide full-reserve banking or claim to do so.

===Islamic banking===

In theory, [[Islamic banking]] is often synonymous with full-reserve banking, with banks achieving a 100% reserve ratio.&lt;ref name=TFP&gt;[http://faculty.capebretonu.ca/mchoudhu/money.htm A MONETARY SYSTEM WITH 100-PER CENT RESERVE REQUIREMENT AND THE GOLD STANDARD: THEORY, FACT AND POLICY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Siegfried |first=NA |year=2001 |month=April |title=Concepts of Paper Money in Islamic Legal Thought |journal=[[Arab Law Quarterly]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=319–332 |issn=0268-0556 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9ky3cbkr791256vq/ |accessdate=2006-10-16 |doi=10.1163/A:1013840123393 |format= &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3ASiegfried+intitle%3AConcepts+of+Paper+Money+in+Islamic+Legal+Thought&amp;as_publication=Arab+Law+Quarterly&amp;as_ylo=2001&amp;as_yhi=2001&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |postscript=.}} {{Dead link|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, this is not the case, and no examples of 100 percent reserve banking are observed. According to [[Islami Bank]] Bangladesh:&lt;ref name=&quot;urlConcept and ideology :: Issues and problems of Islamic banking&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamibankbd.com/page/ih_12.htm  |title=Concept and ideology :: Issues and problems of Islamic banking |work= |accessdate= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070716151628/http://www.islamibankbd.com/page/ih_12.htm |archivedate = 2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The   fractional reserve system versus 100% reserves would have different policy    implications. Under the former system, banks would have the ability to draw    profits on funds that they have exerted no productive effort. Such earning is    against the original spirit of Islamic banking. One solution may lie in the    [[nationalization]] of commercial banks, which has already occurred in most of    these countries. As regards the latter, we have a fair amount of theoretical    insight from the western literature but do not have any valuable empirical    observations on the operations of 100% reserves even in countries that have    adopted Islamic banking. These Islamic banks are still operating under    fractional reserve system. Hence, the operation of monetary policy under 100%    reserves system needs further research.}}

===Digital gold or silver===
Since 1996, a form of [[private currency]] called [[digital gold currency]] has been in circulation. Many of these currency providers claim to act like full-reserve &quot;[[private bank]]s&quot; with a one-to-one ratio of the currency they issue and the hard asset, usually [[gold]] or [[silver]], that they store as reserves. The most prominent example is [[e-gold]], which is encountering various legal issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/t/architecture/digital-currency-firms-face-money-laundering-charges-844 Internet currency firm pleads guilty to money laundering]&lt;/ref&gt; Also available are physical gold exchangers and storage providers, such as [[BullionVault]].

Some [[monetary reform]]ers believe a new free market will emerge in money production and distribution, as the [[Internet]] allows renewed decentralisation and competition in this area, eroding the [[central government]]'s and bankers' old [[monopoly]] control of the [[means of exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/podcast/?p=episode&amp;name=2009-02-01_095_not_losing_your_head.mp3 ''Not Losing Your Head''], Speech by Lew Rockwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/store/Free-Market-Monetary-System-A-P553.aspx?AFID=14 ''Free Market Money System''] by F.A. Hayek&lt;/ref&gt; Some monetary reformers believe that in a genuine free market, where government did not impose a monopoly currency on the populace, a predominantly full-reserve banking system, backed by a [[gold standard]] or [[silver standard]] monetary system, would arise spontaneously out of the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mises.org/books/Theory_Money_Credit/Contents.aspx The Theory of Money and Credit], Ludwig von Mises&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_07_3_white.pdf''], LAWRENCE H. WHITE, &quot;Accounting for Fractional-Reserve Banknotes and Deposits—or, What’s Twenty Quid to the Bloody Midland Bank?&quot;, The Independent Review, v. VII, n. 3, Winter 2003, ISSN 1086-1653, pp. 423– 441.&lt;/ref&gt; and cite current digital gold services as examples, that the free market favors fractional reserve banking and that 100% reserve banking can meet the needs of only a small, extremely risk-averse, niche market.
