'''Government debt''' (also known as '''public debt''', '''national debt''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/|work=United State Department of the Treasury|title=Bureau of the Public Debt Homepage|date=Accessed October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/education/faq/markets/national-debt.shtml|work=United State Department of the Treasury|title=FAQs: National Debt|date=Accessed October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[debt]] owed by a [[central government]]. (In the U.S. and other [[federal states]], &quot;government debt&quot; may also refer to the debt of a [[State government|state or provincial government]], [[municipal government|municipal]] or [[local government]].) By contrast, the annual &quot;[[Government budget deficit|government deficit]]&quot; refers to the difference between government receipts and spending in a single year, that is, the increase of debt over a particular year.

Government debt is one method of financing government operations, but it is not the only method. Governments can also create money to [[monetize]] their debts, thereby removing the need to pay interest. But this practice simply reduces government interest costs rather than truly canceling government debt.&lt;ref&gt;The Economics of Money, Banking, and the Financial Markets 7ed, Frederic S. Mishkin&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments usually borrow by issuing [[security (finance)|securities]], [[government bond]]s and bills. Less credit worthy countries sometimes borrow directly from a [[Supranationalism|supranational]] organization (e.g. the [[World Bank]]) or international [[financial institution]]s. 

As the government draws its income from much of the population, government debt is an indirect debt of the taxpayers. Government debt can be categorized as [[internal debt]] (owed to lenders within the country) and [[external debt]] (owed to foreign lenders). '''Sovereign debt''' usually refers to government debt that has been issued in a foreign currency.  Another common division of government debt is by duration until repayment is due. Short term debt is generally considered to be for one year or less, long term is for more than ten years. Medium term debt falls between these two boundaries. A broader definition of government debt may consider all government liabilities, including future pension payments and payments for goods and services the government has contracted but not yet paid.

==Government and sovereign bonds==

A government bond is a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issued by a national government. Such bonds are often denominated in the country's domestic [[currency]]. Government bonds are sometimes regarded as [[risk-free bond]]s, because national governments can raise taxes or reduce spending up to a certain point; in many cases they &quot;print more money&quot; to redeem the bond at maturity. Most developed country governments are prohibited by law from printing money directly, that function having been relegated to their [[central banks]]. However, central banks may buy government bonds in order to finance government spending, thereby monetizing the debt.

Bonds issued by national governments in foreign currencies are normally referred to as [[sovereign bond]]s. Investors in sovereign bonds denominated in foreign currency have the additional risk that the issuer may be unable to obtain foreign currency to redeem the bonds. In the 2010 Greek debt crisis, for example, the debt is held by Greece in [[Euro]]s, and one proposed solution (advanced notably by [[:fr: Forum Mondial des Fonds de Pension|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] [[financial economist]]s) is for Greece to go back to issuing its own [[Drachma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;M.

Firzli, &quot;Greece and the Roots the EU Debt Crisis&quot; ''The Vienna Review'', March  2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louise Armitstead, &quot;EU accused of 'head in sand' attitude to Greek debt crisis&quot; ''The Telegraph'', 23 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8594698/EU-accused-of-head-in-sand-attitude-to-Greek-debt-crisis.html |title=EU accused of 'head in sand' attitude to Greek debt crisis |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''
1. Primary Market:'''
Government Bonds are often issued via auctions at Stock Exchanges. There are several different methods of issuing such as Auctions, Guarantee, Combined Auction and Guarantee, and others. There are two main depository types: Book-Entry and Certificate. There are two different methods of the payments: at the beginning and at the end. There are two types of interest rates: Fixed and Floating. 

Procedure of an auction:

a.	Disclose auction information:
:•	Information about the bonds: interest rates, maturity year, type, and issuers (Central bank or Treasury)…
:•	Method of issuing
:•	Method of payments
b.	Auction:
:•	Bidding interest rate 
:•	Ceiling interest rate
:•	Big lot or not
:•	Maturity
:•	Disclose information of the final interest rate
c.	Depository:
:•	Book Entry
:•	Certificate
d.	Pre-listing
:•	Stock Exchanges send the information of the auction to Depository Center
e.	Listing:
:•	At the Stock Exchanges

'''
2. Secondary Market:'''
The G-bonds are traded at Stock Exchanges. Unlikely equity system, the bond secondary market uses a completely different system with different method of trading. Most of the system is real time trading. At the secondary market, each bond will be assigned with very own bond code (ISIN code). There are two types of trading: Outright and Repos.

==Municipal, provincial, or state bonds==
{{See|Municipal bond}}
Municipal bonds, &quot;munis&quot; in the United States, are debt securities issued by local governments (municipalities).

== Denominated in reserve currencies ==
Governments often borrow money in a currency in which the demand for debt securities is strong. An advantage of issuing bonds in a currency such as the [[US dollar]], the [[pound sterling]], or the [[euro]] is that many investors wish to invest in such bonds. Countries such as the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[France]] have only issued in their domestic currency (or in the [[Euro]] in the case of Euro members).

Relatively few investors are willing to invest in currencies that do not have a long track record of stability. A disadvantage for a government issuing bonds in a foreign currency is that there is a risk that it will not be able to obtain the foreign currency to pay the interest or redeem the bonds. In 1997 and 1998, during the [[Asian financial crisis]], this became a serious problem when many countries were unable to keep their exchange rate [[fixed exchange rate|fixed]] due to [[speculation|speculative]] attacks.

==Risk==
{{Main|Credit risk}}
Lending to a national government in the country's own sovereign currency is often considered &quot;risk free&quot; and is done at a so-called &quot;[[risk-free interest rate]].&quot; This is because, up to a point, the debt and interest can be repaid by raising tax receipts (either by [[economic growth]] or raising tax rates), a reduction in spending, or failing that by simply printing more money. It is widely considered that this would increase inflation and reduce the [[Value (economics)|value]] of the invested [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. This has happened many times throughout history, and a typical example of this is provided by [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] of the 1920s which suffered from [[hyperinflation]] due to its government's inability to pay the national debt deriving from the costs of World War I.

In practice, the market interest rate tends to be different for debts of different countries. An example is in borrowing by different European Union countries denominated in euros. Even though the currency is the same in each case, the yield required by the market is higher for some countries' debt than for others. This reflects the views of the market on the relative solvency of the various countries and the likelihood that the debt will be repaid.

A politically unstable state is anything but risk-free as it may&amp;mdash;being sovereign&amp;mdash;cease its payments. Examples of this phenomenon include [[Spain]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, which nullified its government debt seven times during a century, and revolutionary [[Russia]] of 1917 which refused to accept the responsibility for [[Imperial Russia]]'s foreign debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Hedlund |first=Stefan |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Russian History (reprinted in [[Encyclopedia.com]]) |title=Foreign Debt |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100454.html |accessdate=3 March 2010 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another political risk is caused by external threats. It is mostly uncommon for invaders to accept responsibility for the national debt of the annexed state or that of an organization it considered as rebels. For example, all borrowings by the [[Confederate States of America]] were left unpaid after the [[American Civil War]]. On the other hand, in the modern era, the transition from dictatorship and illegitimate governments to democracy does not automatically free the country of the debt contracted by the former government. Today's highly developed global credit markets would be less likely to lend to a country that negated its previous debt, or might require punishing levels of interest rates that would be unacceptable to the borrower.

U.S. Treasury bonds denominated in U.S. dollars are often considered &quot;risk free&quot; in the U.S. This disregards the risk to foreign purchasers of depreciation in the dollar relative to the lender's currency. In addition, a risk-free status implicitly assumes the stability of the US government and its ability to continue repayments during any financial crisis.

Lending to a national government in a currency other than its own does not give the same confidence in the ability to repay, but this may be offset by reducing the exchange rate risk to foreign lenders. On the other hand, national debt in foreign currency cannot be disposed of by starting a hyperinflation; and this increases the credibility of the debtor. Usually small states with volatile economies have most of their national debt in foreign currency. For countries in the [[Euro]]zone, the euro is the local currency, although no single state can trigger inflation by creating more currency.

Lending to a local or municipal government can be just as risky as a loan to a private company, unless the local or municipal government has sufficient power to tax. In this case, the local government could to a certain extent pay its debts by increasing the taxes, or reduce spending, just as a national one could. Further, local government loans are sometimes guaranteed by the national government, and this reduces the risk. In some jurisdictions, interest earned on local or municipal bonds is tax-exempt income, which can be an important consideration for the wealthy.

==Clearing and defaults==
{{Main|sovereign default|clearing (finance)|default (finance)}}

Public debt clearing standards are set by the [[Bank for International Settlements]], but defaults are governed by extremely complex laws which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Globally, the [[International Monetary Fund]] can take certain steps to intervene to prevent anticipated defaults. It is sometimes criticized for the measures it advises nations to take, which often involve cutting back on government spending as part of an [[austerity|economic austerity]] regime. In [[triple bottom line]] analysis, this can be seen as degrading [[capital (economics)|capital]] on which the nation's economy ultimately depends.

Those considerations do not apply to private debts, by contrast: [[credit risk]] (or the consumer [[credit rating]]) determines the [[interest rate]], more or less, and entities go bankrupt if they fail to repay. Governments cannot really go bankrupt (and suddenly stop providing services to citizens), thus a far more complex way of managing defaults is required.

Smaller jurisdictions, such as cities, are usually guaranteed by their regional or national levels of government. When [[New York City]] declined into what would have been a bankrupt status during the 1960s (had it been a private entity), by the early 1970s a &quot;[[bail out (finance)|bailout]]&quot; was required from [[New York State]] and the [[United States]]. In general, such measures amount to merging the smaller entity's debt into that of the larger entity and thereby giving it access to the lower interest rates the larger entity enjoys. The larger entity may then assume some agreed-upon oversight in order to prevent recurrence of the problem.

==Structure==
In the dominant [[economic policy]] generally ascribed to theories of [[John Maynard Keynes]], sometimes called [[Keynesian economics]], there is tolerance for fairly high levels of public debt to pay for [[public investment]] in lean times, which, if boom times follow, can then be paid back from rising tax revenues.

As this theory gained global popularity in the 1930s, many nations took on public debt to finance large [[infrastructural capital]] projects — such as highways or large [[hydroelectric dam]]s. It was thought that this could start a [[virtuous cycle]] and a rising [[business confidence]] since there would be more workers with money to spend. Some{{Who|date=January 2012}} have argued that the greatly increased military spending of [[World War II]] really ended the [[Great Depression]]. Of course, military expenditures are based upon the same tax (or debt) and spend fundamentals as the rest of the national budget, so this argument does little to undermine Keynesian theory. Indeed, some{{Who|date=July 2010}} have suggested that significantly higher national spending necessitated by war essentially confirms the basic Keynesian analysis (see [[Military Keynesianism]]).

Nonetheless, the Keynesian scheme remained dominant, thanks in part to Keynes' own pamphlet ''[[How to Pay for the War]]'', published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1940. Since the war was being paid for, and being won, Keynes and [[Harry Dexter White]], Assistant Secretary of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], were, according to [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], the dominating influences on the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] agreements.  These agreements set the policies for the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and [[World Bank]], the so-called ''Bretton Woods Institutions'', launched in the late 1940s for the last two (the BIS was founded in 1930).

These are the dominant economic entities setting policies regarding public debt. Due to its role in setting policies for [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|trade dispute]]s, the [[World Trade Organization]] also has immense power to affect [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] relations, as many nations are dependent on specific [[commodity markets]] for the [[balance of payments]] they require to repay debt.

Understanding the structure of public debt and analyzing its risk requires one to:
* Assess the [[expected value]] of any [[public asset]] being constructed, at least in future tax terms if not in direct revenues. A choice must be made about its status as a [[public good]] — some public &quot;assets&quot; end up as [[public bad]]s, such as [[nuclear power]] plants which are extremely expensive to decommission — these costs must also be worked in to asset values.
* Determine whether any public debt is being used to finance [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], which includes all [[Welfare (financial aid)|social assistance]] and all [[military spending]].
* Determine whether [[triple bottom line]] issues are likely to lead to failure or defaults of governments — say due to being overthrown.
* Determine whether any of the debt being undertaken may be held to be [[odious debt]], which might permit it to be disavowed without any effect on a country's credit status. This includes any loans to purchase &quot;assets&quot; such as leaders' palaces, or the people's suppression or extermination. [[International law]] does not permit people to be held responsible for such debts — as they did not benefit in any way from the spending and had no control over it.
* Determine if any future entitlements are being created by expenditures — financing a public swimming pool for instance may create some right to recreation where it did not previously exist, by precedent and expectations.

== Scale ==
{{disputed|date=March 2010}}
[[File:PublicDebtTriade.PNG|thumb|300px|right|General government debt as percent of [[GDP]], [[USA]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]].]]
[[File:ZinslastquoteEngl.PNG|thumb|300px|Interest burden of public debt with respect to [[GDP]].]]
[[File:National Debt Clock by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|right|300px|National Debt Clock outside the [[IRS]] office in [[NYC]], July 1, 2010]]

[[Global debt]] is of great concern since interest payments can often place great demands on governments and individuals. This has led to calls for universal [[debt relief]] for poorer countries.

A less extreme and more innovative measure would be to permit [[civil society]] groups in every nation to buy the debt in exchange for minority [[Ownership equity|equity]] positions in community organizations. Even in dictatorships, the combination of banks and civil society power could force [[land reform]] and overthrow unaccountable governments, since the people and banks would be aligned against the oppressive government.

Using a [[debt to GDP ratio]] is one of the most accepted measures of assessing a nation's debt. For example, in theory one of the criteria of admission to the [[European Union]]'s [[Euro]] currency is that a country's debt should not exceed 60% of that country's GDP.

The debt of the [[United States]] over time is documented online at the Department of the Treasury's website TreasuryDirect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt.htm |title=Government - Historical Debt Outstanding – Annual |publisher=Treasurydirect.gov |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
[[Sovereign debt crisis|Sovereign debt problems]] have been a major public policy issue since [[World War II]], including the treatment of debt related to that war, the developing country &quot;debt crisis&quot; in the 1980s, and the shocks of the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] and [[Argentine economic crisis|Argentina's default]] in 2001.

Not all [[developing country|developing countries]] have been affected to the same extent. For example [[Yugoslavia]] had low government debt (perhaps because it was unable to borrow on world markets){{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} until its breakup and the coming of democracy, when the new national governments started to borrow money from the IMF. Croatia has a government debt of $47 billion today while the whole of Yugoslavia (six times as many people as Croatia) in 1980 had debt of $14 billion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Government &quot;implicit&quot; debt is the promise by a government of future payments from the state. Usually this refers to long term promises of social payments such as pensions and health expenditure; not promises of other expenditure such as education or defense (which are largely paid on a &quot;[[quid pro quo]]&quot; basis to government employees and contractors).

A problem with these implicit [[government insurance]] liabilities is that it is hard to cost them accurately, since the amounts of future payments depend on so many factors. First of all, the [[social security]] claims are not &quot;open&quot; [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] or debt papers with a stated time frame, &quot;[[time to maturity]]&quot;, &quot;[[nominal value]]&quot;, or &quot;[[net present value]]&quot;.

In the United States, as in most other countries, there is no money earmarked in the government's coffers for future social insurance payments. This insurance system is called [[PAYGO]] ([[pay-as-you-go tax|pay-as-you-go]]). Alternative social insurance strategies might have included a system that involved [[funded|save and invest]].

Furthermore, population projections predict that when the &quot;[[baby boomers]]&quot; start to retire, the working population in the United States, and in many other countries, will be a smaller percentage of the population than it is now, for many years to come. This will increase the burden on the country of these promised pension and other payments - larger than the 65 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2004&amp;ey=2009&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=0&amp;pr1.x=59&amp;pr1.y=16&amp;c=193%2C542%2C122%2C137%2C124%2C181%2C156%2C138%2C423%2C196%2C128%2C142%2C172%2C182%2C132%2C576%2C134%2C961%2C174%2C184%2C532%2C144%2C176%2C146%2C178%2C528%2C436%2C112%2C136%2C111%2C158&amp;s=GGD_NGDP&amp;grp=0&amp;a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|accessdate=2010-10-12}}(General government gross debt 2008 estimates rounded to one decimal place)&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] that it is now. The &quot;burden&quot; of the government is what it spends, since it can only pay its bills through taxes, debt, and increasing the money supply (government spending = tax revenues + change in government debt held by public + change in [[monetary base]] held by the public). &quot;Government social benefits&quot; paid by the [[United States government]] during 2003 totaled $1.3 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=84&amp;FirstYear=2002&amp;LastYear=2004&amp;Freq=Qtr|title=Government Social Benefits Table}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[European Commission]] required EU Member Countries to publish their debt information in standardized methodology, explicitly including debts that were previously hidden in a number of ways to satisfy minimum requirements on local (national) and European ([[Stability and Growth Pact]]) level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:145:0001:0009:en:PDF |title=COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 479/2009 |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
