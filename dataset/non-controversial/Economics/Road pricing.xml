{{Economics sidebar}} 
'''Road pricing''' (also '''road user charges''') are direct charges levied for the use of [[road]]s, including [[Toll road|road tolls]], distance or time based fees, [[congestion pricing|congestion charges]] and charges designed to discourage use of certain classes of vehicle, fuel sources or more polluting vehicles.&lt;ref name=FHWA/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCB/&gt;  These charges may be used primarily for revenue generation, usually for road infrastructure financing, or as a [[transportation demand management]] tool to reduce [[peak hour]] [[travel behavior|travel]] and the associated [[traffic congestion]] or other social and environmental [[Externality|negative externalities]] associated with road travel such as [[tailpipe emissions|air pollution]], [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, visual intrusion, noise and [[road accident]]s.&lt;ref name=IFS2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/fuel_for_thought-johnson_et_al-150512.pdf|title=Fuel for Thought - The what, why and how of motoring taxation|author=Paul Johnson, Andrew Leicester and George Stoye|publisher=[[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] and Royal Automobile Club Foundation for Motoring|date=May 2012|accessdate=2012-05-22}} ''Executive Summary, pp. v''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most countries [[toll roads]], [[toll bridges]] and [[toll tunnels]] are often used primarily for revenue generation to repay for long-term debt issued to finance the toll facility, or to finance capacity expansion, operations and maintenance of the facility itself, or simply as general tax funds.&lt;ref name=FHWA/&gt; [[Road congestion pricing]] for entering an urban area, or pollution charges levied vehicles with higher tailpipe emissions are typical schemes implemented to price externalities. The application of congestion charges is currently limited to a small number of cities and urban roads, and the notable schemes include the [[Electronic Road Pricing]] in [[Singapore]], the [[London congestion charge]], the [[Stockholm congestion tax]], the [[Milan Area C]], and [[high-occupancy toll lane]]s in the United States.&lt;ref name=S&amp;V2007&gt;{{Cite book| last = Small, Kenneth A.; Verhoef, Erik T. | title = The Economics of Urban Transportation |year = 2007| publisher = Routledge, New York| isbn = 978-0-415-28515-5| page = 148-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AreaC&gt;{{cite news|title=Area C è partita: calate del 40% le auto in centro dopo l'entrata in vigore del pedaggio|trans_title= Area C takes off: auto traffic decreased 40% in the center after the toll goes into force|language=Italian|url=http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/12_gennaio_16/congestion-primo-giorno-traffico-1902875137709.shtml|accessdate=2012-01-16|work=Corriere della Sera Milano|date=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of pollution pricing schemes include the [[London low emission zone]] and the discontinued [[Ecopass]] in Milan. Mileage based usage fees (MBUF) or distance based charging has been implemented for heavy vehicles based on truck weight and distance traveled in New Zealand (called RUC), Switzerland (LSVA), Germany ([[LKW-Maut]]), Austria (Go-Maut), Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and in four U.S. states: Oregon, New York, Kentucky and New Mexico.&lt;ref name=MBUF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roadpricing.blogspot.com/2012/05/mileage-based-usage-fees-distance-based.html|title=Mileage based usage fees - distance based charging - vehicle mileage tax - a future? |author=Scott Wilson|publisher=Road Pricing Blog|date=2012-05-03|accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many recent road pricing schemes have proved controversial with a number of high profile schemes in the U.S. and the UK being cancelled, delayed or scaled back in response to opposition and protest. Critics maintain that congestion pricing is not equitable, places an economic burden on neighboring communities, has a negative effect on retail businesses and on economic activity in general, and is just another tax. A 2006 survey of economic literature on the subject, however, finds that most economists agree that some form of road pricing to reduce congestion is economically viable, although there is disagreement on what form road pricing should take. Economists disagree over how to set tolls, how to cover common costs, what to do with any excess revenues, whether and how “losers” from tolling previously free roads should be compensated, and whether to privatize highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Econ Journal Watch]]|volume=3|issue=2|pages=292–379|author=Lindsey, Robin|title=Do Economists Reach a Conclusion on Road Pricing?

==Terminology==
Road pricing is a general term which may be used for any system where the driver pays directly for use of a particular roadway or road network in a particular city, region or nation. Road pricing also includes [[congestion pricing|congestion charging]], which are charges levied on qualifying road users to reduce peak demand, and thereby reduce [[traffic congestion]]&lt;ref name=FHWA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/revenue/road_pricing/defined/|title=Road Pricing Defined|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCB&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.uctc.net/papers/391.pdf|last = Small| first = Kenneth A. | last2 = José A.

==History==
The first published reference to 'road pricing' was possibly in 1949 when the [[RAND Corporation]] proposed &quot;use of direct road pricing to make freight journeys more expensive on congested routes or to influence the time of day at which freight traffic operates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MewnAQAAIAAJ|title=The Rand paper series|quote=Potentially more effective in the near term would be the use of direct road pricing to make freight journeys more expensive on congested routes or to influence the time of day at which freight traffic operates|page=16|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel-laureate [[William Vickrey]] then built on the ideas of the economist [[Arthur Pigou]], outlining a theoretical case for road pricing in a major work on the subject of 1955&lt;ref name=Vickney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economic-policy.org/pdfs/Santos_final.pdf.|title=Road Pricing: Lessons from London|quote=Models of increasing sophistication, which describe congestion have been developed over the years since the seminal work of Vickrey (1955).}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing in 1959 that drivers should be charged by electronic means for use of busy urban roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/business/yourmoney/11view.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=What’s the Toll? It Depends on the Time of Day |work=New York Times | first=Daniel|last=Gross|date=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Pigou had previously developed the concept of [[externality|economic externalities]] in a publication of 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pigou |first=A. C. |title=The Economics of Welfare |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=1920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed that what is now referred to as a [[Pigouvian tax]] equal to the negative externality should be used to bring the outcome within a [[market economy]] back to [[economic efficiency]].&lt;ref name=Vickney/&gt;

In 1963 Vickery published a paper 'Pricing in urban and suburban transport’ in the [[American Economic Review]]&lt;ref name=open18361/&gt; and Gabriel Joseph Roth, John Michael Thomson of the Department of Applied Economics at the [[University of Cambridge]] published a short paper titled &quot;Road pricing, a cure for congestion?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1m1l5AAACAAJ|title=Road pricing, a cure for congestion?|authors=Gabriel Joseph Roth, John Michael Thomson|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smeed Report]], 'Road Pricing: The Economic and Technical Possibilities' which had been commissioned in 1962 by the United Kingdom [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] was published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Road_pricing_the_economic_and_technical.html?id=XR00AQAAIAAJ|title=Road Pricing: The Economic and Technical Possibilities (Smeed Report)|author=R.J.Smeed|year=1964|publisher=[[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road pricing was then developed by [[Maurice Allais]] and Gabriel Roth in a paper titled &quot;The Economics of Road User Charges&quot; published by the [[World Bank]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Walters | first = A. A. | year = 1968 | title = The Economics of Road User Charges| publisher = World Bank Staff Occasional Papers Number Five, Chapter VII, Washington, D.C. pp. 191–217| isbn = 978-0-8018-0653-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first successful implementation of a congestion charge was with the [[Singapore Area Licensing Scheme]] in 1976. The [[Electronic Road Pricing (Hong Kong)]] scheme operated as a trial between 1983 and 1985 but was not continued permanently due to public opposition. A number of road tolling schemes were then introduced in Norway between 1986 and 1991 in [[Bergen]], [[Oslo]] and the [[Trondheim Toll Scheme]].&lt;ref name=Norway/&gt; It was noticed that the Oslo scheme had the unintended effect of reducing traffic by around 5%. The Singapore scheme was expanded in 1995 and converted to use a new electronic tolling system in 1998 and renamed [[Electronic Road Pricing]]. The first use of a road toll for access by low-occupancy vehicles to [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]] was introduced in the U.S. on [[California State Route 91]] in 1995. Since 2000 and other schemes have been introduced although notable the [[New York congestion pricing]] and [[Road pricing in the United Kingdom|a number of UK proposals]] were not progressed due to public opposition.

==Example schemes==

In January 2009, variable tolls were implemented at [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], two weeks after upgrading to 100% free-flow [[electronic toll collection]]. The highest fees are charged during the morning and afternoon peak periods; a toll 25% lower applies for the shoulder periods; and a toll lower than the previously existing is charged at nights, weekends, and public holidays. This is [[Australia]]'s first road congestion pricing scheme, and has had only a very minor effect on traffic levels, reducing them by 0.19% &lt;ref&gt;http://au.news.yahoo.com/latest/a/-/latest/12384129/harbour-bridge-variable-tolls-to-stay/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |date= 2009-01-27 |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/latest/5283437/peak-hour-toll-begins-harbour-bridge/ |title=Peak hour toll begins on Harbour Bridge |publisher=Yahoo!7 News (Australia)  |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Daley |date= 2009-02-05 |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/newsevents/downloads/minister_releases/05022009_cashlesstolling.pdf |format=PDF|title=Motorists Embrace Cashless Tolling on Sydney Harbour Bridge |publisher=NSW Minister for Roads |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |date= 2009-01-22 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2471738.htm |title=Harbour congestion tax 'will anger some' |publisher=ABC News (Australia) |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norway]] implemented electronic urban tolling on the main road corridors into [[Bergen]] in 1986), [[Oslo]] (1990) and then the [[Trondheim Toll Scheme]] the following year.&lt;ref name=Norway&gt;{{cite web |url=http://design.open.ac.uk/potter/documents/NorwayTP.pdf |title=Norway's urban toll rings: evolving towards congestion charging? |author=Ieromanachou, Potter and Warren|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bergen scheme operated as a cordon on all entry points to the central area of the city. The Oslo scheme was initially created as a conventional road toll for revenue generation reasons, but had the unintended effect of reducing traffic by around 5%. Charges vary by time of the day. The legal basis for introducing congestion charging fee was approved by Parliament in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piarc.org/library/aipcr/1/88FDcnh3295yCfA04Vm71nCN.pdf |title=Urban Tolling in Norway |page=5 |author=Wærsted, Kristian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in October 2011.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In March 2001, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] implemented a discount during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying tolls for several tunnels and bridges connecting [[New York City]] and [[New Jersey]] using the electronic [[EZ Pass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Samuel |date= 2001-01-11 |url=http://www.tollroadsnews.com/node/2848 |title=Peak/Off-Peak Tolls:Whitman whittles down PANYNJ tolls|publisher=TOLLROADSnews |accessdate= 2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Ronald Smothers  |date=2001-03-27|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DF1E3CF934A15750C0A9679C8B63&amp;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FT%2FTransit%20Systems&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=Port%20Authority%20value%20pricing%20toll%20Washington%20bridge%20off%20peak&amp;st=cse|title=Grumbling, but Still Moving, Under New Rush-Hour Tolls |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2008, qualified low-emission automobiles could get a 50% discount during off-peak hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |date=|url=http://www.panynj.gov/COMMUTINGTRAVEL/tunnels/html/tolls.html#faq8 |title=New Toll Rates – Effective, 3 AM, March 2, 2008: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)|publisher=Port Authority of New York and New Jersey |accessdate=2009-03-10}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007 the [[New York City]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] proposed a [[New York congestion pricing|contentious congestion charge]] on cars using most streets in the central business district (southern half of [[Manhattan]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/downloads/pdf/report_transportation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the broader [[PlaNYC|PlaNYC 2030]]. The plan received broad support from a coalition of civic, business, environmental, labor, community and public health organizations and the City Council voted for the measure but also received significant opposition. The [[New York Legislature]] declined to vote on it in in April 2008 saying that &quot;''...the opposition was so overwhelming,...that he would not hold an open vote of the full Assembly,''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=80238 |title=Congestion Pricing Dies in Albany |publisher=NY1 |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====San Francisco====

====High occupancy toll (HOT) lanes====

{{See also|High-occupancy vehicle lane}} 
The most common application of congestion pricing policies in the U.S. urban transportation context is to toll a single facility (highway or bridge).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Small |first = Kenneth A. | last2 = José A.
