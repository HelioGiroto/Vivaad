      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6141">A '''standard of deferred payment''' is the accepted way, in a given [[market]], to settle a [[debt]] – a unit in which [[debt]]s are denominated. It is one of the defining functions of [[money]]; for example, while the [[gold standard]] reigned, [[gold]] or any [[currency]] convertible to gold at a fixed rate constituted such a standard. As of 2010, the [[US dollar]] and the [[euro]] are the most generally accepted standards for international settlements. 

The term &quot;standard of deferred payment&quot; is not as widely used as other terms for functions of money, namely [[medium of exchange]], [[store of value]], and [[unit of account]], though it is distinguished in some works.

== Functions of money ==
{{Main|Money#Functions|l1=Functions of money}}
Money is held to serve multiple distinguished but related functions, of which a &quot;standard of deferred payment&quot; is one.&lt;ref name=&quot;greco&quot;&gt;T.H. Greco.

Campbell, Edwin G. Dolan, 1987, [http://books.google.com/books?id=MTK3AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=deferred+payment#search_anchor p. 38–40]&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly distinguished [[Money#Functions|functions of money]] are as a [[medium of exchange]], a [[unit of account]], a [[store of value]], and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment, summarized in a mnemonic rhyme of older economics texts:
:&quot;Money is a matter of functions four, a medium, a measure, a standard, a store.&quot;
However, many newer texts do not distinguish the function of a standard of deferred payment, subsuming it in other functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mankiw&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Macroeconomics |last=Mankiw |first=N. Gregory |authorlink=N. Gregory Mankiw |year=2007 | edition=6th |publisher=Worth Publishers |location= New York |isbn=0-7167-6213-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;krugman&quot;&gt;Krugman, Paul &amp; Wells, Robin, ''Economics'', Worth Publishers, New York (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abel_bernanke&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Abel |first=Andrew |last2=Bernanke |first2=Ben |authorlink2=Ben Bernanke  |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Pearson |year=2005 |edition=5th |pages=266–269 |chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a standard of deferred payment is one of the functions of money; it is distinct from:
* the [[medium of exchange]] function which is used for immediate payments, not deferred payments and requires durability when used in trade, and a minimum of opportunity to cheat others — as the diamond or gold example below illustrate;
* the [[store of value]] function, which relates to the saving, storing, and retrieval of value; and
* from the [[unit of account]] function which requires [[fungibility]] so accounts in any amount can be readily settled.

When [[currency]] is stable, [[money]] can serve all four functions.  When it is not, or when complex and volatile forms of [[financial capital]] are involved, some may wish to identify a single standard of deferred payment to avoid cheating by selecting a denominator of debt that one believes to be dropping in value.

== Relation to debt ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
A debt is a deferred payment; a standard of deferred payment is what they are denominated in. Since the value of money – be it dollars, gold, or others – may fluctuate over time via [[inflation]] and [[deflation]], the value of deferred payments (the real level of debt) likewise fluctuates.
A device is termed &quot;[[legal tender]]&quot; if it may serve to discharge (pay off) debts; thus, while US dollars are not backed by gold or any other commodity, they draw value from being legal tender – being usable to pay off debts.

== Examples ==
Deferred payment is based on enforceability of debts and [[rule of law]], and is not used or rarely used when debts are unlikely to be collectable. For certain kinds of transactions (such as for [[black market|illegal goods]] like [[illegal drug trade|drugs]] or weapons), gold, [[diamond]]s or [[bitcoin]]s may be preferred as the [[medium of exchange]] — there being no recourse in case of [[counterfeit]] currency being used — and there is rarely any deferral of payment: if there is, it will most likely be stated in dollars.

Historically, there have been many times when [[creditor]]s have had to hide from [[debtor]]s to avoid being paid off in near worthless currency, typically following [[hyper-inflation]].

[[Time-based currency]] such as [[Ithaca Hours]] establishes fixed amounts of human labour as the only standard of deferred payment.
