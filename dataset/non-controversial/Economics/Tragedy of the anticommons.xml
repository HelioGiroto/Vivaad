      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7719">The '''tragedy of the anticommons''' is a coordination breakdown where the existence of numerous rightsholders frustrates achieving a socially desirable outcome.   It mirrors the older [[tragedy of the commons]] used to describe coordination breakdowns arising from insufficient rightsholders.&lt;ref name=&quot;heller98&quot; /&gt; The concept covers a range of coordination failures including [[patent thickets]], [[submarine patents]], and [[nail house]]s. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Overcoming these breakdowns can be difficult, but there are assorted means including [[eminent domain]], [[Laches (equity)|Laches]], [[patent pool]]s, or other licensing organizations. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The term originally appeared in Michael Heller's 1998 article of the same name&lt;ref name=&quot;heller98&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller |first=Michael |title=The Tragedy of the Anticommons |journal=Harvard Law Review|month=January |year=1998|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/wdi/papers/1997-40.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the thesis of his 2008 book.&lt;ref name=&quot;book2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gridlock Economy: How Too Much Ownership Wrecks Markets, Stops Innovation, and Costs Lives |last=Heller |first=Michael |year=2008 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn= 978-0-465-02916-7 |url=http://www.gridlockeconomy.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 1998 article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heller|first=M. A.|last2=Eisenberg|first2=R.|title=Can Patents Deter Innovation? The Anticommons in Biomedical Research|journal=Science|volume=280|pages=698–701|year=1998|month=May |doi=10.1126/science.280.5364.698|pmid=9563938|issue=5364|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/280/5364/698}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Science'', Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg, while not disputing role of patents in general in motivating invention and disclosure, argue that biomedical research was one of several key areas where competing [[patent]] rights could actually prevent useful and affordable products from reaching the marketplace. Proponents of the theory claimed that too many property rights could lead to less innovation.

==Classic example==

In Heller's 1998 Harvard Law Review article,&lt;ref name=&quot;heller98&quot;/&gt; he noted that after the [[post-communism|fall of Communism]], in many [[Eastern Europe]]an cities there were a lot of open air kiosks, but also a lot of empty stores. Upon investigation, he concluded that because many different agencies and private parties had rights over the use of store space, it was difficult or even impossible for a [[Startup company|startup]] retailer to negotiate successfully the use of that space. Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, their competing interests got in the way of the effective use of space.

==Copyrights==
In the same way, competing use of [[copyright]] can prevent a product from coming to the marketplace at a reasonable price, resulting in lost [[royalties|royalty]] income for the copyright holders. For example, ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' was one of the most popular syndicated [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] of all time, and many television shows from that era have been successfully released on DVD. However, for many years, WKRP was not available on DVD. When it was a [[television]] program, an agreement was in place between television producers and music licensing organizations such as [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] wherein a standard licensing fee was paid for each song that was played on a television show. As such, the producers could determine how much money would be paid for their use of music clips and budget accordingly. However, there is no similar standard agreement for use of music on DVDs (which ASCAP and BMI do not control), and producers of programs from that era (and into the present) are now faced with the prospect of negotiating individually with several dozen composers. The current owner of the show, [[20th Century Fox]], released the show on DVD starting in the first half of 2007, using &quot;soundalike&quot; versions of music for which they could not obtain rights. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Eminent domain==
[[Image:Chongqing yangjiaping 2007.jpg|thumb|The owners of this [[Chongqing]] &quot;[[nail house]]&quot; refused to leave it, thwarting plans for a shopping mall. Chinese law doesn't include eminent domain.]]
To construct roads, railroads, and similar transportation arteries, [[eminent domain]] has long been considered necessary. Although the benefit to society from the transportation route may be substantial, without eminent domain, every single property owner along the way must agree for the route to be built. This provides conditions for the tragedy of the anticommons, as even if hundreds agree, a single landowner can stop the road or railroad. The ability for one person to veto the construction drastically increases the transaction costs for such projects.
