      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4919">'''Petrocurrency''' is a [[portmanteau]] [[neologism]] used with three distinct meanings, though often confused:

#Trading surpluses of oil producing nations, originally called [[petrodollar]]s
#Currencies of oil producing nations which tend to rise in value against other currencies when the [[price of oil]] rises (and fall when it falls).
#Currencies used as a [[unit of account]] to price oil in the international market.

==Oil producers' trading surpluses==
With the large rise in oil prices in the 1970s, there was concern that the world economy might contract if the oil producers extracted money and failed to [[Petrodollar recycling|recycle]] it back to oil consumers.

With a similar rise in prices at the start of the 21st century, more of these oil surpluses have been reinvested through [[sovereign wealth fund]]s. Two early examples were the [[Kuwait Investment Authority]] and [[the Petroleum Fund of Norway]].

==Currencies correlated with oil prices==
The [[pound sterling]] has sometimes been regarded as a petrocurrency as a result of [[North Sea oil]] exports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cepr.org/pubs/Bulletin/meets/154.htm Sterling and the EMS In for a penny&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Dutch guilder]] was regarded as a petrocurrency due to its large quantities of natural gas and [[North Sea oil]] exports. This caused the Dutch Guilder to strengthen severely in the 1970s when the [[OPEC]] started their price hikes. As a result of this strengthening industrial manufacturing and services were crowded out and became non-competitive on world markets, a phenomenon that is often referred to in economics literature as [[Dutch disease]].

The [[Canadian dollar]] is increasingly viewed as a petrocurrency.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} As the price of oil rises, oil-related export revenues rise, and thus constitute a larger component of Canadian exports. Thus, the movements of the Canadian dollar have become increasingly correlated with the price of oil.  For example, the exchange rate of Canadian dollars for [[Japanese yen]] (99% of Japan's oil is imported) is 85% correlated with crude prices.

==Currencies used to trade oil==
Since the agreements of 1971 and 1973, OPEC oil is exclusively quoted in US dollars. This created a permanent demand for dollars on the international exchange markets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studien-von-zeitfragen.net/Zeitfragen/__Collapse_in_Iran/__collapse_in_iran.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://republic-news.org/archive/120-repub/120_crawford.htm The Iranian line in the sand], Dan Crawford, The Republic ([[Vancouver]]), August 18 to 31, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2005, OPEC continues to trade in US Dollars, but some OPEC members (such as [[Iran]] and [[Venezuela]]) have been pushing for a switch to the [[euro]].  

Since the beginning of 2003, Iran has required euro in payment of exports toward Asia and Europe. The government opened an [[Iranian Oil Bourse]] on the free trade zone on the island of [[Kish, Iran|Kish]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2199/html/economy.htm  Kish Oil Exchange Planned], [[Iran Daily]], January 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HC22Ak01.html A frenzied Persian new year], March 22, 2006, [[Asia Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; for the express purpose of trading oil priced in other currencies, including euros.
