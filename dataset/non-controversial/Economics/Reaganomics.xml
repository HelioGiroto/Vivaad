'''Reaganomics''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|r|eɪ|g|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|m|ɪ|k|s}}; (a [[portmanteau]] of ''Reagan'' and ''economics'' attributed to [[Paul Harvey]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/28/AR2009022802096_2.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=Broadcaster Delivered 'The Rest of the Story' |accessdate=March 1, 2009 |date=March 1, 2009 | first=Joe | last=Holley}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the [[economics|economic]] policies promoted by the [[United States President|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] during the 1980s. These policies are commonly associated with [[supply-side economics]], or pejoratively as [[trickle-down economics]].

The four pillars of Reagan's economic policy were to reduce the growth of government spending, reduce income tax and capital gains tax, reduce government regulation of economy, and control money supply to reduce inflation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nisk_concise&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Reaganomics.html |title=Reaganomics |accessdate= 2007-05-22|last = Niskanen | first = William A. | authorlink = William A. Niskanen | publisher= The [[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
[[File:Nominalrealoilprices1968-2006.png|thumb|Oil prices 1968–2006; peak is 1980, with steep decline over 1980s.]]

Prior to the Reagan administration, the United States economy experienced a decade of rising unemployment and inflation (known as [[stagflation]]). Political pressure favored stimulus resulting in an expansion of the money supply. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[wage and price controls]] were phased out.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenspan&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Greenspan |authorlink=Alan Greenspan |title=The Age of Turbulence |publisher=Penguin Press |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve|federal oil reserves]] were created to ease any future short term shocks. President [[Jimmy Carter]] had begun phasing out price controls on petroleum, while he created the Department of Energy. Much of the credit for the resolution of the stagflation is given to two causes: a three year contraction of the money supply by the [[Federal Reserve Board]] under [[Paul Volcker]], initiated in the last year of Carter's presidency,&lt;ref name=&quot;greenspan&quot; /&gt; and long term easing of supply and pricing in oil during the [[1980s oil glut]].

In his stated intention to increase defense spending while lowering taxes, Reagan's approach was a departure from his immediate predecessors. Reagan enacted lower marginal tax rates in conjunction with simplified income tax codes and continued [[deregulation]]. During Reagan's presidency the annual deficits averaged 4.2% of GDP&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Historical Tables&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf |title=CBO Historical Tables |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; after inheriting an annual deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 1980 under president Carter.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Historical Tables&quot;/&gt; The real (inflation adjusted) rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. GDP per working-age adult, which had increased at only a 0.8% annual rate during the Carter administration, increased at a 1.8% rate during the Reagan administration. The increase in productivity growth was even higher: output per hour in the business sector, which had been roughly constant in the Carter years, increased at a 1.4% rate in the Reagan years.&lt;ref name=&quot;nisk_concise&quot;/&gt;

Before Reagan's election, supply side policy was considered unconventional by the moderate wing of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. While running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980, [[George H. W. Bush]] had derided Reaganomics as &quot;voodoo economics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/270292.stm |title=Reagonomics or 'voodoo economics'? |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-06-05 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1976, [[Gerald Ford]] had severely criticized Reagan's proposal to turn back a large part of the Federal budget to the states. Reagan's policies have since become widely accepted by many Republicans.

==Justifications==
[[File:US high-income effective tax rates.png|thumb|Average tax rate percentages for the highest-income U.S. taxpayers, 1945-2009]]

In his [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|1980 campaign]] speeches, Reagan presented his economic proposals as a return to the [[free enterprise]] principles that had been in favor before the [[Great Depression]]. At the same time he attracted a following from the [[supply-side economics]] movement, which formed in opposition to [[Keynesian]] demand-stimulus economics. This movement produced some of the strongest supporters for Reagan's policies during his term in office.

The contention of the proponents, that the tax rate cuts would more than pay for themselves, was influenced by a theoretical taxation model based on the elasticity of tax rates, known as the [[Laffer curve]]. [[Arthur Laffer|Arthur Laffer's]] model predicts that excessive tax rates actually reduce potential tax revenues, by lowering the incentive to produce; the model also predicts that insufficient tax rates (rates below the optimum level for a given economy) lead directly to a reduction in tax revenues.

==Policies==
President Reagan lifted remaining domestic petroleum price and allocation controls on January 28, 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Executive Order 12287 -- Decontrol of Crude Oil and Refined Petroleum Products |date=January 28, 1981 |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1981/12881a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lowered the oil [[windfall profits tax]] in August 1981. He ended the oil windfall profits tax. Reagan followed his 1981 tax cuts with the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], which sought to eliminate deductions, lower marginal rates for the wealthy, and significantly raise taxes on those earning less than $50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2011-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets |title=U.S. Federal Individual Income Tax Rates History, 1913-2011 (Nominal and Inflation-Adjusted Brackets) |author= |date=September 9, 2011 |publisher=Tax Foundation |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://moneyland.time.com/2011/12/01/the-tragic-death-of-the-temporary-tax-cut/ | work=Time | title=The Tragic Death of the Temporary Tax Cut | date=2011-10-01 | accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Reagan agreed to a rollback of corporate tax cuts and a smaller rollback of individual income tax cuts. The 1982 tax increase undid a third of the initial tax cut. In 1983 Reagan instituted a payroll tax on Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance.&lt;ref name=KrugmanGreatTaxer&gt;{{cite news |title=The Great Taxer |author=Paul Krugman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/08/opinion/the-great-taxer.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 8, 2004 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], Reagan and Congress sought to raise taxes on lower incomes, eliminate many deductions, and reduce tax rates on the wealthy. In 1983, Democrats [[Bill Bradley]] and [[Dick Gephardt]] had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The eventual bipartisan 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also partially &quot;cleaned up&quot; the tax base by curbing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. Ultimately, the combination of the increase in tax rates on lower incomes and decrease in deductions raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aei.org/article/economics/fiscal-policy/taxes/the-tax-reform-evidence-from-1986/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=The tax reform evidence from 1986 | date=October 24, 2011 | accessdate=January 21, 2012 | first1=Martin | last1=Feldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary effect of the tax changes over the course of Reagan's term in office was a change in the ''composition'' of tax revenue, towards payroll and new investment, and away from higher earners and capital gains on existing investments. Federal revenue share of GDP fell from 19.6% in fiscal 1981 to 17.3% in 1984, before rising back to 18.4% by fiscal year 1989. Personal income tax revenues fell during this period relative to GDP, while payroll tax revenues rose relative to GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Historical Tables&quot;/&gt; President Ronald Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20%—its lowest level since the Hoover administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctj.org/hid_ent/part-2/part2-2.htm | publisher=Citizens for Tax Justice | title=The Hidden Entitlements: Capital Gains |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tax benefits the wealthy, however, in 1986 President Reagan set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/us/politics/for-wealthy-tax-cuts-since-1980s-have-been-gain-gain.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Since 1980s, the Kindest of Tax Cuts for the Rich | date=2012-01-18 | accessdate=January 21, 2012 | first1=David | last1=Kocieniewski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan significantly increased public expenditures, primarily the Department of Defense, which rose (in constant 2000 dollars) from $267.1 billion in 1980 (4.9% of GDP and 22.7% of public expenditure) to $393.1 billion in 1988 (5.8% of GDP and 27.3% of public expenditure); most of those years military spending was about 6% of GDP, exceeding this number in 4 different years. All these numbers had not been seen since the end of U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2006/pdf/hist.pdf Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government], 2006, table 6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the maximum tax rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=5324&amp;type=0&amp;sequence=0 |title= Effective Federal Tax Rates: 1979-2001 | publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis | date = July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal deficit fell from 6% of GDP in 1983 to 3.2% of GDP in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The Democratic Fisc |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703995104575389430430274968.html |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal deficit in Reagan's final budget fell to 2.9% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;nisk_concise&quot;/&gt; The rate of growth in Federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name=&quot;nisk_concise&quot;/&gt; As a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the [[national debt]] from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm |title= Historical Debt Outstanding |publisher=U.S. Treasury Department |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the U.S. moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Debt&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26402-2004Jun8.html |title=Reagan Policies Gave Green Light to Red Ink |accessdate= May 25, 2007 |newspaper= The Washington Post | date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan described the new debt as the &quot;greatest disappointment&quot; of his presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon128&quot;&gt;Cannon, Lou (2001) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William A. Niskanen]], one of the architects of Reaganomics, &quot;Reagan delivered on each of his four major policy objectives, although not to the extent that he and his supporters had hoped&quot;, and notes that the most substantial change was in the tax code, where the top marginal individual income tax rate fell from 70.1% to 28.4%, and there was a &quot;major reversal in the tax treatment of business income&quot;, with effect of &quot;reducing the tax bias among types of investment but increasing the average effective tax rate on new investment&quot;. [[Roger Porter]], another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;nisk_concise&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niskanen continues: &quot;It is not clear whether this measure [reduce bias, increase effective tax rate on new investment] was a net improvement in the tax code.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; President Reagan, has remained popular as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency, all in the name of fiscal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/19/business/economy/tax-pledge-may-scuttle-deal-to-cut-deficit-economic-memo.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Tax Pledge May Scuttle a Deal on Deficit | date=November 18, 2011 | accessdate=January 27, 2012 | first1=Catherine | last1=Rampell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan ultimately raised taxes more times than he cut them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18563_162-7111732.html | work=[[CBS News]] | title=Reagan's Tax Increases | date=December 3, 2010 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | first=Katie | last=Couric | authorlink = Katie Couric}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Paul Krugman]], &quot;Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of G.D.P., the increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase.&quot;&lt;ref name=KrugmanGreatTaxer /&gt; According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/bruce-bartlett/1632/reagans-tax-increases | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Reagan's Tax Increases | date=April 6, 2012 | accessdate=April 29, 2012 | first=Paul | last=Barlett | authorlink = Bruce Bartlett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spending during Reagan's two terms (FY 1981–88) averaged 22.4% GDP, well above the 20.6% GDP average from 1971 to 2009. In addition, the public debt rose from 26% GDP in 1980 to 41% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2,052 billion in 1988, a roughly three-fold increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Historical Tables&quot;/&gt; The unemployment rate rose from 7% in 1980 to 10.8% in 1982, then declined to 5.4% in 1988. The inflation rate declined from 10% in 1980 to 4% in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;nisk_concise&quot;/&gt;

Many economists have stated that Reagan's policies were an important part of bringing about the second longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history, and followed by an even longer 1990s expansion that began under [[George H.W. Bush]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=nationalreview&gt;{{cite news |title=Debt, Lies, and Inflation |author=Paul Craig Roberts |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/reagan/roberts200406101413.asp |newspaper=National Review |date=August 31, 1992 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Jennifer M. |year=1994 |title=The 1990-1991 Recession: How Bad was the Labor Market? |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=117 |issue=6 |pages=3–11 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1994/06/art1full.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=6 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This economic expansion continued through the Clinton administration with unemployment rates steadily decreasing throughout his presidency (7.3% at the start of his presidency and 4.2% at the culmination, with the lowest rate reaching 3.9% in 2000).&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Labor Statistics via The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/UNRATE.txt |title=Civilian Unemployment Rate |date=August 3, 2012 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Labor Statistics |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Reagan administration, the American economy went from a GDP growth of -0.3% in 1980 to 4.1% in 1988 (in constant 2005 dollars),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls |title=Gross Domestic Product |date=July 27, 2012 |publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis |format=Microsoft Excel spreadsheet |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduced the unemployment rate by 1.6%, from 7.1% in 1980 to 5.5% in 1988, but with peaks of around 10.8% in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Labor Statistics via The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat01.htm |title=Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey: Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population, 1941 to date |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor: Bureau of Labor Statistics |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A net job increase of about 21 million also occurred through mid-1990.

===Unemployment rates===
[[File:Employment growth by top tax rate.jpg|thumb|right|Average annual growth in U.S. employment, by top income tax bracket rate, 1940-2011]]

The job growth under the Reagan administration was an average of 2.1% per year, with unemployment averaging 7.5%. The unemployment averaged 6.4 percent under [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] and 7.8 percent under [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS14000000 The National Unemployment Rate, The Bureau of Labor Statistics, bls.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth rates===
Comparing the recovery from the 1981–82 recession (1983–1990) with the years between 1971 (end of a recession) and 1980 shows that the rate of growth of real GDP per capita averaged 2.77 under Reagan and 2.50% under Nixon, Ford and Carter. Following the recession, the unemployment rate had averaged slightly higher (6.75% vs. 6.35%), productivity growth lower (1.38% vs. 1.92%), and private investment as a percentage of GDP slightly less (16.08% vs. 16.86%). Real wages were lower following the recession, while real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niskanen1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mindcontagion.org/html/real_wages.html |title=What's Happening with Real Wages |publisher=Mind Contagion |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal income tax and payroll tax levels===
During the Reagan administration, federal receipts grew from $618 billion to $991 billion (an increase of 60%); while outlays grew from $ 746 billion to $1144 billion (an increase of 53%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/budget.php |title=Federal Budget Receipts and Outlays |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/pdf/4a.pdf |title=Table 4.A1—Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, selected years 1937–2007 (in millions of dollars) |publisher=U.S. Social Security Administration |format=PDF |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1996 report of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress, during Reagan's two terms, and through 1993, the top 10% of taxpayers paid an increased share of income taxes (not including payroll taxes) to the Federal government, while the lowest 50% of taxpayers paid a reduced share of income tax revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;JEC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/jec/fiscal/tx-grwth/reagtxct/reagtxct.htm |title=The Reagan Tax Cuts: Lessons for Tax Reform |author=Christopher Frenze |date=April 1996 |work= |publisher=Congress of the United States, Joint Economic Committee |accessdate=March 22, 2011 |archivedate=February 26, 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090226201115/http://www.house.gov/jec/fiscal/tx-grwth/reagtxct/reagtxct.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal income tax revenues declined from 9.4% GDP in 1981 to 8.3% GDP in 1989, while payroll tax revenues increased from 6.0% GDP to 6.7% GDP during the same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Historical Tables&quot;/&gt; This represented a more regressive tax regime, with more revenue derived from the flat payroll tax versus the [[progressive tax|progressive]] income tax.

According to a [[United States Department of the Treasury]] economic study,&lt;ref name=taxtable&gt;{{Cite web |author=Jerry Tempalski |publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |title=Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills |date=2003, rev. September 2006 |url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/ota81.pdf |format=PDF |id=Working Paper 81, Table 2 |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the major tax bills enacted under Reagan, in the short term, increased total tax revenue and reduced the tax burden on the economy (~-1% of GDP). The [[Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981]] resulted in a reduced tax burden on the economy (~-3% of GDP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Thorndike, Joseph J |publisher=Taxhistory.org |title=Historical Perspective: The Reagan Legacy |date= June 14, 2004 |url=http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/cf7c9c870b600b9585256df80075b9dd/3df8b954567e6c8c85256eb300588d4b?OpenDocument |accessdate=November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other tax bills had neutral or, in the case of the [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982]], a (~+1% of GDP) increase in revenue as a share of GDP. It should be however noted that the study did not examine the longer-term impact of Reagan tax policy, including sunset clauses and &quot;the long-run, fully-phased-in effect of the tax bills&quot;.&lt;ref name=taxtable/&gt; The fact that tax receipts ''as a percentage of GDP'' fell following the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 shows a decrease in tax burden as share of GDP. Total tax revenue from income tax receipts increased during this time. The economic growth and increase in GDP outpaced the increase in tax receipt revenue, resulting in a slightly reduced tax burden as a percentage of GDP for the economy.

The effect of Reagan's tax cuts were at least partially offset by phased in Social Security payroll tax increases that had been enacted by President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Agresti, James D. and Stephen F. Cardone (January 27, 2011).[http://www.justfacts.com/socialsecurity.asp#%5B27%5D Social Security Facts]. Retrieved March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An accounting indicated nominal tax receipts increased from $599 billion in 1981 to $1.032 trillion in 1990, an increase of 72% in current dollars. In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/hist01z3.xls|format=xls |title=Table 1.3—Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) in Current Dollars, Constant (FY 2005) Dollars, and as Percentages of GDP: 1940–2015|publisher=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|accessdate=October 12, 2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 to 2000, receipts increased by 90% in current dollars, or 60% in 2005 dollars.

===Fiscal consequences===
The nominal national debt rose from $900 billion to $2.8 trillion during Reagan's tenure, an average national budget deficit per year of $237.5 billion, as compared to an average national budget deficit per year of $56.9 billion during Carter's tenure. The federal deficit as percentage of [[GDP]] rose from 2.65% of GDP in 1980, Carter's final budget year, to 3.04% of GDP in 1988, Reagan's final budget year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/downchart_gs.php?year=1900_2010&amp;view=1&amp;expand=&amp;units=p&amp;fy=fy11&amp;chart=G0-fed&amp;bar=0&amp;stack=1&amp;size=l&amp;title=US%20Federal%20Deficit%20As%20Percent%20Of%20GDP&amp;state=US&amp;color=c&amp;local=s#copypaste US Federal Deficit As Percent Of GDP, Fiscal Years 1900 to 2010, Retrieved 2012-08-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
[[File:Distribution of Wealth in the United States.jpg|thumb|U.S. mean family net worth by percentile of net worth (1989–2010).]]
According to a 1996 study by [[William A. Niskanen]] and Stephen Moore:&lt;ref name=&quot;Niskanen1996&quot;&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-261.html Supply-Side Tax Cuts and the Truth about the Reagan Economic Record], by [[William A. Niskanen]] and Stephen Moore&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 of the 10 key economic variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was worse in the Reagan period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niskanen1996&quot;/&gt;

Stephen Moore stated, &quot;No act in the last quarter century had a more profound impact on the U.S. economy of the eighties and nineties than the Reagan tax cut of 1981.&quot; He claims that Reagan's tax cuts, combined with an emphasis on federal monetary policy, deregulation, and expansion of free trade created a sustained economic expansion creating America's greatest sustained wave of prosperity ever. He also claims that the American economy grew by more than a third in size, producing a $15 trillion increase in American wealth. Consumer and investor confidence soared. Cutting federal income taxes, cutting the U.S. government spending budget, cutting useless programs, scaling down the government work force, maintaining low interest rates, and keeping a watchful inflation hedge on the monetary supply was Ronald Reagan's formula for a successful economic turnaround.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niskanen1996&quot;/&gt;

[[Milton Friedman]] stated, &quot;Reaganomics had four simple principles: Lower marginal tax rates, less regulation, restrained government spending, noninflationary monetary policy. Though Reagan did not achieve all of his goals, he made good progress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot;&gt;[http://www.cato.org/speeches/sp-mf050693.html The Real Free Lunch: Markets and Private Property]&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs flourished as a result of Reaganomics: Lower tax rates and inflation coupled with less regulation favored improved environments for market-based funding, risk-taking, access to labor (leading to greater employment), and a more level playing field between these entrepreneurs and large corporations. Further, the [[Heritage Foundation]] stated, &quot;the U.S. government must allow the entrepreneur to enjoy the rewards of success. If taxes take away most profit, then the entrepreneur will have less incentive to take a risk. If there are great restrictions on how the entrepreneur can use his profit, then there is little reason for the entrepreneur to take a risk. The entrepreneur's courage to take a risk is what leads to new American discoveries and what drives the U.S. economy forward. Reaganomics knows this. It is one of the reasons why Ronald Reagan has reduced American taxes dramatically.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage&quot;&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/reaganomics-and-conservatisms-future-two-lectures-in-china Reaganomics and Conservatism's Future: Two Lectures in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]] and its impact on the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2011-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrara&quot;&gt;Ferrara, Peter (May 5, 2011).[http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2011/05/05/reaganomics-vs-obamanomics-facts-and-figures/ Reaganomics Vs. Obamanomics: Facts And Figures]. ''Forbes''&lt;/ref&gt; The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced [[bracket creep]] from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter the tax system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leiserson&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Leiserson |first=Greg |url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/411703_individual_amt.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Individual Alternative Minimum Tax: Historical Data and Projections |year=2008 |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] &amp; [[Urban Institute]] |accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/arc-exec_summary-2006.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Taxpayer Advocate 2006 Annual Report to Congress-Executive Summary |publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leiserson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/alternative_minimum_tax/index.html |title=Alternative Minimum Tax |year=2008 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-07-29 |first1=Carl |last1=Hulse |first2=Suevon |last2=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued the economic expansion during the Reagan administration was primarily the result of the [[business cycle]] and the monetary policy by Paul Volcker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/nroubini/SUPPLY.HTM | work=Stern School of Business | title=Supply Side Economics: Do Tax Rate Cuts Increase Growth and Revenues and Reduce Budget Deficits ? Or Is It Voodoo Economics All Over Again? | year=1997 | accessdate=2012-01-10 | first1=Nouriel | last1=Roubini}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman argues that there was nothing unusual about the economy under Reagan because unemployment was reducing from a high peak and that it is consistent with Keynesian economics for the economy to grow as employment increases if inflation remains low.&lt;ref name=&quot;krugman&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Krugman|2004|quote| The secret of the long climb after 1982 was the economic plunge that preceded it. By the end of 1982 the recession in U.S. economy was deeply depressed, with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression. So there was plenty of room to grow before the economy returned to anything like full employment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO Historical Tables indicate that federal spending during Reagan's two terms (FY 1981–88) averaged 22.4% GDP, well above the 20.6% GDP average from 1971 to 2009. In addition, the public debt rose from 26.1% GDP in 1980 to 41.0% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2,052 billion in 1988, a three-fold increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBO Historical Tables&quot;/&gt; Krugman argued in June 2012 that Reagan's policies were consistent with Keynesian stimulus theories, pointing to the significant increase in per capita spending under Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/opinion/krugman-reagan-was-a-keynesian.html NYT-Paul Krugman-Reagan was a Keynesian-June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William A. Niskanen|William Niskanen]] noted that during the Reagan years privately held federal debt increased from 22% to 38% of GDP, despite a long peacetime expansion. Second, the [[savings and loan crisis|savings and loan problem]] led to an additional debt of about $125 billion. Third, greater enforcement of U.S. trade laws increased the share of U.S. imports subjected to trade restrictions from 12% in 1980 to 23% in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;nisk_concise&quot;/&gt;

Economists [[Raghuram Rajan]] and [[Luigi Zingales]] pointed out that many deregulation efforts had either taken place or begun before Reagan (note the deregulation of airlines and trucking under Carter, and the beginning of deregulatory reform in railroads, telephones, natural gas, and banking). They stated, &quot;The move toward markets preceded the leader [Reagan] who is seen as one of their saviors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists]] p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Economists [[Paul Joskow]] and Roger Noll made a similar contention.&lt;ref&gt;''American Economic Policy in the 1980s,'' ed. Martin Feldstein, NBER 1994, pp. 371–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[William A. Niskanen]], a member of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers wrote that deregulation had the &quot;lowest priority&quot; of the items on the Reagan agenda&lt;ref name=&quot;nisk_concise&quot;/&gt; given that Reagan &quot;failed to sustain the momentum for deregulation initiated in the 1970s&quot; and that he &quot;added more trade barriers than any administration since Hoover.&quot; By contrast, economist [[Milton Friedman]] has pointed to the number of pages added to the [[Federal Register]] each year as evidence of Reagan's anti-regulation presidency (the Register records the rules and regulations that federal agencies issue per year). The number of pages added to the Register each year declined sharply at the start of the Ronald Reagan presidency breaking a steady and sharp increase since 1960. The increase in the number of pages added per year resumed an upward, though less steep, trend after Reagan left office. In contrast, the number of pages being added each year increased under Ford, Carter, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Friedman |first=Milton |date=June 11, 2004 |title=Freedom's Friend |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3020261.html |accessdate=December 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of pages in Federal Register is however criticized as an extremely crude measure of regulatory activity, because it can be easily manipulated (e.g. font sizes have been changed to keep page count low).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/09/reining-in-the-regulators-how-does-president-bush-measure-up |title=Reining in the Regulators: How Does President Bush Measure Up?|author=James Gattuso|date=September 28, 2004|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent contradiction between Niskanen's statements and Friedman's data may be resolved by seeing Niskanen as referring to ''statutory'' deregulation (laws passed by Congress) and Friedman to ''administrative'' deregulation (rules and regulations implemented by federal agencies).
