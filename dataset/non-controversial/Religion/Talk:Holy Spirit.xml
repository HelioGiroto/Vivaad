== Serious POV ==

The lead and most of the beginning of this article is trinitarian POV. It does not take a scholar to see this. Would someone with a more neutral stance look at this please? [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 01:38, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

===NPOV request===
I have read the talk page and now I am amazed. I am tagging this article NPOV (at this point). Key elements of Wikipedia are not &quot;apply guidlines as you feel like it&quot; or because a majority has a certain belief we are justified using POV. I have not seen anywhere that we can be neutral if there is &quot;exactly&quot; a 50-50 ratio of opinions or beliefs and that the ratio of neutrality deminishes as the ratio (of editors) leans one way or the other. I really do not have the time at present to get into this against a stacked deck but will brush up to accomodate any that can not find a '''Balance''' for the lead. Wikipedia is not a vehicle to further an agenda, political, religious, or other, to weasel, sway, or use a supposed &quot;majority&quot; as a reason to bend an article in one direction. 

A neutral lead with appropriate sections (including &quot;Trinitarian&quot;} is a solution. This article, as written, is a mistitled [[Holy Spirit (Mainstream Trinitarian Christianity) ]] and needs work. [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 03:53, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

===2nd NPOV request===
All of the fine writers that have graced the pages of this article seem to be on vacation. I have made a legitimate request, seeking input and consensus, and received no response. 
*The lead, as written, is not acceptable for an article concerning a subject that is of universal importance and with such varied beliefs listed in the body of the article.
:'''&quot;In Christianity, the Holy Spirit, or Holy Ghost, is the spirit or essence of God. In Trinitarian Christian belief, it is the third person of the Holy Trinity. Pneumatology, is the theology of the Holy Spirit.&quot;''' I do not care what belief a person holds this is &quot;not&quot; a lead for this article and Wikipedia policies will back that up with too many instances to list. I &quot;do not&quot; wish to make changes to an article of such importance without the input from others. I actually do not even want to be the lead on such a quest so am asking (2nd request 3rd notice) for someone else to weigh in. Surely with all the brilliant minds floating around Wikipedia there are some that can assist with a lead to properly introduce the subject of an article and be shown as a not a weasel advertisement for &quot;any&quot; particular belief. I will have no choice but to remove the parts that violate Wikipedia policy and leave:
'''In Christianity, the Holy Spirit, or Holy  Ghost, is the spirit or essence of God. Pneumatology, is the theology of the Holy Spirit.''' This is not much for a lead. Any that wish to expound on any particular belief have ample opportunity to do so in the body of the article. Please do not mistake my request for lack of &quot;boldness&quot;. I have read some disturbing entries in this talk that are most certainly POV leaning in presentation to lead the article in one particular direction and, under the title of this article, is not encyclopedic.
::On a separate note could someone with more knowledge archive at least to the section #Holy Ghost. [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 15:07, 20 July 2010 (UTC)
*I don't know if I understand your objections to the current lead.  If the bulk of the article concerns the Holy Spirit from a Trinitarian perspective, the fact that the Roman Catholic and various Eastern Orthodox churches pre-date (by 15 centuries) and VASTLY outnumber non-Trinitarian Protestant churches (in membership) would justly account for that.  Are you really suggesting that &quot;In Trinitarian Christian belief, it is the third person of the Holy Trinity&quot; (or words to that effect) does not belong in the lead?  If so, you are way, way off. --[[User:Griseum|Griseum]] ([[User talk:Griseum|talk]]) 01:23, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

:I agree with Griseum on this. Just because there are Christians who are not Trinitarian does not mean that Wikipedia cannot recognize that the vast majority of Christians are Trinitarian and believe the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity. Even if we were to agree with you, I am not sure what the solution would be. What would you expect us to do to balance out the lead? I suppose we could add &quot;In non-Trinitarian Christian belief, it is ''not'' the third person of the Trinity,&quot; but somehow that seems obviously redundant and not very useful. The lead clearly says &quot;In Trinitarian Christian belief.&quot; It is not saying that all Christian believe this, only that Trinitarians do. However as Trinitarians make up most Christians, it is perfectly right that this be mentioned in the lead. I see no POV issue. [[User:Ltwin|Ltwin]] ([[User talk:Ltwin|talk]]) 04:45, 24 July 2010 (UTC)
 
I am stating, and justifiably so, that the title of the article is not the '''''Trinitarian Holy Spirit''''' any less than it should be the '''''Nontrinitarian Holy Spirit''''' or any other added name.
::If an editor(s) wishes to explain a particular belief, in such a universally accepted subject, such as placement in the Godhead, then an article with such intent can be created. I do believe the '''''Trinity''''' article, redirected from Holy Trinity, does satisfy that criteria
::&quot;If&quot; Trinitarian is to be used then per [[WP:Manual of Style (lead section)]] due weight must be given to other views or opposing views since singular inclusion is controversial.
::This means that some inclusion is imperative to be balanced to the article and not a particular belief that contradicts the title. The lead should be informative and interesting to get the reader to go farther. Suggestions: Expanding the term &quot; Pneumatology&quot;, a brief inclusion that the Dogmas of (most) Christian entities arise in difference in interpretation of the role of the Holy Spirit. This includes fundamental differences between '''Trinitarians''', Non-Trinitarians, as well as Non-Christians---and also if wanted the inclusion of Binitarianism,
Bitheism, and Ditheism.
::I believe other names of the Holy Spirit, referred to such as &quot;Pneuma&quot; and others, should be edited into the lead. The First heading needs to be edited to reflect information consistent with the contents. THEN- A section on &quot;Trinitarian&quot; belief, before the breakdown, and leading to the sub-sections (related), can be included. This main section and subsections will then be  '''Hugh''' or of considerable size indicative of the reported size of Trinitarian beliefs in society. This will lead to a well rounded article, balanced, NPOV, and acceptable to remove the tags. Also, by including the lacking information the lead will be expanded considerably to reflect a nice look to go along with a nice article. Whew! so this is a few thoughts needing comments. [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 02:41, 25 July 2010 (UTC)
Your comments are difficult to interpret.  I do, however, stand by my previous assertion that the current lead is acceptable and NPOV. --[[User:Griseum|Griseum]] ([[User talk:Griseum|talk]]) 13:41, 25 July 2010 (UTC)
*The above comment flabbergasts me. I could see I might have been lacking in other comments but I gave reasoning and possible suggestions for inclusion of information for a better lead, in what would be referred to as &quot;in plain English&quot;, to solve issues. I receive a reply that either I did not write in plain English or the parties replying have some problem with &quot;all&quot; (since no reference was offered as to what particular part was &quot;difficult to interpret&quot;) of my comments, but at least enough was understood to give comments that there was no POV but, &quot;the current lead is acceptable and NPOV.&quot;. I may not be the brightest bulb in the lamp of the universe, and may actually have fallen off the proverbial turnip wagon, but a [[Non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]] statement; to present that one does not understand another but knows that he is wrong, is not conducive to a discussion, a consensus, or a better article. I did look back to see if my comments slipped into a [[Word salad]]. Certainly, as described above but apparently not understood, the lead (as written) can be edited to reflect the full scope of the title so neither the lead can be called into question or the title. I gave suggestions, as comments requested, and none were commented on. I would like to assume the reason was not understanding or lack of clarity but I am having some trouble with this. I am &quot;not&quot; requesting the removal of anything. I am requesting that material presented in the lead be balanced, more complete, and in good faith seek a consensus to that end. The above, &quot;In Trinitarian Christian belief.&quot;, standing alone, is exactly what I am referring to so I gave a suggestion, &quot;a brief inclusion that the Dogmas of (most) Christian entities arise in difference in interpretation of the role of the Holy Spirit. This includes fundamental differences between '''Trinitarians''', Non-Trinitarians, as well as Non-Christians...&quot;.
:With that said I would ask that editors weigh in with constructive comments that would include reasoning concerning solicited and given comments. Considering that, being valid, my suggestions includes &quot;other sides of the coin&quot; (not redundant), and an other than a singular point of view, with the fact that there are other points of views to follow in the body of the article. With fair editing (consensus) I feel some form of inclusion of the suggestions I provided would enhance the article. [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 14:44, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

In continuing for clarity I would suggest that the first section be edited and appropriate parts moved into a section that would be titled, &quot;Trinitarian Christian belief&quot;, or such to:
* 1)- Set the tone for subsections of beliefs that hold this view, provided there is consensus and acceptance.
* 2)- Allow for the lead inclusion of &quot;Trinitarian&quot;, of which currently there is none, to be included.
* 3)- Consolidates references, especially from the lead, for the article to flow seamlessly.
:By-the-way, at this point, the &quot;bulk of the article&quot; does not exactly address &quot;the Holy Spirit from a clear '''''Trinitarian perspective'''''&quot; anyway, being introduced and then sort of dropped. &quot;Trinitarianism&quot; or the &quot;Trinitarian Christian belief&quot; surely would be doctrine or belief within '''''Variations in Doctrine'''''. Since it would be a core doctrine to those that are of like belief this could be the first sub-section within the section, or directly under &quot;Variations of doctrine&quot; explaining this in detail. This would certainly tie in what appears to be &quot;hanging elements&quot; that are discussed. That would be somebody else's decision or project but just ideas.
::The lead however, introduces &quot;Trinitarian&quot;, and &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; and the section &quot;Christian doctrine&quot; introduces &quot;mainstream Christianity&quot; and &quot;trinity&quot;. To the average reader there would be a clear loss of continuity and possible assumptions that need not be there. The are clear sections on &quot;other beliefs&quot; to include &quot;Nontrinitarian&quot; but no actual reference to the proclaimed belief introduced in the lead. If, as claimed, the Trinitarian belief is &quot;mainstream&quot; and includes the majority of christian beliefs there is ample opportunity to touch on, discuss, or at the least provide references (even if inline) to back this up, or point to articles that add to this information. I am &quot;not&quot; questioning this just making a valid point.
:I think, for an article this size, that the lead is very lacking to promote interest to read farther into this article. It seems to me that with editing, (and expanding) the sections at least by one (or a lead in under Variations in Doctrine), the ensuing clarifications will make a better article.

I hope that my ideas are more clear or understandable than previous. I am sure that it should be understandable now that my suggestions are an attempt to improve the lead, add information consistent to the article, and in conflict with what might have been previously surmised, actually expand (certainly by adding to the body) the &quot;fact&quot; that the &quot;Trinitarian belief&quot; is mainstream, and certainly a view held by the majority of the Christian world, as citations, references, and sources will bear out. Facts are &quot;facts&quot; and even if disagreed with can not be repudiated.
:While I am being bold I mean no ill will but since suggestions are flowing I will add that, &quot;Symbols of the Holy Spirit&quot;, being placed obstructively between &quot;Christian doctrine&quot; and the very related &quot;Variations in Doctrine&quot;, could be moved to above Fruit of the Spirit. If symbols are considered attributes (or maybe manifestations) but at any rate related, these can be sectioned with subsections, but it seems can be all grouped together. It would also seem that the section, &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; or &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;, would be far closer to the top. It does explain and give definition to the subject that is also the title. For some reason I would think it would be the first section or maybe a paragraph in the lead.
::So if you will please look at what I have written, and consider some variation of the first suggestion for the lead (included for ease of reference);
'''''Suggestions''''': Expanding the term &quot; Pneumatology&quot;, a brief inclusion that the Dogmas of (most) Christian entities arise in differences of interpretation of the role of the Holy Spirit. This includes fundamental differences between '''Trinitarians''', Non-Trinitarians, as well as Non-Christians---and also if wanted the inclusion of Binitarianism,
Bitheism, and Ditheism. While considering this and possibly considering the other suggestions, along with ensuing edits, this article can be indicative of a [[WP:Good article|good article]] and maybe even a [[WP: Featured article|featured article]]. [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 19:35, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

[[User:Otr500|Otr500]], I am glad you are taking a passionate interest in this article.  Thanks for clarifying your suggestions.  I think you might be perceiving POV-pushing and potential conflict where there isn't any, but I generally agree with your ideas.  Here are mine:
*I don't think the current lead is biased or POV, but that doesn't mean it I'm adverse to improving it.  Maybe something like “Trinitarian, Non-Trinitarian Christians and various Non-Christian groups hold fundamental differences in belief about the Holy Spirit” could be the third sentence of the lead.  Leaving the second sentence in place seems okay to me, and important enough to include in the lead, but I can imagine other variations of text that would serve the same purpose.
*“Variations in Doctrine” and “Non-Trinitarian views” are already major sections in the article.  “Non-Christian views” is also a section in the article.  While there is always room for improvement, this article seem to be on the right track.
*As for expounding on the term “pneumatology&quot; a bit, talking about Bitheism, moving stuff around, or whatever else you want to do, all these things could potentially improve the article if done right.
*I do understand why certain passages in the article might irk you.  I think (for example) that the sentence “Within mainstream Christianity, the Holy Spirit is one of the three persons of the Trinity” could be improved.  For this one, I'd suggest “The Holy Spirit is one of the three persons of the Trinity for the majority of Christians, including Catholics, Eastern Christians, and many Protestants.”
*Likewise, I see the problem with the first section being labeled “Christian doctrine” when it is really about Trinitarian Christian doctrine.  Wikipedia is a work in progress, right?
In summary, I don't think the current lead is ''un''acceptable but agree it could be expanded.  I don't see the article as needing emergency surgery, but I see room for improvement along lines you have suggested.--[[User:Griseum|Griseum]] ([[User talk:Griseum|talk]]) 03:32, 27 July 2010 (UTC)
:Improving an article is a good thing and I do not see any catastrophic occurrence requiring &quot;emergency surgery&quot; either. I had to conclude other business but I will see what I can do and comment here for consensus. If someone comments, considering a forming consensus, lets start a new section like '''''Article Improvement''''' or the like and retire this section--but not before I can look back at what was discussed.

== inappropriate references ==

I noticed a couple of unacceptable cites.  First of all, there's a couple to geocities websites and geocities doesn't exist anymore.  Those I saw used in relation to reference 44.  Also, reference 31 is to biblelight, a personal website by a non-expert.  The exact URL is also to a foreward about a book, which really isn't usable in wikipedia no matter who wrote it.  I figure that alternative sources can be found for the article, which is why I'm not deleting anything yet.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 03:19, 29 May 2010 (UTC)

== Improvements ==

Surprise! As I understand it the Trinitarian belief, referred to as believing in the [[Trinity]], is a view held by the majority of Christian denominations, and is therefore regarded as [[Mainstream Christianity]]. This requires prominence, not so much sentence placement, and thus a lead-in. From what I read in [[WP: DUE]] it does not mean '''''equally''''' balanced but balanced in presenting views equal to the prominence of material. I bet you didn't expect that? It would be great though if there is a reference (foot note behind Mainstream Christianity) that points to some number availability. I am sure it is out there. Of course this is just a quick thing I threw together and I would not pretend to think great or even acceptable, just a start for ideas. I added material concerning the Trinitarian belief (with prominence reflected in size) but I have no actual idea if the complete content is sought, changes are needed, or if I missed the proverbial nail by a  &quot;country mile&quot; since that is not my forte. The point is I am trying (and I hope not too terribly) to create a lead, that can stand alone, that is inclusive, that is indicative of the contents, and probably satisfies Wikipedia criteria to remove tags. Also note there are now references in the lead.
*The contents of the first section can be replaced (gave a suggestion) down to, &quot;The Holy Spirit is believed...&quot;, as now the Trinitarian part is moved up for mentioned prominence.  If there is a desire to change or trim down Trinitarian belief some of the other ideas might be sought such as a Trinitarian lead-in under &quot;Variations in Doctrine&quot; with other trinitarian beliefs listed as sub-sections. That is not that important but would look good if acceptable. I also noticed under &quot;Catholicism&quot; there is no mention or link to [[Trinitarian Order]] and this seems odd.
*Also Oneness Pentecostal is obviously a sub-section of &quot;Non-trinitarian views&quot;. I have not forgot about moving &quot;Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost up towards the top and moving some of the other things but the lead is far more important. The good news is if you don't like it you probably can't shoot me. What did I screw up and how to fix?
:'''''Suggestion''''' for the lead;

In [[Christianity]], the '''Holy Spirit''', or '''Holy Ghost''', is the [[spirit]] or essence of [[God in Christianity|God]]. [[Pneumatology]] is the theological doctrine or [[Christian theology]] of the Holy Spirit. The [[Dogma]]s of [[Trinitarian]] and [[Non-Trinitarian]] Christians, along with various Non-Christian groups, hold fundamental differences in belief about the Holy Spirit.

'''Pneumatology''' refers to the study of the [[Holy Spirit]]. The English word comes from two Greek words: πνευμα (''pneuma'', spirit) and λογος (''logos'', teaching about). Pneumatology would normally include study of the person of the Holy Spirit, and the works of the Holy Spirit. This latter category would normally include Christian teachings on [[New Birth|new birth]], [[spiritual gift]]s (charismata), [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|Spirit-baptism]], [[sanctification]], the [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of [[prophet]]s, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in Christians.

The '''Trinitarian belief''', referred to (or also known ) as believing in the [[Trinity]] is a view held by the majority of Christian denominations, and is therefore regarded as [[mainstream]] [[Mainstream Christianity|Christianity]]. Trinitarians ascribe to the belief that teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot; /&gt; 
The doctrine states that [[God]] is the '''Triune God''', existing as three ''persons'', or in the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''[[hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]]'',&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in {{CathEncy|wstitle=Person}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one being.&lt;ref&gt;Grudem, Wayne A. 1994.

:'''''First section'''''
'''Christian doctrine'''

Christians believe that the Holy Spirit leads people to faith in Jesus and gives them the ability to live a [[Christianity#Worship and practices|Christian lifestyle]]. The Holy Spirit dwells inside every Christian and each one's body being his or her temple.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|3:16||1 Cor 3:16}} Jesus described the Holy Spirit{{bibleref2c|Jn|14:26}} as ''[[Paraclete|paracletus]]'' in [[Latin]], derived from [[Greek language|Greek]]. The word is variously translated as ''Comforter, Counselor, Teacher, Advocate,''&lt;ref&gt;Spurgeon, Charles H. &quot;The Comforter&quot;, 1855. Online: http://www.spurgeon.org/sermons/0005.htm Accessed 29 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; guiding people in the way of the truth. The Holy Spirit's action in one's life is believed to produce positive results, known as the [[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]. [[User:Otr500|Otr500]] ([[User talk:Otr500|talk]]) 08:34, 29 July 2010 (UTC)
*I moved things around for continuity per talk comments. It was out of place to discuss some about a subject, go into differences, discuss more, then more on differences, that was not a result of the continued discussions. That amounted to having two sections on &quot;Variations in doctrine&quot;. I did not do anything on the lead and first section, pending comments, so I left them alone.

Restoration Movement and Churches of Christ is inclusive but the Church of Christ/Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) is non-trinitarian.

==Improvements==
[[User:Otr500|Otr500]], your suggestions as described here sound like a move in the right direction.  But I think recent changes made to the lead, including overuse of scriptural quotes (do we really need &quot;{{Bibleref2c|Mt|3:16}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk|1:10}} {{Bibleref2c|Lk|3:22}} AND {{Bibleref2c|Jn|1:32}}&quot; to verify &quot;dove&quot;?) and the self-referential &quot;This article describes the beliefs...&quot;, are very bad.

::::::Ah ok. Well ''parakletos'' means one who is &quot;called to one's aid&quot;. It's often translated as &quot;comforter&quot; (in the Old English sense of &quot;strengthener&quot;), &quot;advocate&quot;, &quot;counselor&quot;, or &quot;helper&quot;. John 15:26 records Jesus saying that when the Paraclete comes he will testify of Jesus. He speaks (Acts 13:2; 21:11; Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29), he teaches (John 14:26), he intercedes (Romans 8:26-27), he guides (John 16:13; Acts 16:6), he gives commands and ordains (Acts 13:2; 20:28), and he works miracles (Acts 8:39; Romans 15:19). I'm getting this from ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', and I think most Christians would agree with this. I can add something about what is said in the New Testament similar to this if no one objects. 

::::::About the rejecting the Holy Spirit thing it goes like this. I don't know where exactly, but in the Gospels Jesus mentions that those who sin against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. I have always heard it explained this way: 1)The Holy Spirit convicts people of sin and reveals the knowledge of Christ and the grace of God to them, 2) People have the ability to resist the conviction and the leading of the Holy Spirit, 3) The Holy Spirit can be grieved, 4) There is a point after being resisted and rejected that the Holy Spirit will no longer convict someone of their sins because he will not force himself on anyone, 5) When this happens, a person is no longer convicted of sin and thus can never repent of his sin thus making it impossible for him to be forgiven. A common question that is asked is &quot;How do I know if I've committed the unpardonable sin?&quot; If you are feeling convicted of your sins and your need for God's grace then you have not committed the unpardonable sin. That's a little long, but that's how it has been taught to me, but I don't know if all Christians teach it like this. [[User:Ltwin|Ltwin]] ([[User talk:Ltwin|talk]]) 22:19, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

::::::::I'm not sure if all action is done by the Holy Spirit. From my understanding (and I may be wrong), the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are of one mind. The Father is on the throne in Heaven and Jesus is by his side, but the Holy Spirit is leading and guiding the church and is the presence of God in the earth. Of course I'm not a theologian and that may be very simplistic and even wrong. So I guess you could say that when it comes to the church it is the Spirit which is doing the will of the Father and testifying about Jesus. I'll have to read more into that, but it's really hard to separate the Father, Son, and Spirit so neatly.

== recent wrong changes ==
dear editors:

'''1.''' Do not perform such deletions on this article as performed on March 9, 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
'''2.''' Be sure you have a minimum understanding of theology.


'''Errors in March 9 version:'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;''(The true reasons that point out the errors (not quoting the errors here))''&lt;/small&gt;


'''I.''' islam calls angel Gabriel as a holy spirit (a created spirit, a creature) and by no means they refer to The Lord, The Giver of Life, The All Mighty God Christians refer to when Christians say The Holy Spirit.

'''II.''' In Judaism the theology of the holy spirit is not developed, thus even though they have very clear the references to the Spirit of God, they only, always, refer to God as YHWH or Adonai (The Lord) in spoken language (to avoid direct usage of the Holy Name). For Christians YHWH Is God the Father. Jewish don't have the understanding of the Holy Trinity (nor do they accept it), that mainstream understanding only began with the teachings of Jesus (YHWH saves), a Jew, to his Jewish Apostles, but the theology of the Holy Spirit makes no part of current Judaism.

'''III.''' Holy Spirit is not a term, leave alone for Christians. Christians confess that The Holy Spirit is God All Mighty and receives the same Adoration and Glory as YHWH and Jesus and that this Holy Trinity is Three Persons but Only One God, the same Only One God of the Jewish, The Only One God.

'''Sorry but please see [[W:NPOV]], the article has to be neutral.'''

:: due to further deletion by user [[User:In_ictu_oculi]], Here are his mistakes (and the reasons are already pointed out). This user points out that holy spirit is a term that is equivalent across Abrahamic faiths when it isn't. In Christianity, from the teachings of Jesus, The Holy Spirit is God. In Judaism The Spirit of God is understood by Jewish as perhaps a quality of God. About Judaism One could argue that it is just a simple small thinking away deducting from the writings of old Testament that the Spirit of God is God Himself, but the Jewish scholars haven't done that thinking and thus any idea of Trinity or Duality is rejected.

:: Now, there are other totally different usages of a term written as ´holy spirit´ that do not refer to God directly. in Islam they call an angel as a holy spirit.

==A set of confusing pages==
I must say the set of pages about this topic (Holy Spirit, Spirit of God, etc.) is an amazing mess. It is even hard for me to figure out how many pages exist about this and what they are about. I think any new reader will be totally confused.

I do not have a clear solution for how to fix these pages, except that [[Spirit of God]] is most probably inappropriate as a simple disambiguation page and should become a top level clarifying article that leads to the others. Wikipeda does not have a consistent story here, at all, e.g.

:* [[Prana]] is asserted to be similar to [[Qi]] but is not listed as Spirit of God.
:* [[Kami]], being highly multifaceted, probably do not belong on the Spirit of God page.
:* [[Brahman]] is asserted to be the same as [[Godhead]] but listed there anyway, and probably does not belong there.

And of course, many of the articles on [[Paraclete]], [[Godhead (Judaism)]], [[Gender of the Holy Spirit]] have multicolored &quot;low quality flags&quot; on top of them. What a mess.

I am sure that In ictu oculi is correct that &quot;Holy Spirit (Non-Trinitarian Christianity)&quot; would be a contradiction in terms, because the entire debate about being non-Trinitarian was about that. So Non-Trinitarian Christianity can not be discussed as having a &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;. However, Wikifact is not usable as a reference and we need a better WP:RS reference.

What I am not sure about is if Non-Trinitarian Christianity has a Paraclete. I think it may, but I am not sure at all, so let us first figure that out before we try to find our way through this fog. If we manage to answer that question with solid WP:RS references, then we may be in a better situation to continue. 

The next question after that would be: what are the exact titles in Judaism and Islam? And I do not have the answers there without doing research. Do you guys have answers there with solid WP:RS references? [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 17:30, 25 March 2011 (UTC)
::I think &quot;is an amazing mess&quot; about sums it up. Just dealing with the first question first. Wikipedia does structure out &quot;big&quot; topics common but distinct across various religions:
*[[God]]
**[[God (Judaism)]]
**[[God (Christianity)]]
**[[God (Islam)]]
*[[Heaven]]
**[[Heaven (Judaism)]]
**[[Heaven (Christianity)]]
**[[Heaven (Islam)]]
**[[Heaven (Buddhism)]]
**[[Heaven (Hinduism)]]
**[[Heaven (Taoism)]]
And no, [[Holy Spirit (Non-Trinitarian Christianity)]] wasn't serious, it's already here as a large section, just denied in the lede since Dec 02.
[[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 03:34, 26 March 2011 (UTC)

In answer to Q2. Yes Non-Trinitarianism, like Judaism, has a paraclete, I'm not sure about Islam. Historically Unitarians conceived of the Paraclete in John and 1John being the same, namely Christ. Not sure what other N-T groups think.

I have added the neutral line:
::'''The Holy Spirit''' is a term originating in the [[Hebrew Bible]], though understood differently in the three main [[Abrahamic religions]].
And 2 refs
*John R. Levison ''The Spirit in First-Century Judaism 2002 p65 &quot;Relevant Milieux : Israelite Literature : The expression, holy spirit, occurs in the Hebrew Bible only in Isa 63:10-11 and Ps 51:13. In Isaiah 63, the spirit acts within the corporate experience of Israel..&quot;
* Emir Fethi Caner, Ergun Mehmet Caner ''More than a prophet: an insider's response to Muslim beliefs about Jesus and Christianity&quot; 9780825424014 2003 p43 &quot;In Surah al-Nahl (16:102), the text is even more explicit: Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from thy Lord in Truth, in order to strengthen those who believe and as a Guide and glad tidings to Muslims.&quot;

I'll try and find an Arabic copy of Surah 16 :102(Arabic: سورة النحل, Sūratu an-Naḥl, &quot;The Bees&quot;)
[[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 04:28, 26 March 2011 (UTC)
::Done. Yes, http://quran.com/16/102 - the Arabic text says الروح القدس  Al-Ruh Al-Quds, with the definite article repeated, as normal; Holy Spirit. As a source you may add [[Sulaymān Bashīr]] ''Studies in early Islamic tradition'' 2004 p334 &quot;and aided by the Holy Spirit (ruh al-quds, as in Qur'an 2:87; 5:110; 19:27)&quot;, though as I said it should have a double Al- Al-. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 04:43, 26 March 2011 (UTC)

So now let me ask:

:* Do I take it that ''Holy Spirit (Islam)'', and ''Holy Spirit (Judaism)'' are good page titles? If they are, why are they separate on their own and there is no ''[[Holy Spirit (Christianity)]]''?

:* Exactly what religions/beliefs use the term &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;? Apart from Islam, Judaism and Christianity which ones? Bahá'í is mentioned, but I do not know if they use the exact term or a variation thereof.

:* Per [[WP:COMMONNAME]] is the term used in Islam &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;, &quot;Spirit of God&quot; or &quot;Holy Spirit of God&quot;? I could not easily decide this by a few simple searches. How is that determined here?

Overall I see this as a pretty confusing and disorganized article, which can be easily improved by some deletions, e.g.

:* The Gender of the Holy Spirit section is just too long here, given that there is a Main.

:* The artistic items should really move out to make this more cohesive, given that the art is all Christian. The art section has very little &quot;art history content&quot;, and of course zero references, as many other sections here. If/when the Christian items move to their own page, the art should move with that.

:* I do not think the &quot;Non-Trinitarian views&quot; section needs multiple subsections, some with 1 line. Just one section title is enough.

And I find the repeated use of bold in the text confusing and the overall text hard to read. But separating out and reducing the size of sections such as Gender will start an improvement process.

And how about doing this:

:* [[Spirit of God]] becomes a top level page that is not just a disambig and refers to various concepts including Holy Spirit.

:* [[Holy Spirit]] also becomes a much shorter page that refers to 3 o 4 religions.

:* [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)]] gets the Christian material.

:* I will find some time to do justice to [[Holy Spirit in Christian art]] at some point, as in the other artistic set of articles - can probably do it in May 2011.

The fact that &quot; There are way too many articles that refer to Holy Spirit in Christianity in contrast to the very few that refer to the Spirit of God in Judaism and so on&quot; suggests that [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)]] belongs at the default [[Holy Spirit]]. This article belongs at [[Holy Spirit (Abrahamic faiths)]], or better still not at all. It currently is a cross between [[Holy Spirit (disambiguation)]] and some discussions of Judaism and Islam's opposition to the idea of a Triune God.

:::Jnestorius, the problem with giving the Christian page on any subject (eg. [[Heaven (Christianity)]]) priority over [[Heaven (Judaism)]] etc. is that most Christian subjects were Jewish before they were Christian. Rather than being a &quot;misbegotten runt,&quot; the current page [[Holy Spirit]] gives fair lead in to the three Holy Spirits in the three Abrahamic religions that have the term &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;. Anything wrong with that? This disam page wouldn't be a good idea to move, [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Spirit_of_God]].

:The assumption of a single article is that there is a commonality which is discussed in the base article, with the differing specifics in the various child articles. That is true for [[Heaven]] but you have not shown it to be true for Holy Spirit. If the Christian subject derives from the Jewish subject that can be mentioned in both articles, as is done for example with [[Pesach]] and [[Easter]]. You don't need to create an [[Abrahamic Spring Feast]] article to discuss the commonality (although there is [[Passover (Christian holiday)]], that's not equivalent). 
:This article does not establish any commonality between the idea of &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; in the 3 Abrahamic faiths. Quite the opposite; it does nothing but explain the differences between them. One could start from a dab page with ten items and create a new page with a summarystyle paragraph for each of four of those ten; that would not establish that there is a single underlying concept uniting those four and not common to the other six.  I suggest you work on explaining the putative commonality rather than merely doing summarystyle of the child articles. 
:BTW I have also created a separate [[Holy Spirit (disambiguation)]] page and overhauled [[Holy Ghost (disambiguation)]], and changed the hatnotes accordingly. Is there evidence that Jews or Muslims use the term &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;?

::::::Hi Jnestorius,
::::::You're correct about [[Holy Ghost]], that's a King James-ism, and Christian only (I fixed it). 
::::::Otherwise, 
::::::Can I please ask for clarification -- whether you think there is no commonality between Judaism, Christianity and Islam in all matters (God, Heaven, Hell, Messiah, Satan, Paradise, Soul, sacrifice, angel....) or just this one subject Holy Spirit? 
::::::If the answer is the former then I'd find that an unusual view. Even in anti-Islamic and anti-Jewish evangelical texts the commonality is the root of the polemic. If the latter, maybe you haven't considered muslim and Jewish teaching on this subject. See this [http://books.google.com/books?id=0hhZbc6eFWYC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=%22differences+in+Understanding+of+the+Holy+Spirit%22&amp;hl=&amp;ei=GmC9TZ70HJCEvgPrjvnRBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22differences%20in%20Understanding%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit%22&amp;f=falsetext  chart] (which I assume to be Christian polemic?) Compare the first boxes; Sura 2:253 is a clear Quran reference to Luke 2 (whether or not one reads later Haddith gloss about Gabriel into the text). There's really no commonality there? Difference requires commonality, imagine how a box for Hindu Holy Spirit would look.
:::::::Secondly, it's already been shown above that Arabic and Hebrew wikipedia have an equivalent of this commonality page. Given that many English-speaking wikipedia users will also be Jewish or Muslim the onus is on someone saying that on English Wikipedia the article [[Holy Spirit]] must default to Christianity to justify it. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 13:38, 1 May 2011 (UTC)

There are two separate issues:
# Whether there are grounds for an Abrahamic-commonality &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; article
# Whether the default &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; article should be the Christian one, the disambguation, or the Abrahamic-commonality one. 
Obviously, if the answer to #1 is &quot;No&quot;, that affects the answer to #2. But let's ignore #2 for now and concentrate on #1. 

There is commonality between Judaism, Christianity and Islam in many matters, including all the examples you list. However, not all those in the list have a Wikipedia article which includes all the Abrahamic faiths and excludes every other faith. As to whether there is any commonality on the specific subject of &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;, I have no opinion; this article currently offers no evidence. Rather than debating with me on the Talk: page, it might be quicker if you just cite your evidence on the article page.  
Even if there is commonality, a separate article may not be appropriate; I gave the example of [[Pesach]] and [[Easter]] without [[Abrahamic Spring Feast]].  To take your example, if Sura 2:253 is a reference to Luke 2, that can be discussed in [[Holy Spirit (Islam)]], [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Biblical narratives and the Quran]], [[Injil]] and/or [[Jesus in Islam]]. How do you see it fitting into the current [[Holy Spirit]] article? [[User:Jnestorius|jnestorius]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Jnestorius|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 14:15, 1 May 2011 (UTC)
:::Hi Jnestorius
:::Sorry, but I personally don't feel the need to attempt to fill the article with &quot;commonality&quot; simply because someone else on the talk page is requesting it. As before if you feel it's needed, then by all means please feel free to do so yourself based on your knowledge of the three religions.
:::Also, I've never heard anyone describe either [[Easter]] or [[Passover]] as &quot;[[Abrahamic Spring Feast]]&quot; so I'm not sure what the point is of this comment?
:::Anyway, so what you're proposing then is that [[doesn't exist|Holy Spirit]] be left empty, and just have [[Holy Spirit (disambiguation)]], [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)]], [[Holy Spirit (Islam)]] and [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)]]. Is that correct? I don't have a problem with that.  Except of course, someone coming from a non-religious or non-Abrahamic background (which would be the bulk of the world, outside America) might want to come to [[Holy Spirit]], as a common subject of all 3 Abrahamic faiths and see a paragraph about each. Like [[Heaven]], or [[God]].

::::Well of course if [[doesn't exist|Holy Spirit]]  is deleted then either [[Holy Spirit (disambiguation)]] or [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)]] will move into the empty space. And if the hypothetical non-Abrahamist comes across &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; and wonders what that means, I would recommend [[Holy Spirit (disambiguation)]]. They should be able to work out from the context of the source that mentioned &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; whether the Jewish, Christian or Islamic concept is the relevant one in the particular context. As regards your obligation to provide commonality, the current article amounts to a [[WP:SYNTHESIS]]. You are claiming that the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian concepts are variants of a single idea rather than separate ideas that happen to have the same name. You are not explicitly claiming that, but the claim is implicit in the very existence of the article. If you make the claim, you must back it up.

::::Hi Jnestorius
::::Non-Abrahamists aren't hypothetical, in the UK they make up 90% of the population. It's very likely indeed that some, most, Wikipedia users will want to read an article about [[Holy Spirit]] that reflects all 3 Abrahamic faiths.
::::And, surely it hardly needs anyone to &quot;claim&quot; that Jewish, Muslim, and Christian concepts are variants of a single idea rather than separate ideas that happen to have the same name, for the same reason that no one has to prove that [[Abraham|Abraham (Christianity)]], [[Abraham|Abraham (Judaism)]], and [[Abraham|Abraham (Islam)]] are variants of a single idea rather than separate ideas that happen to have the same name, and the existence of a single [[Abraham]] article is [[WP:SYNTHESIS]], or the article on [[Heaven]] is [[WP:SYNTHESIS]] because it isn't all about [[Heaven (Christianity)]]. For example do you think they are &quot;separate ideas that happen to have the same name&quot;? Do you think there's no connection?
::::In any case Wikipedia can't be tilted to the assumption that the Christian definition is the one that matters, as in the comment &quot;of course if [[doesn't exist|Holy Spirit]] is deleted then either [[Holy Spirit (disambiguation)]] or [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)]] will move into the empty space.&quot; Why not &quot;of course if [[doesn't exist|Holy Spirit]] is deleted then either [[Holy Spirit (disambiguation)]] or [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)]] will move into the empty space.&quot;? Seriously - after all Jewish teaching on the Holy Spirit predates Christian teaching on the subject by around 1000 years. 
::::But back to that double question:
::::* Do you think they are &quot;separate ideas that happen to have the same name&quot;? 
::::* Do you think there's no connection?

Both &quot;God the Spirit&quot; + &quot;God the Holy Spirit&quot; are Trinitarian theological terms occuring fairly evenly from the 4th Century onwards.

== Gender of the Holy Spirit ==

Given that there are valid arguments for a male, female and gender-neutral Holy Spirit, shouldn't this wiki use gender-neutral pronouns, such as &quot;they&quot; and &quot;it&quot; instead of &quot;He&quot; in related articles (and especially this one) to avoid bias?[[User:The Talking Toaster|The Talking Toaster]] ([[User talk:The Talking Toaster|talk]]) 17:48, 1 August 2012 (UTC)

:After a quick look at this article, I'm not even seeing where the pronoun &quot;he&quot; is being used. Is it being used? As it relates to the religion-specific articles, it would come down to how the Holy Spirit is referred to in those religions. For example in Christianity, the vast majority of Christians today and historically consider the Holy Spirit to be a person of the Trinity. Therefore, it would be wrong to refer to the Holy Spirit at [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)]] as an &quot;it&quot;. Furthermore, most Christians refer to the Holy Spirit as &quot;he&quot;. While the minority viewpoint should be noted, it shouldn't be given undo weight so that we change every instance of &quot;he&quot; to &quot;they&quot;. That's my opinion. Also, this might be something better addressed on each sub-articles specific page, since they each cover different religions.
