The original date of the celebration in [[Eastern Christianity]] was January 6, in connection with [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], and that is still the date of the celebration for the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and in [[Armenia]], where it is a public holiday. As of {{currentyear}}, there is a difference of 13 days between the modern [[Gregorian calendar]] and the older [[Julian calendar]]. Those who continue to use the Julian calendar or its equivalents thus celebrate December 25 and January 6 on what for the majority of the world is January 7 and January 19. For this reason, [[Ethiopia]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Serbia]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and the [[Republic of Moldova]] celebrate Christmas on what in the Gregorian calendar is January 7; all the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]es celebrate Christmas on December 25.

In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as [[Santa Claus]], [[Father Christmas]], [[Saint Nicholas]] and [[Christkind]], are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16329025 &quot;Poll: In a changing nation, Santa endures&quot;], Associated Press, December 22, 2006.

The economic impact of Christmas is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;Christmas&quot; originated as a compound meaning &quot;[[Christ]]'s [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]&quot;.

==Celebration==

[[File:Map of Countries that do not recognize Christmas as Public Holiday.png|thumb|right|Map of 39 countries where Christmas is not a public holiday. It is recognized in all countries colored gray.]]

Christmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and [[public holiday]] in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian countries, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. [[Hong Kong]]); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations and Christmas trees.

Countries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include [[China]], (excepting [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macao]]), [[Japan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Algeria]], [[Thailand]], [[Nepal]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and [[North Korea]]. Christmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions.

Among countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures. For Christians, participating in a religious service plays an important part in the recognition of the season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance.

In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] countries, people hold religious processions or [[parade]]s in the days preceding Christmas. In other countries, secular processions or parades featuring Santa Claus and other seasonal figures are often held. Family reunions and the exchange of gifts are a widespread feature of the season. Gift giving takes place on Christmas Day in most countries. Others practice gift giving on December 6, Saint Nicholas Day, and January 6, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[bible|biblical accounts]] are found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], namely Matthew 1:18, and the [[Gospel of Luke]], specifically Luke 1:26 and 2:40. According to these accounts, Jesus was born to Mary, assisted by her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], in the city of [[Bethlehem]].
[[File:Advent Wreath (Broadway United Methodist Church).jpg|thumb|left|On Christmas Day, the Christ Candle in the center of the [[Advent wreath]] is traditionally lit in many [[church service]]s.]]
According to popular tradition, the birth took place in a stable, surrounded by farm animals. A [[manger]] (that is, a feeding trough) is mentioned in {{Bibleverse||Luke|2:7|KJV}}, where it states Mary &quot;wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn&quot; ([[King James Version|KJV]]); and &quot;She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them&quot; ([[New International Version|NIV]]).

The Gospel of Matthew instead describes a visit by an unspecified number of [[Biblical magi|magi]], or astrologers, sometime after Jesus was born while the family was living in a house ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:11|KJV}}), who brought gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]] to the young child Jesus. The visitors were said to be following a mysterious star, commonly known as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], believing it to announce the birth of a king of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:2|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The commemoration of this visit, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]] celebrated on January 6, is the formal end of the Christmas season in some churches.

Christians celebrate Christmas in various ways. In addition to this day being one of the most important and popular for the attendance of church services, there are other devotions and popular traditions. In some [[Christian denominations]], children re-enact the events of the Nativity with animals to portray the event with more realism or  sing [[carols]] that reference the event.  Some Christians also display a small re-creation of the Nativity, known as a [[Nativity scene]] or crèche, in their homes, using figurines to portray the key characters of the event. Prior to Christmas Day, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] practices the 40-day [[Nativity Fast]] in anticipation of the birth of Jesus, while much of [[Western Christianity]] celebrates four weeks of [[Advent]]. The final preparations for Christmas are made on [[Christmas Eve]], and many families' major observation of Christmas actually falls in the evening of this day.

A long artistic tradition has grown of producing painted depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity in art]]. Nativity scenes are traditionally set in a stable with livestock and include Mary, Joseph, the infant Jesus in the manger, the three wise men, the shepherds and their sheep, the angels, and the Star of Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The practice of putting up special decorations at Christmas has a long history. In the 15th century, it was recorded that in London it was the custom at Christmas for every house and all the parish churches to be &quot;decked with [[Quercus ilex|holm]], ivy, [[bay leaves|bays]], and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be green&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Clement A, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23354-5, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart-shaped leaves of [[ivy]] were said to symbolize the coming to earth of Jesus, while [[holly]] was seen as protection against pagans and witches, its thorns and red berries held to represent the [[Crown of Thorns]] worn by Jesus at the crucifixion and the blood he shed.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Ruth, ''Christmas: Its Carols, Customs &amp; Legends'', Alfred Publishing (1985), ISBN 0-7692-4399-1, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ace Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Nativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularised by Saint [[Francis of Asissi]] from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe.&lt;ref name=Collins47&gt;Collins, Ace, ''Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas'', Zondervan, (2003), ISBN 0-310-24880-9 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources. The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children.&lt;ref name=Collins83&gt;Collins p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where a representation of the [[Nativity Scene]] is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family [[heirloom]].

The traditional colors of Christmas are [[green]] and [[red]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Christmasmagic&quot;&gt;Hal Siemer, [http://www.questmagazine.com/christmas.html Christmas Magic: The History and Traditions of the Holiday], ''QuestMagazine.com'', 2004-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; [[White (color)|White]], [[silver (color)|silver]] and [[gold (color)|gold]] are also popular.

[[File:Rockefeller Center christmas tree cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|The famous [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]] in New York City.]]
The [[Christmas tree]] is considered by some as [[Christianisation]] of [[pagan]] tradition and ritual surrounding the [[Winter Solstice]], which included the use of [[evergreen]] boughs, and an adaptation of pagan [[tree worship]];&lt;ref name=Shaman/&gt; according to eighth-century biographer [[Æddi Stephanus]], [[Saint Boniface]] (634–709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an axe to an oak tree dedicated to [[Thor]] and pointed out a [[fir tree]], which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe|title=Christmas|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2010|quote=His biographer, Eddius Stephanus, relates that while Boniface was serving as a missionary near Geismar, Germany, he had enough of the locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an aze to an oak tree dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the Christian trinity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] phrase &quot;Christmas tree&quot; is first recorded in 1835&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;Harper, Douglas, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ Christ], ''Online Etymology Dictionary,'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an importation from the [[German language]].

From Germany the custom was introduced to Britain, first via [[Queen Charlotte]], wife of [[George III]], and then more successfully by Prince Albert during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]]. By 1841 the Christmas tree had become even more widespread throughout Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lejeune, Marie Claire p.550&quot;&gt;Lejeune, Marie Claire. ''Compendium of symbolic and ritual plants in Europe'', p.550. University of Michigan ISBN 90-77135-04-9&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, people in the United States had adopted the custom of putting up a Christmas tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoemaker&quot;&gt;Shoemaker, Alfred Lewis.

ISBN 0-8117-0328-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas trees may be decorated with [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|lights]] and [[Christmas ornaments|ornaments]].

Since the 19th century, the [[poinsettia]], a native plant from [[Mexico]], has been associated with Christmas. Other popular holiday plants include holly, [[mistletoe]], red [[amaryllis]], and [[Christmas cactus]]. Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with [[Garland (decoration)|garlands]] and [[evergreen]] foliage.  The display of [[Christmas village]]s has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated [[Sled|sleighs]], [[snowmen]], and other Christmas figures.

Other traditional decorations include [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[candles]], [[candy canes]], [[Christmas stocking|stockings]], [[wreaths]], and [[angels]]. Both the displaying of [[wreath]]s and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an [[evergreen]], make up Christmas [[wreath]]s and are designed to prepare [[Christians]] for the Advent season. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate the fact that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Music and carols===
{{Main|Christmas music}}
[[File:Chant'tie d'Cantiques dé Noué Dézembre 2009 Jèrri a.jpg|thumb|Christmas carolers in [[Jersey]]]]
The earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in 4th century [[Rome]]. Latin hymns such as ''Veni redemptor gentium'', written by [[Ambrose]], Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to [[Arianism]]. ''Corde natus ex Parentis'' (''Of the Father's love begotten'') by the Spanish poet [[Prudentius]] (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Clement, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23354-5, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas &quot;Sequence&quot; or &quot;Prose&quot; was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] into a sequence of rhymed [[stanza]]s. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional [[Christmas carol]].

By the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of [[Francis of Asissi]], a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native language developed.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, pp. 31–37&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of [[John Audelay|John Awdlay]], a [[Shropshire]] chaplain, who lists twenty-five &quot;caroles of Cristemas&quot;, probably sung by groups of [[Wassailing|wassailers]], who went from house to house.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs we know specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as &quot;harvest tide&quot; as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on [[medieval]] chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like ''&quot;[[Personent hodie]]&quot;'', &quot;[[Good King Wenceslas]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Holly and the Ivy]]&quot; can be traced directly back to the [[Middle Ages]]. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. ''[[Adeste Fidelis]]'' (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.

[[File:Steaua, Bucharest, 1842 crop.jpg|thumb|Child singers in [[Bucharest]], 1841]]
Singing of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the [[Protestant Reformation]] in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like [[Martin Luther]], wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th century English reformer [[Charles Wesley]] understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the [[Great Awakening]] in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled &quot;Hark! How All the Welkin Rings&quot;, later renamed &quot;[[Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Felix Mendelssohn]] wrote a melody adapted to fit Wesley's words. In Austria in 1818 Mohr and Gruber made a major addition to the genre when they composed &quot;[[Silent Night]]&quot; for the St. Nicholas Church, Oberndorf. [[William B. Sandys]]' ''Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern'' (1833) contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Michael Kelly.

[[File:Jingle Bells.ogg|thumb|left|Jingle Bells, 19th century (instrumental)]]
Completely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. &quot;[[Deck the Halls|Deck The Halls]]&quot; dates from 1784, and the American &quot;[[Jingle Bells]]&quot; was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th century, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holidays songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music.

===Traditional cuisine===
{{Further|Christmas dinner}}
[[File:Christmas pudding.JPG|thumb|right|[[Christmas pudding]] cooked on [[Stir-up Sunday]], the Sunday before the beginning of the [[Advent]] season.]]
A special [[Christmas dinner|Christmas family meal]] is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions, such as [[Sicily]], have special meals for Christmas Eve, when 12 kinds of fish are served. In England and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey or goose, meat, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider.  Special desserts are also prepared, such as [[Christmas pudding]], [[mince pie]]s and [[fruit cake]].&lt;ref&gt;Broomfield, Andrea (2007) [http://books.google.com/books?id=fJ_JDp9OgJEC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=christmas+pudding+england&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xzAVTc3WNoqWhQePsJW3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20pudding%20england&amp;f=false Food and cooking in Victorian England: a history] pp.149–150. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Frank (1977) ''Christmas customs &amp; traditions'' p.58. Taplinger Pub. Co., 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

In Poland and other parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, fish often is used for the traditional main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Germany, France and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham and chicken in various recipes are popular throughout the world.  The [[Maltese people|Maltese]] traditionally serve ''[[Imbuljuta tal-Qastan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolnet.gov.mt/HelloEurope/activities/recepies/imbuljuta.html |title=Imbuljuta |publisher=Schoolnet.gov.mt |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after [[Midnight Mass]] and throughout the Christmas season. Slovaks prepare the traditional Christmas bread [[potica]], ''[[bûche de Noël]]'' in France, ''[[panettone]]'' in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German ''[[stollen]]'', [[marzipan]] cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods.

===Cards===
{{Main|Christmas card}}
[[File:Julekort.jpg|thumb|Christmas cards with angels, Scandinavian “nisser”, Father Christmas, snow men and hearts.]]

Christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads &quot;wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&quot;, much like that of the first commercial [[Christmas card#History|Christmas card]], produced by [[Sir Henry Cole]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1679110.stm Christmas card sold for record price] BBC News. Retrieved 2011-10-28&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging [[E-card]]s.

Christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities, and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season.  The content of the design might relate directly to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas narrative]] with [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Jesus]], or [[Christian symbols]] such as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], or a white [[dove]] which can represent both the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Peace]] on Earth.  Other Christmas cards are more [[secular]] and can depict [[Christmas tradition]]s, mythical figures such as [[Santa Claus]], objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes and the wildlife of the northern winter.  There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as [[crinoline]]d shoppers in idealized 19th century streetscapes.

Some prefer cards with a poem, prayer or [[Bible verse|Biblical verse]]; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive &quot;Season's greetings&quot;.

===Commemorative stamps===
{{Main|Christmas stamp}}
A number of nations have issued [[commemorative stamp]]s at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail [[Christmas card]]s, and they are popular with [[philately|philatelists]]. These stamps are regular [[postage stamps]], unlike [[Christmas seal]]s, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.

In 1898 a Canadian stamp was issued to mark the inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The stamp features a map of the globe and bears an inscription &quot;XMAS 1898&quot; at the bottom. In 1937, Austria issued two &quot;Christmas greeting stamps&quot; featuring a [[rose]] and the signs of the [[zodiac]]. In 1939, [[Brazil]] issued four [[semi-postal]] stamps with designs featuring the [[three kings]] and a [[star of Bethlehem]], an [[angel]] and child, the [[Southern Cross]] and a child, and a mother and child.

Both the [[US Postal Service]] and the [[Royal Mail]] regularly issue Christmas-themed stamps each year.

===Gift giving===
{{See also|Gift economy}}
The exchanging of [[gift]]s is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making the Christmas season the most profitable time of year for [[retail]]ers and businesses throughout the world. Gift giving was common in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] celebration of [[Saturnalia]], an ancient festival which took place in late December and may have influenced Christmas customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;OriginMyth&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110430004539/http://www.bsu.edu/web/01bkswartz/xmaspub.html The Origin of the American Christmas Myth and Customs] – ''Ball State University''.

====Gift-bearing figures====
{{Main|Santa Claus|Father Christmas}}
{{See also|Saint Nicholas|Basil of Caesarea}}
[[File:Sinterklaas 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Sinterklaas]] or [[Saint Nicholas]], considered by many to be the original Santa Claus.]]
A number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are [[Father Christmas]], also known as [[Santa Claus]] (derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for Saint Nicholas), Père Noël, and the [[Weihnachtsmann]]; [[Saint Nicholas]] or [[Sinterklaas]]; the [[Christkind]]; Kris Kringle; [[Joulupukki]]; Babbo Natale; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]]; and [[Ded Moroz|Father Frost]].

The best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch ''Sinterklaas'', which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was Bishop of Myra, in modern day Turkey, during the 4th century. Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast on December 6 came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.&lt;ref name=ADS&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 0-520-25104-0, pp. 68–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''Christkindl'', corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;/&gt;

The modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including [[Washington Irving]] and the [[German American|German-American]] cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] (1840–1902). Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of [[New Amsterdam]] and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809, the [[New-York Historical Society]] convened and retroactively named ''Sancte Claus'' the patron saint of [[New Amsterdam|Nieuw Amsterdam]], the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;John Steele Gordon, ''The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000'' (Scribner) 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; At his first American appearance in 1810, Santa Claus was drawn in bishops' robes. However as new artists took over, Santa Claus developed more secular attire.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Nast drew a new image of &quot;Santa Claus&quot; annually, beginning in 1863. By the 1880s, Nast's Santa had evolved into the robed, fur clad, form we now recognize, perhaps based on the English figure of Father Christmas. The image was standardized by advertisers in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikkelson&quot;&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara and David P., [http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp &quot;The Claus That Refreshes&quot;], ''Snopes.com,'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Christmas, a jolly, well nourished, bearded man who typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, predates the Santa Claus character. He is first recorded in early 17th century England, but was associated with holiday merrymaking and [[drunkenness]] rather than the bringing of gifts.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt; In [[Victorian Britain]], his image was remade to match that of Santa. The French [[Père Noël]] evolved along similar lines, eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo Natale acts as Santa Claus, while [[La Befana]] is the bringer of gifts and arrives on the eve of the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]. It is said that La Befana set out to bring the baby Jesus gifts, but got lost along the way. Now, she brings gifts to all children. In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]], or [[Black Peter]]. In other versions, [[elf|elves]] make the toys. His wife is referred to as [[Mrs. Claus]].

[[File:Santa-eop2.jpg|thumb|Santa Claus is famous around the world for giving gifts to 'good' children.]]
There has been some opposition to the narrative of the American evolution of Saint Nicholas into the modern Santa. It has been claimed that the Saint Nicholas Society was not founded until 1835, almost half a century after the end of the American War of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Current tradition in several [[Latin American]] countries (such as [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]]) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and the [[iconography]] of Santa Claus imported from the United States.

In [[South Tyrol]] (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, [[Liechtenstein]], [[Slovakia]] and Switzerland, the [[Christkind]] ([[Ježíšek]] in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from [[Saint Basil]] on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skiathosbooks.com/saints_basil.htm |title=St. Basil (330–379) |publisher=Skiathosbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus/Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a [[bishop]]'s dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]]. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;Matera, Mariane.

===Date of celebration===
In the earliest centuries of Christianity, no particular day of the year was associated with the [[birth of Jesus]]. Various dates were proposed: May 20, April 18 or 19, March 25, January 2, November 17 or 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coffman/&gt; When celebration on a particular date began, January 6 prevailed at least in the East;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=bullard+%226+January+prevailed%22&amp;btnG= Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard (editors), ''Mercer Dictionary of the Bible'' (Mercer University Press 1990 ISBN 978-0-86554-373-7), p. 142]&lt;/ref&gt; but, except among Armenians (the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]), who continue to celebrate the birth on January 6, December 25 eventually won acceptance everywhere.&lt;ref name=Coffman&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/news/2000/dec08.html Elesha Coffman, &quot;Why December 25?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of Jesus was announced in {{bibleverse||Luke|2:11|KJV}}, &quot;For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.&quot;  Moreover, the belief that [[Holy Trinity|God]] came into the world in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|form of man]] to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the [[sin]]s of humanity is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joan Chittister, Phyllis Tickle&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=inhMGc5732kC&amp;pg=PT40&amp;dq=date+of+christmas+important&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7T3GTOWcKMGp8Abk__XkDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=date%20of%20christmas%20important&amp;f=false| title = The Liturgical Year|publisher = [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]]|quote=Christmas is not really about the celebration of a birth date at all. It is about the celebration of a birth. The fact of the date and the fact of the birth are two different things. The calendrical verification of the feast itself is not really that important...What is important to the understanding of a life-changing moment is that it happened, not necessarily where or when it happened. The message is clear: Christmas is not about marking the actual birth date of Jesus. It is about the Incarnation of the One who became like us in all things but sin (Heb. 4:15) and who humbled Himself &quot;to the point of death-even death on a cross&quot; (Phil. 2:8). Christmas is a pinnacle feast, yes, but it is not the beginning of the liturgical year. It is a memorial, a remembrance, of the birth of Jesus, not really a celebration of the day itself. We remember that because the Jesus of history was born, the Resurrection of the Christ of faith could happen. |accessdate = 2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Voice-Christmas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.crivoice.org/cyxmas.html| title = The Christmas Season|publisher = CRI / Voice, Institute|accessdate = 2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard University&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=x_kBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA469&amp;dq=date+of+christmas+unimportant&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2gTwTPL2EoOnnAfa-pynCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=date%20of%20christmas%20unimportant&amp;f=false| title = The School Journal, Volume 49|publisher = [[Harvard University]]|quote=Throughout the Christian world the 25th of December is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus Christ. There was a time when the churches were not united regarding the date of the joyous event. Many Christians kept their Christmas in April, others in May, and still others at the close of September, till finally December 25 was agreed upon as the most appropriate date. The choice of that day was, of course, wholly arbitrary, for neither the exact date not the period of the year at which the birth of Christ occurred is known. For purposes of commemoration, however, it is unimportant whether the celebration shall fall or not a the precise anniversary of the joyous event.|accessdate = 2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 4th century, the church calendar in Rome contained Christmas on December 25 and other holidays placed on solar dates: &quot;It is cosmic symbolism...which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the [[southern solstice]], December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the [[northern solstice]] as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception. While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas,&quot; according to modern scholar S.E. Hijmans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hijmans&quot;&gt;Hijmans, S.E., ''[http://www.scribd.com/doc/33490806/Hijmans-Sol-The-Sun-in-the-Art-and-Religions-of-Rome Sol, the sun in the art and religions of Rome],'' 2009, p. 589. ISBN 978-90-367-3931-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the year 386 [[John Chrysostom]] delivered a sermon in [[Antioch]] in favour of adopting the 25 December celebration also in the East, since, he said, the conception of Jesus (Luke 1:26) had been announced during the sixth month of Elisabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist (Luke 1:10–13), which he dated from the duties Zacharias performed on the [[Day of Atonement]] during the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]] Ethanim or Tishri (Lev. 16:29, 1 Kings 8:2) which falls from late September to early October.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; That shepherds watched the flocks by night in the fields in the winter time is supported by the phrase &quot;frost by night&quot; in Genesis 31:38–40. A special group known as the shepherds of Migdal Eder (Gen. 35:19–21, Micah 4:8) watched the flocks by night year round pastured for Temple Sacrifice near Bethlehem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edersheim&quot;&gt;Edersheim, Alfred (1883).

In the early 18th century, some scholars proposed alternative explanations. [[Isaac Newton]] argued that the date of Christmas, celebrating the birth of him whom Christians consider to be the &quot;Sun of righteousness&quot; prophesied in Malachi 4:2,&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt; was selected to correspond with the southern solstice, which the Romans called ''bruma'', celebrated on December 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolsticeDate&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/SF/WinSol.html Bruma]&quot;, ''Seasonal Festivals of the Greeks and Romans''&lt;br /&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137&amp;query=head%3D%231117 18:59]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1743, German Protestant Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday ''[[Dies Natalis Solis Invicti]]'' and was therefore a &quot;paganization&quot; that debased the true church.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolInvictus&quot;/&gt; It has been argued that, on the contrary, the Emperor [[Aurelian]], who in 274 instituted the holiday of the ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'', did so partly as an attempt to give a pagan significance to a date already important for Christians in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-10-012-v William J. Tighe, &quot;Calculating Christmas&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, [[Louis Duchesne]] proposed that the date of Christmas was calculated as nine months after the [[Annunciation]], the traditional date of the conception of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roll87&quot;&gt;Roll, pp. 88–90.&lt;br /&gt;Duchesne, Louis, ''Les Origines du Culte Chrétien,'' Paris, 1902, 262 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-arch.org&quot;/&gt;

====Using the Julian calendar and the revised Julian calendar====
[[Eastern Orthodox]] national churches, including those of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgia]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church|Ukraine]], [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] mark feasts using the older [[Julian calendar]]. December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the internationally used [[Gregorian calendar]].  However, other Orthodox Christians, such as the churches of [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greece]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antioch]], [[Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albania]], [[Orthodox Church of Finland|Finland]] and the [[Orthodox Church in America]], among others, began using the [[Revised Julian calendar]] in the early 20th century, which corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref name=4Dates&gt;

==History==
The earliest evidence of the celebration on December 25 of a Christian liturgical feast of the birth of Jesus is from the [[Chronography of 354|Chronography of 354 AD]]. This was in Rome, while in [[Eastern Christianity]] the birth of Jesus was already celebrated in connection with the [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]] on January 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Wainwright+%22epiphany+is+older%22&amp;btnG= |title=Geoffrey Wainwright, Karen Beth Westerfield Tucker (editors), '&amp;#39;The Oxford History of Christian Worship'&amp;#39; (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-513886-3), p. 65 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Roy+%22older+than+Christmas%22&amp;btnG= |title=Christian Roy, '&amp;#39;Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia'&amp;#39; (ABC-CLIO 2005 ISBN 978-1-57607-089-5) p. 146 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The December 25 celebration was imported into the East later: in Antioch by [[John Chrysostom]] towards the end of the 4th century,&lt;ref name=Roy/&gt; probably in 388, and in Alexandria only in the following century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Hastings+%22been+between+400+and+432%22&amp;btnG= |title=James Hastings, John A.

Many popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus' birth, with certain elements having origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated around the winter solstice by pagan populations who were later [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]]. These elements, including the [[Yule log]] from Yule and gift giving from [[Saturnalia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;OriginMyth&quot; /&gt; became [[syncretism|syncretized]] into Christmas over the centuries. The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday's inception, ranging from a sometimes raucous, drunken, [[carnival]]-like state in the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas &quot;Medieval Christmas&quot;], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31 – 39.&lt;/ref&gt; to a tamer family-oriented and children-centered theme introduced in a [[#Reformation into the 19th century|19th-century reformation]].&lt;ref name=standiford&gt;Les Standiford.

===Pre-Christian background===

====''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti''====
{{Main|Sol Invictus}}
''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'' means &quot;the birthday of the unconquered sun&quot;.

Some early Christian writers connected the sun to the birth of Jesus, which Christians believe was prophesied in Malachi 4:2 as the &quot;Sun of Righteousness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; &quot;O, how wonderfully acted Providence that on that day on which that Sun was born...Christ should be born&quot;, [[Cyprian]] wrote.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; In the fourth century, [[John Chrysostom]] commented on the connection: &quot;But Our Lord, too, is born in the month of December . . . the eight before the calends of January [25 December] . . ., But they call it the 'Birthday of the Unconquered'. Who indeed is so unconquered as Our Lord . . .? Or, if they say that it is the birthday of the Sun, He is the Sun of Justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt;

One ancient source mentioned ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'' in the [[Chronography of 354]], and Sol scholar Steven Hijmans stated that there is no evidence that the celebration precedes that of Christmas:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hijmans&quot;/&gt; &quot;[W]hile the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas, and none that indicates that Aurelian had a hand in its institution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hijmans&quot;/&gt;

====Winter festivals====
{{Main|List of winter festivals}}
A winter festival was the most popular festival of the year in many cultures. Reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needs to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached.&lt;ref name=AncientHoliday&gt;&quot;[http://www.history.com/minisites/christmas/viewPage?pageId=1252 &quot;Christmas – An Ancient Holiday&quot;], ''The [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Christmas customs include: gift-giving and merrymaking from Roman [[Saturnalia]]; greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year; and [[Yule log]]s and various foods from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] feasts.&lt;ref&gt;Coffman, Elesha. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/newsletter/2000/dec08.html Why December 25?] ''Christian History &amp; Biography'', ''[[Christianity Today]]'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norse paganism|Pagan Scandinavia]] celebrated a winter festival called [[Yule]], held in the late December to early January period.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} As [[Northern Europe]] was the last part to Christianize, its pagan traditions had a major influence on Christmas, especially [[Koleda]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages%5CK%5CO%5CKoliadaIT.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which was incorporated into
the [[Christmas carol]]. Scandinavians still call Christmas ''Jul''. In English, the word Yule is synonymous with Christmas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Yule Yule]. ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,'' Fourth Edition. Retrieved 2006-12-03.&lt;/ref&gt; a usage first recorded in 900.

===Christianity===
The [[New Testament]] [[Gospel of Luke]] may indirectly give the date as December for the birth of Jesus, with the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy with [[John the Baptist]] cited by [[John Chrysostom]] (c. 386) as a date for the [[Annunciation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bib-arch.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082431/Christmas Christmas], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] (d. 220) did not mention Christmas as a major [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] in the [[African Rite|Church of Roman Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; In ''Chronographai'', a reference work published in 221, [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] suggested that Jesus was conceived on the [[spring equinox]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082431/Christmas Christmas]&quot;, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roll, p. 79, 80. Only fragments of ''Chronographai'' survive. In one fragment, Africanus referred to &quot;Pege in Bethlehem&quot; and &quot;Lady Pege, Spring-bearer.&quot; See &quot;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VI/Julius Africanus/Narrative of Events Happening in Persia on the Birth of Christ|Narrative Narrative of Events Happening in Persia on the Birth of Christ Narrative]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The equinox was March 25 on the Roman calendar, so this implied a birth in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradt&quot;&gt;Bradt, Hale, ''Astronomy Methods'', (2004), p. 69.&lt;br /&gt;Roll p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishops Theophilus of Antioch (ca. 175) and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (204) are often cited among the earliest Christian references to December 25 being the Date of Christ's birth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 245, the theologian [[Origen of Alexandria]] stated that, &quot;only sinners (like Pharaoh and Herod)&quot; celebrated their birthdays.&lt;ref name=&quot;Origin&quot;&gt;Origen, &quot;Levit., Hom. VIII&quot;; ''Migne P.G.'', XII, 495.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10709a.htm Natal Day]&quot;, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; In 303, Christian writer [[Arnobius]] ridiculed the idea of celebrating the birthdays of gods, a passage cited as evidence that Arnobius was unaware of any nativity celebration.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, George, ''Arnobius of Sicca, the Case Against the Pagans'', Volume 2, p. 83, . &quot;Therefore if this is a fact, how can Jupiter be god if it is agreed that god is everlasting, while the other is represented by you to have a birthday, and frightened by the new experience, to have squalled like an infant.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;G. Brunner, &quot;Arnobius eine Zeuge gegen das Weihnachtsfest? &quot; JLW 13 (1936) pp. 178–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Christmas does not celebrate Christ's birth &quot;as God&quot; but &quot;as man&quot;, this is not evidence against Christmas being a feast at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt; The fact the [[Donatist]]s of North Africa celebrated Christmas may indicate that the feast was established by the time that church was created in 311.

====Feast established====
The earliest known reference to the date of the nativity as December 25 is found in the [[Chronography of 354]], an [[illuminated manuscript]] compiled in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;This document was prepared privately for a Roman aristocrat. The reference in question states, &quot;VIII kal. ian. natus Christus in Betleem Iudeæ&quot;.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_08_fasti.htm] It is in a section copied from an earlier manuscript produced in 336.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm] This document also contains the earliest known reference to the feast of Sol Invictus.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_06_calendar.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In the East, early Christians celebrated the birth of Christ as part of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (January 6), although this festival emphasized celebration of the [[baptism of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pokhilko, Hieromonk Nicholas, [http://sites.google.com/site/historyofepiphany &quot;History of Epiphany&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas was promoted in the Christian East as part of the revival of [[Catholicism]] following the death of the pro-[[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. The feast was introduced to [[Constantinople]] in 379, and to [[Antioch]] in about 380. The feast disappeared after [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] resigned as [[bishop]] in 381, although it was reintroduced by [[John Chrysostom]] in about 400.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt;

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in [[western Christianity]] focused on the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|magi]]. But the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the &quot;forty days of St. Martin&quot; (which began on November 11, the feast of [[St. Martin of Tours]]), now known as Advent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot; /&gt; In Italy, former [[Saturnalia]]n traditions were attached to Advent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] (December 25 – January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or [[Twelve Holy Days]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt;

The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King [[Edmund the Martyr]] was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King [[William I of England]] was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.

By the [[High Middle Ages]], the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various [[magnate]]s celebrated Christmas. [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. [[Christmas carol|Caroling]] also became popular, and was originally a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; &quot;Misrule&quot;—drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling—was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on [[New Year's Day]], and there was special Christmas ale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt;

Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated [[ivy]], [[holly]], and other evergreens.&lt;ref name=mcgreevy/&gt; Christmas [[gift-giving]] during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord.&lt;ref name=mcgreevy&gt;McGreevy, Patrick. &quot;Place in the American Christmas,&quot; ([http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0016-7428%28199001%2980%3A1%3C32%3APITAC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-2 JSTOR]), ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 80, No. 1. January 1990, pp. 32–42. Retrieved 2007-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting, and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques and pageants. In 1607, [[James I of England|King James I]] insisted that a play be acted on Christmas night and that the court indulge in games.&lt;ref name=BTR/&gt; It was during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th century Europe that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'', and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name=ADS/&gt;

===Reformation into the 19th century===
[[File:Scrooges third visitor-John Leech,1843.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ebenezer Scrooge]] and the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]]. From [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', 1843.]]
Following the [[Protestant Reformation]], groups such as the [[Puritan]]s strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the &quot;trappings of [[Papist|popery]]&quot; or the &quot;rags of [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot; /&gt;
The [[Catholic Church]] responded by promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form. King [[Charles I of England]] directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old style Christmas generosity.&lt;ref name=BTR/&gt; Following the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] victory over Charles I during the [[English Civil War]], England's [[Puritan]] rulers banned Christmas in 1647.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot;/&gt;

Protests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks [[Canterbury]] was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with [[holly]] and shouted [[Royalism|royalist]] slogans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot;/&gt; The book, ''The Vindication of Christmas'' (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions, dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with &quot;plow-boys&quot; and &quot;maidservants&quot;, and carol singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1660 ended the ban, but many clergymen still disapproved of Christmas celebration. In [[Scotland]], the Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]] also discouraged the observance of Christmas, and though [[James VI]] commanded its celebration in 1618, attendance at church was scant.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. p. 211.
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of Scotland]] officially abolished the observance of Christmas in 1640, claiming that the church had been &quot;purged of all superstitious observation of days&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPS1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?action=fc&amp;fn=charlesi_ms&amp;id=id8564&amp;query=&amp;type=ms&amp;variants=&amp;google=|title=Act dischairging the Yule vacance|work=[[The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707]]|publisher=University of St Andrews and National Archives of Scotland|language=[[Middle Scots]]|accessdate=29 February 2012|location=St Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1958 that Christmas again became a Scottish public holiday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houston&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Houston|first=Rab|coauthors=Houston, Robert Allan |title=Scotland: a very short introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|series=Very short introductions|volume=197|pages=172|isbn=978-0-19-923079-2|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PP8ahdq40P4C&amp;pg=PT169&amp;lpg=PT169&amp;dq=Christmas+public+holiday+1958+scotland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JCXaDYyP-4&amp;sig=TP4-xkRD_jvMFMifck3Iemk1nYI&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=CBTbTu-aF7P44QT4-dSFDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Christmas%20public%20holiday%201958%20scotland&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colonial America]], the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Puritans]] of [[New England]] shared radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Celebration was outlawed in [[Boston]] from 1659 to 1681. The ban by the Pilgrims was revoked in 1681 by English governor [[Sir Edmund Andros]], however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bostonban&quot; /&gt;

At the same time, Christian residents of [[Virginia]] and [[NY|New York]] observed the holiday freely. [[Pennsylvania German]] Settlers, pre-eminently the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] settlers of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] and [[Lititz]] in Pennsylvania and the [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]] Settlements in North Carolina, were enthusiastic celebrators of Christmas.

[[George Washington]] attacked [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] (German) mercenaries on the day after Christmas during the [[Battle of Trenton]] on December 26, 1776, Christmas being much more popular in Germany than in America at this time.

In the early 19th century, writers imagined [[Tudor period|Tudor]] Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration. In 1843, [[Charles Dickens]] wrote the novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', that helped revive the 'spirit' of Christmas and seasonal merriment.&lt;ref name=standiford /&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP /&gt; Its instant popularity played a major role in portraying Christmas as a holiday emphasizing family, goodwill, and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, Geoffrey, ''Dickens and the Construction of Christmas'', [[History Today]], Volume: 43 Issue: 12, December 1993, pp. 17 – 24

Dickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centered festival of generosity, in contrast to the community-based and church-centered observations, the observance of which had dwindled during the late 18th century and early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton]] ''Stations of the Sun: The Ritual Year in England''. 1996. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-285448-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Superimposing his secular vision of the holiday, Dickens influenced many aspects of Christmas that are celebrated today in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games, and a festive generosity of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Michael Kelly (ed.) (2003), A Christmas Carol. pp.9,12 Broadview Literary Texts, New York: Broadview Press ISBN 1-55111-476-3&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent phrase from the tale, ''[[Holiday greetings#History of the phrase|'Merry Christmas']]'', was popularized following the appearance of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson Cochrane.

In Britain, the [[Christmas tree#18th and 19th centuries|Christmas tree]] was introduced in the early 19th century following the personal union with the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], by [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], Queen to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. In 1832 a young [[Queen Victoria]] wrote about her delight at having a Christmas tree, hung with [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|lights]], [[Christmas ornaments|ornaments]], and [[presents]] placed round it.&lt;ref&gt;The girlhood of Queen Victoria: a selection from Her Majesty's diaries. p.61.

An image of the British royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, created a sensation when it was published in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' in 1848. A modified version of this image was published in the United States in 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoemaker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'', 1850. ''Godey's'' copied it exactly, except he removed the Queen's crown, and Prince Albert's mustache, to remake the engraving into an American scene.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become common in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoemaker&quot;/&gt;

In America, interest in Christmas had been revived in the 1820s by several [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Washington Irving]] which appear in his ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon]]'' and &quot;Old Christmas&quot;. Irving's stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in [[Aston Hall]], Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Richard Michael (ed.)

In 1822, [[Clement Clarke Moore]] wrote the poem ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' (popularly known by its first line: ''Twas the Night Before Christmas'').&lt;ref&gt;Moore's poem transferred the genuine old Dutch traditions celebrated at New Year in New York, including the exchange of gifts, family feasting, and tales of “sinterklass” (a derivation in Dutch from “Saint Nicholas,” from whence comes the modern “Santa Claus”) to Christmas.[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/ch/in_america.htm ''The history of Christmas: Christmas history in America''], 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;
The poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance.&lt;ref&gt;usinfo.state.gov [http://usinfo.state.gov/scv/Archive/2005/Dec/19-344398.html “Americans Celebrate Christmas in Diverse Ways”] November 26, 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;
This also started the cultural conflict of the holiday's spiritualism and its [[commercialism]] that some see as corrupting the holiday. In her 1850 book &quot;The First Christmas in New England&quot;, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] includes a character who complains that [[the true meaning of Christmas]] was lost in a shopping spree.&lt;ref&gt;First [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] of Watertown [http://www.watertownfirstpres.org/sermons/12-11-05.html “Oh . . . and one more thing”] December 11, 2005

While the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] detected &quot;a transition state about Christmas here in New England&quot; in 1856. &quot;The old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday; though every year makes it more so&quot;.&lt;ref name=APH&gt;Restad, Penne L.

In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. [[Scotland]] is currently planning similar legislation. [[Film studio]]s release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, [[fantasy]] movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the [[Academy Awards]].

One [[economist]]'s analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a [[deadweight loss]] under orthodox [[microeconomic theory]], because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadweight&quot;&gt;&quot;The Deadweight Loss of Christmas&quot;, ''American Economic Review'', December 1993, '''83''' (5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=885748 &quot;Is Santa a deadweight loss?&quot;] ''The Economist'' December 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as [[white elephant]]s, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.
