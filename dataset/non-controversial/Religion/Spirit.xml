[[File:Theodor von Holst Bertalda Assailed Spirits.png|170px|thumb|[[Theodor von Holst]], ''Bertalda, Assailed by Spirits'', c.1830]]
The English word '''''spirit''''' (from [[Latin]] ''spiritus'' &quot;[[breath]]&quot;) has many differing meanings and connotations, most of them relating to a non-corporeal substance [[mind-body dualism|contrasted with the material body]]. The word spirit is often used metaphysically to refer to the [[consciousness]] or [[personality]].
The notions of a person's &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;soul&quot; often also overlap, as both contrast with [[body]] and both are understood as  surviving the bodily death in religion and occultism,&lt;ref&gt;OED &quot;spirit 2.a.: The soul of a person, as commended to God, or passing out of the body, in the moment of death.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
and &quot;spirit&quot; can also have the sense of &quot;[[ghost]]&quot;, i.e. a manifestation of the spirit of a deceased person.

The term may also refer to any incorporeal or immaterial being, such as [[demon]]s or [[deity|deities]], in Christianity specifically the [[Holy Spirit]] (though with a capital &quot;S&quot;) experienced by the disciples at Pentecost.

== Etymology ==
The English word '''''spirit''''' comes from the [[Latin]] ''spiritus'', meaning &quot;[[breath]]&quot;, but also &quot;spirit, soul, courage, vigor&quot;, ultimately from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*(s)peis''. It is distinguished from Latin ''anima'', &quot;[[soul]]&quot; (which nonetheless also derives from an Indo-European root meaning &quot;to breathe&quot;, earliest form ''*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;enh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-'' &lt;ref&gt;'''anə&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-'''. Watkins, Calvert, The American Heritage&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Dictionary of Indo-European Roots, second edition. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 2000, p. 4. Also available online at http://web.archive.org/web/20071208010420/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE17.html. [Note that '''ə&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''ə&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''ə&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' as used by Watkins are fully equivalent notational variants for '''h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', respectively, which are more widely used for the same Proto-Indo-European [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeal segments]].]&lt;/ref&gt;). In Greek, this distinction exists between ''[[pneuma]]'' (πνευμα), &quot;breath, motile air, spirit,&quot; and ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psykhē]]'' (ψυχη), &quot;soul&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;polysemy&quot;&gt;[[#polysemy|François 2008]], p.187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; (even though the latter term, ψῡχή = ''psykhē/psūkhē'', is also from an Indo-European root meaning &quot;to breathe&quot;: '''''*bhes-''''', [[Zero_grade#Zero_grade|zero grade]] '''''*bhs-''''' [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|devoicing]] in [[Proto-Greek_language#Proto-Greek_changes|proto-Greek]] to '''''*phs-''''', resulting in historical-period Greek '''''ps-''''' in '''''psūkhein''''', &quot;to breathe&quot;, whence '''''psūkhē''''', &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''''bhes-'''''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Watkins, Calvert, The American Heritage&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Dictionary of Indo-European Roots, second edition. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 2000, p. 11. Also available online at http://web.archive.org/web/20071208011042/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE60.html&lt;/ref&gt;).

The word &quot;spirit&quot; came into [[Middle English]] via [[Old French]]. The distinction between soul and spirit also developed in the [[Abrahamic religions]]: Arabic ''nafs'' (نفس) opposite ''rúħ'' (روح); Hebrew ''neshama'' (נְשָׁמָה ''nəšâmâh'') or ''[[nephesh]]'' (in Hebrew ''neshama'' comes from the root ''NŠM'' or &quot;breath&quot;) opposite ''ruach'' (רוּחַ ''rûaħ''). (Note, however, that in Semitic just as in Indo-European, this dichotomy has not ''always'' been as neat historically as it has come to be taken over a long period of development: Both '''נֶ֫פֶשׁ''' (root '''נפשׁ''') and '''רוּחַ''' (root '''רוח'''), as well as cognate words in various Semitic languages, including Arabic, also preserve meanings involving misc. air phenomena: &quot;breath&quot;, &quot;wind&quot;, and even &quot;odour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler, L., Baumgartner, W., Richardson, M.

== Metaphysical and metaphorical uses==
English-speakers use the word &quot;spirit&quot; in two related contexts, one [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and the other [[metaphorical]].

=== Metaphysical contexts ===
In metaphysical terms, &quot;spirit&quot; has acquired a number of meanings:

* An [[incorporeal]] but ubiquitous, non-quantifiable substance or [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] present individually in all living things.  Unlike the concept of souls (often regarded as eternal and sometimes believed to pre-exist the body) a spirit develops and grows as an integral aspect of a living being.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patheos.com/Library/Mormonism/Beliefs/Human-Nature-and-the-Purpose-of-Existence.html&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of the individual spirit occurs commonly in [[animism]].  Note the distinction between this concept of spirit and that of the pre-existing or eternal soul: belief in souls occurs specifically and far less commonly, particularly in traditional societies.  One might more properly term this type/aspect of spirit &quot;life&quot; (''bios'' in Greek) or &quot;[[aether (classical element)|aether]]&quot; rather than &quot;spirit&quot; (''pneuma'' in Greek).
* A [[Daemon (mythology)|daemon]] [[sprite (creature)|sprite]], or especially a [[ghost]].  People usually conceive of a ghost as a wandering spirit from a being no longer living, having survived the death of the body yet maintaining at least vestiges of [[mind]] and of [[consciousness]].
* In [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], the [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] of a human  has for obvious reasons become seen as strongly linked with the very occurrence of life. A similar significance has become attached to human [[blood]]. Spirit, in this sense, means the thing that separates a living body from a corpse&amp;mdash;and usually implies [[intelligence]], [[consciousness]], and [[sentience]].
*[[Latter-day Saint]] prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.]] taught that the concept of spirit as incorporeal or without substance was incorrect: &quot;There is no such thing as immaterial matter.  All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131?lang=eng 131:7]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] spiritual traditions the [[Great Spirit]] or [[Wakan Tanka]] is a term for the [[Supreme Being]].
* Various forms of [[animism]], such as Japan's [[Shinto]] and [[African traditional religion]], focus on invisible beings that represent or connect with plants, animals (sometimes called &quot;[[Animal spirit|Animal Fathers]])&quot;, or [[landform]]s ([[kami]]){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}: translators usually employ the English word &quot;spirit&quot; when trying to express the idea of such entities.
* Individual spirits envisaged as interconnected with all other spirits and with &quot;The Spirit&quot; (singular and [[capitalization|capitalized]]). This concept relates to theories of a unified [[spirituality]], to [[universal consciousness]] and to some concepts of [[Deity]]. In this scenario all separate &quot;spirits&quot;, when  connected, form a greater unity, the Spirit, which has an identity separate from its elements plus a [[consciousness]] and [[intellect]] greater than its elements; an ultimate, unified, non-[[dualism|dual]] awareness or [[force]] of [[life]] combining or transcending all individual units of consciousness.  The [[experience]] of such a connection can become a primary basis for [[supernatural|spiritual]] [[belief]].  The term ''spirit'' occurs in this sense in (to name but a few) [[Anthroposophy]], [[Aurobindo]], ''[[A Course In Miracles]],'' [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Ken Wilber]], and [[Meher Baba]] (though in his teachings, &quot;spirits&quot; are only ''apparently'' separate from each other and from &quot;The Spirit.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: [http://www.lordmeher.org ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher''], Volume Eighteen, Manifestation, Inc., 1986, p. 5937.&lt;/ref&gt; In this use, the term seems conceptually identical to [[Plotinus|Plotinus's]] &quot;[[Absolute (philosophy)|The One]]&quot; and [[Friedrich Schelling|Friedrich Schelling's]] &quot;[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]&quot;.  Similarly, according to the [[panentheism|panentheistic]]/[[pantheism|pantheistic]] view, Spirit equates to [[essence]] that can manifest itself as [[mind]]/[[soul]] through any level in pantheistic [[hierarchy]]/[[holarchy]], such as through a mind/soul of a single cell (with very primitive, elemental consciousness), or through a human or animal mind/soul (with [[consciousness]] on a level of organic synergy of an individual human/animal), or through a (superior) mind/soul with synergetically extremely complex/sophisticated consciousness of whole galaxies involving all sub-levels, all emanating (since the superior mind/soul operates non-dimensionally, or trans-dimensionally) from the one Spirit.
* Christian [[theology]] can use the term &quot;Spirit&quot; to describe [[God]], or aspects of God — as in the &quot;[[Holy Spirit]]&quot;, referring to a [[Triune God]] ([[Trinity]])(cf [[Gospel of Matthew]] 28:19).
*&quot;Spirit&quot; forms a central concept in [[pneumatology]] (note that pneumatology studies &quot;pneuma&quot; (Greek for &quot;spirit&quot;) not &quot;psyche&quot; (Greek for &quot;soul&quot;) — as studied in [[psychology]]).
* [[Christian Science]] uses &quot;Spirit&quot; as one of the seven synonyms for [[God]], as in: &quot;Principle; Mind; Soul; Spirit; Life; Truth; Love&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harmony Society|Harmonism]] reserves the term &quot;spirit&quot; for those that collectively control and influence an individual from the realm of the [[mind]].

=== Metaphorical usage ===

The [[metaphorical]] use of the term likewise groups several related meanings:

* The loyalty and feeling of inclusion in the social history or [[collective]] essence of an institution or group, such as in [[school spirit]] or ''[[esprit de corps]]''.
* A closely related meaning refers to the worldview of a person, place, or time, as in &quot;The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was written in the spirit of [[John Locke]] and his notions of liberty&quot;, or the term ''[[zeitgeist]]'', meaning &quot;spirit of the age&quot;.
* As a synonym for &quot;vivacity&quot; as in &quot;She performed the piece with spirit&quot; or &quot;She put up a spirited defense&quot;.
* The underlying intention of a [[writing|text]] as distinguished from its [[literal translation|literal]] meaning, especially in [[law]]; see [[Letter and spirit of the law]]
* As a term for [[alcoholic beverages]].
* In [[mysticism]]: [[existence]] in unity with [[God]]head.  Soul may also equate with spirit, but the soul involves certain individual human consciousness, while spirit comes from beyond that. Compare the psychological teaching of [[Al-Ghazali#Psychology|Al-Ghazali]].

''See'' [[soul]] ''and'' [[ghost]] ''and'' [[spirituality|spiritual]] ''for related discussions''.

==Related concepts in other languages==
Similar concepts in other languages include Greek ''[[pneuma]]'' and Sanskrit ''[[akasha]]/[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]'';&lt;ref name=&quot;polysemy&quot;/&gt; ''see also'' [[Prana]].

Some languages use a word for &quot;spirit&quot; often closely related (if not synonymous) to &quot;[[mind]]&quot;. Examples include the German, ''[[Geist]]'' (related to the English word &quot;ghost&quot;) or the French, 'l'esprit'. English versions of the Judaeo-Christian [[Bible]] most commonly translate the Hebrew word &quot;ruach&quot; (רוח; &quot;wind&quot;) as &quot;the spirit&quot;, whose essence is divine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalheritage.org/Bible%20Studies/ruach.htm RUACH: Spirit or Wind or ???] at Biblical Heritage Center&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Ruach HaKodesh|''ruach hakodesh'']]). Alternatively, Hebrew texts commonly use the word ''[[nephesh]]''. [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] regard ''nephesh'' as one of the five parts of the Jewish [[soul]], where ''nephesh'' (animal) refers to the physical being and its animal instincts. Similarly, [[Scandinavian languages]], Baltic languages, Slavic languages and the [[Chinese language]] (''[[qi]]'') use the words for &quot;breath&quot; to express concepts similar to &quot;the spirit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;polysemy&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- Dumpmerge from Rooah:
''Rooah'' (also transliterated ''ruah'' or ''ruach'') is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning ''[[wind]]'' or ''[[spirit]]''.
