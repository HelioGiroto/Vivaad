Then why not take as the basis for working on a text that did start with the ordinary understanding of what &quot;Lucifer&quot; means: 

'''Lucifer''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|l|uː|s|ɪ|f|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|l|juː|s|ɪ|f|ər}}) is a name given in [[Western Christianity]] to an [[angel]]ic being supposed to have been referred to in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:1-17|NIV}}, a text that describes a king of Babylon as a fallen ''morning star'' (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], הילל, ''hêlēl'',&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;H1966&quot;&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H1966&amp;t=KJV Strong's Number H1966]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; literally &quot;shining one&quot;).&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(H2122); {{harvnb|Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary|2011|p=862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; This word was translated in the late 4th-century [[Vulgate]] as ''lucifer'' ([[Latin]] for &quot;morning star&quot;, literally &quot;light-bringing&quot;).&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dlucifer Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Unlike the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ἑωσφόρος (''heosphoros''), the translation of הילל in the [[Septuagint]],&lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.septuagint.org/LXX/Isaiah/14 Septuagint text of Isaiah 14.] The writer of the [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10177-lucifer article &quot;LUCIFER (Φωσφόρος)&quot;] in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] mistakenly says that φωσφόρος (''phosphoros'') is the word the Septuagint used to translate הילל.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; the Latin word ''lucifer'' later came to be used as a proper name for the [[fallen angel]] supposedly referred to in the text, who was identified with the [[Devil]].&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary|2011|p=863}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winn|first=Shan M.M.|title=Heaven, heroes, and happiness : the Indo-European roots of Western ideology.|year=1995|publisher=University press of America|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0819198609|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Schwartz,108&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Among the works of literature that use the name in this way are [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'', [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and the [[King James Version]] of Isaiah 14:12.

Apart from its common use as a proper name for this supposed angelic being, the word &quot;lucifer&quot; is applied also to the [[planet]] [[Venus]] in its dawn appearance (capitalized when personified), to a [[match#friction marches|friction match]], and to a [[lucifer (prawn)|genus of prawn]].&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?lucifer lucifer definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 17:21, 17 July 2012 (UTC)

::Verification of what?  The Latin word &quot;Lucifer&quot; undeniably exists both in that language and in languages that derived vocabulary from that language.  Do you have any doubt that in those languages &quot;Lucifer&quot; is used as a name for the leading fallen angel?  If you do, let me know which language and I will try to find you a source.  On the other hand, although Greek has in recent centuries adopted many words from the West, it has not adopted a word derived from &quot;Lucifer&quot;.  The Google translator gives for English &quot;Lucifer&quot; Greek &quot;Αυγερινός&quot; (''Avyerin'''o'''s''), which means &quot;morning star&quot; (literally, &quot;associated with the dawn&quot;).  And for Εωσφόρος (which, as you know, was the word, with a slightly different spelling and which then meant only &quot;morning star&quot;, used in the Jewish Septuagint translation of Isaiah 14:12 into Koine Greek) my dictionary of modern Greek gives two meanings: 1) Σατανάς (Satan); and 2) Αυγερινός.  You are not suggesting, are you, that to include traditions of languages such as Greek the title of the article be changed to &quot;Morning Star (fallen angel)&quot;?  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 19:58, 17 July 2012 (UTC)
:::I'm still puzzled about what you think should be verified.  There is no doubt, is there, that in Western Christianity &quot;Lucifer&quot; came to be used as a name for the devil?  Are you worried about the suggestion that &quot;Lucifer&quot; did not come to be used in that way in Eastern Christianity?  That is not stated explicitly and, if it were, that is what would need to be verified.  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 07:23, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
::::I apologize, I got a little confused because [[Eastern Christianity]] readily accepted the ''Apocalypses'', but I guess it make sense that the Lucifer/Satan identification would take off in [[Western Christianity]] because of ''lucifer'' being rooted in Latin. So... I guess we can remove the tag then...&amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; [[User talk:Jasonasosa|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jasonasosa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 07:44, 18 July 2012 (UTC)

== Comment ==

I note that the ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' edited by Lindsay Jones, which is the second edition of the earlier volume of the same name edited by Mircea Eliade, has a separate article on Lucifer which is included in their outline as a part of &quot;Canaanite mythology.&quot; If anyone here has access to either of those works, they would be very valuable sources for an idea of what to include here. I probably won't get to that book until next Monday myself, but I can try to remember to check it then if someone drops me a note to do so. But that book is the most highly regarded refernce work in this field that isn't clearly tied to any particular &quot;school&quot; of religious thought, and I read all the reviews I could find and found critical comments about some articles, but not this one, so I assume it might be one of the better indicators of what to include in this article here out there. Like I said, though, try to remind me over the weekend if you want me to check, because any attempts I make to have a &quot;things-to-do&quot; list pretty much disappears or becomes useless due to new developments fairly fast.

:Thanks [[User:John Carter]] for your input here. It's much welcomed and appreciated. I will check out my library to see what I can come up with. I live in Vegas, so resources here are plenty.&amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; [[User talk:Jasonasosa|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jasonasosa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]] 04:50, 18 July 2012 (UTC)

== Does this Taxil's Hoax thing belong in this article? ==

Seems pointless to have an entire section about debunking something previously not mentioned on the page, only indirectly related to the article itself, and unlikely to have been known to the user beforehand. Shouldn't it be in a freemasonry article or something?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.36.233.115|92.36.233.115]] ([[User talk:92.36.233.115|talk]]) 21:36, 11 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The section reports about the hoax and also (not exclusively) about the debunking, which was done by Taxil himself, not by Wikipedia.  I think the section should be kept.  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 07:36, 12 August 2012 (UTC)

== Lucifer VS Satan ==

I have the impression that this article does not emphasize enough on the difference between Satan and Lucifer as two different entities. Is it really the same figure/character/angel or is there actually a difference? The [[Seven Princes of Hell]] puts Satan and Lucifer as two parts of the seven rulers of hell (wrath and pride respectively). [[Special:Contributions/88.89.42.79|88.89.42.79]] ([[User talk:88.89.42.79|talk]]) 21:11, 1 November 2012 (UTC)
:I don't think that Rosemary Ellen Guiley, the source cited for the Seven Princes of Hell, is at all as notable as Milton and Dante, who identify Lucifer with Satan.  In fact, I think the [[Seven Princes of Hell]] article should be deleted as simply not notable.  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 21:37, 1 November 2012 (UTC)
::Seven Princes of Hell isn't synonymous or limited to the source of its article... It is a well known part of Christian theology, (see [[Peter Binsfeld]] for one) and part of the [[Seven deadly sins]]. But this is not really a big part of my initial post. [[Special:Contributions/88.89.42.79|88.89.42.79]] ([[User talk:88.89.42.79|talk]]) 21:44, 1 November 2012 (UTC)
:::The seven deadly sins are certainly a well-known part of Christian theology; but I confess that until now I never once heard of the &quot;Seven Princes of Hell&quot;.  Just my ignorance?  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 21:48, 1 November 2012 (UTC)</text>
