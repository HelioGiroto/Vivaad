== Revert by Tritomex ==

{{Discussion top|The result is '''no consensus''' for the change introduced by Dailycare. This discussion is long, convoluted, and has taken place against the backdrop of other ongoing discussions on this page which make arriving and a productive conclusion difficult. However, I have taken all viewpoints into consideration, and when disregarding those which are irrelevant, I can see that there is some weak support for the current status quo.

To start, Dailycare's initial edit was made with the edit summary &quot;after discussion on talk&quot;. However, discussion on this page has been far from clear. I feel it is troublesome to unilaterally arrive at a &quot;consensus&quot; viewpoint by method of disregarding comments from other editors which one deems to be invalid. The arguments in opposition can be summarised as:

#The change introduces unnecessary repetition to an already complicated and difficult-to-read lead, since the controversy over Jerusalem's official status is already amply discussed.
#The sentence in its original form was already balanced, as it states that Jerusalem is not internationally recognised as the capital.

The arguments in support of Dailycare's change can be summarised as:

#Dailycare's original justification that his edit was based on the result of talk page discussions (a claim I find hard to ratify).
#The fact that the edit introduces repetition doesn't matter, as there is already a lot of other repetition in the article and we would need to remove all that too.

I find the first of the arguments in opposition to be valid, if only weakly compelling. I do not find any of the arguments in support to be valid, particularly the [[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS|second]].

The latter half of this discussion derailed into a long-winded discussion about semantics and the morality/legality of Israel's seizure of East Jerusalem. I find this part of the discussion to be irrelevant to the outcome of this discussion, since the sentence in question makes no bold claim about the legal status of East Jerusalem. I find attempts to derail the discussion by speculating what is implied by the sentence to be particularly unhelpful.

For reasons of clarity, I feel it important to declare (to those who do not routinely investigate) that I am not an administrator and as such this is a non-admin close. However, I have no iron in this fire and have never edited in this area before. I have done by utmost to be impartial. [[User:Basalisk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''Basa'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;CC9900&quot;&gt;'''lisk'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Basalisk|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;inspect damage&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]‚ÅÑ[[User talk:Basalisk|&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;CC9900&quot;&gt;berate&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]] 15:33, 27 October 2012 (UTC)}}

Tritomex reverted an edit of mine [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerusalem&amp;diff=516859626&amp;oldid=516855500 here]. However the edit summary merely says &quot;no consensus&quot; and &quot;not acceptable&quot; which isn't sufficient, as on the talkpage no substantial policy-based objections to the edit came up in discussion, above. Unless such objections surface here in a couple of days, I'll re-do the edit. Comments along the lines of &quot;I support the current version&quot;, &quot;I don't support any change&quot; etc don't carry any weight per [[WP:CONSENSUS]] (&quot;The quality of an argument is more important than whether it represents a minority or a majority view. The arguments &quot;I just don't like it&quot; and &quot;I just like it&quot; usually carry no weight whatsoever.&quot;)  Cheers, --[[User:Dailycare|Dailycare]] ([[User talk:Dailycare|talk]]) 18:28, 10 October 2012 (UTC)
:You know you had no consensus for that edit. It had exactly ''nobody'' supporting it and at least one person objecting to it, and that's putting aside the people who said they think the current version is fine. You do not get to decide if other editors' arguments are valid or not. Luckily for you someone reverted your edit before I saw it but if you do it again I'll be going straight to AE with no further warning.

Threatening AE here and on another user's talk page multiple times. Knock it of Nableezy. We all know you aren't going to AE since the edit wasn't bad enough to warrant it and you would just get a boomerang. Stop trying to wield it like a big stick since you have successfully used it a handful of times to knock off editors who deserved it. You are next on the chopping block anyways. The proposal a couple sections above is perfect and everyone should chill out and consider how it could be a benefit to the reader. It would also save a lot of bickering.[[User:Cptnono|Cptnono]] ([[User talk:Cptnono|talk]]) 06:28, 11 October 2012 (UTC)

:As I was honored personally in the name of section I feel the need to reflect on few assumptions.
I don't know what entitle anyone to qualify its personal point of view as &quot;substantial&quot; and to disqualify the majority opinion made by six or seven editors as unsubstantial. The evaluation of the &quot;quality of arguments&quot; is beyond any objective measurement and as far as I have noticed no one who opposed changing of current wording  seems to be impressed by those arguments. As many editors here I have opposed any change in current wording, especially double negations,  based on my assumption that the current wording is already reflecting balanced and neutral position.

::Nonsense. This is a line-up parade. The opinion that this is 'neutral and balance' is predictably identified with one set of editors, whose belief is opposed by another set. There has been, in this tiresome rehearsal, only one editor who has tried to rise above the fray and propose creative solutions, successively modifying his proposals to reflect input. Despite this, they were worn down by absurd filibustering. Thus, everything is stalled. If people will not come to some fair adjustment, the lead should remain as it was, i.e., as satisfying no one. No one is replying to the lockstep proposals and votes because they are meaningless, and even arguing here is a waste of time.  The only way to fix this, given the lack of goodwill, would be for admins to tell everyone to fuck off, and put in accomplished article outsider FA writers to fix it.--[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 17:08, 11 October 2012 (UTC)
(outdent) Saying I &quot;knew&quot; there was no consensus for the edit is wrong, since exactly one person commented on the proposal, by opposing it on the basis that, wait for this, it would ''change the meaning of the sentence''. This isn't even remotely a substantial policy-based argument, and therefore doesn't affect the existence or non-existence of consensus in any way. I challenged the user to identify a policy he was referring to, which he failed to do. In this thread, by the way, I currently see exactly zero policy-based objections to the edit. Therefore not only did the edit have consensus to begin with, it still has consensus. Cheers, --[[User:Dailycare|Dailycare]] ([[User talk:Dailycare|talk]]) 19:37, 11 October 2012 (UTC)

:Dailycare What you currently see or do not see is your personal issue. Seven editors here do not see that you have a right or consensus here to make changes which you try to enforce above all of us. I have said and I will not repeat my self every time you come back with threats to report someone, or to force upon everyone your personal believes and impressions. Jerusalem is a capital of Israel (Fact) it is not recognized by most of international community as such (Fact) Those two facts function independently from each other and the neutrality of this sentence can be achieved only by combining them. As the first half of sentence may look problematic to you, the second part has even more bases to be challenged by others. This is why the current form is balanced and neutral. --[[User:Tritomex|Tritomex]] ([[User talk:Tritomex|talk]]) 22:20, 11 October 2012 (UTC)
::Tritomex, is it a fact that [[East Jerusalem]], the part of the city that is across the green line, is part of [[Jerusalem]] ? I think we would all agree that the answer to that question is &quot;yes&quot;. If &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel&quot; is a fact, and East Jerusalem is part of Jerusalem, it follows that it is a fact that East Jerusalem is part of the capital of Israel. But it is not a '''fact''' that East Jerusalem is part of the capital of Israel because it is not a fact that East Jerusalem is in Israel. It is the opinion of the State of Israel that East Jerusalem is part of the capital of Israel. Can you see the problem ? There is a contradiction. It's shining brightly. Please can you confirm that you can at least see it ? It seems to me that many editors cannot see it or choose to ignore it, whereas many reliable sources recognize this contradiction and deal with accordingly through careful wording. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Sean.hoyland|&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;Sean.hoyland&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - '''[[User talk:Sean.hoyland|talk]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 05:15, 12 October 2012 (UTC)

::Sean.hoyland, Jerusalem was declared capital of Israel in 1950, so this fact has nothing to do with the annexation and extension of Jerusalem city borders in 1980. East Jerusalem had only 6,4 square km in 1967-under Jordanian occupation, which means that if we would fully ignore Israeli Jerusalem law of 1980 we would have an article about a city with 300 000 inhabitants(internationally recognized  East+West Jerusalem) and 55 square kilometers. Also we should refer to almost all Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem as villages outside Jerusalem (this is their legal status from 1948 and even from 1967 Jordanian occupation) as they were declared part of Jerusalem  unilaterally by Israel, under  Jerusalem law. Also such Jerusalem would have only 50 000 Palestinian citizens. However we have article here which use Israeli Jerusalem law referring to the city of more than 800 000 inhabitants and 125 sq.km.
Again, the extension of Jerusalem is as much (Il)legal as the annexation of East Jerusalem, as it is based on same law, which was not recognized by UN or by most of international community. So technically speaking, yes the borders of Jerusalem, its population and neighborhoods, could be as much in dispute as its status.
However, the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel predates the 1967 war and this fact is independent from international recognition or negation.--[[User:Tritomex|Tritomex]] ([[User talk:Tritomex|talk]]) 15:16, 12 October 2012 (UTC)
::You're extremely confused. When Jerusalem was declared the capital in 1950 it was not a declaration that Jordanian Jerusalem was the capital of Israel. (b) there was no formal annexation of Jerusalem in 1980 according to authoritative legal opinion (c) you appear to be wholly unfamiliar with [[WP:NPOV]], which obliges editors to respect neutrality, even those editors, as your above screed shows, who can see only one side, Israel's, to a complex question. Whatever Israel determines as its 'facts', is a partial perspective, and per policy, must be balanced by other perspectives, be they of the international community or the Palestinians. The refusal to acknowledge that there are two perspectives here is getting rather blatant. The policy reads:'This policy is nonnegotiable and '''all editors and articles must follow it'''. It's a curiosity that administrators never force compliance with this non-negotiable policy in this area.--[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 16:30, 12 October 2012 (UTC)
:Tritomex, don't fall into Sean's trap. His assertion that &quot;But it is not a 'fact that East Jerusalem is part of the capital of Israel because it is not a fact that East Jerusalem is in Israel&quot; is nothing more than his opinion. You may have noticed that some editors like to redefine the word &quot;capital&quot; to include all kinds of limitations and conditions that don't actually appear anywhere the word is defined.

::Nishidani I am very much familiar with [[WP:NPOV]] and I do adhere to it.  I am also sometimes surprised &quot;that administrators never force compliance with this non-negotiable policy in this area&quot; As for example in the case of your main page, where you are narrating solely the Palestinian perspective in a  way that is a clear example what [[WP:NPOV]] is not.
Please familiarize yourself with the terminological meaning of annexation. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation] Annexation as occupation is unilateral move and an established fact  regardless of authoritative legal opinion or the legality of such act. This mean that annexation can  be legal or illegal as well. In its terminological construct annexation do not allude or determine the legality of such action, (although it imply to unilateralism)  it simply reflect the action without its repercussion. In this way   annexation cant be non existing if it happened.

As we have said already  everything in this dialogue and there is evidently  no consensus I do not see any reason to artificially prolong it.

::Assertions count nothing against evidence. You are apparently not familiar with basic editing protocols. You ignore the obligations of [[WP:NPOV]], and now you cite a wiki article [[Annexation]] as evidence for a fact, again showing that you are unfamiliar with what all practiced editors know, i.e.,[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a reliable source|Wikipedia is not a reliable source]]. You are consistently ignoring policy, and confusing an identifiable political-partisan position with facts. Israel's position is one of several facts, and NPOV requires that in composition, the other &quot;facts&quot; be included in order to avoid passing off one tilted perspective as the only one that counts.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 09:17, 13 October 2012 (UTC)
:Tritomex, you rely in your argumentation on what you call facts. This is in fact not in-line with what policy states, since we should rather edit based on what best sources say, than on what we consider to be the facts. However, ''arguendo'', do you think it's '''not''' a fact that Jerusalem is the capital under Israeli law? Applying your fact-based theory, it seems that my edit is in fact better in-line with it than the longstanding wording, since it's a noncontroversial, bland and universally non-contested fact that Jerusalem is, under Israeli law, the capital city of Israel. On the other hand, the General Assembly has recently passed, with overwhelming support, a resolution stating that the proclamation of Jerusalem as capital is &quot;null and void&quot;. To the extent that you're advancing your fact-based theory as a policy-based objection to the edit, which policy are you referring to? [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/FRUS5_31_62a.html This] source, by the way, describes objections to the notion of Jerusalem as Israel's capital already before 1967.  --[[User:Dailycare|Dailycare]] ([[User talk:Dailycare|talk]]) 20:40, 12 October 2012 (UTC)

UN GA has no power  by its charta to pass biding resolutions,  as such power lies   only in the domain of UN SC. As in the previous case mentioned, international recognition, do not change facts such as occupation, annexation, declaration of independence, and facts regarding capital of each  state. Political opinion has its dynamics [http://www.haaretz.com/news/abbas-slams-obama-for-saying-jerusalem-to-stay-israel-s-undivided-capital-1.247201] and as I will say this for the last time, if the wording that Jerusalem is not internationally recognized as the capital of Israel (which is in my opinion POV against Israel, due to the abstract meaning of the term &quot;international community&quot;  and due to absolutist wording of this claim) is included in leading sentence, the avoidance of further POV could be achieved only by keeping the current form. By inserting double negation,  this article  would be transformed from good NPOV in to Palestinian political pamphlet. 
Definition of capital [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city] I do not see any connection between the substantial meaning of this term   and international recognition of the same.

:::DC, as you constantly demand &quot;policy-based objections&quot;, I'll give you a few.  Attempting to misuse, contradict or reinterpret the meanings of terms defined in the dictionary to serve your own agenda appears to violate the policy against [[WP:OR|original research]], and is [[WP:NPOV|POV]].  It must be said again: Israel has designated Jerusalem as its capital, and Israel is governed from there.  That much is well sourced.  It is '''not''' sourced that recognition or approval by any outside party is relevant to what makes a capital a capital.  Therefore, adding a modifier such as &quot;under Israeli law&quot; is restrictive and misleading.  Repeatedly ignoring, or branding as invalid, arguments that contradict your position, and falsely claiming consensus for a change (or that none is needed), can be seen as [[WP:DISRUPTIVE|disruptive]]‚Äîanother policy violated.  You recently (11 Oct.) claimed (with astonishment) that an editor objected to your edit on the basis that (&quot;wait for this&quot;, you said) it &quot;would change the meaning of the sentence&quot;.  Strange, I can't find that phrase anywhere in this discussion.  However, controversial edits often do seek to change the meaning of a text, and that is indeed the effect of your proposed change.  I hope your &quot;uninvolved party&quot; will readily see that the existing text is a proper representation and that consensus to change it is lacking.

You objected to this edit in your comment timestamped 20:06, 2 October 2012 by stating &quot;Adding &quot;under Israeli law&quot; would be restrictive and '''a major change in the meaning'''&quot;. I'm sure you agree, that isn't a policy-based objection and indeed when challenged you were unable to name a policy that says we can't change the meaning of text in articles.

:::::Ask the same basic questions over and over, you are likely to get the same basic answers.  Once again, you can't change the meaning or usage of words as defined in the '''dictionary''' and use them as you please.  That would be POV and OR.  As Jerusalem is both designated by Israel as its capital '''and''' where the government institutions are located, it complies with the commonplace dictionary definition of a capital city and is '''simply''' the capital.  You keep insisting on altering that simple statement with superfluous, limiting modifiers.

:::::OR and POV-pushing come in when you maintain that embellishment (in this case restrictive language) is called for, rather than the simple, direct statement we have in place now.  Israel's capital, not just &quot;under Israeli law&quot;.  The capital, period, full stop.

The Basic Law states plainly that it is, and the edit doesn't say that according to other laws it isn't, so it's not in any way &quot;restrictive&quot; either. (not that using a dictionary like you're proposing is a valid argument to begin with, or that there would be anything wrong in restricting meanings)

:::::::::One way or another, we've been over basically this same ground before, all too many times.  Along the way I have expressed my ''policy-based'' objections as requested, and won't repeat them here.  What makes a capital a capital is readily ascertainable, and applicable.  Anything further added to the statement in question is obfuscation, and irrelevant.  It may be technically correct to say &quot;under Israeli law&quot;, but unless you intend to add &quot;and in every other way&quot;, or the like, you would be &quot;[[poisoning the well]]&quot;, because saying &quot;under Israeli law&quot; implies &quot;'''only''' under Israeli law&quot;, as I'm sure you know or ought to know.  Such tendentious errors of omission are not &quot;good faith&quot; editing.  What Britain (&amp; other outside parties) may have to say is also irrelevant; they can disapprove, but they cannot make it not be the capital.  If it could be shown otherwise, I think it would have been by now.

In other words, you can't maintain both that sources matter and your &quot;simply the capital&quot; theory. Concerning the &quot;Israeli law&quot; point, the idea there is precisely that the edit doesn't take a side, rather it describes the sides.

Not just the term international community is abstract term but in this case is factually fraud term. All countries that recognized Israel, recognized its institution in accordance with Israeli law. 22 countries have specifically   recognized Jerusalem as Israel capital and never revoked this recognition. Although by the latter of international law there is no specific need to recognize the institutions of the state, if the recognition of the state is already done, this countries have did so. What they objected was 1980 annexation of EJ, not the proclamation of Jerusalem as Israel capital. See (Mosheh  ªAmirav,Jerusalem Syndrome: The Palestinian-Israeli Battle for the Holy City, Sussex University Press, 2009 p.27)
The term international community in this case is POV.--[[User:Tritomex|Tritomex]] ([[User talk:Tritomex|talk]]) 12:01, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

::I'm glad you cited that admirable book by Amirav, which I'm familiar with. It serves to kill two birds with one stone
::Biosketch said earlier I was distorting sources, which was nonsense. My source said Israel declared '''West Jerusalem''' its capital (Michael Dumper) the prior source just said Israel in 1948 declared 'Jerusalem' its capital. Dumper is correct. The 1948 declaration did not declare that the capital of Israel was partially in Jordanian territory. It declared that its capital was in that part of Jerusalem held by Israel. Amirav again clarifies:-
::&lt;blockquote&gt;'In 1948, Al Quds came under Jordanian rule, while '''the western part of the city, which was declared the capital of Israel, became known as Jerusalem''' p.21 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
::&lt;blockquote&gt;'what the Ben-Gurion government did in the 1950s '''when it declared ''West Jerusalem'' to be the country's capital'''.' (p.26) 
::In other words, Biosketch accuses me of misrepresenting a source, when the source I added says exactly what I said it did, and a further source, by a Jerusalem policy expert, confirms that when Israel declared Jerusalem its capital, it referred to the western sector. This is what I mean by refusal to look at RS, refusal to compromise when RS clarify terms that are ambiguous. You are all culpable of a stubborn refusal to accept what RS that are not generic, but specific, written by Jerusalemite urban planning experts, or authorities on the city, quite clearly say.

::To address your specific point. 
 
::*&lt;blockquote&gt; 22 countries '''have''' specifically   recognized Jerusalem as Israel capital and never revoked this recognition. Although by the latter (sic?) of international law there is no specific need to recognize the institutions of the state, if the recognition of the state is already done, this (sic?) countries have did (sic) so. What they objected (sic?=to) was (sic =the) 1980 annexation of EJ, not the proclamation of Jerusalem as Israel(sic=i/'s) capital. See (Mosheh  ªAmirav,Jerusalem Syndrome: The Palestinian-Israeli Battle for the Holy City, Sussex University Press, 2009 p.27)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::It's understandable that your English is somewhat awkward. Unfortunately, this means you are a poor reader of what English books say, which, when added to your frequent [[WP:OR]] hermeneutic divagations, makes following your argument a laborious task. One can hardly argue with someone who cites a book and twice capsizes its its evidence and argument.
::You confuse the past present tense (have) with the past tense. Thus Amirav says 24 countries 'agreed to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and transferred their embassies there' (p.26) '''in the 1950s'''. He then says 'Twenty-two of the twenty four countries that '''had ''previously'' recognized''' Jerusalem as the capital of Israel moved their embassies out of the city' following the passage of the Jerusalem Basic Law of 1980.(p.27) The remaining two, Costa Rica and El Salvador, joined the boycott in 2006. So you have utterly distorted your source, and interpreted a withdrawal of recognition by 24 countries in the source into a recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. It is a rather monstrous thing to do, this [[WP:OR]] interpretation of Amirav, which changes documentation by Amirav that 24 countries reneged on their recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital into 'What they objected was 1980 annexation of EJ, not the proclamation of Jerusalem as Israel capital.' 

::Your editing, and arguments here, are troublesome because they are poorly explained, distort sources, and press rather vigorously for 'solutions' that strike many other editors as negligent of [[WP:NPOV]]. It's very difficult to sustain a dialogue if this pattern of distortion and neglect continues.

::::I now see what Tritomex is doing. He is, as with his argument about Annexation, also here not looking at sources. He is reading a wiki page, and culling sources from that page without even verifying them independently. In this case, his incomprehensible ref to 22 countries recognizing the country comes from the Jerusalem article before I just now changed it (which used the figures 20-22). He cited Amirav without checking it. This is fundamental to editing. Wikipedia, to repeat what I said earlier, is not a reliable source, and editors should not pretend they have read a source, when all they have done is read the wikipage citing that source.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 16:04, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

The relocation of embassies was in protest of Israel annexation of East Jerusalem and there was no &quot;withdrawal of recognition&quot; I do not think that Nishadani do not know the difference between relocation of embassies and withdrawal of recognition. His reacting to arguments shown here by directly and immediately  making edits in to the article based  on his own believes and by  misinterpreting different sources without even looking for any consensus. For example he directly translated &quot;relocation of embassies&quot; in to &quot;withdrawal of recognition&quot; I will not engage myself in further dialogue with him.--[[User:Tritomex|Tritomex]] ([[User talk:Tritomex|talk]]) 16:46, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

It is [[WP:OR]] to make an inference, as you are doing, from two distinct passages and then declare thee inference to be either a fact, or what the author thought.

Everyone in the diplomatic, historical and political world knows exactly what the Security Council of Resolution 478 (1980) on 20 August 1980 asked and how its first and second points led to relocation by states. Not the UN. It was the Security Council by a 14-0 vote. If you don't know the background you can play all the games you like. People are fixated on the lead, and ignore fixing the body of the article. It isn't even true that Costa Rica and San Salvador kept on there till 2006.

::Tritomex, can you confirm that you understand that that section of the book is talking about West Jerusalem ? When we say &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel&quot; are we referring to West Jerusalem ? If so, we should change it to say that. This article is about the whole city though, including East Jerusalem, so when we say &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel&quot;, we are referring to the city described by this article, the city &quot;complete and united&quot; that Israel has declared as the capital, which includes both West and East Jerusalem, hence the neutrality dispute. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Sean.hoyland|&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;Sean.hoyland&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - '''[[User talk:Sean.hoyland|talk]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 17:33, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

::Well, this article is about the entire city of Jerusalem, whatever that means over its long history. There is an article about [[West Jerusalem]] and an article about [[East Jerusalem]]. For the PNA, East Jerusalem is part of the [[Jerusalem Governorate]] and I don't know what criteria they use to distinguish between city and not-city, but it isn't relevant to the disputed issue here. The dispute is caused by ignoring the green line and stating as a fact that the city described by this article is the capital of Israel including the parts of the city of Jerusalem across the green line. That means we are saying they are in Israel. Think about the consequences of that statement if we cascaded the spatial relations that follow from that statement to other articles. It follows that the Western Wall is in Israel, the entire Old City is in Israel etc. Those are not facts according to RS. We have contradictions in spatial relations between articles. It isn't clear why the people who advocate the statement &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel&quot; as an NPOV compliant statement don't do it properly by adding &quot;complete and united&quot; or &quot;including East Jerusalem&quot;. What's the problem ? Why not cascade the spatial relationships that inevitably follow from that statement to other articles ? If it is a fact that the city this article is about is the capital of Israel, many things follow from that simply because of topology. Apparently the only people with the balls to make those kind of changes across article space, to say that the Old City is in Israel for example, to explicitly label places across the green line in East Jerusalem as being in Israel etc are so sure that they are right, so sure that &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel&quot; is a fact, that they are willing to be blocked and topic banned for it.

::::That is an odd request. That line of argument will take you somewhere you don't want to go. We know that a city can be proclaimed/declared/designated/pick-a-word as the capital (and consequently be described by sources as the capital, the proclaimed capital, the declared capital etc) without there being de jure sovereignty over the city or even de facto control. We know that's possible because that's exactly what both Israel and Palestine have done and reliable sources talk about it. We have a source, Israel's basic law, that explicitly states as a fact that &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, the subject of this article, is the capital of Israel, and another source, Palestinian basic law, that explicitly states as a fact that &quot;Jerusalem&quot; is the capital of Palestine. Neither case establishes that it is an undisputed objective fact that Jerusalem is the capital of anything to the extent that we can present it to readers as if it is the same as saying 1+1=2. It's obvious that these are not facts but the positions of the parties to the dispute and need to be presented that way. We already know something is wrong here because we have a source, an important source given that it is from one of the parties to the conflict, that explicitly contradicts, or at the very least, calls into question the factual nature of the statement in the lead, and that is without even looking at the thousands of independent reliable sources that deal with this issue in a whole variety of ways. What normally follows at this point, as soon as sources are mentioned, is the policy violating, time wasting, nonsense of using dictionary definitions of the word capital to &quot;prove&quot; that the entire city described by this article is the capital of Israel and only Israel as a matter of fact. This is of course original research and not allowed. But what is worse for me, setting aside the policy violation, is that it's a method that doesn't even work. A city isn't, as a matter of undisputed objective fact, a capital because it matches one, many or all of the attributes dictionaries use in their definitions such as &quot;city...that is the official seat of government in a country...&quot;, &quot;city...that functions as the seat of government and administrative centre of a country...&quot;, &quot;the seat of government of a country&quot; or whatever. We know this because the method fails for various cases such as the Netherlands. A method only has to produce an invalid result once to know that there is something wrong with the method. Editors surely know this so it really is very odd for editors to try to use a method that doesn't even work to violate a core policy here of all places. 

::::I think the problem for you and everyone who wants to retain this statement of fact are the policies [[WP:V]] and [[WP:NPOV]]. If you want to make an unattributed statement of fact in this article, it's you who has to prove that the city described by this article, the whole city, is the capital of Israel as a matter of undisputed fact. I don't think anyone here has ever done that, or knows how to do it, and given the nature of Wikipedia's rules and the variation in how sources handle this issue, I don't think it is even possible. There has been a failure to demonstrate that the statement of fact complies with policy. It nearly complies but falls short. Reasonable alternatives that could end this dispute once and for all have been suggested. 

::::I'm not sure where you think my opinion comes into this. You have said things like this a couple of times without pointing out precisely what you are referring to. Perhaps you mean my opinion that the statement &quot;X is the capital of Y&quot; where X is a city and Y is a &quot;a country or other political unit&quot; implies the spatial relations Y contains X and X is within Y to the reader in Wikipedia's voice. I think that is a reasonable assumption about how readers will parse that kind of statement because that is how things normally work for capital cities. I suppose an exception might be Kinshasa-Brazzaville if the combined name becomes more widely used, 1 city in effect, 2 capitals, both within different countries.  

::::While you are pondering the next &quot;Please provide a source that says...&quot; question to ask editors, why don't you find a source that says that a city can ''only'' be designated as the capital by the country/political unit with de facto control over the city. Perhaps the international community can decide what the capital of Israel is. Perhaps a basket of red herrings can make the decision. Without a source that says they can't, someone could argue endlessly that it's hard to tell and more time would be wasted not just looking at how sources deal with this issue and applying Wikipedia's content rules to it. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Sean.hoyland|&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;Sean.hoyland&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - '''[[User talk:Sean.hoyland|talk]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 09:07, 17 October 2012 (UTC)

The issue is not just if the wording &quot;not internationally recognised&quot; is accurate or not, the problem is there is still a dispute on this page if that belongs in the opening sentence like that. The entire sentence has some neutrality concerns by people regarding different parts (some on the capital of Israel and some regarding stating something in the first sentence that is already stated more clearly further down the article intro). For that reason the neutrality tag warrants encompassing both points. At present the tag position suggests the fact Israel is the capital isnt seen as neutral, yet the next part of the sentence is entirely accepted. That is not the case.. Clearly putting the tag at the end of that part of the sentence still encompasses the fact the whole issue arond Jerusalems status has concerns. Its the only reasonable wayto be balanced. Of course ideally as there is no consensus for a change, no tag should be kept there. Most oppose the changes a small number of editors are demanding.[[User:BritishWatcher|BritishWatcher]] ([[User talk:BritishWatcher|talk]]) 20:21, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

: There is a blatant attempt to bias this article in favour of the Palestinian POV and it is totally unacceptable. The introduction is balanced at present by saying Jerusalem is the capital of Israel though not internationally recognised as such. That balanced, giving both sides views and providing the facts. Attempts to try and add the fact there is a palestinian claim to the first sentence is just unreasonable, as has been debated extensively above. There is NO consensus for certain changes being proposed, and there is no reasonable case for an entire POV section tag when there is already inline neutrality tag for the primary issue people seem concerned about.

::&quot;''There is a blatant attempt to bias this article in favour of the Palestinian POV and it is totally unacceptable''&quot;..no, sorry, but that simply isn't true as far as I can tell. The evidence suggests to me that it's the other way around. Where is the Palestinian POV in the introduction ? The international community isn't Palestinian. The Palestinian POV doesn't appear until the 5th paragraph of the lead despite the Palestinians being the other party to the dispute with an equal claim to the city as their capital as far as RS are concerned. Frankly I think it's lucky the Palestinian POV is mentioned at all given that we have so many contributors here whose ability to deal with this issue neutrally is apparently damaged beyond repair or who are insufficiently informed about the issues and their policy obligations. If editors followed the advice at [[Wikipedia:ARBPIA#Editors_counseled]] this would have been sorted out years ago. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Sean.hoyland|&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;Sean.hoyland&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - '''[[User talk:Sean.hoyland|talk]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 08:48, 17 October 2012 (UTC)
::: Im saying there is clearly an attempt here to insert Palestinian POV, not that the current article is Palestinian POV. Whilst i would prefer to see some changes, i believe the current wording is balanced, making clear Israel is the capital of Jerusalem, but this is not recognised by the international community. That is perfectly balanced and reasonable.  What is not reasonable and what is blatant POV pushing is the attempts to try and make out like a claim to the city is somehow worthy of being in the same sentence as the fact it is the capital of ISrael. The proposal above is the latest flawed proposal, yet there has been even worse ones in recent months too. It is simply not appropriate for the first sentence to be vandalised with POV. There are many disputed states and territorial claims, the first sentences do not tend to put a claim in line with the factual realities on the ground. For example.. [[Northern Ireland]] says &quot;Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province or region of the UK, amongst other term.&quot;. It does not say, Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom,  and claimed by Irish republicans who want a united Ireland.&quot;  To do so would give undue weight. Same applies in this case, the palestinian claim is clearly explained in the introduction already.. it does not need to be pushed into the first or second sentence, which will give undue weight.

Please do not use an entire section POV tag for the introduction. Use inline tagging for the specific claims people have concerns about, the vast majority of the facts and information in the introduction is accurate so people should not be confused about how accurate any of it is.

::: The palestinian claim to Jerusalem is already mentioned in the introduction. The question is here about preventing [{WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] by biasing the introductions first sentence with Palestinian POV. A claim to want to control the city at some point in the future is very very different to the fact it is the capital of Israel and acts as such. We ensure balance by including very clearly after that this is not recognised by the international community (which includes the palestinian view). The claim by palestinians to jerusalem is better handled in the other parts of the introduction as at present. You will find many articles saying that Israels capital is Jerusalem but that this isnt recognised by the international community/, yet do not go on to say in the same sentence or paragraph about palestinians wanting it as their future capital.

There's also no reason to introduce &quot;according to the Israeli government&quot; when we have RS that state it as plain fact.

The palestinian viewpoint appears in the first sentence already as they do also not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Their claim to the city cannot be given equal weight by being placed in the first sentence when there is clearly a massive difference between one entity claiming the capital for a future state, compared to one serving as the capital of a state, despite lacking recognition. There has been no consensus on previous attempts to bias this introduction by giving undue weight to the palestinian claim. I never said that the palestinian claim is never mentioned in article on this matter, i said there are many that do not because the primary two factors are &quot;Jerusalem is Israels capital&quot; and &quot;the international community do not recognise this&quot;. The palestinian claim is handled in the introduction still, it is not as though there is no mention of it, but the view has rightly been it does not warrant inclusion in the first sentence.

I fail to see why in line tagging does not solve the issue people claim to be unhappy about. People are saying they just want a change to the first sentence.. the first sentence is tagged with the neutrality. How does that not cover the issue?

== WP:NPOV - status of Jerusalem ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Npov Wikipedia:Neutral point of view:]

*&quot;Neutral point of view&quot; is one of Wikipedia's three core content policies.
*NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects. This policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it.
*Editing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources.
&lt;br&gt;

Partial explanation of editing from a neutral point of view:
* &quot;Avoid stating opinions as facts.&quot;
* &quot;Avoid stating seriously contested assertions as facts.&quot;
* &quot;Indicate the relative prominence of opposing views.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;

I'd say that:
* The status of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is not universally accepted, which is related to the non-acceptance of Jerusalem as Israeli territory.
* Reliable sources state that that status is not universally accepted and explain why.
* It's probable that the non-acceptance is the majority view.
* Some editors here, in some cases for years, have, contrary to the neutrality rule, been arguing that one point of view, the Israeli one, is a fact rather than a point of view.
* The job of editors is to fairly represent what the reliable sources say, not to argue that one point of view is correct by advancing arguments based on dictionary definitions or carrying out votes on who thinks that Jerusalem ''is'' the capital of Israel etc.
* Not only does the first sentence of the Lead breach the neutrality rule, it doesn't even properly summarise the body of the article.
* It has already been explained to the editors breaching the neutrality rule that they are breaching it (in some cases repeatedly over a period of years).
* The editors who have been breaching the neutrality rule will probably go on quite happily breaching it.
&lt;br&gt;

Therefore, I think that it is time to start reporting editors to AE for failure to abide by one of the fundamental principles of Wikipedia.   &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Perpetua, serif; font-size:120%&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‚Üê&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:ZScarpia | ZScarpia]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 18:20, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

:Do you think the AE process is capable of dealing with issues like this ? I'm not sure. I've filed a couple of AE cases specifically to test the process without success, in the sense that I didn't learn much from the results. [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive114#DionysosElysees]] was to test whether a violation of a guideline, [[WP:POINT]], presented in the context of the active arbitration remedies statement &quot;''After being warned, any editor who repeatedly or seriously fails to adhere to the purpose of Wikipedia, any expected standards of behavior, or any normal editorial process may be blocked up to one year, topic-banned, further revert-restricted, or otherwise restricted from editing.''&quot; would result in sanctions. The editor was blocked for sockpuppetry before I could find out. The other test was [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement/Archive87#Uruandimi]] to address &quot;non-stop soapboxing and refusal to get the point on the talk page.&quot; The test did show, in my view, that AE is not well equipped to deal with situations that involve reading a substantial amount of evidence and making the effort to understand it in context. The editor stopped editing, so again, no result. I would have liked to have filed a lot more test cases to address specific issues but it's time consuming. Soapboxing and original research on talk pages in the topic area is an important one for me. I think there should be a very high cost to editors for doing that. At the moment the cost is paid by everyone else having to wade through it/address it. That is just wrong. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Sean.hoyland|&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;Sean.hoyland&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - '''[[User talk:Sean.hoyland|talk]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 19:26, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

::[EC] I think that it's clear that the current wording is not neutral and that it results from long-term point-of-view pushing, point-of-view pushing which it would be fairly easy to demonstrate that it is such. What the latter takes is showing how editors have insisted on presenting something that is not an established fact, that is, in Wikipedia terms, an opinion, something reliable sources don't agree on, as a fact. First you establish that there is disagreement about the status of Jerusalem, then you list the reasons that the various point-of-view pushers have given for why the Israeli point of view is the &quot;correct&quot; one. I think that could be achieved simply and clearly.  As far as I can see, there are two, complementary, approaches that could be used to get out of the current situation: to have problem editors removed and, if necessary, to ask for adjudication. To simplify things at AE, I would suggest taking problem editors there individually, one at a time, rather than making a request against a group.   &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Perpetua, serif; font-size:120%&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‚Üê&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:ZScarpia | ZScarpia]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 20:56, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

:::ZScarpia, in all fairness (and, as you know, I support removing the word &quot;capital&quot; from the lead), you are misrepresenting the argument of the pro-capitalists. They contend that calling Jerusalem the capital ''is'' the neutral point of view - that, in the ordinary, everyday use of the word, Jerusalem is the capital. Moreover, they argue that removal of the word capital would be a capitulation to political opponents of Israel, thus rendering the lead non-neutral. So the argument is not between neutral and non-neutral positions but over what is neutral.

:::While I disagree with the pro-capitalists' position, I respect that they are arguing for what they see as neutrality, in an arena where neutrality is, I believe, a pipe dream. I also believe that with a little flexibility on both sides, the issue could be resolved.

::::Three questions: have opinions been stated as facts; have seriously contested assertions been stated as facts; has the relative prominence of opposing views been indicated? If the answer to any of those is No, then the article is not neutral. I think that the answer in each case is No and that the reason is that a number of editors have been pushing the Israeli view for a very long time. Imagine if the article was to state that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel but that Israel disagrees! Point of view pushing happens when editors are so wedded to a particular view that they cannot admit that it is only a view and that is what has happened here. The status of Jerusalem is disputed. It does not matter if some editors feel that their own point of view is a neutral one; if they fail to present their point of view as a point of view, they are point-of-view pushing. The wording of the first sentence has been argued over for years. We came close to a resolution a year or so ago, but it was blocked by someone with more hardline views.

In this sense,  that East Jerusalem  legally does not form part of the capital of Israel, since you cannot place your capital in land not belonging in international law to the state. The conceptual confusion is elementary. I understand why several editors in good faith find objections to the use of capital suspicious (the anti-Israel/antisemitic perspective used to interpret almost any attitude not consonant with Israel's self image) and counter-factual. I understand why many editors in good faith find the use of capital to denote an area that is belligerently occupied and not a legally constituted part of the state of Israel, dubious, a form of preemptive ideological annexation to tilt world opinion into accepting the status quo as in fact legal. The NPOV crisis lies precisely here, in the refusal to allow that, given the denotative ambiguity of 'Jerusalem' (in Israeli rhetoric 'unified': in international law 'divided') any sentence on the status of Jerusalem must be finessed in order to (a) provide a nuance which copes with this ambiguity or(b) eliminate the word 'capital'. The division is between those who face the problem of denotative ambiguity, and those who refuse to (often on what they regard  as commonsense lexical grounds (that ignore the ambiguities).[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 13:00, 29 October 2012 (UTC)

:::Of course, the individual views of editors about the status of Jerusalem are irrelevant. What matters is that the status of Jerusalem is disputed and therefore any statements about it should be presented as points of view. However, in relation to the status of Jerusalem, there are undisputed facts, such as that Jerusalem is the Israeli seat of government, that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel in Israeli law or that Jerusalem is the declared capital of Israel. I doubt that anyone has a problem with those as statements of fact. Something that is disputed, though, is what the article states, that Jerusalem ''is'' the capital of Israel. The view of what we term for convenience the international community is that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel. Until agreement is reached, Jerusalem is not part of the sovereign territory of any country and that no country can unilaterally, as Israel claims to have done, change its status.   &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Perpetua, serif; font-size:120%&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‚Üê&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:ZScarpia | ZScarpia]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 13:33, 29 October 2012 (UTC)


So what people are proposing is not just to alter the introduction of this article to give undue weight to the Palestinian point of view, but a fundamental change to the entire way the article on Jerusalem is handled and indeed potentially dozens, or hundreds of other articles on wikipedia. This is an absolutely massive and fundamental change from many years of wikipedia handling this situation a certain way... yet the small minority of editors on this page demanding change cannot even get a majority to support a alteration to the introduction of this article? Incredible. The introduction IS balanced and i take offence at suggestions those of us who oppose alterations are some how supporting a biased article. '''Jerusalem is the capital of Israel though not internationally recognised as such.''' That is a balanced statement of fact that is fully in line with wikipedia policies. If such a fundamental change is to take place it will need a major discussion involving editors from different pages and wikiprojects. This single articles talk page would not be appropriate for what some people seek to impose. [[User:BritishWatcher|BritishWatcher]] ([[User talk:BritishWatcher|talk]]) 18:31, 30 October 2012 (UTC)
:Have you considered that you might be wrong ? Everyone should do that. Can you prove that you are right, that the statement &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel&quot; is fully compliant with policy using sources that discuss Jerusalem ? That's the problem I have with the statement, a statement that is certainly consistent with lots of sources. I don't think I would be able to prove that it is an undisputed fact based on a large sample of sources that discuss Jerusalem. So for me at least, there is something fundamentally wrong, and that is enough for me to think that there must be better ways out there. It has nothing to do with the numbers of editors and their views, it's about the sources and policy. I think Nish summed up the problem quite nicely. Actually I think what is required to solve this is probably very little. I think that is clear when you look at ZScarpia's statement above - &quot;in relation to the status of Jerusalem, there are undisputed facts, such as that Jerusalem is the Israeli seat of government, that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel in Israeli law or that Jerusalem is the declared capital of Israel.&quot; Those are undisputed facts that could be stated in the encyclopedia's voice in full compliance with policy. But people are so tied to stating as a fact that 'Jerusalem is the capital of Israel' for reasons I don't really understand, no matter what, no matter how disputed it is, no matter that much of this capital of Israel is across the green line, no matter that it's the most contentious city in the world and the most contentious issue in a decades long conflict that has cost thousands of lives. People just need to go back to the sources, and if it can't be done here, it needs to be done somewhere else, in arbitration for example because this issue is clearly not going to go away. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Sean.hoyland|&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;Sean.hoyland&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - '''[[User talk:Sean.hoyland|talk]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 21:15, 30 October 2012 (UTC)

:Regarding [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus consensus], a few points to bear in mind:
::* &quot;Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy.&quot;
::* &quot;The quality of an argument is more important than whether it represents a minority or a majority view.&quot;
::* &quot;Many of these [consensus-building] discussions will involve polls of one sort or another; but as consensus is determined by the quality of arguments (not by a simple counted majority), polls should be regarded as structured discussions rather than voting. Responses indicating individual explanations of positions using Wikipedia policies and guidelines are given the highest weight.&quot;
::* &quot;In some cases, disputes are personal or ideological rather than mere disagreements about content, and these may require the intervention of administrators or the community as a whole. Sysops will not rule on content, but may intervene to enforce policy (such as WP:BLP) or to impose sanctions on editors who are disrupting the consensus process inappropriately.&quot;
::* &quot;'''Tendentious editing:''' The continuous, aggressive pursuit of an editorial goal is considered disruptive, and should be avoided. Editors should listen, respond, and cooperate to build a better article. Editors who refuse to allow any consensus except the one they insist on, and who filibuster indefinitely to attain that goal, risk damaging the consensus process.&quot;

Jerusalem is the state of Israel's capital. Nobody has yet provided evidence of how a country requires international approval for its capital city, or that a capital is only somewhere that foreign countries have their embassies. You are being selective by simply focusing on &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel&quot;, the introduction clearly states it is the capital of Israel but not internationally recognised as such. That is fact and it is balanced. It is the small number of editors on here that are demanding radical changes to this article and indeed dozens of other articles, who are making a big fuss when they cannot even get majority support for a change to this introduction. How long has this article said that Israel is the capital of Israel in the way you dislike? And why all of a sudden has this become such a problem it must be changed, when there has been numerous debates on this matter in the past? Just because some editors do not like the current wording, is no reason to justify radical changes that remove facts simply to bias the article in favour of palestinian POV.

:(ec) As far as Wikipedia is concerned, a fact is something which is not disputed. The status of Jerusalem is disputed, as stated in sources which have been provided. Therefore, as far as the rules are concerned, whether or not Jerusalem is the capital of Israel should be presented as a point of view. You can say, the Israeli position is that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel (that is a factual statement about a point of view which nobody will argue with), but you cannot state, as a fact, that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Everything you say is either erroneous or irrelevant.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Perpetua, serif; font-size:120%&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‚Üê&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:ZScarpia | ZScarpia]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 23:40, 30 October 2012 (UTC)

&quot;&quot;Avoid stating seriously contested assertions &quot; - It is not an assertion.. it is a fact, the state of Israels capital city is Jerusalem. It is also fact that this is not recognised by the international community, so the two points are combined into a very clear first sentence that was a reasonable middle ground. Some would rather that second bit had no place in the opening sentence at all, but it is the moderate centre ground position for the current wording.  Some do not respect the fact [[Belfast]] is the capital of [[Northern Ireland]] which is a country of the [[United Kingdom]]. So  should we go and make lots of changes to those? Belfast is the claimed capital of Northern Ireland, which is claimed to be one of the countries of the United Kingdom, but this is not recognised by everyone with some believing it is a city in one of the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland?  Where will it all end? We should not give [[WP:UNDUE|Undue Weight]] to Palestinian POV by in anyway suggesting it is in a similar situation in terms of being Palestines capital compared it being the State of Israels. The key issue is the fact it lacks international recognition, something the introductions first sentence makes very clear. It is not the fact that Palestinians claim it as a capital for their future state. [[User:BritishWatcher|BritishWatcher]] ([[User talk:BritishWatcher|talk]]) 23:33, 30 October 2012 (UTC)

:(ec) As far as &quot;the international community&quot; is concerned, Jerusalem is neither sovereign Israeli territory nor the capital of Israel.

ZScarpia,Sean.hoyland I have personally nothing against inclusion of third party in any dispute resolution in accordance with Wikipedia rules. 
ZScarpia What is in your opinion the capital of Israel? or is there some source which states that anyone from outside can determine the capital of another state? Just to repeat we already pointed out that Jerusalem is not recognized by &quot;international community&quot; as the capital of Israel(this is my answer to Sean question), so the only question which remains are:

1) If there is possibility (under international law or international agreements ) that some institution, state or entity  from outside could determine legally the capital of another state
 
2) Did it happen in the case of Israel and what was determined as Israeli capital?
[[User:Tritomex|Tritomex]] ([[User talk:Tritomex|talk]]) 10:46, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

:Personally, I have no view on what the capital of Israel is, not that my own view, or the view of any other editor, on the matter has any relevance to Wikipedia. What I think the sources show is that the capital of Israel is disputed. One viewpoint is that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Another viewpoint is that it isn't. Some sources used to state that Tel Aviv was the capital of Israel; I don't know if more recent ones still do.
:We're not in the business of arguing the rights or wrongs of the various positions, just trying to neutrally present them, so, unless you can point to a binding decision made somewhere on Wikipedia that, in the matter of capitals, one side's viewpoint gets to predominate, then your question about institutions has little relevance. Even if, say, there was an Institute For Specifying Capitals Under International Law, if Israel still insisted that Jerualem was its capital, we would still probably end up having to write something to the effect that Israel says that Jerusalem is it's capital, but the IFSCUIL has determined that, under international law, it isn't. Note that the various UN resolutions don't state what IS the capital of Israel, they stated that, without agreement from other parties, Israel cannot change the status of Jerusalem, including making it its capital, which is different.  If arguments based on your questions were used to contend that, despite the international community's view, Jerusalem is, undisputably, the capital of Israel, that would be, in effect, trying to circumvent the neutrality rules using arguments not based in policy, that is, point-of-view pushing.

:: &quot;Would it be neutral to write: Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, though the international community disputes that?&quot; - Yes it would be neutral and balanced.. and that is exactly what the introduction already says. We express the facts... It is Israel's capital de jure and defacto, provide us with evidence that says a country cannot determine its own capital? But at the same time we explain very clearly in the very first sentence that this is not recognised by the international community. That is extremely balanced! Can i suggest that you guys demanding radical changes for this article make clear proposals on what wording you want in the first sentence and also what other changes you want for the article. For example what will be done to the info template if you guys had your way? Would we remove the Israeli city flag and emblem if we are wanting this article to pretend this isnt an israeli city?

Above you said maybe i was exaggerating about how radical the changes to this page would be if you guys got your way.. but that seems to be the position you are taking. Do you accept that Jerusalem is a city in Israel? No.. so do we need to remove the Israeli city's flag and emblem from the infobox template or put silly disclaimers?  This article would need completely changing, far more than just adding a single word or two to the first sentence.  This is why we need to know details of what exactly you are proposing. Are you and all the others happy with the neutrality tag being removed and this debate resolved if we simply add the word is the &quot;declared capital of Israel&quot; instead of just capital? Im prepared to debate that and im not entirely against such a change (as putting declared and linking to the Israeli law could make sense) though i do not think such wording is required. But some of the recent proposals have been totally unacceptable. And yes ive read some of the past debates on this matter.

I think we have more or less everyone here on the record with the arguments that they've advanced. My suggestion is to proceed, one question I have is if we decide to proceed to mediation, can some editors prevent the mediation from going ahead by not consenting, or prevent the mediation from succeeding by claiming to &quot;not support&quot; the mediated edit after the fact?

That Jerusalem &quot;is the capital&quot; of Israel IS disputed. As is well established, there is a raft of UN resolutions which reject Israel's moves to change the status of Jerusalem. They state that Israel's laws on the matter are null and void. Therefore, the more neutral sources are careful to explain that, though Israel's position is that Jerusalem is its capital, the international community rejects that. As has been pointed out, the BBC issued an apology and made a correction when one of its sports reporters wrote an article in which it was stated that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. Whereas it is disputed that Jerusalem IS Israel's capital, it is not disputed (as far as I know) that Jerusalem functions as/serves as/is de facto Israel's capital. If that is not disputed, then it is permissible to state that as a fact, rather than a point of view, in Wikipedia.

::: As you pointed out in your response, it contains two &quot;factual statements&quot;, the first being Israel considers it its capital, the second the international community disputes this. I agree it wouldnt need the second statement, but it is a statement of fact if the UK considers London its capital city. Perhaps it would start the United Kingdom and the international community consider London the capital of the UK? Still waiting for any evidence that says a country cannot determine its own capital. Also if we did put &quot;considers&quot; in the first sentence, do we go and add that word everywhere.. Israel considers this the flag of the city of Jerusalem, Israel considers this the emblem of the city. Israel considers this person to be the mayor of the city, Israel considers this to be the city government..

Tariq, congratulations for pointing out a fundamental flaw in the anti-capital argument. It is a flaw that illustrates the level of prevarication and subterfuge of both sides of this argument.

It is absurd to say that using a dictionary definition to justify a lead is original research. It isn't (unless the editor is also the author of the dictionary). On the other hand, it is certainly a very flimsy justification. Dictionaries are not references that give in-depth analyses of all the linguistic, political, and legal ramifications of a word. The laconic dictionary definition of &quot;capital&quot; - &quot;seat of government&quot; - doesn't come near to defining all the constituents that make up a capital.

The anti-capitalists certainly know this. The trouble is that there is no clear policy against flimsiness, only against OR. So they have, completely artificially, attached the OR standard to the dictionary argument. For most of those arguing on this page (I hesitate to say all), this appeal to an irrelevant standard is simply a way of promoting their own political agendas.

The pro-capitalists are no better. They are perfectly aware that the dictionary definition does not capture the complexity of the term capital. Otherwise, why are they so adamantly against using what the dictionary considers synonymous - &quot;seat of government&quot;? The reason is clear: they believe that if they say &quot;capital&quot; loud enough and long enough, it will somehow become true.

No, it is clear that both sides are using specious arguments of policy to grind their own political axes. The complete lack of dedication to the principles of neutrality, as Wikipedia dreams of it, is glaring throughout this discussion.

If the sides could, for a moment, put aside their political zeal for a moment, the issue, I believe, could be easily resolved. But it seems that is asking too much of mere mortals. --[[User:Ravpapa|Ravpapa]] ([[User talk:Ravpapa|talk]]) 11:16, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

:I'd like to request that you not repeat the characterizations and suggestions you made in your last two paragraphs. There are no doubt, I'm sure, people who hold their respective positions because of political zeal, but there are no doubt people who hold their positions because, after reading the opinions presented by those who disagree with them, still believe they're correct.
:Your own description of the two sides seems to more clearly get at the problem here. There is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a capital) that makes recognition a prerequisite for a city being a capital, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Likewise, there is nothing in the dictionary (or in the general definition of a country) that makes recognition a prequisite for a region being a country, but there's also nothing in the dictionary saying it isn't. Yet, in the latter case, I'm sure most here would agree that without recognition, a country is nothing, and really is not a country at all. Does the same apply to capitals? Well, we have limited situations in which this is even a question, and unfortunately the primary situation is this one, coming in the context of a bitter, and ultimately stupid, conflict. I personally think the same standard does not apply to capitals, as there is something physical (e.g. government institutions, place of residence of the head of state) to denote the capital. But if one operates under the belief that a state (and we all agree Israel is one, right?) can be without a capital, then maybe one can believe that recognition is a pre-requisite for capital status. Okay. I don't believe that, but go ahead. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;tariq&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;abjotu&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 12:42, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

:::What's with this brinksmanship? Mediation is not an indictment against editors. There are no sanctions that can come out of mediation. The proceedings of the mediation are privileged, and so they can't be used against you in the future. So why is this a big deal? Why are people insisting that there be some agreement that mediation goes forward? Why are people using &quot;mediation&quot; as some sort of threat and treating it as one? I don't think this issue has ever been to mediation before, so putting it to ArbCom -- which generally doesn't deal with content disputes -- will be seen as premature, while lesser forms of dispute resolution have us spinning in circles. So clearly MedCom is the answer. Do you need help creating the mediation request? If not, just do it already. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;tariq&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;abjotu&lt;/font&gt;]]''' 12:18, 9 November 2012 (UTC)
:::: Well i would be ok with some form of mediation but i am unsure if it will resolve anything. This has been debated extensively in the past couple of months, attempts to change a consensus that has existed for a very long time. And radical and totally unacceptable proposals that would totally change this article were rejected. A vote took place above some weeks ago showing majority support for the status quo. A small number of editors are demanding change after years of this article addressing the issue a certain way, trouble is they refuse to even put a specific proposal for us to debate. They insist on having in line tagging of a disputed sentence and a disputed introduction template which tarnishes the entire introduction just based on the first sentence which is already tagged anyway. I propose the editors above arguing for change, create a new section with a very specific proposal that we can all specifically discuss and debate. All the mediation is going to do is try to bring us together to discuss the situation, frankly we could do that without wasting other peoples time too.. if those demanding change actually said exactly what they want.

:::::I can only put it in negative terms:  Isn't it fairly obvious that what they want is some way, any way, ''not'' to say that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel?  Or, at the very least, to qualify or dilute the direct statement more than it currently is by its juxtaposition of the &quot;not internationally recognized&quot; phrase.  To this end they bring in one extraneous argument after another, and try to redefine the meanings of words. That indulges in OR and POV advocacy; referencing the dictionary meaning does not.  The torrent of words here, year after year, does not change the simple reality.  I think we would be better served by a reminder of the [[duck test]] criteria, rather than by recourse to arbitration or mediation, and wouldn't be wasting other people's time (not to mention the time of people here).

::::::You keep talking about dictionary meanings as though that were the only thing that mattered. How about the definition of ''occupied territory''? How is that less relevant to Jerusalem's status than the proclamation, rejected by every other competent party, by one state? &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:Nableezy|&lt;font color=&quot;#C11B17&quot;&gt;nableezy&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - 17:10, 9 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
:::::::Good examples of extraneous [[red herring]]s.  As far as I can tell, the definition of a capital (i.e., what makes a capital a capital) does not depend on either criterion (occupied/non-occupied status, universal approval). I didn't know that editors were allowed to change the meanings of words as they please. [[User:Hertz1888|Hertz1888]] ([[User talk:Hertz1888|talk]]) 21:49, 9 November 2012 (UTC)
::::::::No, that isnt extraneous and isnt a red herring. You, and a number of other editors who are adamant about the word ''capital'' being used on the basis of the definition of the word, have quite the history of ignoring other words that have plain meanings. You support what you like, and oppose what you dont. It has exactly squat to do with what the dictionary says. You ignore things that dont toe the Israeli party line, and support to the hilt what does. Thats fine, lots of people are like that. But at least drop the act here that this isnt what it so clearly is. &lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px solid;padding:1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:Nableezy|&lt;font color=&quot;#C11B17&quot;&gt;nableezy&lt;/font&gt;]]''' - 01:21, 10 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
::::::Editors accepting sources that present the information in a certain way, as a statement of fact, and ignoring sources that do not present this information as a statement of fact is wrong.

:::::::Interesting. So if, for example, I were to provide sources that do not present as fact that the [[State of Palestine]] is a state, or that actually say it is not a fact, you'd support changing the lead of that article? Do let me know, maybe we'll do a test case over there. [[User:No More Mr Nice Guy|No More Mr Nice Guy]] ([[User talk:No More Mr Nice Guy|talk]]) 20:35, 9 November 2012 (UTC)
:::::::: I don't see a problem with saying Palestine is a &quot;declared&quot; state in that lead, as it isn't even nearly universally recognized. Concerning mediation, I certainly didn't earlier intend to issue any threats by suggesting mediation as a possible way forward and it's a bit tragic if editors got that impression. However, speaking for my behalf I have very limited experience from mediation, I recall that the first hurdle is to get all involved editors to agree to it which is why I asked. --[[User:Dailycare|Dailycare]] ([[User talk:Dailycare|talk]]) 22:21, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

::::::::::: Due weight is important yes, and the current introduction has the right approach. The proposed changes some are demanding would give undue weight to palestinian POV and bias this article. Jerusalem is israel's capital, but the international community does not recognise this. That is stated extremely clearly in the first sentence of the article. For us to pretend that the reality on the ground is not the case, there must be clear evidence that a &quot;capital&quot; is only a &quot;capital&quot; when it has international recognition. No such evidence has been produced. It would be undue weight to treat a palestinian claim to the city as their future capital, in exactly the same way as we treat the fact this is Israel's capital. Quite clearly at present it serves as the capital of the state of Israel, de jure and de facto. No sovereign state of Palestine in control of the territory exists.

I believe that there is a spelling error in Section 15 'Notable residents'. 'Mediaeval' should be spelled 'Medieval'.[[Special:Contributions/216.165.253.27|216.165.253.27]]
