      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16285">A '''pilgrimage''' is a [[Travel|journey]] or search of  [[moral]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] significance. Typically, it is a journey to a [[shrine]] or other location of importance to a person's [[belief]]s and [[faith]], although sometimes it can be a metaphorical journey in to someone's own beliefs. Many religions attach spiritual importance to particular places: the place of birth or death of founders or saints, or to the place of their &quot;calling&quot; or spiritual awakening, or of their connection (visual or verbal) with the divine, or to locations where miracles were performed or witnessed, or locations where a deity is said to live or be &quot;housed,&quot; or any site that is seen to have special spiritual powers. Such sites may be commemorated with shrines or temples that devotees are encouraged to visit for their own spiritual benefit: to be healed or have questions answered or to achieve some other spiritual benefit.  A person who makes such a journey is called a [[pilgrim]]. As a common human experience, pilgrimage has been proposed as a Jungian archetype by [[Wallace Clift]] and [[Jean Dalby Clift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clift|first1=Jean Dalby|last2=Clift|first2=Wallace|year=1996|title=The Archetype of Pilgrimage: Outer Action With Inner Meaning|publisher=The Paulist Press|isbn=0-8091-3599-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holy Land]] acts as a focal point for the pilgrimages of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. According to a [[Stockholm University]] study in 2011, these [[pilgrim|pilgrims]] visit the [[Holy Land]] to touch and see physical manifestations of their [[faith]], confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.metti-bronner.com/Jerusalem.pdf |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date= 2011-06-01|accessdate=01July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Main|Bahá'í pilgrimage}}
[[Bahá'u'lláh]] decreed pilgrimage to two places in the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]: the [[Bahá'í pilgrimage#House of Bahá'u'lláh, Baghdad|House of Bahá'u'lláh]] in [[Baghdad, Iraq]], and the House of the [[Báb]] in [[Shiraz, Iran]]. Later, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] designated the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] at Bahji, Israel as a site of pilgrimage.&lt;ref name=&quot;oneworld&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Pilgrimage |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'í pilgrimage consists of visiting the holy places in [[Haifa]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and [[Mansion of Bahjí|Bahjí]] at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in northwest Israel, and Bahá'ís can apply to join an organized nine-day pilgrimage where they are taken to visit the various holy sites, or attend a shorter three-day pilgrimage.&lt;ref name=&quot;oneworld&quot;/&gt;

==Buddhism==

[[File:Pilgrimage to Lhasa.jpg|thumb|283px|[[Tibet]]ans on a pilgrimage to [[Lhasa]], doing full-body [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostrations]], often for the entire length of the journey.]]
There are four places that Buddhists make pilgrimage to:

==Christianity==

{{Main|Christian pilgrimage}}
Christian pilgrimage was first made to sites connected with the birth, life, crucifixion and resurrection of [[Jesus]]. Surviving descriptions of Christian pilgrimages to the [[Holy Land]] date from the 4th century, when pilgrimage was encouraged by church fathers like [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]] and established by [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], the mother of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine the Great]]. Pilgrimages also began to be made to [[Rome]] and other sites associated with the [[Apostle (Christian)#The Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], [[saint]]s and [[Christian martyrs]], as well as to places where there have been [[Marian apparitions|apparition]]s of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]].  A popular pilgrimage site in the past and today is [[Santiago de Compostela]], in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain, in reference to the Apostle St. James, The Great. Chaucer's [[The Canterbury Tales]] recounts the tales told by pilgrims on their way to Canterbury and the shrine of [[Saint Thomas Becket]].

According to Karel Werner's ''Popular Dictionary of Hinduism'', &quot;[m]ost [[Hinduism|Hindu]] places of pilgrimage are associated with legendary events from the lives of various gods.... Almost any place can become a focus for pilgrimage, but in most cases they are sacred cities, rivers, lakes, and mountains.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Karel (1994). ''A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism''. Curzon Press. ISBN 0-7007-1049-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus are encouraged to undertake pilgrimages during their lifetime, though this practice is not considered absolutely mandatory. Most Hindus visit sites within their region or locale. 

'''Kumbh Mela:''' [[Kumbh Mela]] is the largest pilgrimage recorded in history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/84149 Digitaljournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/15/AR2007011500041.html Washingtonpost.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6226895.stm News.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Kumbh Mela is also credited with the largest gathering of humans in the entire world. The location is rotated among [[Allahabad]], [[Haridwar]], [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. 

'''Char Dham (Famous Four Pilgrimage sites):''' The four holy sites [[Puri]], [[Rameswaram]], [[Dwarka]], and [[Badrinath]] (or alternatively the [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]]) compose the ''[[Char Dham]]'' (''four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. 

'''Old Holy cities as per Puranic Texts:''' [[Varanasi]] formerly known as Kashi, [[Allahabad]] formerly known as Prayag, [[Haridwar]]-[[Rishikesh]], [[Mathura]]-[[Vrindavan]], and [[Ayodhya]]. 

'''Major Temple cities:''' [[Puri]], which hosts a major [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[Jagannath]] temple and [[Rath Yatra]] celebration; [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]], home to the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple; Three comparatively recent temples of fame and huge pilgrimage are  [[Shirdi]], home to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]], [[Tirumala - Tirupati]], home to the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]; and [[Sabarimala]],where [[Swami Ayyappan]] is worshipped. 

'''Shakti Peethas:''' Another important set of pilgrimages are the ''[[Shakti Peethas]]'', where [[Shakti|the Mother Goddess]] is worshipped, the two principal ones being ''[[Kalighat]]'' and ''[[Kamakhya]]''.

==Islam==
{{Main|Hajj}}
{{See also|Holiest sites in Islam}}
[[Image:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|left|thumb|[[Muslim]] Pilgrims circumambulating the [[Kaaba]] during the [[Hajj]]]]
[[File:Supplicating Pilgrim at Masjid Al Haram. Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Supplicating Pilgrim at [[Masjid Al-Haram]], Mecca, Saudi Arabia]]

The pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (the ''[[Hajj]]'') is one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. It should be attempted at least once in the lifetime of all able-bodied [[Muslims]] who can afford to do so. It is the most important of all Muslim pilgrimages, and is the largest pilgrimage for Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atlas of Holy Places &amp; Sacred Sites|author=Colin Wilson|isbn=978-0-7894-1051-1|publisher=DK Adult|year=1996|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important place for Muslims is the city of [[Medina]], the second holiest place in [[Islam]], in [[Saudi Arabia]], where [[Muhammad]] rests in ''[[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]]'' (the Mosque of the Prophet).

The ''[[ihram]]'' (white robes of pilgrimage) is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in the eyes of [[God in Islam|Allah]]: that there is no difference between a prince and a pauper. ''Ihram'' is also symbolic for holy virtue and pardon from all past sins.

While wearing the ''ihram'' in Mecca, a pilgrim may not shave, clip their nails, wear perfume, swear or quarrel, hunt, kill any creature, uproot or damage plants, cover the head for men or the face and hands for women, marry, wear shoes over the ankles, perform any dishonest acts or carry weapons. If they do any of these their pilgrimage is invalid .

==Judaism==
[[File:Jews place of wailing, 1860.jpg|thumb|283px|The [[Wailing Wall]] is all that remains of the Western wall of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].]]
{{See also|Jerusalem in Judaism|Three Pilgrimage Festivals}}
The [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was the center of the Jewish religion until its [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction in 70 CE]], and all adult men who were able were required to visit and offer sacrifices (''[[korbanot]]''), particularly during [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] and [[Sukkot]].

Following the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and the onset of the [[diaspora]], the centrality of pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]] in Judaism was discontinued. In its place came prayers and rituals hoping for a return to [[Zion]] and the accompanying restoration of regular pilgrimages.

Until recent centuries, pilgrimage had been a fairly difficult and arduous adventure. But now, Jews from many countries make periodic pilgrimages to the holy sites of their religion.

The western retaining wall of the [[Temple Mount]], known as the [[Western Wall]] or Wailing Wall, remains in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]] and this has been the most sacred site for religious Jews. Pilgrimage to this area was off-limits from 1948 to 1967, when East Jerusalem was controlled by [[Jordan]].

There are numerous lesser Jewish pilgrimage sites, mainly tombs of ''[[tzadik]]im'', throughout the [[Land of Israel]] and all over the world, including: [[Hebron]]; [[Bethlehem]]; [[Mt. Meron]]; [[Netivot]]; [[Uman]], [[Ukraine]]; [[Silistra]], [[Bulgaria]]; [[Damanhur]], [[Egypt]]; and many others.&lt;ref&gt;See David M. Gitlitz and Linda Kay Davidson, ''Pilgrimage and the Jews'' (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2006) for history and data on several pilgrimages to both Ashkenazi and Sephardic holy sites.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meher Baba==
The main pilgrimage sites associated with the spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] are [[Meherabad]], India, where Baba completed the &quot;major portion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deshmukh, Indumati (1961). &quot;Address in Marathi.&quot; ''The Awakener'' '''7''' (3): 29.&lt;/ref&gt; of his work and where his tomb is now located, and [[Meherazad]], India, where Baba resided later in his life.

==Sikhism==
[[File:Sikh pilgrim at the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar, India.jpg|thumb|283px|A [[Sikh]] pilgrim at [[Harmandir Sahib|Harmandir Sahib (the Golden Temple)]] in [[Amritsar]]]]
The [[Sikh]] religion does not place great importance on pilgrimage.  [[Guru Nanak Dev]] was asked &quot;Should I go and bathe at pilgrimage places?&quot; and replied:
&quot;God's name is the real pilgrimage place which consists of contemplation of the word of God, and the cultivation of inner knowledge.&quot;

Eventually, however, [[Amritsar]] and [[Harmandir Sahib|Harmandir Saheb (the Golden Temple)]] became the centre of the Sikh faith, and if a Sikh goes on pilgrimage it is usually to this place considered the spiritual and cultural centre of Sikhs rather than a pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://re-xs.ucsm.ac.uk/re/pilgrimage/sikhism.htm Re-xs.ucsm.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroastrianism==
The Zoroastrians take pilgrimage trips in India to the eight [[Atash Behram]]s in India and one in [[Yazd]].
