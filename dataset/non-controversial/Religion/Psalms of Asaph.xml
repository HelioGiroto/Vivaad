      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10684">The '''Psalms of Asaph''' are the twelve psalms numbered 50 and 73-83 in the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] or [[Old Testament]]. When the psalms are labeled as the Psalms of Asaph scholars have discovered that that can mean a variety of things. Because of the attribution to Asaph it could mean that the psalms were a part of a collection from the Asaphites (a name commonly used to identify temple singers). Another possibility is that the psalms could have been performed in the style or tradition of the guild bearing Asaph's name. &lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=David Noel|title=The Anchor Bible Dictionary|year=June 1, 1992|publisher=Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Asaph himself is said to either be the author or the transcriber of these psalms for some say that he may not have said these psalms but rather that he transcribed the words of David. There is also a disconnect as to the exact origin of the association of Asaph with these psalms because some are labeled as &quot;of Asaph&quot; while others are &quot;for Asaph&quot; and another &quot;a testimony to Asaph.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Robert C.|title=Theodoret of Cyrus: Commentary on the Psalms|year=2000|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A specific time period is not known to be associated with these Psalms but most of the book of Psalms was written in the time of David and Solomon (c. 1010-9-30 B.C.). 

== Identity of Asaph ==
In the Old Testament there are three different men with the name of Asaph. The Asaph identified with these twelve Psalms is said to be the son of Berechiah which is said to be an ancestor of the Asaphites. The Asaphites are said to be one of the families or guilds of musicians in the Jerusalem temple. These pieces of information are clarified in the books of 1 and 2 Chronicles. In the Chronicles it is said that Asaph was a descendant of Gershom the son of Levi therefore he is identified as a member of the Levites. He is also known as one of the three Levites commissioned by David to be in charge of singing in the house of Yaweh.  In 1 Chronicles 6:39 David appoints a man named Heman as the main musician or singer and Asaph as Heman’s right hand assistant and the Merarites at his left hand. &lt;ref name=Harper/Achtemeier&gt;{{cite book|last=Achtemeier|first=Paul J.|title=Harper's Bible Dictionary|year=1985|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asaph is also accredited with performing at the dedication of Solomon’s temple in 2 Chronicles 5:12.&lt;ref name=Harper/Achtemeier /&gt; 
== Context and Meaning == 
The meaning behind the Psalms as a whole is not labeled specifically for they all have different meanings in and of each individual chapter. There is a re-occurrence throughout the twelve psalms of a theme of the judgment from God and how the people of the bible must follow the Law of God yet he bestows infinite amounts of mercy upon them. According to Hermann Gunkel there are many genres of Psalms including: Hymns, Communal Laments,  Individual Laments, Individual Song of Thanksgiving, Wisdom Poems, Pilgrimage Songs and Liturgies.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt;  Several in not all of the Psalms of Asaph are categorized as communal laments because they are concerned for the well being of a whole community of people. Communal laments encompass a description of some sort of severe destruction followed by a cry out to God for help and a reference to his great mercy of the past. The communal laments are different from the individual laments because of the use of “we” versus the use of “I.” The psalms are ridden with thanksgiving and praise for God as well. Many of these psalms forecast destruction or devastation in the future of their tribes. Matching those forecasts stride for stride however are predictions of God’s mercy and saving power for the people of this time period. &lt;ref name=HIll&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Robert C.|title=Theodoret of Cyrus: Commentary on the Psalms|year=2001|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Some of the Psalms of Asaph are not labeled as just from Asaph but as “for the leader.” Some interpret this to mean that they were written to be read by an oracle and proclaimed and front of a large audience, or simply that it was a cue to the lead singer or chief musician. 
Another characteristic to these psalms is the use of the word “selah” which has been interpreted many ways. One way to interpret it is as a direction for the cantor or musicaion and another is to see it as a signal for a pause. &lt;ref name=NAB&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American Bible|year=1987|publisher=Fireside Bible Publishers|location=Wichita, Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=HarperCollins&gt;{{cite book|last=Mays|first=James L.|title=HarperCollins Bible Commentary|year=2001|publisher=Harper One}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact definition or derivation is not known but it occurs 71 times in 39 Psalms. &lt;ref name=NAB&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American Bible|year=1987|publisher=Fireside Bible Publishers|location=Wichita, Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elohist psalms == 
This section of the book of Psalms is part of a section known as the Elohist psalms. Psalms 42-83 are referred to as Elohistic because the name &quot;Yaweh&quot; is avoided and the term &quot;Elohim&quot; is used instead.  The Elohistic psalms are divided into three subdivsions 42-49 are &quot;of the sons of Korah,&quot; 51-65, 68-71 are &quot;of David,&quot; and 50, 73-83 are &quot;of Asaph.&quot;&lt;ref name=Black&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Matthew|title=Peake's Commentary on the Bible|year=1964|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The Psalms of Asaph ==
==== Psalm 50 ====
This Psalm forecasts the judgment to come and the manifestation of God. It speaks of God asking to be acknowledged as judge and creator and promising to bestow mercy on those who turn to him. It ends with a threat followed by a promise.
==== Psalm 73 ====
Divine providence and the internal battle within one’s soul are the two main themes of this psalm. It speaks of the journey of self-realization about the evils around the world but also coming back and realizing the plan of God.&lt;ref name=BOP /&gt; 
==== Psalm 74 ====
The theme of this psalm revolves around the first verse “Why, God, have you cast us off forever?”&lt;ref name=NAB /&gt;  and forecasts destruction. It comes across as a cry out to God as to when salvation will come and save them from the depths of their despair. Amidst the cries of despair a voice of praise to God also comes through.
==== Psalm 75 ====
The laments of the people are voiced here and their promise to sing the praises of God at all times is established. This Psalm is labeled as a song or psalm to the leader&lt;ref name=NAB /&gt;, interpreted as the chief Musician&lt;ref name=BOP&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Psalms|year=1986|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, Inc.|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or leader of the community. &lt;ref name=Black&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Matthew|title=Peake's Commentary on the Bible|year=1962|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader ends the psalm with a statement about the wicked being humbled and the righteous being exalted. &lt;ref name=Elwell&gt;{{cite book|last=Elwell|first=Walter A.|title=Evangelical Commentary on the Bible|year=1996|publisher=Baker book House|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==== Psalm 76 ====
This psalm focuses on elaborating on the incredible saving power of God. It calls the people to worship and praise God in thanksgiving for his saving power. This Psalm is also recognized as for the leader. &lt;ref name=Black /&gt; 
==== Psalm 77 ====
This Psalm is a psalm of lament from a community of people crying out to God and asking him to not be silent in their time of need. The question “Will God let his created people be destroyed?” is posed.  It comes full circle with the end proclaiming the wonder of God as creator and reflecting on his care of Moses and Aaron.
==== Psalm 78 ====
This psalm urges people to follow the law and is a more historically themed psalm that is meant to show the people of the time the pattern of God’s saving mercy. It encourages the passing down from generation to generation the deeds of God. It reflects specifically on the time of Moses and the Israelites in the desert.
==== Psalm 79 ====
The focus of this psalm is the importance of prayer in the midst of calamities specifically the calamity of the reduction of Jerusalem to ashes by the Babylonian army in 587 B.C.&lt;ref name=NAB /&gt;  The lament of the community acknowledges their faults and beg for God’s mercy.
==== Psalm 80 ==== 
This psalm is sometimes referred to as a testimony to Asaph and is also another psalsm labeled as “for the leader.” It highlights the restoration of the nation through prayer and God’s mercy. It combines hope with a memory of great sorrow. The images of Israel as a vineyard and God as a shepherd are both utilized here.&lt;ref name=Elwell /&gt;  
==== Psalm 81 ====
This psalm emphasizes praising a God who saves and a national return to liturgical worship. The concept of choosing to act on the desires and wants of humans rather than walking with God and being in his favor is brought to light in this psalm. It also calls for repentance from the people to reorder God’s protection upon them. 
==== Psalm 82 ====
The stress of this psalm is placed on judgment both from human judges and from God and declares the strong bonds between moral and physical order. It comments on the act of God rebuking the kings and unjust pagan gods of Israel for not treating the poor with respect. This psalm ends with a prayer for justice.&lt;ref name=Black /&gt; 
==== Psalm 83 ====
The last Asaph psalm and the last Elohistic psalm highlights the lament of the people due to their fear of the invasion and of Israel. However then it reveals how God is in control of all occurrences and prays that the current enemy will be destroyed as all the enemies of the past were destroyed.&lt;ref name=HIll /&gt; 

== Other uses of the psalms of Asaph ==
[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] used the first line of Psalm 50 in his cantata Wer Dank opfert, der preiset mich BWV 17 and part of Psalm 75 in his cantata wir danken dir, got, wir danken dir, BWV 29.

Some contemporary bands have also utilized some of these Psalms as basis for their music. Underoath used Psalm 50 as a basis for their song “Salmamir” and Barlow Girl used Psalm 73 as a basis and title of one of their songs also known as “My God's Enough.”

Psalm 82 is also used in the Common Book of Prayer for funeral ceremonies.
