{{Judaism}}
{{Teshuva}}
The term '''offering''' as found in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in relation to the worship of Ancient Israel is mainly represented by the Hebrew noun ''korban'' (קָרְבָּן) whether for an animal or other offering. Other terms include [[animal sacrifice]] (''zevah'' זֶבַח), traditionally [[peace offering]] and ''olah'', traditionally &quot;[[burnt offering]].&quot; In Hebrew the noun ''korban'' is used for a variety of [[Sacrifice|sacrificial offerings]] described and commanded in the Hebrew Bible.

Such sacrifices were offered in a variety of settings by the ancient [[Israelite]]s, and later by the [[Priesthood (Ancient Israel)|Jewish priesthood]], the [[Kohen|priests]], at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. A ''korban'' was often an [[animal sacrifice]], such as a [[sheep]] or a [[bull]] that underwent [[shechita|Jewish ritual slaughter]], and was often cooked and eaten by the offerer, with parts given to the priests and parts burned on the Temple [[altar (Judaism)|mizbe'ah]]. Sacrifices could also consist of [[dove]]s, [[grain]] or meal, [[wine]], or [[incense]].

The [[Hebrew Bible]] narrates that [[God]] commanded the [[Israelites]] to offer offerings and sacrifices on various altars, and describes the offering of sacrifices in the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]], in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] until the First Temple was destroyed, and resumed with the [[Second Temple]] until it was destroyed in 70 CE.

The practice of offerings and animal sacrifices in Judaism mostly ended with the destruction of the Temple, although it was briefly reinstated during the [[Jewish-Roman Wars]] of the 2nd century AD and was continued in certain communities thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qorbanot: Sacrifices and Other Offerings|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html|publisher=JewishVirtualLibrary.org|accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbinic Judaism]] continued to maintain that the Torah allowed observance of Jewish law without animal sacrifice based upon oral tradition and strong support from scripture, such as Psalms 51:16-19 and Hosea 6:6. However, the practice and nature of sacrifices continue to have relevance to [[Judaism|Jewish theology]] and [[halakha|law]], particularly in [[Orthodox Judaism]].

==Etymology==
===Noun ''korban'' and verb ''karab''===
The Hebrew noun ''korban'', in [[Classical Hebrew]], is pronounced ''qarban'' in [[Sephardic Hebrew]]. The plural is ''korbanot'' or ''qorbanoth'' (קָרְבֳּנוֹת).

The Hebrew feminine noun ''qorban'' (plural ''qorbanot'') first occurs in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in Leviticus 1:2 and in all occurs 80 times in the [[Massoretic Text]]; of which 40 in Leviticus, 38 in Numbers and 2 in Ezekiel. The related form ''qurban'' appears only in Nehemiah 10:35 and 13:31 &quot;wood offering.&quot; Traditionally the etymology is from the verb stem ''karab'' and indicates the purpose to bring man back to God.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Schechter in ''Understanding rabbinic Judaism, from Talmudic to modern times'' ed. Jacob Neusner p229 &quot;Hence the injunction to bring a Korban (sacrifice) even in this case; the effect of the Korban, as its etymology (Karab) indicates, is to bring man back to God, or rather to facilitate this approach.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judaism in biological perspective: biblical lore and Judaic practices Rick Goldberg - 2008 &quot;The traditional etymology of korban is of a valuable object &quot;brought near to God &quot; (through the sacrificial act).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The same stem is found in the [[Akkadian language]] noun ''aqribtu'' &quot;act of offering.&quot; The Hebrew word ''qorban'' passed as a loan word into Samaritan as ''qaraban'', into Syriac as ''qurbana'', and is documented in &lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz-Josef Fabry]], extensive entry ''qorban'' in ''Theological dictionary of the Old Testament'' ed. Helmer Ringgren. pages 152-158&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Septuagint]] generally translates the term in Greek as ''doron'', &quot;gift&quot;, ''thusia'' &quot;sacrifice&quot;, or ''prosfora'' &quot;offering up&quot;, while the New Testament preserves ''korban'' once as a transliterated loan-word, otherwise using ''doron'', ''thusia'', ''prosfora'' and other terms drawn from the Septuagint.

The word Korban is pronounced identically in the Arabic language (Arabic ''kurban'' قربان) and [[Mizrahi Hebrew]], and also means a sacrifice offered to God. The word is used in Islam besides its use in Judaism.

==Hebrew Bible==
Offerings were practiced from earliest times, particularly for over one thousand years in the [[tabernacle]] and during the eras of the [[Temple of Solomon]] and the [[Second Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] when the [[Israelite]]s lived in the [[Land of Israel]] until the destruction of [[Judea]], Jerusalem, and the Temple by the [[Roman Empire]] in 70 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch A. Levine ''In the presence of the Lord: a study of cult and some cultic terms'' 1974   Page 99 &quot;The Bible gives evidence of two modes of sacrifice in ancient Israel: 1) Altar sacrifices, of which at least some part was consumed by the altar fire, or was burnt as incense, and 2) Offerings placed before the deity and ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Offerings are mentioned in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], but codified in the later four books of the [[Torah]] outlining their origins and history.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carasik ''The commentators' Bible: the JPS Miqra'ot gedolot Exodus '' 2005  Page 3 &quot;The majority of Leviticus deals with the offerings: how they are to be made, by whom, and where, as well as the ancillary rules that go along ....&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Every regular weekday, Sabbath, and many [[Jewish holiday]]s had their own unique offerings.&lt;ref&gt;James E Smith ''The Pentateuch'' Page 392 2006 &quot;Leviticus 23 presents in chronological order a list of &quot;the Lord's appointed feasts. ... Special offerings were presented each day of the feast.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The priests performed the offerings first in the ancient [[Tabernacle]] and then in the [[Temple of Solomon]] (the first Temple in Jerusalem) and later in the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt; Henry W. Soltau ''The Tabernacle, the Priesthood, and the Offerings''- 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrew Bible]] describes the priests as descendants of [[Aaron]] who meet certain marriage and ritual purity requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Himmelfarb ''A kingdom of priests: ancestry and merit in ancient Judaism'' Page 5  2006 &quot;On the other hand, P and H, the priestly sources, grant the priesthood only to descendants of Aaron, Levi's great-grandson.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The high priest in particular played a crucial role in this regard on the [[Day of Atonement]], a day when multiple offerings were offered.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Edersheim ''The Temple -- Its Ministry and Services'' &quot;The Duties of the High-priest  - Seven days before the Day of Atonement the high-priest left his own house in Jerusalem, and took up his abode in his chambers in the Temple.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and Offerings===
Women were required to perform a number of offerings, including:

* ''Childbirth'' The offerings following childbirth described in [[Leviticus]] 12.
* [[Thank offering]] and its accompanying [[meal offering]] following recovery from illness or danger
* ''Passover'' The [[Passover sacrifice]] on [[Passover]]. Women could offer the sacrifice and hold a seder themselves if they wished, even if married.
* [[Sin offering]]s or [[guilt offering]]s in atonement for transgressions and unintentional errors.
* Offerings relevant to fulfillment of, or transgression of, the [[Nazirite]] vow.
* Offerings following cure from certain diseases and unusual bodily discharges.

Women could also voluntarily participate in a number of other offerings and rituals for which they were not obligated, including:
* [[First Fruits]] on the holiday of [[Shavuot]].
* [[Temple tax]] - The half-[[shekel]] tax for Temple needs.{{cn|date=September 2011}}
* Voluntary offerings, [[peace offerings]] and a variety of other voluntary and donative offerings.
* ''[[Semicha]]'' (laying on hands) of sacrificial animals for sacrifices they were not required to perform (Berachot 19a).
* Women could slaughter their sacrificial animals themselves if they wished.{{cn|date=September 2011}}

===In the Prophets===
Many books of the [[prophet]]s in the [[Hebrew Bible]], such as the [[Book of Isaiah]] and [[Book of Jeremiah]], spoke out against those Israelites who brought forth sacrifices but did not act in accord with the precepts of the Law. The Prophets disparaged sacrifices that were offered without a regeneration of the heart, i.e., a determined turning from sin and returning to God by striving after righteousness ([[Hosea]] 14:1-2, Joel 2:13, Micah 6:6-8). At the same time, prophets stressed the importance of offerings combined with justice and good even as they taught that offerings were unacceptable unless combined with heartfelt repentance and good deeds. [[Malachi]], the last prophet in the [[Hebrew Bible]], emphasized that the goal of repentance is not to end sacrifices, but to make the offerings fit for acceptance once again (Malachi 3:3-4). Similarly, the [[Book of Isaiah]] despite disparagement of sacrifices without justice, portrays sacrifice as having a role complementary with prayer in a universalistic [[eschatology]] (Isaiah 56:1; 6-7).

===Instructions in Mishnah and Talmud===
The [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] devote a very large section, known as a ''seder'', to the study and analysis of this subject known as ''[[Kodshim]]'', whereby all the detailed varieties of ''korbanot'' are enumerated and analyzed in great logical depth, such as ''kodshim kalim'' (&quot;of minor degree of sanctity&quot;) and ''kodashei kodashim'' (&quot;of major degree of sanctity&quot;). In addition, large parts of every other book of the Talmud discuss various kinds of sacrifices. As but a few examples, ''Pesachim'' is largely devoted to a discussion of how to offer the [[Pesach]] (Passover) sacrifice. ''Yoma'' contains a detailed discussion of the offerings and Temple ritual on [[Yom Kippur]] (Day of Atonement), and there are sections in ''seder Moed'' (Festivals) for the special offerings and Temple ritual for other major [[Jewish holidays]]. ''Sheqalim'' discusses the annual half-shekel offering for Temple maintenance and Temple governance and management, ''Nashim'' discusses the offerings made by Nazirites and the suspected adultress, etc.

The Talmud provides extensive details not only on how to perform sacrifices but how to adjudicate difficult cases, such what to do if a mistake was made and whether improperly performing one of the required ritual elements invalidates it or not. The Talmud explains how to roast the [[Passover]] offering, how to dash blood from different kinds of sacrifices upon the altar, how to prepare the incense, the regulatory code for the system of taxation that financed the priesthood and public sacrifices, and numerous other details.

===Rationale and Rabbinic commentary===
[[Maimonides]], a medieval Jewish scholar, drew on the early critiques of the need for sacrifice, taking the view that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides' view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice would be a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God's decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step. In his ''[[Guide to the Perplexed]]'' he writes:

:&quot;But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service. For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.&quot; (Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, The Guide for the Perplexed, Dover Publications, 1956 edition.)

In contrast, many others such as [[Nachmanides]] (in his Torah commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed. Nachmanides cites the fact that the [[Torah]] records the practices of animal and other sacrifices from the times of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] and earlier. Indeed, the purpose of recounting the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]], known in Judaism as &quot;The Binding of Isaac&quot; (''Akeidat Yitzhak'' or the ''Akeidah'') was to illustrate the sublime significance and need of animal sacrifices as supplanting the abomination of human sacrifices.

===In Spiritual practice===
The ''korban'' also has a spiritual meaning, and refers to some part of an individual's ego, which is given up as a sacrifice to God in honor of the mortality of the worshipper. In keeping with the root of the word, meaning to draw close, and to the common usage as the sacrifice of an animal, so too can the worshipper sacrifice something of this world in order to become closer to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==The end of sacrifices==
With the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.

Rabbinic Judaism was forced to undergo a significant development in response to this change; no longer could Judaism revolve round the Temple services. The destruction of the Temple led to a development of Judaism in the direction of text study, prayer, and personal observance. [[Orthodox Judaism]] regards this as being largely an alternative way of fulfilling the obligations of the Temple. Other branches of Judaism ([[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]]) regard the Korbanot as an ancient ritual that will not return. A range of responses is recorded in classical rabbinic literature, describing this subject.

:Once, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was walking with his disciple, Rabbi Y'hoshua, near Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Y'hoshua looked at the Temple ruins and said &quot;Alas for us!! The place that atoned for the sins of the people Israel lies in ruins!&quot; Then Rabbi Yohannan ben Zakkai spoke to him these words of comfort:  'Be not grieved, my son. There is another equally meritorious way of gaining ritual atonement, even though the Temple is destroyed. We can still gain ritual atonement through deeds of loving-kindness. For it is written &quot;Lovingkindness I desire, not sacrifice.&quot; (Hosea 6:6)
:[[Midrash]] Avot D'Rabbi Nathan 4:5

In the Babylonian Talmud, a number of sages opined that following Jewish law, doing charitable deeds, and studying Jewish texts is greater than performing animal sacrifices.

:Rabbi Elazar said: Doing righteous deeds of charity is greater than offering all of the sacrifices, as it is written: &quot;Doing charity and justice is more desirable to the Lord than sacrifice&quot; (Proverbs 21:3).
:Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 49

Nonetheless, numerous texts of the Talmud stress the importance of and hope for eventual re-introduction of sacrifices, and regard their loss as a terrible tragedy. Partaking of sacrificial offerings was compared to eating directly at one's Father's table, whose loss synagogue worship does not quite entirely replace. One example is in ''Berachot'':

:And I said to him: I heard a heavenly voice that was cooing like a dove and saying, &quot;Woe to the children because of whose sins I destroyed My house, and burned My temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world. And he [Elijah the prophet] said to me: &quot;By your life and the life of your head! It is not only at this moment that [the heavenly voice] says this. But on each and every day it says this three times. And not only this, but at the time that the people of Israel enter the synagogues and houses of study, and respond (in the [[Kaddish]]) &quot;May His great name be blessed&quot;, the Holy One, Blessed is He, shakes His head and says: &quot;Fortunate for the king who is praised this way in his house. What is there for the Father who has exiled His children. And woe to the children who have been exiled from their Father's table.&quot;  (Talmud ''Berachot'' 3a).

Another example is in ''Sheqalim'':

:Rabbi Akiva said: Shimon Ben Loga related the following to me: I was once collecting grasses, and I saw a child from the [[House of Avitnas]] (the incense-makers). And I saw that he cried, and I saw that he laughed. I said to him, &quot;My son, why did you cry?&quot; He said, Because of the glory of my Father's house that has decreased.&quot; I asked &quot;And why did you laugh?&quot; He said to me &quot;Because of the glory prepared for the righteous in the future.&quot; I asked &quot;And what did you see?&quot; [that brought on these emotions]. &quot;The herb ''[[Maaleh Ashan|maaleh ashan]]'' is growing next to me. [''Maaleh Ashan'' is the secret ingredient in the incense that made the smoke rise, which according to the Talmud the [[House of Avitnas]] never revealed.]&quot;

===Liturgical attention to end of sacrifices===
Numerous details of the daily religious practice of an ordinary Jew are connected to keeping memory of the rhythm of the life of the Temple and its sacrifices. For example, the [[Mishna]] begins with a statement that the [[Shema Yisrael]] (Hear O Israel) prayer is to be recited in the evening at the time when  [[Kohanim]] who were [[Tamei]] (ritually impure) are permitted to enter to eat their [[Terumah]] (a food-tithe given to priests) following purification, requiring a detailed discussion of the obligations of tithing, ritual purity, and other elements central to the Temple and priesthood in order to determine the meaning of the contemporary daily Jewish obligation.

===Other occasions===
Jewish services for [[Shabbat]], [[Jewish holidays]] and other occasions include special prayers for the restoration of sacrifices. For example, the traditional [[Yom Kippur]] liturgy contains repeated prayers for the restoration of sacrifices and every [[High Holiday]] [[Amidah]] contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7:

:Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;mechon-mamre.org&quot;&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1056.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern view and resumption of sacrifices==
===Future of sacrifices in Judaism===
{{see also|Rabbinic Judaism}}
Since the destruction of the Temple, Judaism has instituted a system of study, public [[Torah]] readings, and prayers that connect the Jewish people to the Temple and the Temple service.

The prevailing belief among rabbinic Jews is that in the messianic era, the [[Jewish Messiah]] will come and a [[Third Temple]] will be built. It is believed that the ''korbanot'' will be reinstituted, but to what extent and for how long is unknown. Some biblical and classical rabbinic sources hold that most or all sacrifices will not need to be offered.

* In the future all sacrifices, with the exception of the Thanksgiving-sacrifice, will be discontinued. (Midrash Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)
* All sacrifices will be annulled in the future. (Tanchuma Emor 14, Vayikra Rabbah 9:7)
* Then the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to God as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. (Malachi 3:4)
* It is impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the other;...the custom which was in those days general among all men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted of sacrificing animals in the temples... For this reason God allowed this kind of service to continue.  The sacrificial system is not the primary object, rather supplications, and prayer. (Maimonides, The Guide to the Perplexed III 32)

The majority view of classical rabbis is that the [[613 mitzvot|Torah's commandments]] will still be applicable and in force during the messianic era. However, a significant minority of rabbis held that most of the commandments will be nullified in the [[Jewish Messiah|messianic]] era, thus holding that sacrifices will not be reinstated. Examples of such rabbinic views include:

* Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Niddah 61b and Tractate Shabbat 151b.
* Midrash Shochar Tov (Mizmor 146:5) states that God will permit what is now forbidden.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that in the messianic era, most or all of the korbanot will be reinstituted, at least for a time. Other, non-Torah observant [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish movements]], such as [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], hold that no animal sacrifices should be offered in a rebuilt Temple at all, not for any [[Halakhic]] reason, but because animal sacrifice appears to be incompatible with their view of the modern world. See the article on the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] for examples of how prayerbooks by many Jewish groups deal with this issue.

===Nineteenth and Twentieth century===
In the 1800s a number of Orthodox rabbis studied the idea of reinstating ''korbanot'' on the Temple Mount, even though the messianic era had not yet arrived and the Temple was not rebuilt. A number of [[responsa]] concluded that within certain parameters, it is permissible according to Jewish law to offer such sacrifices.

During the early 20th century, Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] known as the ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]'' and himself a ''kohen'', advised some followers to set up special [[yeshiva]]s for married students known as ''Kodshim [[Kollel]]s'' that would specialize in the study of the ''korbanot'' and study with greater intensity the ''kodshim'' sections of the [[Talmud]] in order to prepare for the arrival of the [[Jewish Messiah]] who would oversee the rebuilding of the original [[Temple of Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]] that would be known as the [[Third Temple]]. His advice was taken seriously and today there are a number of well-established ''[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]]'' institutions in [[Israel]] that focus solely on the subject of the ''korbanot'', ''kodshim'', and the needs of the future Jewish Temple, such as the [[Brisk yeshivas]].

===Efforts to restore Korbanot===
{{Main|The Third Temple}}

A few groups, notably the [[Temple Institute]] and the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], have petitioned the Israeli government to rebuild a [[Third Temple]] on the [[Temple Mount]] and restore sacrificial worship. The Israeli government has not responded favorably. Most Orthodox Jews regard rebuilding a Temple as an activity for a [[Jewish Messiah]] as part of a future [[Jewish eschatology]], and most non-Orthodox Jews do not believe in the restoration of sacrificial worship at all. The [[Temple Institute]] has been constructing ritual objects in preparation for a resumption of sacrifices.

==View among modern Jewish denominations==
===Contemporary Orthodox Judaism===
Today [[Orthodox Judaism]] includes mention of each ''korban'' on either a daily basis in the ''[[siddur]]'' (daily prayer book), or in the ''[[machzor]]'' (holiday prayerbook) as part of the prayers for the relevant days concerned. They are also referred to in the prayerbooks of [[Conservative Judaism]], in an abbreviated fashion.

On each [[Jewish holiday]] the sections in the [[Torah]] mentioning that festival's ''korbanot'' is read out loud in [[synagogue]].

====Daily Services====
In the very early morning daily ''[[Shacharit]]'' prayers for example, they include the following in order of mention, actually called the ''korbanot''. (The following example is taken from the [[Ashkenazi Judaism|Ashkenazi]] liturgy.)
* ''Kiyor'' Describing the basin containing pure water to wash up before touching the ''korbanot'' (offerings), based on Exodus 30: 17-21.&lt;ref name=&quot;bible.ort.org&quot;&gt;http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=30&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Trumat Hadeshen'' Removing the ashes of the ''korban olah'' (elevation offering), based on Leviticus 6:1-6.&lt;ref&gt;http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=6&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Korban Tamid'' Perpetual daily offerings: &quot;...Fire-offering...male yearling lambs unblemished two a day...&quot; based on Numbers 28:1-8.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=28&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ketoret''' [[Incense]] [from] [[spice]]s: &quot;...stacte, onycha, and galbanum, ...and [[frankincense]]...&quot; Based on Exodus 30:34-36;7-8...&lt;ref name=&quot;bible.ort.org&quot;/&gt;&quot;[[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]], [[Nard (perfume)|spikenard]], [[saffron]], costus, aromatic bark, [[cinnamon]], ley, [[salt]], [[amber]]...&quot; based on the Babylonian [[Talmud]] ''Kritut'' 6a; Jerusalem Talmud ''Yoma'' 4:5; 33a.
* ''Korban Musaf'' The additional offerings for [[Shabbat]]: &quot;On the Sabbath...two male [[domestic sheep|lamb]]s...fine [[flour]] for a meal offering mixed with oil and its [[wine]] libation...&quot; based on Numbers 28:9-10.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
* ''Korban Rosh Chodesh'' Offering for the new month: ...Two young [[bull]]s, one [[Sheep|ram]], seven lambs...fine flour ...mixed with [[olive oil]]...one he [[goat]]... and its wine libation.&quot; Based on Numbers 28: 11-15.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
* ''Zevachim'' Chapter 5 of [[Mishnah]] ''Zevachim'' is then cited. (It was included in the ''siddur'' at this stage because it discusses all the sacrifices and the sages do not dispute within it):
**A. ''Eizehu mekoman shel z'vachim'' Places for the ''zevachim korbanot'' to be offered: &quot;...The slaughter of the bull and the he-goat of [[Yom Kippur]] is in the north [of the altar]...&quot;
**B. ''Parim hanisrafim'' [[Bull]]s that are completely burned: &quot;...These are burned in the place where the [altar] ashes are deposited.&quot;
**C. ''Chatot hatzibur v'hayachid'' Sin offerings of the community and the individual: &quot;...The he-goats...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] curtains by male priests...until midnight.&quot;
**D. ''Ha'olah kodesh kodashim'' The elevation offering is among the offerings with a major-degree-of-holiness: &quot;...it is entirely consumed by fire.&quot;
**E. ''Zivchei shalmei tzibur v'ashamot'' Communal peace offerings and guilt offerings: &quot;...are eaten within the [Temple courtyard] by males of the priesthood...until midnight.&quot;
**F. ''Hatodah v'eil nazir kodashim kalim'' The thanksgiving offering and the ram of a [[Nazirite]] are offerings of a minor-degree holiness: &quot;They are eaten throughout the city [of [[Jerusalem]] ] by anyone, prepared in any manner...until midnight...&quot;
**G. ''Sh'lamim kodashim kalim'' The peace offerings are of lesser (lighter) holiness:  &quot;...Is eaten by the ''kohanim''...throughout the city [of Jerusalem] by anyone...&quot;
**H. ''Hab'chor vehama'aser vehapesach kodashim kalim'' The firstborn and tithe of animals and the [[Passover]] offering are offerings of lesser (lighter) holiness: &quot;...The Passover offering is eaten only at night...only if roasted.&quot;
* ''Rabbi Yishmael omer'' Rabbi Yishmael says: Through thirteen rules is the [[Torah]] elucidated. (Introduction to the ''Sifra'', part of the Oral Law).
* ''Yehi Ratzon'' (Ending) The study session concludes with a prayer (&quot;May it be thy will...) for the restoration of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and the resumption of sacrifices. (...that the [[The Third Temple|Temple]] be rebuilt speedily in our days, and grant our portion in your [[Torah]] and there we shall serve you with reverence as in days of old and in former years. And may the grain offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and in former years.&quot;)

The [[Amidah]]
* ''Retzai'' Every the Orthodox [[Amidah]] prayer, the central prayer of [[Jewish services]], contains the paragraph: &quot;Be favorable, Oh Lord our God, to your people Israel and their prayer, and [[The Third Temple|restore]] the service of the [[Holy of Holies (Judaism)|Holy of Holies]] of Your [[Temple in Jerusalem|House]], and accept the fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer with love and favor, and may the service of your people Israel always be favored.&quot; Conservative Judaism removes the words &quot;fire offerings of Israel&quot; from this prayer.
* ''Yehi Ratzon'' Private recitiation of the Amidah traditionally ends with the ''Yehi Ratzon'' prayer for the restoration of the Temple.
* The Amidah itself is said to represent liturgically the ''purpose'' of the daily Korban, while the recitation of the korbanot sections fulfill the ''formal responsibility'' to perform them, in the absence of the Temple.

The weekday [[Torah reading]]
* A set of blessings connected with the weekday Torah reading include a prayer for the [[Third Temple|restoration of the Temple]]: &quot;May it be the will before our Father who is in heaven to establish the House of our lives and to return his ''[[shekhina]]'' (Divine presence) into our midst, speedily, in our days, and let us say Amen.&quot;

{{Jewish prayers}}

===In Conservative Judaism===
[[Conservative Judaism]] disavows the resumption of Korbanot. Consistent with this view, it has deleted prayers for the resumption of sacrifices from the Conservative Siddur, including both the morning study section from the sacrifices, prayers for the restoration of Korbanot in the Amidah, and various mentions elsewhere. Consistent with its view that a priesthood and sacrificial system will not be restored, Conservative Judaism has also lifted certain restrictions on [[Kohen|Kohanim]], including limitations on marriage prohibiting marrying a divorced women or a convert. Conservative Judaism does, however, believe in the restoration of a [[The Third Temple|Temple]] in some form, and in the continuation of Kohanim and [[Levites]] under relaxed requirements, and has retained references to both in its prayer books. Consistent with its stress on the continuity of tradition, many Conservative synagogues have also retained references to [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|Festival]] Korbanot, changing all references to sacrifices into the past tense (e.g. the Orthodox &quot;and there we will sacrifice&quot; is changed to &quot;and there they sacrificed&quot;). Some more liberal Conservative synagogues, however, have removed all references to sacrifices, past or present, from the prayer service. The most recent official Conservative prayer book, [[Sim Shalom]], provides both service alternatives.

===In Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===
[[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] disavow all belief in a restoration of a [[The Third Temple|Temple]], the resumption of Korbanot, or the continuation of identified [[Kohen|Kohanim]] or [[Levites]]. These branches of Judaism believe that all such practices represent ancient practices inconsistent with the requirements of modernity, and have removed all or virtually all references to Korbanot from their prayer books.

==Martyrs as ''korbanot''==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2007}}
Classical Judaism teaches that after the destruction of the Temple, any Jew can become a ''korban'' for God as a martyr, both as a ''kadosh'' and as a ''korban''. A ''kadosh'' means a &quot;holy&quot; or &quot;sanctified&quot; person who has given up his life for God, which is known as ''[[kiddush Hashem]]'' or &quot;sanctification of God's name&quot;. The word for ''korbanot'' is ''kodshim'', meaning &quot;holy things&quot; and the name for martyrs is ''kedoshim'' meaning &quot;holy ones&quot;. So it is no wonder that Jews murdered during [[the Holocaust]] are referred to as both ''&quot;korbanot&quot;'' and &quot;the ''kedoshim''&quot;.
   
The relationship between martyrs and sacrifices has its sources in the Torah. One strong proto-type for the subject is the [[Binding of Isaac|near sacrifice of Isaac]], where God calls [[Isaac]] an ''olah'' (&quot;burnt offering&quot;): &quot;...God tested [[Abraham]]...'Take your son, the only one you love, Isaac...Bring him as an ''olah'' (an [[holocaust (sacrifice)|all-burned offering]])...'...Abraham built the altar there, and arranged the wood. He then bound his son Isaac, and placed him on the altar on top of the wood. Abraham reached out and took the slaughter knife to slit his son's throat. God's angel called to him from heaven...Abraham then looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. He went and got the ram, sacrificing it as an all-burned offering in his son's place...&quot; (Genesis 22:1-19).&lt;ref&gt;http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this ram is interchangeable with Isaac, as any animal ''korban'' is symbolic of its human owner. In times when there is no Temple, the individual martyr is his or her own ''korban'' according to most classical views in Jewish thought on this subject.
    
This lesson was embedded into the Jewish national consciousness because it became their &quot;mental framework&quot; and means of rationalizing the persecutions against them over the centuries. A rabbinical teaching ([[Rashi]] ''Torat Kohanim'', Leviticus) that when Jews are suffering, God looks to the &quot;ashes&quot; of Isaac on the altar, as if he had been burned like a ''korban olah'', a complete &quot;burned offering&quot;, (since Isaac accepted his fate, it is considered to be the equivalent of him having actually &quot;gone through with it&quot; on a metaphysical level), and it then serves the same purposes of gaining atonement as the sacrifices would have done in the ancient Temples.
    
A noted verse in the Book of [[Psalms]] says &quot;...But for your [God's] sake are we killed all the day; we are considered like '''sheep for the slaughter'''. &quot; (Psalms 44:23).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2644.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Jews going like &quot;sheep to the slaughter&quot; has been used as the metaphor for both Jewish powerlessness as well as absolute fealty by them to their God. The death of people martyred for their faith was deemed to be the equivalent of sacrifices in the ancient Temples and hence the nomenclature utilized is the same as well. The word &quot;[[Holocaust]]&quot; derives from the Greek term for a &quot;completely burnt&quot; (''olah'') offering.

==In Christianity==
Most Christians (Jesus Christ in Gospel and St Paul in The Epistles) believe that sacrifices were commanded by God because of mankind's need to be ransomed from the punishment of sin (Lev. 17:11). They believe that since God is holy, he demands perfection in his followers, which is an unattainable standard (Rom. 3:23). The sacrificed animals were a sign of God's grace to mankind - in effect allowing the death of an acceptable animal to take the place of a man's death. Many Christians{{Who|date=July 2008}} believe that this system of substitutionary atonement was prophesied to end with the coming of the Messiah. The Messiah's death was to be the atoning sacrifice for the entire world, thereby invalidating the need for the old system of animal sacrifice (Heb. 10:1-18). See [[Isaiah 53]]
Some other Christians{{Who|date=July 2008}} (arguably fewer in number) believe that the atonement by the sacrificial system worked in allowing the worshiper to approach a Holy God who dwelled among them, but did not take away sins which they never intended to do. 

Lewis Sperry Chafer taught that the entire modus operandi of the Levitical priesthood was a &quot;shadow Christology.&quot;  This included the structures, furniture, furnishings, clothing, and rituals.  Hebrews 10:1  &quot;For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.&quot;  The writer of Hebrews asserts that these sacrifices do not have the ability to &quot;make perfect them that draw nigh,&quot; but were instead, a &quot;shadow of good things to come,&quot; specifically, the person and work of Jesus Christ.  The Book of Hebrews, written c. 67 AD, was addressed to the Jews living in Jerusalem.  The content, grammar, syntax, style, and the use of Attic and Patristic Greek terms, idiom, and structures, all point to the writer being someone intimately familiar with the Old Testament rituals, and solidly educated in Greek.  All the Old Testament quotes are directly from the Septuagint.  Two examples of Jesus Christ fulfilling the &quot;shadows&quot; are the following:  John the Baptist noted (John 1:29) &quot;On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!&quot;  In John 8:12, Jesus states, &quot;Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.&quot;  In the context, Jesus is referring to the golden candelabra that is in the Holy Place inside the Tabernacle.  John 10:22 tells us the time period during which Jesus made this statement.  

Jesus rebuked some of the Pharisees for their inappropriate position on Korban [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207:9-13;&amp;version=31 Mark Chapter 7],  also parallel [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015:4-6;&amp;version=31 Matthew Chapter 15].    In these passages, Jesus condemned the Pharisees for &quot;…making void the word of God by your tradition…&quot; by violating the Fifth Commandment to &lt;''honor your father and mother''&gt;, when they rather followed their &quot;traditions&quot;.  In the Gospel narrative, the Pharisees were keeping people obligated to their vow once something was set aside as Korban, prohibiting them to use it even in order to attend to the need of the parents. Many modern translations render Matthew 15:6 as if putting aside as Korban exempts people from their filial duty to the parents. Thus, it relieves people of any further responsibility to support their parents, whether it was actually turned over to the Temple treasury, being not important. This line of eisegesis interpretation is easily spotted in many Bible commentaries on this Gospel text.

The phrase al-Qurbaan al-Muqaddas (القربان المقدس; The Holy Korban) is the usual term used to translate the term &quot;[[Eucharist]]&quot; into Arabic among Arab Christians.
