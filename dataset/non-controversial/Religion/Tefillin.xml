'''Tefillin''' ([[Ashkenazim|Askhenazic]]: {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|t|f|ɪ|l|ɨ|n}}; [[Hebrew language|Israeli Hebrew]]: {{IPA-he|tfiˈlin|}}, {{lang|tmr|תפילין}}) also called '''phylacteries''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɪ|ˈ|l|æ|k|t|ər|iː|z}} from Ancient Greek ''phylacterion'', form of ''phylássein'', φυλάσσειν meaning &quot;to guard, protect&quot;) are a set of small black leather boxes containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the [[Torah]], which are worn by observant Jews during weekday morning prayers. Although &quot;tefillin&quot; is technically the plural form (the singular being &quot;tefillah&quot;), it is loosely used as a singular as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The [[Torah]] commands that they should be worn to serve as a &quot;sign&quot; and &quot;remembrance&quot; that God brought the [[children of Israel]] out of [[Egypt]].

The scriptural texts for tefillin are obscure in literal meaning. For example, the verse in Deut.&amp;nbsp;11:18 does not designate what specifically to &quot;bind upon your arm,&quot; and the definition of ''totafot'' is not obvious. It is the [[Talmud]], the authoritative [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]] for [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which explains what are to be bound to the body and the form of tefillin.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

== Biblical source ==
The obligation of tefillin, as expounded by the Oral Law, is mentioned four times in the [[Torah]]: twice when recalling the [[The Exodus]] from [[Egypt]]:
{{quote|And it shall be for a sign for you upon your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the {{LORD}} may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand did the {{LORD}} bring you out of Egypt.|[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 13:9}}
{{quote|And it shall be for a sign upon your hand, and as ''totafot'' between your eyes; for with a mighty hand did the {{LORD}} bring us forth out of Egypt.|[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 13:16}}
and twice in the [[shema]] passages:
{{quote|And you shall bind them as a sign upon your arm, and they shall be as ''totafot'' between your eyes.|[[Deuteronomy]] 6:8}}
{{quote|You shall put these words of mine on your heart and on your soul; and you shall tie them for a sign upon your arm, and they shall be as ''totafot'' between your eyes.|[[Deuteronomy]] 11:18}}

== Etymology ==
The ultimate origin of [[Hebrew]] &quot;tefillin&quot; is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinmetz2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Sol Steinmetz|title=Dictionary of Jewish usage: a guide to the use of Jewish terms|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Nk_RFL9LYg0C&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4387-4|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;tefillin&quot; is not found in the Bible, which calls them ''ṭoṭafot''. The [[Septuagint]] renders &quot;ṭoṭafot&quot; ''ἀσαλευτόν'', &quot;something immovable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=290&amp;letter=P Phylacteries], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1906).&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe it refers to a charm, similar to the Hebrew ''neṭifot'', &quot;round jewel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; The [[Talmud]] (Sanhedrin 4b) explains that the word ''ṭoṭafot'' is combination of two foreign words: ''Tot'' means &quot;two&quot; in the &quot;[[Caspi language|Caspi]]&quot; language and ''Fot'' means &quot;two&quot; in the &quot;[[African language|Afriki]]&quot; language,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Targum]] often substitutes the word ''Afriki'' for [[Tarshish]], see [[Books of Kings|Kings I]] 10:22&lt;/ref&gt;  hence ''tot'' and ''fot'' means &quot;two and two&quot;, corresponding to the four compartments of the head-tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 13:16, s.v. ''U'letotafot bein ei'neicha''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menahem ben Saruq]] explains that the word is derived from the Hebrew ''Ve'hateif'' and ''Tatifoo'', both expressions meaning &quot;speech&quot;, &quot;for when one sees the tefillin it causes him to remember and speak about The Exodus from Egypt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rashi]] to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 13:16, s.v. ''U'letotafot bein ei'neicha''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first texts to use &quot;tefillin&quot; are the [[Targum]]im and [[Peshitta]]&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; and it is also used in subsequent Talmudic literature, although the word &quot;ṭoṭafah&quot; was still current, being used with the meaning of &quot;frontlet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; &quot;Tefillin&quot; may have derived from the [[Aramaic]] ''palal'', &quot;to plead, pray,&quot; a word closely related to the Hebrew ''tefillah'', &quot;prayer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinmetz2005&quot;/&gt; [[Jacob ben Asher]] (14th&amp;nbsp;century) suggests that &quot;tefillin&quot; is derived from the Hebrew ''pelilah'', &quot;justice, evidence,&quot; for tefillin act as a sign and proof of [[Shechinah|God's presence]] among the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeiselsFinkel2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dovid Meisels|author2=Avraham Yaakov Finkel|title=Bar mitzvah and tefillin secrets: the mysteries revealed|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hGYRAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=30 April 2004|publisher=Dovid D.

The only instance of the name &quot;phylacteries&quot; in ancient times occurs once in the Greek [[New Testament]] whence it has passed into the languages of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; &quot;Phylacteries&quot; derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''phulaktērion - φυλακτήριον'', &quot;defences,&quot; and in late Greek, &quot;amulets&quot; or &quot;charms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cambridge Bible for schools and colleges&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Bible for schools and colleges|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rs4LAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 June 2011|year=1908|publisher=University press|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]] nor [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]] use the word &quot;phylacteries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

The most basic form are called ''peshutim'' (&quot;simple&quot;) are made using several pieces of parchment to form the inner walls of the head tefillin. The higher quality tefillin, namely ''dakkot'' (&quot;thin&quot;), made by stretching a thin piece of leather, and the more durable ''gassot'' (&quot;thick&quot;) are both fashioned from the single piece of hide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eider1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Shimon D.

The knot of the head-tefillin strap forms the letter ''[[dalet]]'' ({{Hebrew|ד}}) while the strap that is passed through the arm-tefillin is formed into a knot in the shape of the letter ''[[Yodh|yud]]'' ({{Hebrew|י}}). These three letters spell ''Shaddai'' ({{Hebrew|ש}}{{Hebrew|ד}}{{Hebrew|י}}), one of the names of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

=== Parchment scrolls ===
Four biblical passages which refer to the tefillin are placed inside the leather boxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; (''See &quot;Biblical passages contained in Tefillin&quot; template below'').
They are written by a [[sofer|scribe]] with special ink on parchment scrolls (''[[klaf]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; The Hebrew [[Ashuri alphabet|Ashuri]] script must be and there are three main styles of lettering used: ''Beis Yosef'' – generally used by [[Ashkenazim]]; ''Arizal'' – generally used by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]]; ''Velish'' – used by [[Sefardim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eider1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Shimon D. Eider|title=Student Edition of Halachos of Tefillin|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FrbbdzcfTxkC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=September 1985|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-1-58330-050-3|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passages contain 3,188 letters usually take between 10–15 hours to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stam.net/what_is_stam.aspx  What is Tefillin?], ''www.stam.net''. Retrieved 1 July 2011,&lt;/ref&gt; The arm-tefillin has one large compartment, which contains all four biblical passages written upon a single strip of parchment.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; The head-tefillin has four separate compartments in each of which one scroll of parchment is placed.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

There was considerable discussion among the commentators of the Talmud as to the order in which the scrolls should be inserted into the four compartments of the head-tefillin.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; In the Middle Ages, a famous debate on the issue was recorded between [[Rashi]] and his grandson [[Rabbeinu Tam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Rashi held that the passages are placed according to the chronological order as they appear in the Torah: ''Kadesh Li'', ''Ve-haya Ki Yeviehcha'', ''Shema'', ''Ve-haya Im Shemoa'', while according to Rabbeinu Tam, the last two passages are switched around.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Jacobs|title=The book of Jewish belief|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pFpZgMzsEWYC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=November 1984|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0-87441-379-3|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of tefillin dating from the 1st-century CE discovered at [[Qumran]] in the [[Judean Desert]] revealed that some were made according to the order understood by Rashi and others in the order of Rabbeinu Tam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs1984&quot;/&gt; The prevailing custom is to arrange the scrolls according to Rashi's view, but some pious Jews are also accustomed to briefly lay the teffilin of Rabbeinu Tam as well,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs1984&quot;/&gt; a custom adopted by the [[Hasidim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabinowicz1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tzvi Rabinowicz|title=The encyclopedia of Hasidism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OprXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 July 2011|year=1996|publisher=Jason Aronson|isbn=978-1-56821-123-7|page=482}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The placement of the protrusion of a tuft of the sinew (''se'ar eigel'') identifies as to which opinion the tefillin were written.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eider1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Shimon D.

==Obligation==
The duty of laying tefillin rests upon males after the age of thirteen years.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Although women are exempt from the obligation, some early codifers allowed them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''Hilkhot Tzitzit'' 3:9; [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Rashba]] Teshuva 123; ''[[Sefer Hachinuch]]'', Mitzvah 421; [[Rabbenu Tam]]. See Grossman, Avraham (2004). ''Pious and Rebellious - Jewish Women in Medieval Europe.'' Brandeis Univ.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Isserles]] (16th&amp;nbsp;century), however, strongly discourages it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]] [[Orach Chayim]], 38:3. See also [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan|Targum Yerushalmi]] on [[Deuteronomy]] 22:5.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the ''[[mitzvah]]'' of tefillin was not performed by women, but the ritual was apparently kept by some women in medieval France and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, Elisheva (2004). Mothers and Children - Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe. Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions exist of some prominent women laying tefillin&lt;ref name=&quot;beki.org&quot;&gt;[[Rashi's daughters]] allegedly wore tefillin, as did the wife of [[Chaim ibn Attar]] and the female Hasidic [[Rebbe]] known as [[Maiden of Ludmir]]. http://www.beki.org/womentefillin.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea is gaining a following among women affiliated to the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;uscj.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.uscj.org/Women_and_Tefillin7649.html Women and Tefillin : The United Synagogue for Conservative Judaism (USCJ)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who are not obliged to lay tefllin include a mourner during the first day of his mourning period, a bridegroom on his wedding-day.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; A sufferer from stomach-trouble or one who is otherwise in pain and can not concentrate his mind is also exempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; One who is engaged in the study of the Law and scribes of and dealers in tefillin and ''[[mezuzot]]'' while engaged in their work if it can not be postponed, are also free from this obligation.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

The codes view the commandment of tefillin as important and call those who neglect to observe it &quot;transgressors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Essrig1932&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaac David Essrig|title=The fountain of wisdom|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0DhDAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 July 2011|year=1932|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] counts the commandment of laying the arm-tefillin and head-tefillin as two separate positive ''[[mitzvot]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rambam&quot;&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2301.htm ''Tefillin, Mezuzah, ve'Sefer Torah'' ch 5-6].&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud cites [[Rav Sheshet]] who said that by neglecting the precept, one transgresses eight positive commandments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Menahot]] 44a&lt;/ref&gt; A report of widespread laxity in its observance is reported by [[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy|Moses of Coucy]] in 13th&amp;nbsp;century Spain. It may have arisen from the fear of persecution, similar to what had occurred to the Jews living in the [[Land of Israel]] under Roman rule in the 2nd-century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloch1980&quot;/&gt;

==Performance==
[[File:Israel 3 009.Religious Jew on a Daily-Market .jpg|thumb|200px|Member of the [[Chabad mitzvah campaigns#Tefillin campaign|Chabad Tefillin campaign]] offers passers-by the opportunity to put on tefilin]]
Originally tefillin were worn all day, but not during the night. Nowadays the prevailing custom is to wear them only during the weekday morning service,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]] [[Orach Chayim]] 37:2&lt;/ref&gt; although some individuals wear them at other times during the day as well.

Tefillin are not donned on [[Shabbat]] and the major festivals  because these holy days are themselves considered &quot;signs&quot; which render the need of the &quot;sign&quot; of tefillin superfluous. On [[Chol HaMoed]] (intermediate days) of [[Pesach]] and [[Sukkot]], there is a great debate among the early [[Posek|halachic authorities]] as to whether tefillin should be worn or not. Those who forbid it consider the &quot;sign&quot; of intermediate days as having the same status as the festival itself, making the ritual of tefillin redundant.&lt;ref name=&quot;koltorah&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/tefillinONmoed.htm|title=Tefillin on Hol Hamoed|last=Jachter|first=Howard|date=April 7, 2001|publisher=Kol Torah: ''Torah Academy of Bergen County''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue and hold that Chol HaMoed does not constitute a &quot;sign&quot; in which case tefillin must be laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;koltorah&quot;/&gt; Three customs evolved resulting from the dispute:
*''To refrain from wearing tefillin'': This ruling of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' is based on [[kabbalah]] and the [[Zohar]] which strongly advocate refraining from laying tefillin on Chol HaMoed. This position is maintained by [[Sephardic Jews]] and is also the opinion of the [[Vilna Gaon]] whose ruling has been universally accepted in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;koltorah&quot;/&gt;
*''To wear tefillin without reciting the blessings'': This is the opinion of, among others, [[Jacob ben Asher]], [[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy|Moses of Coucy]] and [[David HaLevi Segal]]. The advantage of this compromise is that one avoids the transgressions of either not donning tefillin or making a blessing in vain.&lt;ref name=&quot;koltorah&quot;/&gt;
*''To wear tefillin and recite the blessings in an undertone'': This opinion, based on  [[Maimonides]], is the ruling of [[Moses Isserles]] who writes that this is the universally accepted practice among [[Ashkenazic Jews]].&lt;ref name=&quot;koltorah&quot;/&gt;

In light of the conflicting opinions, the ''[[Mishna Berura]]'' (20th-century) recommends Ashkenazim make the following stipulation before donning tefillin: &quot;If I am obligated to don tefillin I intend to fulfill my obligation and if I am not obligated to don tefillin, my doing so should not be considered as fulfilling any obligation&quot; and that the blessing not be recited.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishna Berura]]'' 31:8&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fast day of [[Tisha B'Av]], tefillin are not worn in the morning as tefillin are considered an &quot;adornment&quot;, symbols of beauty, which is deemed inappropriate for a day of mourning. They are worn instead at the afternoon [[Mincha]] service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donin1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hayim Donin|title=To Be a Jew: A Guide to Jewish Observance in Contemporary Life|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=efJoMK8RhAAC|accessdate=1 July 2011|year=1991|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-08632-0|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashkenazim]] put on and remove the tefillin while standing, while [[Sephardim]] do so while sitting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grinṿald2001pg.36&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Zeʾev Grinṿald|title=Shaarei halachah: a summary of laws for Jewish living|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Txt4EidAVFEC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-1-58330-434-1|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is forbidden to speak or be distracted while putting on the tefillin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grinṿald2001pg.36&quot;/&gt;  An Ashkenazi says two blessings when laying tefillin, the first before he ties the arm-tefillin: ...''lehani'ach tefillin'', and the second after placing the head tefillin: ...''al mitzvat tefillin'', thereafter he tightens the head straps and says &quot;''Baruch Shem Kovod....&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitov2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliyahu Kitov|title=The Jew and His Home|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NQNG3I9ZLVUC&amp;pg=PA488|accessdate=4 July 2011|year=2000|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-1-58330-711-3|page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sephardic]] custom is that no blessing is said for the head-tefillin, the first blessing sufficing for both.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitov2000&quot;/&gt;  Many members of the [[Chabad]] Orthodox movement only recite the blessing on the Head-Tefillah if they spoke about something not related to tefillin since reciting the blessing on the Hand-Tefillah.
;Procedure
The arm-tefillin is laid on the inner side of the bare left arm, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; If one is left-handed, it is placed on the right arm in the same place.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; After the blessing is said, the arm-tefillin is tightened, and the strap wound seven times round the arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Then the head-tefillin is placed on the middle of the head just above the forehead, so that no parts rests below the hairline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Jacobs|title=The book of Jewish practice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qPW0BFLYb4kC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=1 June 1987|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0-87441-460-8|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knot of the head-tefillin sits at the back of the head, upon the part of the [[occipital bone]] that protrudes just above the [[nape]], directly opposite the [[optic chiasm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Munk1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael L.

There are various customs regarding winding the strap on the arm and hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kitov2000&quot;/&gt; In fact, the arm strap is looped for clockwise wrapping with Ashkenazi tefillin while it is knotted for counter clockwise wrapping with Sephardic and [[Chabad]] tefillin. On removing the tefillin, the steps are reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewishEncyclopedia&quot;/&gt;
