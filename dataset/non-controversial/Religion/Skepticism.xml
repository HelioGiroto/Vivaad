{{Certainty}}

'''Skepticism''' or '''scepticism''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) is generally any questioning attitude towards knowledge, facts, or opinions/beliefs stated as facts,&lt;ref&gt;See R. H. Popkin, The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes (rev. ed. 1968); C. L. Stough, Greek Skepticism (1969); M. Burnyeat, ed., The Skeptical Tradition (1983); B. Stroud, The Significance of Philosophical Skepticism (1984). [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Skeptikoi Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[doubt]] regarding claims that are taken for granted elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Philosophical views are typically classed as skeptical when they involve advancing some degree of doubt regarding claims that are elsewhere taken for granted.&quot; [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/s/skepcont.htm URM.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophical skepticism]] is an overall approach that requires all information to be well supported by evidence.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Philosophical skepticism should be distinguished from ordinary skepticism, where doubts are raised against certain beliefs or types of beliefs because the evidence for the particular belief or type of belief is weak or lacking...&quot; [http://www.skepdic.com/skepticism.html Skepdic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Classical philosophical skepticism derives from the 'Skeptikoi', a school who &quot;asserted nothing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of [[Pyrrhonism]], for instance, suspend judgment in investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines Of Pyrrhonism,'' Translated by R. G. Bury, [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Skeptics may even doubt the reliability of their own senses.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...the two most influential forms of skepticism have, arguably, been the radical epistemological skepticism of the classical Pyrrhonian skeptics and the Cartesian form of radical epistemological skepticism&quot; [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/s/skepcont.htm UTM.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Religious skepticism, on the other hand is &quot;doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam–Webster&lt;/ref&gt;  Most {{who|date=September 2012}} scientists are [[empiricism|empirical]] skeptics, who admit the possibility of knowledge based on evidence, but hold that new evidence may always overturn these findings.

==Definition==
In ordinary usage, skepticism (US) or scepticism (UK) ([[Ancient Greek|Greek:]] 'σκέπτομαι' ''skeptomai'', to think, to look about, to consider; see also [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|spelling differences]]) refers to:

* (a) an attitude of doubt or a disposition to incredulity either in general or toward a particular object;
* (b) the [[doctrine]] that true [[knowledge]] or knowledge in a particular area is uncertain; or
* (c) the method of suspended judgment, systematic doubt, or criticism that is characteristic of skeptics (Merriam–Webster).

In [[philosophy]], scepticism refers more specifically to any one of several propositions. These include propositions about:
*(a) an inquiry,
*(b) a method of obtaining knowledge through systematic doubt and continual testing,
*(c) the arbitrariness, relativity, or subjectivity of moral values,
*(d) the limitations of knowledge,
*(e) a method of intellectual caution and suspended judgment.

==Philosophical skepticism==
{{Main|Philosophical skepticism}}
In philosophical skepticism, [[pyrrhonism]] is a position that refrains from making truth claims. A philosophical skeptic does not claim that truth is impossible (which would be a truth claim), instead it recommends &quot;suspending belief&quot;. The label is commonly used to describe other philosophies which appear similar to philosophical skepticism, such as [[academic skepticism]], an ancient variant of Platonism that claimed knowledge of truth was impossible. [[Empiricism]] is a closely related, but not identical, position to philosophical skepticism. Empiricists see empiricism as a pragmatic compromise between philosophical skepticism and [[nomothetic]] science; philosophical skepticism is in turn sometimes referred to as &quot;radical empiricism.&quot;

Philosophical skepticism originated in ancient [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/tok/scepticism8.htm Scepticism – History of Scepticism]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]] of the 5th century BC were for the most part skeptics. [[Pyrrhonism]] was a school of skepticism founded by [[Aenesidemus]] in the first century BC and recorded by [[Sextus Empiricus]] in the late 2nd century or early 3rd century AD. One of its first proponents was [[Pyrrho]] of [[Elis]] (c. 360-275 B.C.), who traveled and studied as far as [[Indian philosophy|India]] and propounded the adoption of &quot;practical&quot; skepticism. Subsequently, in the &quot;New Academy&quot; [[Arcesilaus]] (c. 315-241 B.C.) and [[Carneades]] (c. 213-129 B.C.) developed more theoretical perspectives, by which conceptions of absolute truth and falsity were refuted as uncertain. Carneades criticized the views of the Dogmatists, especially supporters of [[Stoicism]], asserting that absolute certainty of knowledge is impossible. [[Sextus Empiricus]] (c. A.D. 200), the main authority for Greek skepticism, developed the position further, incorporating aspects of [[empiricism]] into the basis for asserting knowledge.

Greek skeptics criticized the [[Stoics]], accusing them of [[dogmatism]]. For the skeptics, the [[logic]]al mode of argument was untenable, as it relied on propositions which could not be said to be either true or false without relying on further propositions. This was the [[regress argument]], whereby every proposition must rely on other propositions in order to maintain its validity (see the five [[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]] of [[Agrippa the Sceptic]]). In addition, the skeptics argued that two propositions could not rely on each other, as this would create a [[circular argument]] (as p implies q and q implies p). For the skeptics, such logic was thus an inadequate measure of truth and could create as many problems as it claimed to have solved. Truth was not, however, necessarily unobtainable, but rather an idea which did not yet exist in a pure form. Although skepticism was accused of denying the possibility of truth, in fact it appears to have mainly been a critical school which merely claimed that logicians had not discovered truth.

In [[Islamic philosophy]], skepticism was established by [[Al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111), known in the West as &quot;Algazel&quot;, as part of the orthodox [[Ash'ari]] school of [[Islamic theology]], whose method of skepticism shares many similarities with [[Cartesian_doubt#Descartes.27_method|Descartes' method]].&lt;ref name=Najm&gt;{{citation|title=The Place and Function of Doubt in the Philosophies of Descartes and Al-Ghazali|first=Sami M.|last=Najm|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=16|issue=3–4|date=July–October 1966|pages=133–141|doi=10.2307/1397536|publisher=Philosophy East and West, Vol. 16, No. 3/4|jstor=1397536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Descartes]] is credited for developing a global skepticism as a [[thought experiment]] in his attempt to find absolute certainty on which to base the foundation of his philosophy. Descartes discussed skeptical arguments from [[Dream argument|dreaming]] and [[Demon (thought experiment)|radical deception]]. [[David Hume]] has also been described as a global skeptic. However, Descartes was not ostensibly a skeptic and developed his theory of an absolute certainty to disprove other skeptics who argued that there is no certainty.

Pierre Le Morvan (2011) has distinguished between three broad philosophical approaches to skepticism. The first he calls the &quot;Foil Approach.&quot; According to the latter, skepticism is treated as a problem to be solved, or challenge to be met, or threat to be parried; skepticism's value on this view, insofar as it is deemed to have one, accrues from its role as a foil contrastively illuminating what is required for knowledge and justified belief. The second he calls the &quot;Bypass Approach&quot; according to which skepticism is bypassed as a central concern of epistemology. Le Morvan advocates a third approach—he dubs it the &quot;Health Approach&quot;--that explores when skepticism is healthy and when it is not, or when it is virtuous and when it is vicious.

==Scientific skepticism==
{{Main|Scientific skepticism}}
A scientific (or [[empirical]]) skeptic is one who questions beliefs on the basis of scientific understanding. Most scientists, being scientific skeptics, test the reliability of certain kinds of claims by subjecting them to a systematic investigation using some form of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skeptoid.com/skeptic.php Skeptoid.com]: ''What is skepticism?''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[List of topics characterized as pseudoscience|a number of claims]] are considered &quot;[[pseudoscience]]&quot; if they are found to improperly apply or ignore the fundamental aspects of the scientific method. [[Scientific]] skepticism may discard beliefs pertaining to things outside perceivable observation and thus outside the realm of systematic, [[empirical]] [[falsifiability]]/testability.

==Religious skepticism==
{{Main|Religious skepticism}}
Religious skepticism generally refers to doubting given religious beliefs or claims.  Historically, religious skepticism can be traced back to [[Socrates]], who doubted many religious claims of the time. Modern religious skepticism typically places more emphasis on scientific and historical methods or evidence, with [[Michael Shermer]] writing that it is a process for discovering the truth rather than blanket non-acceptance. For this reason, a religious skeptic may not believe that [[Jesus]] existed, or if he did, that he was not the messiah and did not perform miracles. Religious skepticism is not the same as [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], though these often do involve skeptical attitudes toward religion and philosophical theology (for example, towards divine [[omnipotence]]). Religious people are generally skeptical about claims of other religions, at least when the two denominations conflict in some stated belief.
