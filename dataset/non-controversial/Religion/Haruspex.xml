In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Etruscan civilization#Religion|Etruscan]] religious practice, a '''haruspex''' (plural '''haruspices'''; from [[PIE]] 'gher-, ghor-na' &quot;bowels&quot; (compare [[Latin]] 'hernia', &quot;protruding viscera&quot;, 'hira', &quot;empty gut&quot;) plus '-spex', &quot;observer&quot;, from 'specere') was a person trained to practice a form of [[divination]] called '''haruspicy''', '''hepatoscopy''' or '''hepatomancy'''. Haruspicy is the inspection of the entrails of [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificed animal]]s, especially the [[liver]]s of sacrificed [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[poultry]]. The rites were paralleled by other rites of divination such as the interpretation of [[lightning]] strikes, of the flight of birds ([[augur]]y, [[auspice|auspicy]]), and of other natural [[omen]]s.  

Being a specific form of the general practice of [[extispicy]], haruspicy is not original to Etruscans nor [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Rather, it is now considered to have originated from the [[Near East]] where one would once find [[Hittites]] and [[Babylonia]]ns performing similar rites with [[gastrointestinal tract|entrails]] and producing comparable stylized models of the sheep's liver.

==Babylonian haruspicy==
The Babylonians were famous for [[hepatoscopy]]. The liver was considered the source of the blood and hence the base of life itself. From this belief, the [[Mesopotamia]]ns deemed the liver of special sheep the means to discover the will of the gods. The priest, called a ''bārû'', was specially trained to interpret the &quot;signs&quot; of the liver and a monumental compendium of omens was assembled called the [[Bārûtu]]. The liver was divided into sections with each section representing a particular deity.

The [[Nineveh]] library texts name more than a dozen liver-related terms and before [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] writing was even deciphered, hints of the existence of Babylonian hepatoscopy were recorded in the [[Bible]]. One Babylonian clay model of a sheep's liver, dated between 2050 and 1750 BC, is conserved in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;BM WA 92668.&lt;/ref&gt; The model was used for omen divination which was important to Mesopotamian medicine. This study was carried out by priests and seers who looked for signs in the stars, or in the organs of sacrificed animals, to tell them things about a patient’s illness. Wooden pegs were placed in the holes of the clay tablet to record features found in a sacrificed animal's liver. The priest or seer then used these features to predict the course of a patient's illness.

Haruspicy was part of a larger study of organs for the sake of divination, called ''extispicy'', paying particular attention to the positioning of the organs and their shape. There are many records of different peoples using the liver and spleen of various domestic and wild animals to forecast weather. There are hundreds of ancient architectural objects, labyrinths composed of cobblestones in the northern countries that are considered to be a model of the intestines of the sacrificial animal, i.e. the colon of ruminants.

==Etruscan haruspicy==
The Etruscans were also well known for the practice of divining by the entrails of sheep. A [[bronze]] [[sculpture]] of a liver called the &quot;Piacenza Liver&quot; was discovered in 1877—and dating to c. 100 BC—near the town of [[Piacenza]] in northern [[Italy]], complete with the name of regions marked on it which were assigned to various [[pantheon (gods)|gods]]. It has been connected to the practice of haruspicy. By 1900, a professor of anatomy, [[Ludwig Stieda]], sought to compare this artifact with a Mesopotamian one dated to a millennium earlier.

Etruscan haruspicy probably reached [[Etruria]] via the [[Hittites]],{{cn|date=November 2012}} perhaps because the Etruscans originated in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].{{cn|date=November 2012}}{{dubious|date=November 2012}} The art of haruspicy was taught in the ''Libri Tagetici'', a collection of texts attributed to [[Tages]], a childlike being who figures in [[Etruscan mythology]], and who was discovered in an open field by [[Tarchon]].

==Roman haruspicy==
Haruspicy continued to be practised throughout the history of the [[Roman Empire]]. It was a haruspex, Spurinna, who warned Julius Caesar to beware the Ides of March.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Claudius]] was a student of [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and opened a college to preserve and improve their art, which lasted until the reign of [[Theodosius I]]. Further evidence has been found of haruspices in [[Bath, England]] where the base of a statue was inscribed to honour a [[deity|god]] for a haruspex (Memor).
