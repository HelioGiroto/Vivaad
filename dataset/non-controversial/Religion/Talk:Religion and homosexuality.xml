==Someone should rewrite this==

Hi people, I think someone should rewrite this whole article. I would do it myself, but my English is honestly not good enough. Reasons to rewrite it: 
(1) Reading back all the comments, the article was very subjective from the start. Since then, it has changed a lot, but it still spreads a false message - that nearly every religions are against homosexuality. 
(2) Follows from this that there are quite a little number of citations. And that these citations are not really relevant in the topic or interpreted falsely.
An example. This is a well-known and objective citation from the article: http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/china,5.html And what the article says referred to this citation: 'Among the Taoic religions of East Asia, such as Taoism, passionate homosexual expression is usually discouraged because it is believed to not lead to human fulfillment.' 
My conclusion is that we should be objective here, either we support homosexual people or not. Religions are not subjective scenarios. They are based on books or at least some people wrote books about them, which we should read with an open mind.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Annab88|Annab88]] ([[User talk:Annab88|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Annab88|contribs]]) 07:15, 11 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Undue Weight==

Hello, I read this article, and I thought that the overall message was misleading.  This article is supposed to be about 'Homosexuality and Religion', but instead focuses on Religious intolerance of homosexuality.  Granted, the latter has occurred, but the article then goes onto make broad generalizations of certain religions based on remarks made by a few religious leaders, or by lines of text taken out of religious books which are interpreted by the writer of the article.  I suggest the the writers of this article be more careful about making claims about large populations of people of certain religions without citing some sort of data which confirms this inferrence. 

Another point, I think the article should weigh the quotes and passages in question with the overall message of the religion.  For example, isn't it a little irresponsible to base Christianity's overall intolerance of homosexuals on a few quotes when Jesus' overall message was unconditional acceptance, even of people like criminals?  

This is just something to think about...90% this article analyzes what, at best, can be considered the article writers' interpretations of vague quotes from religous texts, and on the otherhand the only part mentioning religious support for homosexuals is poorly written paragraph with no citations.--[[User:Starchild12345|Starchild12345]] ([[User talk:Starchild12345|talk]]) 05:00, 23 September 2008 (UTC)
:&quot;For example, isn't it a little irresponsible to base Christianity's overall intolerance of homosexuals on a few quotes when Jesus' overall message was unconditional acceptance, even of people like criminals?&quot; - I think you're wrong on this. Jesus always forgave people for their sins and then said &quot;go forth and sin no more.&quot; Someone tempted by homosexual attractions can still choose not to sin.

::He didn't judge people either, but that hasn't stopped his followers from doing so ever since.  The problem is that Wikipedia is about accuracy and NPOV, and religion is about belief which is POV, but belief that is constructed in a way that makes it appear as reality.  So, it is possible to quote the few Biblical injunctions about homosexual practice ad nauseam accurately.  Polemics against homosexual practice are many, but all based on the same few sources.  If there are broad generalisations which do not cite reliable sources, then they are inaccurate abd should be highlighted as such - fact tagging for example - ditto for alternative views, as long as they are not given undue weight and accurately reflect the sources.  [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 06:56, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
:::Actually Jesus did judge people - for example pharisees and money-changers - but his central message was forgiveness for past actions was available for those who were sorry for their past actions. That is not unconditional acceptance as was suggested above - it is very much conditional. Homosexuals who are not sorry for their homosexual behaviour can not be forgiven for that behaviour.

:::Possibly, but that last bit is a POV.  We have no way of knowing this, what we have is that there are sources that claim this.  Just as there are sources that suggest that is an interpretation. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 18:28, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

== LGBT Community and Religion ==

Shouldn't there be information about what Religions the LGBT community typically belong to?--[[User:Occono|Occono]] ([[User talk:Occono|talk]]) 23:01, 1 December 2008 (UTC)

:There are religions that LGBT people typically belong to?  If so, and if you can find sourced information on it, by all means add it.  But I'm not aware of any &quot;typical LGBT&quot; religions.  We're everywhere :) --[[User:Alynna Kasmira|Alynna]] ([[User talk:Alynna Kasmira|talk]]) 23:23, 4 December 2008 (UTC)

I know we're everywhere, but it's all about Religious views on Homosexuality, which to me posits that Gay people aren't Religious if the Religion they were raised with or identify with has a negative view on them. I think there needs to be information about how Gay people in various Religions typically deal with their Faith and Sexual Orientation. (I suppose it sounds like I'm talking about something different now, but I meant there should be info on whether Gay people in an unfriendly branch of Christianity to them move to a friendlier one or what.) And I couldn't add that sort of information, I'm a Humanist.--[[User:Occono|Occono]] ([[User talk:Occono|talk]]) 23:12, 8 December 2008 (UTC)

:Okay, yes, there should be information on how LGBT folks deal with their faith, especially when that faith is traditionally unfriendly to them.  [[LGBT-welcoming church programs]] should be in there, along with stats (I'm sure there are some) on how many people stay with their faith vs. leave (or more nuanced options, such as &quot;find a different group within that faith&quot;).  I'm not sure where to find it either... I'll look.  --[[User:Alynna Kasmira|Alynna]] ([[User talk:Alynna Kasmira|talk]]) 19:15, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

== Additional References Needed for &quot;Religious Support for Homosexuality&quot; Section == 

I've added two references and one specific example of a large denomination explicitly supporting homosexuality (the United Church of Canada) but this section needs many more references. Most of its statements are currently unsupported and the editorial charge of weasel words is, given the current text, a valid one.  Please contribute specific referenced examples from major Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, or other denominations around the world.

== Non-Religious Views of Homosexuality ==

I have been thinking that a section about non-religious views of Homosexuality should be included (Atheist, Secular, etc.) but I'm having trouble tracking down information on the subject, can anyone help? [[User:The Fading Light|The Fading Light]] ([[User talk:The Fading Light|talk]]) 17:55, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

:Why?  it is about religion and homoseuxality - atheism is not religion. What about humanist or communist views? Then it would need to be renamed something like 'views about homosexuality'. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:16, 2 June 2009 (UTC)

==Merge &quot;oppose&quot; and &quot;support&quot; sections into the &quot;specific beliefs&quot; section?==
Most of the content in the &quot;Religious opposition to homosexuality&quot; and &quot;Religious support for homosexuality&quot; sections is beliefs of specific religions.  Would there be any objection to merging it into the appropriate subsections of &quot;Views of specific religious groups&quot;?  What remains could be either merged into &quot;Religious groups and civil rights political activity&quot; or made into a new section. --[[User:Alynna Kasmira|Alynna]] ([[User talk:Alynna Kasmira|talk]]) 19:33, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

== What reference 1 says ==

I changed the sentence &quot;Some teach that claiming homosexual orientation itself is sinful&quot; to &quot;Some teach that homosexual attraction is inherently sinful&quot;.  I did this because 1) The original sentence is confusing and 2) I looked at the reference, and it says that &quot;''The paper distinguishes homosexual attraction from homosexual sexual activity, and equates homosexuality with the attraction rather than the act. By claiming that homosexuality is an unchosen &quot;condition,&quot; rather than a sin of the heart, the author contradicts the teaching of Scripture that both the desire and the act are sin.''&quot;.  This seems to clearly state that the author of the reference considers homosexual attraction to be a sin.  It is also the only appearance of the word &quot;claiming&quot; in the reference.  What is &quot;claiming homosexual orientation&quot;? --[[User:Alynna Kasmira|Alynna]] ([[User talk:Alynna Kasmira|talk]]) 19:09, 13 June 2009 (UTC)
:Hi there. I reverted you because I think you may have misunderstood the reference. The bit you quote is the author of the article actually referring to the claims contained in another article (the paper) - it would therefore be wrong to quote words from this sentence as though they reflected the author's view. About 4 pages into the article (just before a subheading 'documents') it says &quot;She distinguishes between an involuntary orientation (same-sex attraction) and homosexual activity, both of which are sinful.&quot; - This is the sentence from which the claim is made that both those claiming homosexual orientation and those engaging in homosexual activity are sinful.Hope that's helpful. Cheers [[User:Fishiehelper2|Fishiehelper2]] ([[User talk:Fishiehelper2|talk]]) 19:35, 13 June 2009 (UTC)
::'Claiming sexual orientation' would mean identifying as gay.  It is not just the activity that is a sin, but identifying with the activity in the form of cultivating a positive identity that is sinful.  There is grounds in scripture for arguing that an attraction per se is sinful - where attraction is read as desire; but it applies to heterosexuals as much as anybody, and was described in that context.  Extending this to orientation is a synthesis and original research, unless a clear citation can be found that says 'orientation' rather than 'attraction'.

:::It is a very weak link, which cites a paper that refers to a comment by a pastors wife in California.  Is this notable enough for the weight given in the article?  I don't see how, especially as it consists of a report of a comment made on a blog from what I can see.  It does say orientation, but it is still not good enough for the lead [[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 23:27, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

== homosexuality vs homosexual practice ==

This is so you can discuss this.

What was there was 'homosexuality', which got changed to 'homosexual behaviour' and back and forth.  The argument for 'behaviour' is that scripture refers to 'acts'.   So, that would rule out much homosexual behaviour from the list.  For instance - miming to Abba or Freddie Mercury, camp comedians, anything I've seen on [[Will and Grace]].   Of course, there are those who say anything that presents the gay life as 'normal' promotes homosexuality - so that would unclude any behaviour perceived as homosexual, including identifying as gay, having a homosexual identity.  But that is not scriptural.  Behaviour is not neutral.  If the point is 'acts', that does not match up with 'behaviour' - so why not say 'acts'?  as 'homosexual activity'? or 'homosexual practice'?  Or something along those lines... [[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 22:08, 29 June 2009 (UTC)
:Hello - I changed the word 'homosexuality' to 'homosexual behaviour' because the previous paragraph used the 'behaviour phrase' and was clearly consequential to the first - I though it made the article more consistent. I don't agree that 'homosexual behaviour' is open to some interpretation - it is 'sexual behaviour' that is (homo) i.e. 'same-sex'. As for 'the gay life', what is 'the gay life' if it does not involve gay sex? Take out the 'gay' and it is just 'life'. Similarly, the 'heterosexual life' only has meaning with reference to heterosexual sex. My point is that the title of the article itself is wrong since this article should really be about 'religion and homosexual behaviour'. \by the way, I don't understand your point that 'Behaviour is not neutral' - why not?

::I only have to read what you wrote to see why it is not neutral.  If you are referring to sexual behaviour, then specify this.  For instance, two male penguins who bring an egg to hatching abandoned by others, and raise the chick, is seen as homosexual behaviour - but it is not sexual.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/5550488/Homosexual-behaviour-widespread-in-animals-according-to-new-study.html Homosexual behaviour widespread in animals according to new study]  Mum, dad and the kids sitting around the table for Sunday dinner is heterosexual behaviour, but is not sex.  If you mean sexual activity, say sexual activity - but describing people's sexual activity as the sum of their lives is derogatory, which is what is implied in what you are saying.  To you all homosexual behaviour may be sexual activity, but that is your view - the religion may have something about acts, but nothing to say about pairs of male penguins acting as surrogate parents. 23:34, 29 June 2009 (UTC)
:::Sorry if I misunderstand, but I don't see anything radically different between 'behaviour' and 'activity' - I thought 'sexual' was already specified in homoSEXUAL and heteroSEXUAL.

:::::Agreed - the article should not reflect how I see things. But if I can see little difference between 'homosexual behaviour' and 'homosexual activity', I suspect many other readers of this page will see things in a similar way. I am quite happy if you wish to see more clearly set out phrases to avoid confusion. The passages in the bible that deal with homosexuality never use phrases like 'homosexuality' or 'homosexual behaviour' but uses phrases that make clear that 'homosexual sex' is the issue that is unacceptable (passages like &quot;And you shall not have sexual intercourse with a male as with a female&quot; in Leviticus 18.22). [[Special:Contributions/86.150.206.248|86.150.206.248]] ([[User talk:86.150.206.248|talk]]) 16:31, 30 June 2009 (UTC)
:No, actually the Bible does not mention homosexual sex ever.  That is because the concept of homosexuality did not exist prior to 1869/70 (although there was a proto-typical gay subculture in the 18th century, it was not then known as homosexuality, because it was sodomy that prohibited); 'homosexuality' only became current through the shift towards medicalisation of people who habitually engaged in homosexual activity - which began when it was delineated as a form of psycho-sexual pathology in 1869/70).  What it does talk about are examples of sexual activity in a handful of places, mostly in the legal books and Paul's Epistles, and what they tend to refer to is what used to be called 'sodomy'.  Since its decriminalisation, we no longer talk about sodomy, although despite its de-pathologisation we do still talk about homosexuality.  When referring to a few specific acts that are detailed in the legal system developed by a group of desert nomads, which still applied in the religious  culture inhabited by St. Paul, and that persisted for some time after the Reformation (as happened with churching of women after childbirth,[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mikef/bcp1552.html], unlike segregation of menstruating women and eating pork), then it is probably best to be clear about it being (certain) 'homosexual' acts - because homosexual behaviour cannot be substantiated by the archaic sources the prohibitions rely on.  For example.  Two men engaged in a passionate kiss, or as lovers walking along the road hand-in-hand, are aspects of homosexual behaviour; a same-sex couple setting up home together, embarking on a civil union, jointly adopting children, all these are part of homosexual behaviour - and the Bible says nothing about this; it doesn't even discuss the sex that takes place between two women - all it discusses is when two men share a bed together (which is translated in some Bibles as meaning 'sexual intercourse').[[User:MishMich|Mish (just an editor)]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 18:21, 30 June 2009 (UTC)
::Hi. Firstly, you are correct that the bible does not use the phrase homosexual sex since the word homosexual is a relatively recent creation. However, as you rightly point out, the bible does condemn sexual acts that have been called sodomy. (The fact that sodomy is no longer illegal is irrelevant to this discussion.) The three examples you give are all interesting - in the case of 'two men engaged in a passionate kiss', I think the key word is 'passionate' as that would appear to infer a sexual component (a kiss is often a cultural greeting and need not be sexual); 'as lovers walking along the road hand-in-hand' - the key word is 'lovers' as this implies a sexual relationship (again, in many cultures mem will walk hand-in-hand, but there is no sexual aspect to this); 'a same-sex couple setting up home together' - I shared a flat with a fellow male while a student, but we never 'set up home together' as that phrase usually implies a sexual relationship. My point is that I think you are wrong to suggest that 'the Bible says nothing about this' as regards all these three examples as in each case, sexual relations are implied which the bible does comment about. Coming back to the point about trying to find neutral phrases, would you prefer a phrase such as 'same-sex sexual activity' rather than 'homosexual behaviour'? Does that not narrow down the debate better? [[Special:Contributions/86.150.206.248|86.150.206.248]] ([[User talk:86.150.206.248|talk]]) 18:59, 30 June 2009 (UTC)
:::I want to note that the paragraph in question is about churches who accept/welcome homosexuals; those churches would not use the term &quot;homosexual behavior&quot; to describe what the welcome- they'd say that they welcome homosexual people.  It isn't a fair or accurate paragraph if it describes those churches using the language that people who oppose &quot;homosexual behavior&quot; use, especially since this way of describing homosexuality is specific to those churches, and not used by gay-accepting churches, or gay people, or professional psychologists, or anyone other than the religious organizations which are working against gay people.  The term &quot;homosexual behavior&quot; is inherently biased, unless it is used in a paragraph about sex- no one is engaging in &quot;homosexual behavior&quot; or &quot;heterosexual behavior&quot; in church, since both gay and straight, conservative and liberal people, all agree that it is not appropriate to have sexual intercourse during a church service. -[[User:FisherQueen|FisherQueen]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot;&gt; ([[User talk:FisherQueen|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/FisherQueen|contribs]])&lt;/span&gt; 20:00, 30 June 2009 (UTC)
::::Actually. you're wrong - the paragraph in question is not about churches who accept/welcome homosexuals...it is about churches who accept homosexuality.  There is a difference. Almost every church welcomes homosexuals (as sinners in need of forgiveness) in the same way as they welcome heterosexuals (as sinners in need of forgiveness). However, 'accepting homosexuality' is to accept homosexual sex as not being inherently sinful. You are correct that some churches do accept homosexuality in those terms, so I see no problem with saying so.

:::::Again; the distinction you are making is a distinction which is ''only'' made by the people who are opposed to homosexuality, and no one else.  There is no meaningful difference between 'accepting homosexuality' and 'accepting homosexuals,' except to the same people who would divide the two with phrases like 'love the sin but hate the sinner,' but those are not the people that this paragraph is about.  You appear to be trying to add your own [[WP:NPOV|opinion]] on homosexuality into the article, by using a phrase which is inherently biased and which is not in widespread use, but used only by people on one side of this issue.  I cannot think of any reason why you would want to change the term ''except'' for the purpose of adding your opinion to the article.  Changing the term does not make the article better or more accurate; it makes the article more biased and less accurate.

::I'm going to try and look at this from a neutral perspective (I know this is old, but this is really bugging me). It is definitely not hatred to claim that someone should not act on their attractions. The fact is, there is a difference between believing homosexual relations are wrong and treating homosexuals poorly because of their identity. It is simply that only those who oppose homosexuality typically put any focus on this distinction- it is only those who support homosexuality very fiercely, and (not always, but far too often) who are unwilling to tolerate a differing opinion, who try to pretend that there is no difference. To accuse someone of being hateful because they disagree with you is a frightening sort of prejudice in and of itself.

== should title be reversed? ==

Hi all. I added a religious topics box above the LGBT topics box ( to reflect the order of the title) and this was then changed to have the LGBT topics box above the religions topic box. I don't mind, but thought the order should reflect the title of the article. Why not move the article to 'Homosexuality and Religion' if the emphasis is supposed to be from a LGBT perspective?

== Using Wiki biblemanager for refs ==

There has been an attempt to push one or two translations of scripture here, most recently the 'Amplified Bible' (and now Today's NIV).  I have replaced these with links which will allow the reader to select the Bible they prefer.  It is not appropriate to include a reference from a particular translation and highlight in bold that bit which supports a particular POV.  That departs from NPOV.  I could insert a different reference, such as NRSV, which gives a different (and arguably more accurate) translation.  It is better in this introductory paragraph on Abrahamic religions to cite the relevant passages, using the tool which leads to a selection of translations.  These references are all discussed in the relevant sections further below, so better to include citations about the range of meanings and interpretations there.

:I notice the link you give does not lead to the version I happen to prefer (Today's New International Version).

== Jesus makes no reference to homosexuality in the Gospels? ==

This seems like OR. How can you say Jesus didn't reference homosexuality?  He did on several occasions. Homosexuality was addressed when he denounced adultery (Mark 10:19) when he denounced fornication(Mark 7:21) and when he commanded a man to cleave to his wife (Mark 10:19).  Seems like someone's personal opinion rather than fact.  Most Christians agree he addressed homosexuality. Either way, it doesn't belong in the Abrahamic section. If you find someone that has the interpretation that Jesus made no reference to homosexuality, it should be stated as a minority view and kept within the Christianity section. And the no reference to female homosexuality - a command to abstain from fornication should be sufficient for that - but Romans 1:26-27 clearly references female homosexuality. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 00:23, 14 July 2009 (UTC)
: To suggest that adultery is referring to homosexuality is what is [[WP:OR]], as is fornication.  Fornication and adultery are usually taken to refer to heterosexual sex.
* Fornicate - have sexual intercourse with someone one is not married to. [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/fornicate?view=uk]
* Etymology: Late Latin fornicatio, from fornicare to have intercourse with prostitutes, from Latin fornic- fornix arch, vault, brothel: consensual sexual intercourse between a man and esp. single woman who are not married to each other; also : the crime of engaging in fornication. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Fornication]
: The original meaning was ''whoredom'', or ''sex with a prostitute'', and when used in the Bible it often has connections with idolatry (as idolatry is a form of religious ''whoring'').  However, the Greek ''porneia'' (which is what is translated into 'fornication') is a broader word than the Latin root for ''fornication'', or more modern uses; for example, Paul uses it to refer to a quasi-incestuous relationship between a young man and his step-mother.  Again, though, this is a heterosexual relationship, and it is not used in the context of homosexual congress.
* Adultery - voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and a person who is not their spouse. [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/adultery?view=uk]
* conjugal infidelity. An adulterer was a man who had illicit intercourse with a married or a betrothed woman, and such a woman was an adulteress. Intercourse between a married man and an unmarried woman was fornication. Adultery was regarded as a great social wrong, as well as a great sin. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adultery]
: I can see why you might extrapolate that to include sex between people of the same sex, but that is not in the source.  When homosexuality is mentioned, it is done so using specific descriptions that do not give any suggestion that this is adultery or fornication (e.g., ''sodomy'', ''men lying with men'', ''unnatural passions for other men''); the definition makes no mention of things like cunnilingus or fellatio (or sodomy) because the sexual intercourse that takes place is usually taken to mean when a man puts his penis in a vagina.
* Sexual intercourse - sexual contact between individuals involving penetration, especially the insertion of a man’s erect penis into a woman’s vagina culminating in orgasm and the ejaculation of semen. [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/sexualintercourse?view=uk]
: Mark 10:6 to 10:19 is Jesus' teaching on divorce and adultery, and it takes some twisting to make this out to be about homosexuality, especially as Jesus does not discuss two men or two women having sex together (and presumably in discussing divorce in his context he was assuming heterosexual marriage, not gay partnerships).  I understand that you believe that this implies certain things about homosexuality, but your interpretation of this is your opinion.  Ditto for fornication and lesbianism - clearly lesbians cannot fornicate in the sense in which it was defined historically or in modernity.  It was not mentioned, and is you extrapolating a meaning that is not explicit in the text.  The point stands, Jesus said nothing about homosexuality.
: While there is nothing said before St. Paul about lesbianism, I appreciate that one passage can be read this way (not the one you raised), so I have inserted a comment about women engaging in unnatural sex from St.Paul to the Romans, although lesbianism is only implied in the context of what is said about men in the following verse, not stated explicitly.  It doesn't matter whether you think most Christians believe something if it cannot be verified - especially as he did not, if he did, it would be easy to verify, but you can't - whereas I can verify he didn't, because it is not in the Gopsels, and this has been commented upon in several sources, one of which I have now cited.  As this is about religion AND homosexuality, the contention that most Christians mistakenly believe he spoke about homosexuality is not relevant, because there are Christians who do not believe this, some of whom are also LGBT, and they would insist that in an article about them you stick to the sources rather than engaging in [[WP:OR]] and polemic in order to push your own views.
: I would move the section, however, it is intertwined with detail about Judaism and Hebrew scripture, and there was some care taken in ensuring sections of the New Testament were incorporated into this section, and a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{fact}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag placed there which necessitated expansion to show how this featured in reliable sources, as well as your recent deletion of material that necessitated elaboration to show this.  If you want all the Christian material relocated, fine, but only moving the bits you don't like seems a bit biased. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 01:13, 14 July 2009 (UTC)
::I find this confusing - it is being implied that since Jesus made no direct reference to homosexuality that he is accepting it. Yet Jesus made no direct reference to lots of other things, such as incest, pedophilia, bestiality etc - are we suggesting that Jesus was accepting of these things since he didn't mention these? Seems to me that the most we can safely say in the article is that &quot;some people believe that the fact that Jesus didn't directly condemn homosexuality is significant, whereas other disagree pointing out that Jesus also didn't condemn a range of other behaviours.&quot; [[Special:Contributions/86.158.120.73|86.158.120.73]] ([[User talk:86.158.120.73|talk]]) 09:46, 14 July 2009 (UTC)
:::That is incorrect.  Saying that Jesus said nothing about homosexuality says nothing about whether he accepted it or not.  It states a fact.  If you want to find a source that argues that his discussion about divorce and adultery implies that he also included homosexuality, that is up to you, but claiming this without such a source is [[WP:OR]].  The problem is that once you start to insert such sources, it opens up the need to balance such an interpretation with alternative interpretations - and such discussions are best managed in more focused articles than here.  This is why it was a mistake to start adding detailed references to primary sources in this section in the  first place.  Given that links to more detailed treatment of the subject are already included in the section, such discussion is unnecessary IN THIS ARTICLE.  This is not a place to promote one particular understanding of theology and the Bible as if that is neutral, and doing so has opened up the need to insert balancing material.  The fact is he didn't, and if people want to look into that further, the links are available. There is no point re-inventing the wheel here, when the work has been done elsewhere. The reality is we might try to imagine what Jesus' views about homosexuality were, but as he said nothing about it specifically, that is all we are able to do, and we do not rely on the imagination here. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 12:22, 14 July 2009 (UTC)
::::Your argument is that Jesus taught against fornication, but that doesn't apply to gay people because they can't have sexual intercourse with each other?  I think your definition of sexual intercourse is off. Fornication is sexual intercourse between two people who are not married, same-sex couples couldn't get married back then, and sexual intercourse includes penetration, especially involving a penis and a vagina, but not necessarily. Two woman can have penetration with their fingers.&quot;
::::You said &quot;This is not a place to promote one particular understanding of theology and the Bible as if that is neutral&quot;. I'm not the one doing that. You are. If I were to insert the phrase &quot;Jesus taught against homosexuality&quot;, then that would be promoting my own view. I deleted the phrase that Jesus didn't teach against homosexuality, and you are the one that put it back in based on the assumption that gay couples are incapable of having sexual intercourse with each other.  Citing the Latin root doesn't help because Christ didn't speak Latin. You are being hypocritical. You are promoting your own view that Christ taught strict abstinence before marriage and complete fidelity after marriage, but that doesn't apply to gays since they can't have sexual intercourse so they can do whatever they want. Straight men could commit adultery by simply looking at a woman (which doesn't include any penetration by the way), but gay people get down and dirty with whoever and whenever they want of the same sex without committing adultery because they are incapable of sexual intercourse? Not only does it not make any sense, it goes against what most Christians believe. Yes, you can find a lot of people trying to promote that view, but you need to take your own advice and not favor your own view over any other view.
::::The scripture from Mark is more than just divorce - it is a command for a man to get married and then cleave to his wife and become one flesh with her.  For him to cleave to his wife and become one flesh, he can't be having any other sexual relationships, not a prostitute, another woman, a child, his mother, the family dog or even another man. Jesus taught against fornication, and that entails all sexual relationships with someone who is not your spouse - whether it be prostitution, pedophilia, incest, bestiality or even homosexuality.  No sex is no sex - and yes, gay people are capable of having sex with each other.  Again, I'm not saying the majority interpretation needs to go in as fact, I'm just saying your interpretation better not go in as fact. [[User:Joshuajohanson|Joshuajohanson]] ([[User talk:Joshuajohanson|talk]]) 16:42, 14 July 2009 (UTC)
::::: First point.  This is not what I said, so no point discussing with you about something I didn't say.  I don't care if you think the definitions are off, they are what they are.  The point is that Jesus did not discuss homosexuality.  However you want to phrase it, he did not, and whether you read 'adultery' or 'fornication' to refer to homosexuality or not, the fact is he did not, so the statement is accurate and verifiable.
::::: Second point. No, you have the point of view that homosexuality is a form of sexual immorality, therefore when Jesus speaks about some form of sexual immorality he includes homosexuality, which is a view you are entitled to, but it does not mean Jesus discussed homosexuality - only that he discussed sexual immorality (in this case, divorce, adultery and fornication).  That is verifiable.
::::: Third point.  This is all original research using sources synthetically to reflect your POV, and you are welcome to find sources for this to show where this has been argued, but it still does not mean that Jesus spoke about homosexuality per se.  That is indisputable.  You may not like that, but that is how it is.  Even the source that has been added to clarify this makes that perfectly clear.  I am saying nothing about whether he condoned homosexuality or not - simply reporting the sources accurately, which is what we do here.  There is no 'truth' to be had here, only accuracy about what sources say.  Your views (or mine) are not relevant in this, and twisting what I have said does not help either.  I am not insisting on any interpretation - the fact is he said nothing, and that fact is stated without further comment, in the same way as all the relevant scripture passages have been cited just above this without comment.

::::::&quot;Whether you read 'adultery' or 'fornication' to refer to homosexuality or not, the fact is he did not, so the statement is accurate and verifiable.&quot;  How is your reading &quot;fact&quot; and mine &quot;opinion&quot;?  If I say you can't bring fruit into California, and someone tries to bring in an apple, they can't just say the fact is I didn't say anything about apples, and it is only my &quot;opinion&quot; that no fruit implies no apples. Fruits include apples, and fornication includes homosexuality. That is fact, according to your own definition that fornication is to &quot;have sexual intercourse with someone one is not married to.&quot;  Does that mean prostitution isn't fornication, because it has a different name? What about an orgy? Assigning a specific name to homosexuality doesn't make it not a sexual act with someone you are not married to.  You can say what you are saying is &quot;fact&quot; all you want to, and your &quot;fact&quot; is &quot;indisputable&quot;, but that doesn't make it fact.

: Instead of arguing about it, provide a source that shows Jesus discussing homosexuality.  That is all you need to do.  Siker is simply a source which states that Jesus doesn't mention homosexuality, that is all, no more no less, he is not the fact, he describes the fact, that Jesus does not mention homosexuality.  That is all.  It is not that big a big deal.  It is not an interpretation, it is just the way it is.  You are free to think that his talking about other things means he meant homosexuality.

If the Mormon interpretation, or the Catholic interpretation or any other interpretation is undue weight, than so is Jeffrey Sikers.  You asked for a reference, I provided it.

::::Mormonism isn't even considered Christian by most Christians, nor by any mainstream Christian denomination, and is not a member of WCC - so why it should be included in a section about the three Abrahamic religions is not clear to me.  This is a fairly novel interpretation of this passage.  So, to use Mormonism to insert a piece that presents Mormon beliefs as if they are mainstream Christian belief in an extensive passage in a short paragraph is what makes it [[WP:UNDUE]].  All my source is doing is providing a reference to the fact that Jesus does not mention homosexuality, which you seem to have a problem with.  Even the source that was previously inserted, which was not from a reliable source, (but I ignored that) stated that Jesus never said that, and documented why the passage cited about heterosexual activity (marriage and adultery) applied to homosexuality.  Now, the way I left this gave both understandings, i.e., that Jesus did not mention homosexuality in the Bible (which, because you cannot provide a reference to him talking about this), and this the leads into the interpretation that the Matthew and Mark passages include homosexuality.  If you feel you need to expand on that further, then do so in another section, or another article, but not in a way that breaches NPOV.

However, if he insists on including that Christ never mentioned homosexual behavior, in order to be balanced it would need to mention that Christ condemned fornication. Right now it seems as if Christ were silent on sexual relationships between two unmarried people, or as if that were some weird twisting of his teachings on divorce.  It is true that in his teachings against sexual relationships before marriage, he did not make specific mention of the gender of the participants of the sexual relationships.  I would be fine with either completely leaving it out or saying something like &quot;Jesus taught against fornication, but did not directly mention homosexual or heterosexual behavior before marriage.&quot;  Preferably, I would like to see the whole thing removed.

: @YobMod. In relation to your other point, about the excessive detail in the Homosexuality and Christianity section, I had a look at [[History of Christianity and homosexuality#Diverging opinions in modern era]], and this seems to provide a reasonable summary/intro for the main article on [[Homosexuality and Christianity]]:
* Historically, Christian churches have regarded homosexual sex as sinful, based on the Catholic understanding of the natural law and traditional interpretations of certain passages in the Bible. This position is today affirmed by most Christian groups, including the Catholic (1.1 billion members) and Orthodox (250 million members) Churches, part of Protestant denominations, especially among Evangelicals such as the Southern Baptist Convention (16.3 million members), and the LDS Church (13 million members). However, there is a minority who interpret biblical passages differently and argue that homosexuality can be seen as morally acceptable. This approach has been taken by a number of denominations, notably the United Church of Canada (2.8 million members), the liberal congregations within United Church of Christ, the Moravian Church (825,000 members), the Anglican Church of Canada (800,000 members), the Methodist Church of Great Britain (330,000 members), Friends General Conference and Lutheran churches in Europe. A new denomination, the Metropolitan Community Church (40,000 members), has also come into existence specifically to serve the Christian LGBT community. However, individual Christians maintain a variety of beliefs on this subject that may or may not correspond to their official church doctrines. Some mainline Protestant denominations in the United States have also removed language in their bylaws which suggest that homosexuality is a sinful state of being. The Book of Order used by the PCUSA reflects this change. Similar modifications in position can also be seen in the ELCA and Disciples of Christ. Although acceptance of sexually active LGBT laity has increased in terms of actual practice and in terms of church law, some of these denominations continue to limit leadership and clergy roles for LGBT persons.
: Perhaps something along the lines of this brief entry would be better? Then any material that is in currently in the section that is not in the main article could be relocated there.

==Freemasonry and homosexuality==
Freemasonry is not usually classified as a religion, although as a secret society, it is often thought to be a kind of sect.

There is a huge difference between high-ranking and low-ranking initiates, and at the top levels Freemasonry is in fact very close to groups like the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], the [[Rosicrucians]], the [[Great White Brotherhood]] and [[Wicca]].

==Reverted Edits that Removed Referenced Material Supportive of Homosexuality==
I've reverted some recent edits that removed a fairly substantial amount of supportive material that was fully referenced.  While I certainly understand the desire to edit for brevity, removal of fully referenced material that is positive in its view of homosexuality and religions should first be discussed here on this talk page before destructive editing takes place. This is especially the case when the material has not been copied over into another more extensive article (e.g., Christianity and Homosexuality) but instead, merely deleted from Wikipedia entirely.   

Homosexuality and religion is a somewhat controversial topic and existing text should be excised with great care and sensitivity. Even more vigilance is needed when the material to be removed attempts to provide a wider cultural or geographic context (e.g., Africa, Canada, views of black Americans, etc.)  

Discussions of how to achieve brevity and clarity without sacrificing content are always welcomed.

:::It is not sacrificing content, it is keeping it in the articles it is supposed to be in. Christianity should not have a section bigger than every asian or african religion combined, it is a massive WP:Coatrack, and not a help to readers who want to learn about all religions. If people want to write so much about Christianity, they need to go to the [[Homosexuality and Christianity]] article. The removed material is on the talk page there. This is how the sub-article organisation works. No matter how supportive or not, this level of detail is simply inappropriate for a top level article about ''every religion in the world''. (And as a long-standing member of the LGBT project, i clearly didn't disproportionatly remove positive content, i simply removed details from each viewpoint)[[User:Yobmod|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0000CD&quot;&gt;Yob&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]][[User talk:Yobmod|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;CC3399 &quot;&gt;Mod&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]] 19:43, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

:::: It would have been helpful if you had integrated the material removed into [[Homosexuality and Christianity]], rather than merely dumping it on the talk page.  In any event, the paucity of material on, say, Islam, is not for lack of research -- there just isn't much published currently material that can be referenced that is gay positive and Islamic. 

::::As for balance, the material on Christianity now almost exclusively focuses on Roman Catholicism and American protestant churches.  Other than a good list of 20th century theologians, the article now refers to Fred Phelps (American), Jerry Falwell (American), the Church of Latter Day Saints (headquartered in Utah), the United Church of Christ (American), and Gene Robinson (American).  This is American-centric editing at its most blatant.  Surely you must realise that there are Wikipedia readers who want a more global view? I worked hard to obtain material from other countries and cultures and you seem intent on removing it but preserving all US references.  --[[User:Ross Fraser|Ross Fraser]] ([[User talk:Ross Fraser|talk]]) 02:42, 24 July 2009 (UTC)
::::: I have tried to integrate some of the material placed on the talk page of [[Homosexuality and Christianity]].  I am torn between both positions on this, but think YobMod has a point.  There is a section link to the main article.  The problem is that the same six or seven verses from the Old and New Testament, quoted at every opportunity, referenced numerous times, isn't appropriate here.  It is not possible to give all the arguments justice in a summary, beyond that there is a history, there is a view expressed by certain authorities, and there are different positions on this - both as denominations and within all denominations and forms of Christianity.

== Good Guys and  Bad Guys? ==

First, the picture. Though that may be a picture of Christian protesters, putting &quot;Christian Protesters&quot; as part of the caption, quickly changes this article from being &quot;Religion and Homosexuality&quot; to &quot;Christian Acts Against Homosexuals&quot;.

The text in the introduction seems to be a little biased where it says &quot;Current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions generally view homosexuality negatively. This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents&quot;
I don't see how &quot;quietly discouraging homosexual activity&quot;, or &quot;forbidding same-sex sexual practices&quot; at all depicts a negative view of homosexuality.  Perhaps you could say something about &quot;Homosexual activity&quot;, or &quot;practices&quot; but the title of this article is &quot;Religion and Homosexuality&quot; not &quot;Religion and Homosexual Practices&quot;.

Also in the introduction it mentions &quot;Liberal voices within these religions tend to view homosexuality more positively&quot; referring to the previous section where it mentions religions offering assistance to people who do not wish to be homosexual.  Helping someone &quot;avoid homosexual behavior&quot;, is not in anyway viewing homosexuality less positively, however I will agree that the latter example of '...help &quot;people seeking freedom from homosexuality&quot;.' is viewing homosexuality less positively and even negatively.
If any rewording can be done to remove the word &quot;Liberal&quot; from that section, that would also be much appreciated as well.

Those are my complaints for the introduction. Hopefully someone could take this and change not only the introduction, but the rest of the article, to something where religion and homosexuality are not are not presented as good guys and bad guys (not necessarily respectively) but something that describes the relationship between religion and homosexuality.

:I don't agree that the picture turns the article into &quot;Christians acts against homosexuals,&quot; since there are no other pictures of Christians acting against homosexuals, nor is the article focused in that direction.  I'd have no problem with moving the picture further down the page if you have a better picture- surely one of us has a picture of Christian homosexuals doing something photogenic?  I can't think of a phrasing that would be as clear and simple as 'viewing homosexuality negatively' to describe the point of view that homosexuality is something to be avoided; do you have a suggested phrasing you think would be better?  I don't really think that the word 'negative' is an inherently biased one in this context; it seems to be accurate.  I'd be against replacing it with a word like 'bigot' or 'homophobe,' which would be unnecessarily biased. -[[User:FisherQueen|FisherQueen]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot;&gt; ([[User talk:FisherQueen|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/FisherQueen|contribs]])&lt;/span&gt; 09:50, 5 September 2009 (UTC)
:: I agree that the picture needs relocating within the Christian section and balancing with a picture of LGBT Christians, there are two other religions represented in photographs.  Perhaps we could have one of homosexuals being whipped under Sharia Law from somewhere or other? [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 21:31, 5 September 2009 (UTC)
::: Fisher, I would say that saying that homosexuality is something to be avoided would be (somewhat) viewing homosexuality negatively, however what it currently talks about is homosexual practices. What I mean is (in most cases) it is the homosexual acts that are seen negatively, and not homosexuality that is seen negatively. So the phrase &quot;...view homosexuality negatively. This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices...&quot; is talking about two different things, homosexuality, and homosexual activities/practices. Perhaps this part could be rephrased to &quot;Some of the current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions see homosexual behavior negatively, while others view the homosexual orientation itself negatively. This can be seen within quiet discouraging of homosexual activity and explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents, to actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality, and execution.&quot; The next line &quot;Most who are opposed to homosexuality argue that homosexual sexual activity is a sin, not the sexual orientation.&quot; would then be taken out, due to its redundancy. Also its wording is confusing, as it says that people who are opposed to homosexuality are not opposed to the sexual orientation... kind of contradictory. I think that it is fair enough to put the picture further down the page and another picture up in its place. I am kind of reluctant to have a picture of homosexuals being whipped, put up but I suppose that it is something that happens and is related to this article, however it would be nice to see something balancing to that, if there's a picture of homosexuals being whipped, by Muslims, perhaps a picture of homosexuals being helped by Muslims would be nice.

:I think we could have a better picture -- the current one implies that over-the-top protesters at a pride parade are representative of the intersection of religion and homosexuality.
:As far as the lede, I'd argue that discouraging/forbidding &quot;homosexual behaviour&quot; is certainly indicative of a negative view of homosexuality.  Seriously, if you think same-sex attraction and/or sex are bad, how could that be considered anything but a negative view of homosexuality?  It might be true that some groups consider only gay sex sinful, and don't have a problem with celibate gay people, but that's still a negative view of homosexuality -- if they had a neutral or positive view of homosexuality, they would encourage gay sex or treat it the same way they treat straight sex. --[[User:Alynna Kasmira|Alynna]] ([[User talk:Alynna Kasmira|talk]]) 13:08, 6 September 2009 (UTC)
:: It is a difficult call, because what the negative view appears to be about is any expression of homosexuality - not just behaviour.  So, buggery is condemned, but then so is are same-sex relationships, partnerships, marriages, regardless of the sexual activity within them - and in many cases, simply gay or lesbian identification.  It is hard to see how you can distinguish between 'homosexuality' and any expression of homosexual love, simply by reducing this to 'behaviour'. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 17:13, 6 September 2009 (UTC)
:::I also find the distinction between 'homosexuality' and 'homosexual acts' to be incomprehensible in relation to real homosexual people- this is a distinction that only makes sense to straight members of certain religious groups.  Assume that having sex is a 'homosexual act.'  Is kissing a homosexual act?  Is taking care of a sick partner a homosexual act?  Is taking one's turn washing the dishes a homosexual act?  Is saying 'not tonight, dear; I have a headache' a homosexual act?  Would religious groups that oppose 'homosexual acts' oppose a gay person buying flowers for her partner?  Does it matter whether they're roses or daisies?  I'm getting a little silly here, but- the distinction between 'homosexuality' and 'homosexual acts' is one that simply is not used outside a few religious groups, and it's one that many readers would consider to be simply nonsensical.   -[[User:FisherQueen|FisherQueen]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot;&gt; ([[User talk:FisherQueen|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/FisherQueen|contribs]])&lt;/span&gt; 18:24, 6 September 2009 (UTC)
:::: They would be against buying partners flowers, because that implies having a partner, which unless homosexual people are in a heterosexual relationship, is not supportable.  It is not supportable, because of what might happen in the bedroom - those sexual acts.  It all comes back down to sex, and of course, by focusing on the sex, and reducing any partnership (which may involve a romantic gesture like buying one's lesbian partner a padded lumberjack shirt) to sex, the relationship is effectively dehumanised.  Hitler did a similar thing with Jews and images of rats.  In this case it is the mental image of sticking willies up bums that does the job - ironically, even for lesbians, who rarely have a willy anywhere near their bum (strap-ons maybe, depending on the politics and aesthetics of the lesbians involved). [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 02:29, 7 September 2009 (UTC)
Alynna, I agree with you that saying that homosexual attraction is wrong, is discrimatorry towards homosexuals. However then you go on to say that people believe that celibate gay people are not to be viewed poorly but gay sex is. First of all the problem with this is we're analyzing, sex and people. The two are not synonymous and thus can not be compared in this way. If we were to look at people that say that homosexuals who have homosexual intercourse are bad while homosexuals who do not have homosexual intercourse (or intercourse at all) are good then I would say that we have a variable. This being whether or not there is homosexual intercourse. Since celibate homosexuals are seen as good then the argument that homosexuals are seen as bad to these people is invalidated, as there are homosexuals that are seen as good. It has to be that the variable of having or not having homosexual intercourse, is seen as &quot;bad&quot; part.

Fisher, I'm not certain what everyone else says but what I hear from most religions who oppose &quot;homosexual acts&quot;, and what I mean by &quot;homosexual acts&quot; is, homosexual intercourse. Now, yes there are people out there that do oppose homosexuals kissing, taking care of a sick partner, or any of the other potential acts named, however that does not mean that this is a homosexual act. What's more a religion can not be defined by its members, but only by its doctrine (unless its doctrine is its members) and I do not see that &quot;...the worlds largest religions&quot; (as mentioned in the article)for the most part, have doctrines against anything but homosexual acts.

Mish, I'd like you to clear up what you said because you're kind of contridicting yourself there. However if you don't mind I'm going to use it to my advantage. You said that reducing a relationship to sex is dehumanizing the relationship, however you also said that buying a partner flowers implies sex in the minds of the people who are &quot;viewing homosexuality negatively&quot;. However in the article itself, it says &quot;Most who are opposed to homosexuality argue that homosexual sexual activity is a sin, not the sexual orientation.&quot; and while I stated before that I don't like the wording to that sentence, the initial message stands true. Now if we view &quot;homosexual activity&quot; as homosexual intercourse, then the article essentially states that nobody really cares if flowers are bought. Furthermore, heterosexuals buy flowers for their partners all the time, and this rarely specifically means sexual activity.
As you can see the fact that the argument is out there that it is believed that homosexual activity is different than homosexuality, I believe that it needs to be incorporated into the article somewhere at the least, if not being the reason for rewording many of the sentences in the article.
[[User:EMSchmittgen|EMSchmittgen]] ([[User talk:EMSchmittgen|talk]]) 04:17, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
:: No contradiction there at all.  It is not only the sexual act, it is also the relationship, and the sexuality includes relationships.  Same for heterosexuality, it includes relationships as well as sexual acts.  Restricting homosexuality to homosexual acts is defamatory, as it is about more than sexual acts.  Stating that opposition is against sexual acts and not homosexual attraction is incorrect because it is incomplete.  Opposition is against sexual activity, sexual relationships (including committed partnerships), and yet somehow states it is not opposed to the attraction (despite often promoting therapies to change that attraction from homosexuality).  OK?  Get it?  If we had an article [[Religion and heterosexuality]], would we say that promotion of heterosexuality involves affirming heterosexual sex, but not the attraction, and yet omit the point that heterosexual relationships (such as marriage) is part of that affirmation?  The relationship in both cases is more significant than the act or the attraction, yet this is ignored in the case of our coverage of homosexuality, instead foucsing on sex, and yet the with heterosexuality we focus on the relationship, ignoring the sex.  That suggests a bias in the way we cover these things. [[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 08:24, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

I began tagging unsourced material, then I found an article tag applied in a section from 2007.

# POVvy statements, such as the usual bias phrase &quot;In accordance with the traditional values&quot;, the initial paragraph then claims &quot;Christian denominations accepts homosexuals&quot; and then goes on to explain that they don't accept &quot;homosexual acts&quot;, which is clearly biased in favor of that kind of Christian bigottery on the loss of the homosexuals – what does it mean? ''&quot;We're not going to excommunicate you if you abstain from being homosexuals&quot;'' or?

Just... needs a lot of attention. &quot;Some texts in Jainism have depicted of Eunuchs are born with genetic defects or due to social pressure.&quot; -- one of many examples of really bad grammar.

==Child prostitution==
The section '''Buddhism''' starts: &quot;Asian societies shaped by Buddhist traditions take a strong ethical stand in human affairs and sexual behavior in particular. However, unlike most other world religions, most variations of Buddhism do not go into details as to what is right and what is wrong in what it regards as mundane activities of life.&quot;  Anybody who has read the Buddha's teachings in Pali knows that the second sentence is untrue and that is why the author has not verified it with a citation. As regards the first sentence it may be noted that Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, Vietnam and India have the worst incidence of child prostitution in the world. United Nations and other human rights groups have conducted studies which show that at least one third of prostitutes in these countries are children. In India and Thailand an estimated 40% of prostitutes are children. Can it therefore be asserted that 'Asian societies shaped by Buddhist traditions take a strong ethical stand with regard to sexual behaviour in particular'?

==Jesus and Homosexuality==
Recently I attempted to make the following edit to the last paragraph in the Christianity section.

Some Protestant churches condemn same-sex sexual relations based on the teachings of Jesus[31] and scripture texts that describe a man lying with another man 18:22 as a sinful act.ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bpnews.net/BPFirstPerson.asp?ID=38461|title=Is it true Jesus never addressed same-sex marriage|last=Akin|first=Daniel|date=2012-8-9|publisher=Baptist Press|accessdate=2012-8-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

http://www.bpnews.net/BPFirstPerson.asp?ID=38461

The author of the article is [[Daniel Akin]] who is the president of [[Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary]] and prominent leader in the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].  What made this article interesting was its emphasis on applying the teachings of Jesus to same-sex marriage.  Many have argued that Jesus had nothing to say about the matter.  I thought that wiki readers might be interested in hearing Daniel Akins tradition Christian interpretation on this matter.

While I appreciate Dominus doing what he believes best, I would like to appeal his removal of my edit.
