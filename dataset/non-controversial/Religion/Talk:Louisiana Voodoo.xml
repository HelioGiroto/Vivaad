==Merge==
I think that this page ought to be merged with the &quot;Voodoo&quot; page. That page already covers the voodoo folk beliefs of the southern U.S.

==Hoodoo==
Actually, hoodoo (not capitalized) is the system of earth magic which corresponds with the religion of Voodoo, which may or may not be practiced in concert with Voodoo. It is a combination of African, Native American &amp; European earth magic. Hoodoo employs the use &amp; of ethno-botany, (the knowledge and use of herbs &amp; roots native to particular cultures) and many other factors, such as &quot;gris-gris&quot; or mojo bags, candles, saints &amp; charms. It is hoodoo, when the service to the lwa is not employed, Voodoo, when it is.

==Official Catholic Teaching- Response to &quot;Catholic Reaction&quot; (above) and Fainites==
I am confused as to the reason my edit has been repeatedly reverted. This Wikipedia article implies and/or states in multiple areas that Voodoo teaching/belief and Catholic teaching belief are not in conflict, when they most certainly are. This is from an entirely objective point of view, stating only what the official documents of the Catholic Church state. If anyone doubts the validity of the Catechism of the Catholic Church or the representative nature of its content in relation to the Church's official stance, please voice such concerns.

If it is simply a matter of form or of placement in the article, please voice those concerns as well. It is simply unreasonable to leave such a glaring misrepresentation of the Catholic Church's stance on various practices uncorrected. It would be a disservice to the Wikipedia community and all of its readers to misinform them in such a way.

As for the second edit I made to the Voodoo Queens section, once this first issue has been resolved, it should fall into place. Obviously, anyone who practiced multiple things which are publicly condemned by official Church teaching could not be canonized. Only the most exemplary examples of both orthodoxy and love are even considered for canonization. Since Marie Laveau does not fulfill the requirements of the former, she cannot be canonized.

I hope this clears things up and moves us forward.

[[User:Divineofficer|Divineofficer]] ([[User talk:Divineofficer|talk]]) 19:42, 29 December 2010 (UTC)

:Splendid! This is what you need to do Divineofficer. Start talking on the talkpage. Meanwhile - please stop reverting other editors as clearly you do not have consensus. Please state here - with sources - what you want to add. It may be of course that the RC Church's ''official'' position is somewhat different to what happens on the ground and both aspects can be incorporated.[[User:Fainites|Fainites]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Fainites|barley]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Fainites|&lt;small&gt;scribs&lt;/small&gt;]] 23:56, 29 December 2010 (UTC)

OK Fainites (and all), here is what I state... with sources, as you request... that I want to add. This addition is intended with the full awareness that official Catholic Church teaching and the practice thereof by some purported members of aforementioned faith group are at odds with one another in many cases. Now, moving forward:

=== Official Catholic Church Teaching on the Types of Practices Incorporated Into Voodoo ===
While many followers of voodoo may purport to practice Catholicism, this does not mean that the Catholic Church's official teaching condones the practices of voodoo. The following is an excerpt from an official Catholic document called the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]. It puts forth several teachings which show that the Catholic Church's official beliefs and those of voodoo are vastly different and, unfortunately, incompatible. For example,

:''&quot;All forms of divination are to be rejected... conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to 'unveil' the future.''
:''Consulting [[Horoscopes|horoscopes]], [[Astrology|astrology]], [[Palmistry|palm reading]], interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]], and recourse to [[Mediumship|mediums]]'' ''all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden'' ''powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and loving fear that we owe to God alone.''

:''All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a'' ''supernatural power over others- even if this were for the sake of restoring their health- are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion.'' ''These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they have recourse to the'' ''intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. Spiritism often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her'' ''part warns the faithful against it. Recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the'' ''exploitation of another's credulity&quot; (CCC 2116-2117).'' &lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Conference | first = United States Catholic | year = 1994 | title = Catechism of the Catholic Church- Second Edition | publisher = Libreria Editrice Vaticana | pages = 513-514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, one must consider that several of the previous statements made in this article regarding the amicable relationship between the practice of voodoo and [[Catholicism|Catholicism]], while perhaps in good faith, must be called into question, since they are untrue according to [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] official stance.

---END ADDITION---

Notice the use of sources and that what is said in the addition is an objective statement of fact meant to clarify that voodoo and Catholicism as an official entity (not as a practice-as-you-choose system) are not exactly a harmonious pair of belief systems. This &quot;amicable&quot; relationship was implied by the wording and content of the article as it stands now (without the addition I have tried to make), and it is plainly false according to the Catholic Church's stance.

If there are any questions or clarifications that you require, please let me know. If there is a better way to present the information without losing the obvious point that voodoo and practice of true Catholicism cannot co-exist, please let me know. This clarification is not meant to be any form of hate speech or exclusion-focused rhetoric; rather, it is meant to correct a glaring error in the current state of the article.

Now, from a purely factual, reasonable, source-driven point of view, are there any objections to this addition?

To make it easier to validate the veracity of the previous assertions, here is the link to the (specific quoted sections of the) Catechism of the Catholic Church from the Vatican website: http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm

===Point-by-Point Comparison of Voodoo Practices and Catholic Teaching on Said Practices===
Current Article: &quot;... the ritual creation of charms and amulets, intended to protect oneself or harm others, became key elements of Louisiana Voodoo.&quot;

Catholic Teaching: &quot;All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a supernatural power over others- ''even if this were for the sake of restoring their health''- are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. ''These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone''...''Wearing charms'' [and, by logical extension, making charms] ''is also reprehensible''...&quot; (Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 2117).

Current Article: &quot;The administrator of the ritual frequently evoked protection from Allah, the Christian God, and Jesus Christ.&quot;

&quot;The gris-gris is then performed from one of four categories: love; power and domination; luck and finance; and uncrossing.&quot; (from the voodoo superstitions and spells section)

Catholic Teaching: &quot;[In witchcraft]... supernatural aid is usually invoked either to compass the death of some obnoxious person, ''or to awaken the passion of love in those who are the objects of desire, or to call up the dead, or to bring calamity or impotence upon enemies, rivals, and fancied oppressors''. This is not an exhaustive enumeration, but these represent some of the principal purposes that witchcraft has been made to serve at nearly all periods of the world's history.

In the traditional belief... the witches or wizards addicted to such practices entered into a compact with Satan, ''adjured'' [which means called upon] ''Christ and the Sacraments'', observed &quot;the witches' sabbath&quot;—performing infernal rites which often took the shape of a parody of the Mass or the offices of the Church...&quot; Thurston, Herbert. &quot;Witchcraft.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 29 Dec. 2010 &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm&gt;.

To read the article, go to: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm

Anyone who has read this article can see the similarities between the practices of witchcraft (as put forth in the Catholic Encyclopedia) and voodoo.

Current Article: &quot;She acted as an oracle, conducted private rituals behind her cottage on St. Ann Street of the New Orleans French Quarter...&quot;

According to the World English Dictionary, an oracle is &quot;a prophecy, often obscure or allegorical, revealed through the medium of a priest or priestess at the shrine of a god&quot; OR &quot;any person or thing believed to indicate future action with infallible authority&quot;

Catholic Teaching: &quot;All forms of divination are to be rejected... conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to 'unveil' the future&quot; (CCC 2116).

Current Article: &quot;...[Marie Laveau] performed exorcisms...&quot;

Catholic Teaching: &quot;…it is only priests who are authorized to use the exorcising power conferred by ordination… called upon to perform his duty as exorcist… [the priest] is to be mindful of the prescriptions of the Roman Ritual and of the laws of provincial or diocesan synods, which for most part require that the bishop should be consulted and his authorization obtained before exorcism is attempted.&quot;
Toner, Patrick. &quot;Exorcist.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 29 Dec. 2010 &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05711a.htm&gt;.

There are more objections that legitimate, orthodox Catholic teaching can make to the practices inherent to voodoo. If more are needed to convince people that the association between the Catholic Church as an official organization/belief system and voodoo is weak and unfounded, then I can produce them. I am simply trying to indicate the extent to which this article is misleading.

::Thanks Divineofficer. What you have here is what is called [[WP:OR|original research]]. In other words - you have taken a primary source (Catholic Church writings) and said they are incompatible with voodoo. This is original research. What you need to do is find a ''secondary source'', ie some book or paper that covers the subject of the interelationship between catholicism and voodoo, and use that as a source. Also - 12 hours is not reasonable. People are editing from different timezones.

My apologies Fainites... I thought at least one person could respond within 12 hours. Fortunately, you did!

===Secondary Resources===
Here are a series of secondary sources that validate my stated standpoint on the less-than-harmonious relationship between Catholicism and voodoo as a whole:

&quot;The church has long struggled against the role of voodoo in Haitian society, which Haitians have used as a means of establishing their identity. In 1941 church and state together attempted finally to destroy the voodoo temples. Every baptized person had to take a vow to renounce the practices and teachings of voodoo, which was condemned as a Satanic cult. Papa Doc Duvalier, however, who was close to voodoo, ended the persecution and used voodoo as a political instrument.

When John Paul II visited Haiti in 1983, he encouraged the official church to oppose the brutal regime of Duvalier.&quot;

Fahlbusch, Erwin. The Encyclopedia of Christianity. Volume 2. Michigan: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999.

Find the Google Books preview here (page 496): http://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;pg=PA496&amp;lpg=PA496&amp;dq=Bishop+Gayot+on+voodoo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fy3VRLsWGB&amp;sig=qqcC_qKyPq7aN0HbxD8y6blvrwo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nL8cTbetHo26sAPw_dHoAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bishop%20Gayot%20on%20voodoo&amp;f=false

&quot;In Haiti, the Church has sought out cultural elements and utilized them in the liturgy, in catechesis and in pastoral activity in general. Nevertheless, the Church must be vigilant, especially with regard to voodoo which is not a valid, complete response to the profound aspirations of man and which most often engenders fear, division and vengeance.

There is much propaganda today in favor of voodoo. Voodoo certainly conveys very rich cultural elements. However, cultural elements and voodoo beliefs must not be confused as if they were the same thing. A musical instrument, a musical rhythm, is neutral in itself. The identity of Haitian people does not necessarily express itself in voodoo.&quot;
Constant, H. Exc. Rev. Msgr. Emmanuel, Bishop of Les Gonaïves. Synodus Episcoporum Bulletin. Holy See Press Office, 1997.

Here is the link to this article/publication: http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/sinodo/documents/bollettino_17_speciale-america-1997/02_inglese/b20_02.html

Also, keep in mind that, although this specifically addresses Haitian voodoo, this in no way negates the Church's long-standing stance that voodoo as a whole is problematic and unfit for Catholics or other Christians to practice.

&quot;Voodoo involves the worship of spirits and occult practices such as divination (fortunetelling) and sorcery. These practices are strongly condemned by God throughout the Bible, such as in Deuteronomy 18:9-13, where God forbids consulting anyone who practices 'divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead' (also see Leviticus 19:26, 31, 20:6; 2 Kings 17:17; Acts 19:18-19; Revelation 21:8, 22:15).&quot;

Is this a sufficient enough amount of evidence?

::The first looks like a suitable source on Haitian Voodoo. The second may be a source as to what the Church says on various points. The third doesn't look suitable at all. It's not a question of &quot;evidence&quot; but [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and as such relies mostly on notable and reliable secondary sources - not interpretation of primary material. To Wikipedia the Bible is simply one of many religious texts in existence. That is why an entry from a suitable source about RC efforts to combat voodoo in Haiti is appropriate but direct quotes from the Bible are not - unless they too emanate from a notable secondary source dealing with this point. The last site does this but it is a site interpreting the Bible.[[User:Fainites|Fainites]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Fainites|barley]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Fainites|&lt;small&gt;scribs&lt;/small&gt;]] 23:04, 30 December 2010 (UTC)

== Misleading Information ==
Hello,
I have to agree with DivineOfficer. I ask that he be allowed to make his changes, or at least that the offending sentences be removed. As a Catholic, I merely wish to remove any statements that may lead readers to infer that the Catholic Church agrees with all Voodoo practices.
Before reading this talk page, I made 2 modifications. The article used to state that Marie was a &quot;devout Catholic.&quot; After reviewing the given source (the Skeptical Inquirer), however, I did not see this information. The only sentence that was close stated that &quot;She won the approval of the local priest by encouraging her followers to attend mass.&quot; I think the wrong source is being cited here.
Many thanks for the understanding,
[[User:Respongen|Respongen]] ([[User talk:Respongen|talk]]) 10:05, 20 January 2011 (UTC)Respongen

==Further misleading information==
Various details in this article are sourced to an article in the Salt Lake Tribune, which is evidently not available online. Since the matter was raised in the above matter of whether Catholicism and Voodoo are at odds, and whether this is verifiable according to primary sources, I should point out that newspapers are also often considered primary sources and are not guarantors of fact. A newspaper, in other words, is not peer-reviewed, and simply because a detail was listed in an article, once, does not mean that it is a verified truth. DivineOfficer above has raised important points but since they do not fit consensus it has been determined that they cannot be included in this article. As a result, it seems that he has given up his efforts, and the matter has been allowed to rest. However, the facts regarding Catholicism are also insufficiently verified by reliable sources, as this entire debate falls to matters of opinion and perspective, something that this article should reflect. In other words, since it is debatable whether Catholicism is on entirely friendly terms with Voodoo, and this article leads one to believe hands-down that they '''are''' on friendly terms, the article is one-sided and incomplete. As it stands, it is most certainly misleading, because a casual reader who takes Wikipedia articles for granted will come away thinking that Voodoo is somehow an orthodox subcategory of Roman Catholicism. The simple fact that someone has uploaded the information at some point in the article's history is insufficient to keep it here. If these facts are verifiable from '''reliable''' secondary sources, i.e., something other than an inaccessible newspaper article from Salt Lake City from an unlisted date, then we have another fix to make: correct all the relevant citations to reflect the details they are supposed to support.

So, here's one basic problem, which we can't elaborate on because I do not have access to the Salt Lake Tribune source: who is leading this &quot;strong movement to have [Marie Laveau] canonized&quot;? Are they Catholics, seeking canonization within the Catholic Church? Or is this a movement entirely within the Voodoo community? As stated, one would think the Catholic Church, if only because when one thinks of &quot;canonization&quot; one generally refers to that context. Is there a form of canonization within Voodoo? How many people make this &quot;strong movement&quot;?

==Number of Followers==
Are there any estimates of the number of voodoo practicioners in the United States, Haiti, and other areas? Maybe some people have listed voodoo on their Census forms. When I saw Marie Laveaux's grave in 1990 there appeared to be a fair number of people who had been there recently, and there were also those who believed that she was entombed not in her marked tomb, but other nearby tombs. Marks and trinkets were left at those locations as well. As for the voodoo vs. catholicism debate, I think church leaders really, really hate it, like a gardener hates weeds. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.191.247.254|71.191.247.254]] ([[User talk:71.191.247.254|talk]]) 18:12, 2 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
