==Article expansion==
This article could be expanded:

*African roots of the musical form (call and response, blue notes, etc.)
*Role of the Jubilee Singers in spreading spirituals internationally, and their reception by the public.  Importance of the music in keeping Fisk University afloat.
*Early recordings.
*Popularization of spirituals by Mahalia Jackson and Leontyne Price.
*Spiritual form as precursor to gospel.  [[User:Deeceevoice|deeceevoice]] 12:43, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
:Agree, and more details about choral arrangements by such composers as [[Moses Hogan]] could be added. I suggest changing the heading of the second section from &quot;Evolution of...&quot; to &quot;Choral arrangements of...&quot;.
:Also, the definition line should refer to black [[History of slavery in the United States|American slaves]], not African-Americans in general. &amp;mdash;[[User:Wahoofive|Wahoofive]] ([[User talk:Wahoofive|talk]]) 17:17, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I really need to find a certain spiritual song, but I am not sure of the lyrics; it has one person singing (almost a cappella) and other people 'answering' him, and part of the lyrics are something like:

Oh help me Lord (help me Lord)
Cause I'm in need (I'm in need)

it was part of a rap song recently, but I don't know the name of that, either.  Any help would be...ummm...helpful.  Yes, I have tried Google. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:172.163.26.189|172.163.26.189]] ([[User talk:172.163.26.189|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/172.163.26.189|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

The rapper [[K-os]] has a spiritual as a component to the song &quot;Valhalla&quot; but I doubt that's who you mean.  His song does not have that lyric.  He has two albums which I have not heard, which could have that song.  Good luck.


----------
I need the lyrics to the spiritual Come and See!  I'm performing an organ piece by that name, which lists the composer as &quot;Spiritual.&quot;  BUT I cannot find words anywhere.  I've searched all I know to search. 01:52, 30 July 2006 (UTC)joyc7578@starband.net

Isn't there too much historical background in this article? 
[[User:68.197.174.49|68.197.174.49]] 02:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

What do you mean?  Too much background for a musical genre?  Or too much background for a historical phenomenon?  Music like this is very particularly understood as tied to historical background, so separating it is a grave injustice to the genre.

Not more than a month ago, this article referred to the most &quot;authentic&quot; spirituals deriving from &quot;the black keys&quot; or as someone above may have been referring to, &quot;blue notes&quot; (is that what you meant i.e. black keys = black keys of the piano ...?).  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.235.57.95|66.235.57.95]] ([[User talk:66.235.57.95|talk]]) 11:01, 13 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Oops.  It seems these comments still persist and have always been located int he &quot;Samples&quot; section... not that they belonge dthere... peace out.

== when did spirituals start? ==

The spirituals that we know today, are they all from the 19th century or later? [[User:Jonathan Tweet|Jonathan Tweet]] 02:57, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
:No one wrote any spirituals down until after 1865 -- they were an exclusively oral tradition before that -- so there's no certainty of how early they started. Some analysts claim to have found elements of African music in them, which slaves might have brought over with them. &amp;mdash;[[User:Wahoofive|Wahoofive]] ([[User talk:Wahoofive|talk]]) 06:55, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

== What about secret codes? ==

Out of curiosity, why aren't the African secret codes mentioned in this article?  During the time of the underground railroad, slaves that wanted to escape to the North used these &quot;spirituals&quot; to give directions and advice to other slaves.  &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; could be changed into one of these easily (I was taught this in college) with inferences to direction, when the chariot was going to come, where it was going, and what time to meet in order to jump on it and head for the North.  Am I the only one who was taught that?
:I think most of the &quot;secret codes&quot; people have attributed to spirituals are mostly projection and wishful thinking. I don't think there's any solid evidence that these songs were used in this way. While there's no reason we can't mention such legends in Wikipedia (as long as they're indicated that way), I don't think it's essential. &lt;small&gt;unsigned comment by [[User:Tarkaan]]&lt;/small&gt;
:Furthermore, they are mentioned. You didn't read the article completely. &amp;mdash;[[User:Wahoofive|Wahoofive]] ([[User talk:Wahoofive|talk]]) 20:55, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with that at all. It’s not like people wrote down the meanings of their songs; if there were a coded message on escape from slavery, the last thing they would want to do would be to record them and risk being discovered. Indeed, it was forbidden by law to teach slaves to read and write! There is no “wishful thinking” here— absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. [[User:Rambam rashi|Rambam rashi]] ([[User talk:Rambam rashi|talk]]) 23:28, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

:OK, but of course in a Wiki article, both sides of a controversy must be presented, and the implication that coded messages are a figment of modern imagination is sourced in the article from a [[WP:RS]], and that must stay in the article. [[User:Sensei48|Sensei48]] ([[User talk:Sensei48|talk]]) 08:18, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

I was taught about these secret codes in school, i'm not sure if they are true, but in my university studies of Australian/Pacific Islander History (and particularly in regards to slavery) we were taught that primary sources are a very western concept since normally only those in power have the ability to keep/define records.  Given the circumstances (secrecy, oppression) the lack of primary records should not be accepted as concrete proof this was not true, on the other hand verbal accounts passed down to the ancestors of these slaves should settle this matter one way or the other.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.32.131.200|110.32.131.200]] ([[User talk:110.32.131.200|talk]]) 00:03, 8 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== American European ? ==
I think the introductory language is a little confusing.  Is the article about Spirituals in all Eurpopean colonies in the Americas or onlyc those colonies that ultimately became part of what is now the USA ?  Slavery ended in different parts of the Americas over a long period.  I think it is possible that the article is really about spirituals in the ante-bellum Southern United States =.  That would be the implication of using the 13th amendment as an end point.

I don't know how to fix this but there is a clear problem.  In the introduction we seem to be talking about the Americas (i.e. European colonies), but I think 1619 would be the date for English colonies, but not Spanish, Portugese or French. or Danish.  Clearly the ending date is restricted to some of the states of the United States (most of which were part of the CSA )The content seems to be limited to the United States.  

I don't know how to fix this.  The easiest thing at this point might be to make it clear that we are discussin a much more restricted period and place.  Conceivably something equivalent to spirituals was happening in Brazil or maybe not.

Hope that others can weigh in on this.  It's a very important topic.

[[User:Peter Reilly|Peter Reilly]] ([[User talk:Peter Reilly|talk]]) 16:58, 27 December 2007 (UTC)


Very good point.  I never thought about 'spirituals' an anything outside the U.S.  But surely the phenomenon was not limited to the U.S. any more than slavery was.  How to address this?..  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.235.57.95|66.235.57.95]] ([[User talk:66.235.57.95|talk]]) 10:57, 13 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:While of course, songs with spiritual lyrics are common worldwide, the term &quot;spiritual&quot; in this context refers to a very specific genre of music. If there is something relevant to say about something called &quot;spirituals&quot; in Brazil or wherever, then there should be a separate article on that topic. Any hypothetical Brazilian genre called &quot;spirituals&quot; does not necessarily have anything to do with &quot;spirituals&quot; in the sense meant in this article. [[User:TUF-KAT|Tuf-Kat]] ([[User talk:TUF-KAT|talk]]) 01:15, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

==American/European==

My suggestion is not to expand the article to cover other regions and time, but rather to mske it clear that what is being discussed is somehwat restricted in time and place.  It would also be good to figure out some better lanuage.  I really hate &quot;de-Africanize the captive Black workforce&quot; but don't have a ready substitute.  Also &quot;captive Africans&quot; is probably not an apt description of someone who's parents and grandparents were born in Virginia.  Referring to people as a &quot;labor force&quot; besides being possibly dehumanizing isn't even that accurate from the purported viewpoint of the master class.

== &quot;Code&quot;Section removed. ==
The entire code section has been removed. It was based entirely on one guy's blog, exhorting the 'yes they were codes' meme with no ground to stand on. At the end was a one sentence 'no, not true', grudgingly written, but traced to a published researcher who actually counts as [[WP:RS]], where the blog does not. As such, it fails [[WP:WEIGHT]] in such a way that there's no point in restoring any of it, since it's just not true. [[User:ThuranX|ThuranX]] ([[User talk:ThuranX|talk]]) 15:44, 26 August 2008 (UTC)

:Good. Although there are undoubtedly published sources (more reliable than a blog) which discuss the codes, the evidence for them seems pretty nonexistent, more like backwards projection, so I'm glad it's gone. &amp;mdash;[[User:Wahoofive|Wahoofive]] ([[User talk:Wahoofive|talk]]) 02:03, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

I would like to see the code section restored and plan to make some edits to do just that. There are widespread claims of coded messages. This entry should challenge myths, not simply refuse to mention them. [[User:Jk180|Jk180]] ([[User talk:Jk180|talk]]) 20:09, 2 September 2008 (UTC)jk180

While myths can be entertaining and make us feel good about ourselves, in a reference source such as Wikipedia they need to be challenged. Ignoring them isn't enough, particularly if they are very popular and widely accepted as fact. I've restored a brief section on codes that is supported by two researched sources. [[User:Jk180|Jk180]] ([[User talk:Jk180|talk]]) 16:23, 17 September 2008 (UTC)jk180

::An important consideration, apparently absent here, is that of Wiki [[WP:CONTROVERSY]], which requires that in the event of a disagreement on a point such as whether or not codes existed, both sides need to be presented equally and dispassionately. Hence, a major problem exists with the last sentence of this section - 

::''These claims, as popular as they are, do not hold up to reasoned and informed inquiry; for example, the sources provide no firsthand evidence of the use of coded songs or distort the firsthand accounts that are available (e.g. Frederick Douglass) in order to support their claims.[10] [11]''

::- because  a)it is dismissive (&quot;reasoned and informed inquiry&quot;? - classic POV),  b)trying to create a general point from a statement that starts &quot;for example,&quot; violating [[WP:OR]], and c) basing the point on a single published source on one song (note 10) and an internet source which has not yet listed its own sources and which presents a considerable amount of evidence to the contrary of this assertion (note 11). I am therefore re-writing the sentence to more NPOV while leaving in the references. [[User:Sensei48|Sensei48]] ([[User talk:Sensei48|talk]]) 02:22, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

::: This whole article needs to be sourced more effectively, not simply the code section. There are virtually no references here for an absolute host of POV or OR statements in each section. Consistency of perspective would help as well - the section immediately preceding the &quot;code section&quot; about biblical references alludes to coding, though it simply does not employ that term - and a healthy dose of logic wouldn't hurt either - the lack of primary sources for nearly any topic related to spirituals results from the self-evident point of the illiteracy of the slaves who composed the songs but were unable to write them down or provide a neat little paper trail regarding their meanings. Much needs to be done here.[[User:Sensei48|Sensei48]] ([[User talk:Sensei48|talk]]) 05:13, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

::::And finally for today - I would hardly call the Spirituals Project at the Center For Teaching and Learning at the University of Denver here [http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/History] either a blog or an unreliable source - the articles in virtually every category on this site are heavily and academically annotated, and they tend toward the acceptance of the existence of codes. At the very least, this confirms the existence of controversy and is a far cry from the accusation that there exists no &quot;reasoned and informed inquiry&quot; on the topic.[[User:Sensei48|Sensei48]] ([[User talk:Sensei48|talk]]) 06:47, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

:I understand Sensei48's point about how Wikipedia seeks to handle controversial topics, but I don't see the claim of coded messages in slave songs as part of a real controversy that requires equal and neutral discussion of all sides. It seems to me to be, in Clarence E. Walker's terms, a &quot;therapeutic mythology&quot; -- and a widely spread one, at that. The section certainly can be improved and expanded, but solid sources need to be used. I reviewed all of the Spirituals Project at the Center For Teaching and Learning at the University of Denver  [http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/History] -- -- and did not find any supported references for the coded message thesis. The closest I found was a simple assertion in one sentence (with no supporting citations) that the songs &quot;also reflected deep longings for freedom, often masked in the form of secret codes or messages imbedded in the lyrics of the songs&quot; (http://ctl.du.edu/spirituals/History/music.cfm). Repeating a claim does not make it true. Truth (or as close to truth as we can get) is arrived through reasoned and informed inquiry. [[User:Jk180|Jk180]] ([[User talk:Jk180|talk]]) 15:42, 31 March 2009 (UTC)

These are all of course excellent points, and the last two sentences of Jk's resonate positively with me. &quot;Repeating a claim does not make it true&quot; - absolutely. I don't claim to know enough about the topic to make a definitive point - except to say that in academic circles (and conceivably for broad-sense political terms), the focus of reasoned inquiry, there is a dispute, however ill-informed one or the other side may be. I'd compare this to something in my own field - the &quot;alternative authorship&quot; theories for Shakespeare's plays - not a shred of documentary evidence exists to suggest that ol' Will of Stratford was not the author - it's all speculation and inference based IMHO on classist elitism - but however ill-informed or ill-intended, one can't deny that a controversy exists. That's why I like the pithy, simplified, straightforward wording of the current code section (and also I'm sure because I rewrote it) - it informs the reader of the major ideas of both sides and sources them and just leaves it there.

On a personal note - I learned &quot;Follow The Drinking Gourd&quot; in the mid-1950s from a Weavers album, which of course (Lee Hays and all) identified it as a code song. Some time in the 70s, I was doing an academic research project and stumbled upon a 1920s vintage book that included &quot;Gourd&quot; and identified it as what we're calling a code song here. That doesn't prove a thing - but I reiterate my point above that the lack of documentary evidence for almost any topic regarding slavery results from the enforced illiteracy of virtually all the slaves. So - to delete the code section because code proponents' standards of academic inquiry don't match what we might insist upon is hard to justify as NPOV. There are academics who propound the existence of codes; they have published; they work at respected institutions. To ignore them in the article is to my way of thinking a declaration that we at Wikipedia have established as truth a point that is still debated in academia, however much we may believe that one side is groundless. Regards, [[User:Sensei48|Sensei48]] ([[User talk:Sensei48|talk]]) 06:28, 1 April 2009 (UTC)

ps: I just checked - Wiki has an entire,long, sourced article about the Shakespeare authorship question - with the &quot;lede&quot; identifying the theory as speculative and having no traction in academic circles. If this little idea merits an article - it seems to me that some brief reference to the code allegations is appropriate here - without drawing conclusions relative to its merits, as the authorship article does.

== Minor Problems ==

I don't have a good suggestion for how to fix this, but I hope someone else may :

Religious significance
Negro spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith. They may also have served as socio-political protests veiled as assimilation to white American culture. They were originated by enslaved '''African-Americans in the United States'''. Slavery was introduced to the '''British colonies''' in the early seventeenth century, and enslaved people largely replaced indentured servants as an economic labor force during the 17th century. '''These people''' would remain in bondage for the entire 18th century and much of the 19th century. Most were not fully emancipated until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.


1.  Did spirituals arise before or after 1776 (or arguably 1789) ?  Before that there was not a United States (or better United States of America) ?
2.  No suggestion but is the term African-American really good historically i.e. - is the first generation American ?  Arguably white people did not think of themselves as Americans till the mid eighteenth century ?  You could go on and on about this
3. &quot;These people&quot; does not work really well.  Grammatically it seems to refer to the generation in the 17th century that replaced indentured servants.  Of course none of them had anything to do with the thirteenth amendment.  
4.  &quot;The British colonies&quot; is also somewhat problematical since we are only talking about some British colonies and some regions Florida for example which never were British colonies.


Basically the article confuses historical entities and concepts with geographical regions.  I think you have to know a bit about what we might call &quot;American History&quot; and have that as a frame of reference for the article to be unambiguous as to what it is talking about.

Also rather than stating without reference that nothing similar went on in the Caribean or South America, it is more accurate to say that the article is not about what might or might not have happened in those places.  I'm clueless about the question.  It is very challenging to have any proof of a negative, but before we say it didn't happen somewhere we should want a credible source that has apparently looked at all available literature and made that conclusion.  If a Wikipedia contributor read all the available literature and didn't find anything, that would constitute research.  

I'm not making any changes, because the ariticle works OK if you come to it with the needed frame of reference and I might somehow compound the problems.  Nonetheless, I hope there is someone more skilled than I am who can come up with something.

[[User:Peter Reilly|Peter Reilly]] ([[User talk:Peter Reilly|talk]]) 19:33, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

====Oops====

I see that the statement about not happening in other regions is sourced.  I would still be inclined to make the statement conditional.

[[User:Peter Reilly|Peter Reilly]] ([[User talk:Peter Reilly|talk]]) 19:39, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

I'm going to go ahead and openly accuse whoever wrote the &quot;Replacement with Christianity&quot; section of pushing their hideously transparent christian agenda through retconning that section. It was mostly opinion and speculation, and it was all outsourced. Why don't need to read how you imagine those slaves felt. -Kei$hi

Martin Luther King said in 1967 &quot; Deep in our history of struggle for freedom Canada was the North Star. The Negro slave, denied education, de-humanized, imprisoned on cruel plantations, knew that far to the north a land existed where a fugitive slave, if he survived the horrors of the journey, could find freedom. The legendary underground railroad started in the south and ended in Canada. The freedom road links us together. Our spirituals, now so widely admired around the world, were often codes. We sang of 'heaven' that awaited us, and the slave masters listened in innocence, not realizing that we were not speaking of the hereafter. Heaven was the word for Canada and the Negro sang of the hope that his escape on the underground railroad would carry him there. One of our spirituals, 'Follow the Drinking Gourd', in its disguised lyrics contained directions for escape. The gourd was the big dipper, and the North Star to which its handle pointed gave the celestial map that directed the flight to the Canadian border&quot; p. 1 of Conscience for Change, published by CBC Learning Systems in 1967 

I have just found on Google Books that parts of &quot;My Bondage and my Freedom&quot; F Douglass 1855 are online, and there is on content page a Section “Hymns with double meaning” p203. I am not sure if this is the specific book the websites refer to or whether he mentions more fully coding in songs in his later works. It does occurs to me that he may not have been too specific in any books, written during the period before the abolition of slavery (1865)that songs may contain guidance on escaping. 

I suspect it may be worth  looking at the writings of Levi Coffin and others associated with the Under Ground Railroad that were published in the 19th century. If I find anything I will post on this discussion page.
