'''Ancient of Days''' is a name for [[God]] in Aramaic: ''Atik Yomin''; in the Greek [[Septuagint]]: ''Palaios Hemeron''; and in the [[Vulgate]]: ''Antiquus Dierum''.

The title &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; has been used as a source of inspiration in art and music, denoting the Creator's aspects of [[eternity]] combined with [[perfection]].  [[William Blake]]'s [[watercolour]] and [[relief etching]] entitled &quot;[[The Ancient of Days]]&quot; is one such example.

== In Religion ==
===Judaism===
:''See also [[The names of God in Judaism]]''
There are many sources for this term, including:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
&lt;p align=right&gt;[[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whenever Judgment looms and the forehead of the Impatient One is revealed, the Forehead of the Ancient of Ancients is revealed; Judgment subsides and is not executed.
&lt;p align=right&gt;[[Idra Rabba]], [[Zohar]] 3:136b&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This term appears three times in the [[book of Daniel]] (7:9, 13, 22),&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%207;&amp;version=9|title=Daniel 7|accessdate=21 January 2008|publisher=BibleGateway.com (KJV)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in the sense of God being [[eternity|eternal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eastons&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Easton's Bible Dictionary, &quot;Ancient of Days&quot;| url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Ancient%20of%20Days| last=Easton| first=M. G.| authorlink=Matthew George Easton| year=1897}} &quot;In contrast with all earthly kings, his days are past reckoning.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful effect of this particular Name of God stems from the [[Kabbalah: Primary Texts|Jewish mystical book]] the [[Zohar]], the seminal document of [[Kabbalah]] that emerged in 13th century Spain.  In the Kabbalah there is mention of the Ancient of Ancients, and the Holy Ancient One - Atika Kadisha, variably interpreted as synonymous with the [[En Sof]], the unmanifested [[Godhead (Judaism)|Godhead]]. The Ancient of Days is the manifestation of the Ancient of Ancients within Creation. It refers to the most primary (&quot;ancient&quot;) source of Creation in the Divine Will [[Keter]]. In 16th century [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], Atik Yomin becomes the inner [[Partzuf]] of Keter, synonymous with Divine Delight, that enclothes within and motivates [[Arich Anpin]], the outer Partzuf of Keter, synonymous with Divine Will. Arich Anpin is said to extend down all levels of Creation in ever more concealed mode as the Divine substratum of everything. The [[Zohar]] goes into great detail describing the White Head of God and ultimately the emanation of its [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|personality or attributes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|http://web.archive.org/web/20070702115508/http://www.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/ancient.html|Glossary entry for Ancient of Days}}; Retrieved 21 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Damian. The Ancient of Days.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Ancient of Days&quot;, a 14th-century fresco from [[Ubisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]
In [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christian hymns and [[icon]]s, the Ancient of Days is sometimes identified with [[God the Father]]; but most properly, in accordance with [[Orthodox theology]] he is identified with [[God the Son]], or [[Jesus]] [[Christ]].  As such, Eastern Christian art will sometimes portray Jesus Christ as an old man, the Ancient of Days, to show symbolically that he existed from all eternity, and sometimes as a young man to portray him as he was incarnate.  This [[iconography]] emerged in the 6th century, mostly in the Eastern Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Cartlidge and Elliott, 69-72&lt;/ref&gt;  It was declared by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] at the [[Stoglavy Sobor|Great Synod of Moscow]] in 1667 that the Ancient of Days was the Son and not the Father.&lt;ref&gt;The Tome of the Great Council of Moscow (1666-1667 A.D.), Ch. 2, 43-45; tr. [[Hierodeacon]] Lev Puhalo, ''Canadian Orthodox Missionary Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Western Church similar figures usually represent only God the Father.  Building his argument upon the Daniel passage, [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies the Ancient of Days as the Person of the Father.&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologica III.59.1 obj 2, ad 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[hymn]] &quot;Immortal, Invisible, God only Wise&quot;, the last two lines of the first verse read:

: ''Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,''
: ''Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.''

{{bibleverse||Daniel|7:13-14|KJV}} says, “I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One. And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and his kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.&quot;  A visit by the Son of Man to bestow a kingdom and honor on the Ancient of Days would suggest that they are two distinct identities. Among ancient Christian pseudepigrapha, one Book of Enoch states that He who is called “Son of man,” who existed before the worlds were, is seen by Enoch in company with the “Ancient of Days”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Enoch|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/deane/pseudepig.iv.html|work=Pseudepigrapha: An Account of Certain Apocryphal Sacred Writings of the Jews and Early Christians|publisher=Christian Classics Etherial Library|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the title ''Ancient of Days'' belongs to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], the oldest and earliest man, who is also identified with the [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].&lt;ref name=&quot;D&amp;C27&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/27/11 | title=Doctrine &amp; Covenants 27:11 | accessdate=19 May 2008|publisher=Lds.org| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080420083045/http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/27/11| archivedate= 20 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
The [[Sanskrit]] name, Karttikeya or Skanda, means &quot;always a youth&quot; and is revered as one of the four (or seven) sons of [[Brahma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=A classical dictionary of Hindu mythology and religion, geography, history, and literature| url=http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/courseinfo/books.htm#dowson| last=Dowson| first=John (1820-1881)| year=1879| publisher=Trübner| location=London}} [Reprint, London: Routledge, 1979]. ISBN 0-415-24521-4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{main|God in Buddhism}}
In [[Buddhism]], in the Kevattha Sutta (Digha Nikaya 11), the term &quot;ancient of days&quot; is referred to the creator God Brahma,

''&quot;“I am the Great Brahma, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Controller, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, '''the Ancient of days''', the Father of all that are and are to be.” .&quot;''

In Buddhism, although Brahma or God is respected, he is not regarded as omnipotent or all knowing, but someone in [[samsara]] who is subject to ignorance, birth and death (over billions of years) and a disciple of the Buddha.

=== Bahá’í ===
In the [[Bahá’í Faith]], 'the Ancient of Days' is one of the titles with which [[Bahá’u’lláh]] refers to Himself.&lt;ref&gt;The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, Shoghi Effendi, US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition, pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt;
