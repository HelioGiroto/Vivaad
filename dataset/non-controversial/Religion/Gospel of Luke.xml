{{Books of the New Testament}}
The '''Gospel According to Luke''' ({{lang-el|Τὸ κατὰ Λουκᾶν εὐαγγέλιον}}, ''to kata Loukan euangelion''), commonly shortened to the '''Gospel of Luke''' or simply '''Luke''', is the third and longest of the four [[canonical Gospels]]. This [[synoptic gospel]] is an account of the [[New Testament view on Jesus' life|life]] and [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. It details his story from the events of his birth to his [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. 

According to the preface&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Luke|1:1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the purpose of Luke is to write a [[historical]] account,&lt;ref&gt;N. B. Stonehouse, ''The Witness of Luke to Christ'' (1951), pp. 24-45; H. J. Cadbury, ''The Beginnings of Christianity'' II, 1922, pp. 489-510; R. Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Eerdmans, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; while bringing out the theological significance of the history.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The writer divides history into three stages: the first ends with [[John the Baptist]], the second consists of Jesus' earthly ministry, and the third is the life of the church after Jesus' resurrection.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;&quot;biblical literature.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 6 Nov 2010 [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature].&lt;/ref&gt; The author portrays [[Christianity]] as divine, respectable, law-abiding, and international.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; Here, Jesus' compassion extends to all who are needy, women are important among his followers, the despised Samaritans are commended, and Gentiles are promised the opportunity to accept the gospel.&lt;ref name = &quot;May Metzger&quot;&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977. p. 1240.&lt;/ref&gt; While the gospel is written as a historical narrative, many of the facts portrayed therein are based on previous traditions of the recorded Gospel story and not on what some might consider to be historical record.&lt;ref&gt;'Historically reliable information cannot be expected, however, because Luke’s sources were not historical; they rather were embedded in tradition and proclamation.' &quot;biblical literature.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 6 Nov 2010 [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature].&lt;/ref&gt; Certain popular stories, such as the [[Prodigal Son]] and the [[Good Samaritan]], are found only in this gospel. This account also has a special emphasis on prayer, the activity of the Holy Spirit, women, and joyfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is presented as the Son of God, but attention especially paid to the humanity of Jesus, featuring his compassion for the weak, the suffering and the outcast.

The author is traditionally identified as [[Luke the Evangelist]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biblical Scholars are in wide agreement that the author of the Gospel of Luke also wrote the [[Acts of the Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Udo Schnelle]], ''The History and Theology of the New Testament Writings'', Fortress Press, 1998. p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe that these two books originally constituted a two-volume work,&lt;ref&gt;David Aune ''The New Testament in Its Literary Environment'' (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1987), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebooksofthebible.info ''The Books of The Bible''] (Colorado Springs: International Bible Society, 2007); ''The Original New Testament'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In some editions of the Bible, Luke-Acts has been presented as a single book. Both Luke and Acts are addressed to a certain &quot;[[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]]&quot;, and there are several theories concerning why.&lt;/ref&gt; which scholars refer to as [[Luke-Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Robert J., The Complete Gospels, pp. 115–117 &quot;Introduction to the Gospel of Luke&quot;: &quot;scholars usually refer to Luke's work as &quot;Luke-Acts&quot;&quot;. Polebridge Press, 1992. ISBN 0-944344-49-6&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to some scholars, it is not impossible that Luke was the author.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown 1997&quot;&gt;'This proposal for authorship [by Luke] has more to recommend it than other theories, but &quot;not impossible&quot; is all that should be claimed.' Brown, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While the traditional view that Luke authored the gospel is still often put forward, a [[Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles|number of possible contradictions between Acts and Paul's letters]] lead many scholars to dispute this account,&lt;ref&gt;'Contrary to [the traditional] view, which is occasionally still put forward today, a critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.' Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The principle essay in this regard is P. Vielhauer, 'On the &quot;Paulinism&quot; of Acts', in L.E. Keck and J. L. Martyn (eds.), Studies in Luke-Acts (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1975), 33-50, who suggests that Luke's presentation of Paul was, on several fronts, a contradiction of Paul's own letters (e.g. attitudes on natural theology, Jewish law, christology, eschatology). This has become the standard position in German scholarship, e.g., Conzelmann, Acts; J. Roloff, Die Apostelgeschichte (NTD; Berlin: Evangelische, 1981) 2-5; Schille, Apostelgeschichte des Lukas, 48-52. This position has been challenged most recently by Porter, &quot;The Paul of Acts and the Paul of the Letters: Some Common Misconceptions', in his Paul of Acts, 187-206. See also I.H. Marshall, The Acts of the Apostles (TNTC; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans; Leister: InterVarsity Press, 1980) 42-44; E.E. Ellis, The Gospel of Luke (NCB; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans; London: Marshall, Morgan and Scott, 2nd edn, 1974) 45-47.&quot;, Pearson, &quot;Corresponding sense: Paul, dialectic, and Gadamer&quot;, Biblical Interpretation Series, p. 101 (2001). Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; and for some the author remains unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; 

Most modern critical scholarship concludes that Luke used the [[Gospel of Mark]] for his chronology and a hypothetical sayings source [[Q document]] for many of Jesus' teachings. Luke may also have drawn from independent written records.&lt;ref name = &quot;5GIntro&quot;&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. &quot;Introduction,&quot; p 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Christian scholarship has dated the composition of the gospel to the early 60s,&lt;ref&gt;D. R. W. Wood, New Bible Dictionary (InterVarsity Press, 1996), 704.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, D.A.; Moo, Dougals J. (1992). &quot;4&quot; (in English). An introduction to the New Testament. Morris, Leon. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan. pp. 116. ISBN 0-310-51940-3.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[higher criticism]] dates it to the later decades of the 1st century.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris Gospels&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. &quot;The Gospels&quot; p. 266-268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Raymond E. (1997). Introduction to the New Testament&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
Early on, the gospel was given the title Gospel According to Luke ({{lang-el|κατὰ Λουκᾶν εὐαγγέλιον}}, ''kata Loukan euangelion'', or {{lang|grc|τὸ εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Λουκᾶν}}, ''to euangelion kata Loukan''). It is commonly called the '''Gospel of Luke''' or simply '''Luke'''. &quot;Gospel&quot; means &quot;good news.&quot;

==Composition==
The date of the Gospel of Luke is traditionally fixed to some time before the end of the final events of Luke's second volume to Theophilus, Acts, so as early as 59 or 60.&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Robertson ''Luke the historian in the light of research'' 1923 &quot;The theological argument strongly confirms the early date ... There remains only one further difficulty of importance in the way of dating the Gospel of Luke so early as 59 or 60 &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the ''Gospel of Luke'' acknowledges familiarity with earlier [[gospels]] (1:1). Although [[semitic language|semitisms]] exist throughout the ''Gospel of Luke'', it was composed in [[Koine Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis &amp; Mary Peloubet, ''A dictionary of the Bible: comprising its antiquities, biography, geography, natural history and literature'', Porter and Coates Pub. 1884 P. 367&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mark (but unlike Matthew), the intended audience is the Greek-speaking populations of the region; it assures readers that Christianity is an international religion, not an exclusively Jewish sect.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt;

===Synoptic Gospels===
{{See also|Synoptic Gospels}}
[[File:Relationship between synoptic gospels.png|thumb|right|350px|Almost all of Mark's content is found in Matthew, and much of Mark is similarly found in Luke. Additionally, Matthew and Luke have a large amount of material in common that is not found in Mark.]]

The Gospels of Luke, Matthew and Mark (known as the Synoptic Gospels) include many of the same stories, often in the same sequence, and sometimes exactly the same wording. The most commonly accepted explanation for this similarity is the [[two-source hypothesis]]. It hypothesizes that Matthew and Luke each borrowed from both [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and a [[hypothetical]] sayings collection, called [[Q document|Q]]. For most scholars, the Q collection accounts for what the gospels of Luke and Matthew share but are not found in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p8081&quot;&gt;Bart Erhman, ''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'', Oxford University Press, p.78-87&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins'' (1924), [[Burnett Hillman Streeter]] argued that another source, referred to as [[L source|''L'']] and also hypothetical,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katapi.org.uk/4Gospels/Ch9.htm&lt;/ref&gt; lies behind the material in Luke that has no parallel in Mark or Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett H. Streeter,''[http://www.katapi.org.uk/4Gospels/Contents.htm The Four Gospels. A Study of Origins Treating the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, &amp; Dates]''. London: MacMillian and Co., Ltd., 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; (See the [[Four Document Hypothesis]] )

===Sources===
The traditional view is that Luke, who was not an eye-witness of Jesus' ministry, wrote his gospel after gathering the best sources of information within his reach (Luke 1:1-4).&lt;ref&gt;M.G. Easton, Easton's Bible Dictionary (Oak Harbor, WA: Logos Research Systems, Inc., 1996, c1897), &quot;Luke, Gospel According To&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical scholarship generally holds to the [[two-source hypothesis]] as most probable, which argues that the author used the [[Gospel of Mark]] and the hypothetical [[Q document]] in addition to unique material, as sources for the gospel.

====The Gospel of Mark====
{{main|Markan priority}}
Most modern scholars agree that Luke used the ''Gospel of Mark'' as one of his sources.&lt;ref name = &quot;ActJLuke&quot;&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. &quot;Luke,&quot; p. 267-364&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding that Mark was the first of the synoptic gospels and that it served as a source for Matthew and Luke is foundational to modern critical scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;5GIntro&quot;/&gt;

Mark's gospel is quite short, and written in [[Koine Greek]] (that is, common Greek). It provides a general chronology from Jesus' baptism to the empty tomb. Luke, however, sometimes presented events in a different order to more clearly support his emphases. For example, Mark has Jesus recruit his first disciples before he has performed any miracles, and Luke moves the recruitment scene to a point after Jesus' first miracles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActJLuke&quot;/&gt;

====The sayings gospel Q====
[[File:Synoptic problem two source colored.png|thumb|right|200px|The Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written independently, each using Mark and a second document called &quot;Q&quot; as a source. '''''Q''' is defined as the &quot;common&quot; material found in Matthew and Luke but not in Mark'']]
{{See also|Q source}}
A majority of scholars believe that Luke used Q as his second source. Q (for &quot;Quelle,&quot; German for &quot;source&quot;) is a hypothetical collection of Jesus' sayings. In the &quot;two-source hypothesis,&quot; Q explains where the authors of Matthew and Luke got the material that they have in common with each other but that is not found in Mark, such as the Lord's prayer. The existence of a highly treasured dominical sayings document in circulation going totally unmentioned by the Fathers of the Early Church, remains one of the great conundrums of Modern Biblical Scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pier Franco Beatrice 2006, pp. 147-195&quot;&gt;Pier Franco Beatrice, ''The Gospel according to the Hebrews in the Apostolic Fathers'', Novum Testamentum 2006, vol. 48, no2, pp. 147-195 ISSN 0048-1009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Vs9YXAB_axYC&amp;dq=%22James+Edwards%22++%22Hebrew+Gospel%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cdXiwt--gI&amp;sig=MExo3o7vnOrb887DWJ4tVbM94es&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l3o1S_TnI9W9lAehybWRBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false James R. Edwards, ''The Hebrew Gospel &amp; the Development of the Synoptic Tradition'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2009 pp. 209 - 247]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Hengel, ''The Four Gospels and the One Gospel of Jesus Christ'' Trinity Press, SCM 2000 p.207- 210&lt;/ref&gt;

====L source====
Material unique to Luke is said to derive from the [[L source]], which is thought to derive from the oral tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;5GIntro&quot;/&gt;

Luke apparently draws formal set pieces from the &quot;teachings&quot; of Christianity and incorporates into the gospel. The [[Magnificat]], in which Mary praises God, is one such element.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActJLuke&quot;/&gt;

The birth narratives in both Luke and Matthew seem to be the latest component of the Gospels.&lt;ref name = &quot;ActJBirth&quot;&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. &quot;Birth &amp; Infancy Stories&quot; p. 497-526.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke may have originally begun with verses 3:1-7, a second prologue.&lt;ref name = &quot;ActJBirth&quot;/&gt;

Comparisons have been made between the annunciation narrative in Luke's Gospel with the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] manuscript Q4Q246:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High … The power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God” '''(Luke 1:32, 35)'''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“[X] shall be great upon the earth. O king, all people shall make peace, and all shall serve him. He shall be called the son of the Great God, and by his name shall he be hailed as the Son of God, and they shall call him Son of the Most High.” '''(Dead Sea scrolls manuscript Q4Q246)'''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''An Unpublished Dead Sea Scroll Text Parallels Luke’s Infancy Narrative''&quot;, Biblical Archaeology Review, April/May 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The similarity in content has been described as such that &quot;''it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Luke is dependent in some way, whether directly or indirectly, on this long lost text from Qumran''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The meaning of the Dead Sea scrolls: Their significance for understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity''&quot;, James C. VanderKam, Peter W. Flint, p. 335, Continuum, 2005, ISBN 0-567-08468-X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek===
{{see also|Language of the New Testament}}
The books of the New Testament were written in Greek. Luke's style is the most literary of all these books.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Greek.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Stanton evaluates the opening of the Gospel of Luke as &quot;the most finely composed sentence in the whole of post-Classical Greek literature.&quot;

===Authorship===
[[File:Byzantinischer Maler des 10. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|right|10th century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] illustration of [[Luke the Evangelist]].]]
{{Main|Authorship of Luke-Acts}}

Although the Gospel survives in anonymous form, it is considered that the name was known to the addressee, Theophilus.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Luke Christopher Francis Evans - 1990 &quot;... author was bound to give his name - 'Luke to Theophilus greeting' - it is considered likely that his name was attached to the work somehow (it is not known whether or not it had a title), or was attached to it by Theophilus. If so,&lt;/ref&gt; The author was probably a Gentile Christian.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris Gospels&quot;/&gt; Whoever the author was, he was highly educated, well traveled, well connected, and extremely widely read. By the time he composed the Gospel, he must have been a highly practiced and competent author - able to compose in a wide variety of literary forms according to the demands of the moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fizmyer, Joseph 1985&quot;&gt;Fizmyer, Joseph. The Gospel according to Luke: introduction, translation, and notes. The Anchor Bible v. 28-28A. (2 vols) Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1981-1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the majority opinion that Luke was a gentile writing to other gentiles, a few authors have challenged this view. Birger Gerhardsson notes his opinion that “Luke is very much dependent upon Palestinian tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;Gerhardsson, Birger, Memory and manuscript: oral tradition and written transmission in rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity with Tradition and transmission in early Christianity, (Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans Pub., 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Schlatter concluded that the text's character together with other indicators point to the author's provenance from the Jewish church.&lt;ref&gt;Schlatter, Adolf, The theology of the Apostles: the development of New Testament theology, (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1998), 327.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Luke presupposes a knowledge of the Old Testament and Jewish history (1:7; 4:38; 9:9-10 &amp; 9:28-36).&lt;ref&gt;Schlatter, 330.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, “Luke perceives himself to be a Jew.”&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, Marilyn, “Insider or Outsider? Luke's relationship with Judaism,” in Tyson, ed., Luke-Acts and the Jewish People, 76-82.　&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Rebecca Denova concludes her book with these words: “Luke-Acts, we may conclude on the basis of a narrative-critical reading, was written by a Jew to persuade other Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was the messiah of Scripture and that the words of the prophets concerning ‘restoration’ have been ‘fulfilled.’”&lt;ref&gt;Denova, Rebecca I., The Things Accomplished Among Us: Prophetic Tradition in the Structural Pattern of Luke-Acts, (Sheffield, 1997), 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally it should be noted that Strelan in 2008 not only concluded that Theophilus was Jewish but also that Luke was a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Rich Strelan, ''Luke the Priest'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The ''Gospel of Luke'' and the [[Acts of the Apostles]] were both written by the same author.&lt;ref&gt;Horrell, DG, An Introduction to the study of Paul, T&amp;T Clark, 2006, 2nd Ed.,p.7; cf. W. L. Knox, ''The Acts of the Apostles'' (1948), p. 2-15 for detailed arguments that still stand.&lt;/ref&gt; The most direct evidence comes from the prefaces of each book. Both prefaces were addressed to [[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]], and the preface of Acts explicitly references &quot;my former book&quot; about the life of Jesus. Furthermore, there are linguistic and theological similarities between the two works, suggesting that they have a common author.&lt;ref&gt;on linguistics, see A. Kenny, ''A stylometric Study of the New Testament'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Both books also contain common interests.&lt;ref&gt;F. F. Bruce, ''The Acts of the Apostles'' (1952), p2.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic and theological agreements and cross-references between the books indicate that they are from the same author.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Schnelle. ''The History and Theology of the New Testament Writings'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Those [[biblical scholars]] who consider the two books a single, two-volume work often refer to both together as [[Luke-Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., C. Kavin Rowe, &quot;History, Hermeneutics and the Unity of Luke-Acts,&quot; ''[[Journal for the Study of the New Testament|JSNT]]'' 28 (2005): 131-157, raising questions about the literary unity of Luke-Acts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;we&quot; passages in Acts, where the first person plural is used, point to the author being a companion of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Siotis, ‘Luke the Evangelist as St. Paul’s Collaborator’, in ''Neues Testament Gesichichte'', pp. 105-111. (what year? who is &quot;M A Soitis&quot;?)&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition holds that the text was written by [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke the companion of Paul]] (named in [[Colossians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Col|4:14}}). 

The [[Church Fathers]], witnessed by the Muratorian Canon, Irenaeus (''c.'' 170), Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian, held that the ''Gospel of Luke'' was written by [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest manuscript of the gospel [[Papyrus 75|P&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;]] (''circa'' 200) carries the attribution “the Gospel according to Luke”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/luke.html Gospel of Luke at EarlyChristianWritings.com] However, there is probably a bit of a mistake here. According to my sources, P75 does not include the start of the gospel, rather it includes the end, where an attribution to Luke is found.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/tc_pap75.html Image of Papyrus 75] showing the end of Luke's Gospel and the beginning of John's Gospel, separated by the words Κατά Λουκαν, (''Kata Loukan'') = &quot;According to Luke&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; however another manuscript [[Papyrus 4|P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;]] from about the same time period&lt;ref&gt;Possibly dated earlier than [[Papyrus 75|P&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;Gregory, A. (2003) ''The Reception of Luke and Acts in the Period Before Irenaeus'', Mohr Siebeck, ISBN 3-16-148086-4 p.28&lt;/ref&gt; has no such (surviving) attribution. 

====Critical view====
According to the majority view, the evidence against Luke's being the author is strong enough that the author is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The unknown author of Luke-Acts was certainly not a companion of Paul.&quot; Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz.

However, this assertion was contradicted by an influential study by Cadbury in 1926, and has since been abandoned; instead it is now believed this language reflects merely a common Greek education.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Efforts to argue that the Third Gospel demonstrates that its author was a doctor have been abandoned today. Hobart argued that the sheer number of healing stories and the vocabulary demonstrated that Luke was a physician.10 However, Cadbury later refuted these claims by proving that Luke showed no more “medical” language than other educated writers of his day.11 Of course, the healing stories and “medical” vocabulary are consistent with authorship by a physician. They simply do not prove it.&quot;, Black, M. C. (1996). Luke. College Press NIV commentary. Joplin, Mo.: College Press Pub.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Colossians 4:14 refers to Luke as a doctor. In 1882, Hobart tried to bolster this connection by indicating all the technical verbal evidence for Luke’s vocation. Despite the wealth of references Hobart gathered, the case was rendered ambiguous by the work of Cadbury (1926), who showed that almost all of the alleged technical medical vocabulary appeared in everyday Greek documents such as the LXX, Josephus, Lucian, and Plutarch. This meant that the language could have come from a literate person within any vocation. Cadbury’s work does not, however, deny that Luke could have been a doctor, but only that the vocabulary of these books does not guarantee that he was one.&quot;, Bock, D. L. (1994). Luke Volume 1: 1:1-9:50. Baker exegetical commentary on the New Testament (7). Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attempts have been made to strengthen the argument for authorship by a physician by finding examples of medical phraseology in Luke-Acts; these are too few to be made the basis of an argument, but there is perhaps just sufficient evidence to corroborate a view more firmly based on other considerations.&quot;, Marshall, I. H. (1978). The Gospel of Luke : A commentary on the Greek text. The New international Greek testament commentary (33–34). Exeter [Eng.: Paternoster Press.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. W. K.

====Traditional view====
The traditional view on Lukan authorship, however, is held by many scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Scholars such as Hengel (2000:48), Fitzmyer (1981:51), Thornton (1991), Nolland (1989: 1. xxxvii), Riley (1993: vii), and Eckey (2004: 49). There are three chief factors cited in favor of the traditional authorship: The tradition that almost unanimously ascribes the Gospel and Acts to 'Luke'; the 'we' passages in Acts suggest the author is an eyewitness and a companion of Paul; and the medical language and interest found in both writings fit the language and interest of a physician, and Luke held that profession, as Col 4:14 states. &quot;But each of these arguments can be, and has been, questioned.&quot;, Strelan, &quot;Luke the Priest: the Authority of the Author of the Third Gospel&quot;, pp. 99-100 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and according to some scholars it is &quot;not impossible&quot; that they are right.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown 1997&quot;/&gt; Since Luke was not prominent there is no obvious reason that this gospel and Acts would have been attributed to him if he didn't write them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;.. since Luke is not prominent in the apostolic age, if the gospel and Acts were not originally written by him, there is no obvious reason why they should have been associated with him.&quot; Fizmyer, Joseph. The Gospel according to Luke: introduction, translation, and notes. The Anchor Bible v. 28-28A. (2 vols) Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1981-1985.&lt;/ref&gt; If Luke was only a sometime companion of Paul who idealized him long after his death, that could explain the differences between Acts and Paul's letter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;His brief association with Paul led him to idealize Paul and make him the hero of the second part of Acts. He has painted his own picture of Paul, which may not agree in all details with the Paul of the uncontested letters&quot;. Fizmyer, Joseph. The Gospel according to Luke: introduction, translation, and notes. The Anchor Bible v. 28-28A. (2 vols) Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1981-1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the evangelist as depicted in the New Testament doesn't match the patristic description of Luke, the traditional view is still argued today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fizmyer, Joseph 1985&quot;/&gt;

===Date===
Traditionally Luke has been regarded as written by [[Luke the Evangelist]] some time between the &quot;we&quot; passages in Acts 16 onwards&lt;ref&gt;Clare K. Rothschild ''Luke-Acts and the rhetoric of history'' 2004 Page 264 &quot;Present scholarship still struggles to make sense of the so- called 'we-passages' in Acts 16:10—17; 20:5—15; 21:1—18; ... The primary purpose of Campbell's thesis, however, is to defend the eyewitness quality of Luke's account and its..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and the imprisonment of Paul in Rome in Acts 28, leading as with some modern scholars to argue for a date ''c.'' 60-65.&lt;ref name=Carson&amp;Moo&gt;&quot;Introduction to the New Testament&quot;, chapter on Luke, by D. Carson and D. Moo, Zondervan Books (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However many [[Higher Criticism|critical scholars]] consider the &quot;we&quot; passages spurious or inserted and place the date ''c'' 80-90,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Raymond E. |authorlink=Raymond E. Brown |title=Introduction to the New Testament |year=1997 |publisher=Anchor Bible |location=New York |isbn=0-385-24767-2 |pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John P. Meier|Meier, John P.]], [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus'']]. Doubleday, 1991, v. 1, pp. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

====AD 75 to 100====
[[File:LukeSt.Matts.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Stained glass depiction of St. Luke at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina.]]
Most contemporary scholars regard [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] as a source used by Luke (see [[Markan Priority]]).&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Koester. ''Ancient Christian Gospels''. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Trinity Press International, 1999. p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; If it is true that Mark was written around the destruction of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], around 70,&lt;ref name = &quot;TM1998 Mark&quot;&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition). p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; they theorize that Luke would not have been written before 70. Some who take this view believe that Luke's prediction of the destruction of the 
temple could not be a result of Jesus predicting the future but with the benefit of hindsight regarding specific details. They believe that the discussion in Luke 21:5-30 is specific enough (more specific than Mark's or Matthew's) that a date after 70 seems likely.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;&gt;&quot;Matthew, Gospel acc. to St.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Brown agrees that the references to the Jerusalem temple's destruction are seen as evidence of a post-70 date. Brown, Schuyler. ''The origins of Christianity: a historical introduction to the New Testament.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars have suggested dates for Luke from 75 to 100. Support for a later date comes from a number of reasons. Differences of chronology, &quot;style&quot;, and theology suggest that the author of Luke-Acts was not familiar with [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's distinctive theology]] but instead was writing a decade or more after his death, by which point significant harmonization between different traditions within [[Early Christianity]] had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler. ''The origins of Christianity: a historical introduction to the New Testament.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Luke-Acts has views on [[christology|Jesus' divine nature]], [[eschatology|the end times]], and [[soteriology|salvation]] that are similar to the those found in [[Pastoral epistles]], which are often seen as [[pseudonym]]ous and of a later date than [[Authorship of the Pauline Epistles|the undisputed]] [[Pauline Epistles]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler. ''The origins of Christianity: a historical introduction to the New Testament.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars from the [[Jesus Seminar]] argue that the birth narratives of Luke and Matthew are a late development in gospel writing about Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActJBirth&quot;/&gt; In this view, Luke might have originally started at 3:1,&lt;ref name = &quot;ActJBirth&quot;/&gt; with John the Baptist. However, given as the birth narrative of Luke contains several 'tropes' that would indicate to a Roman audience that Jesus was special (the virgin birth, wise teaching at twelve, c.f. The Life of Flavius Josephus, &quot;Moreover, when I was...of the law.&quot;), and so would have been likely to have been included in the original manuscript.

The ''[[Terminus post quem|terminus ad quem]]'', or latest possible date, for Luke is bound by the earliest [[List of New Testament papyri|papyri]] [[Biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] that contains portions of Luke (late 2nd/early 3rd century)&lt;ref&gt;[[Papyrus 4|P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Papyrus 45|P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;]], P&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;, P&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;, and P&lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the mid to late 2nd century writings that quote or reference Luke. The work is reflected in the [[Didache]], the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] writings of [[Basilides]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]], the apologetics of the [[Church Father]] [[Justin Martyr]], and was used by [[Marcion]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), pp. 126-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian scholar [[Donald Guthrie]] claims that the Gospel was likely widely known before the end of the 1st century, and was fully recognized by the early part of the second,&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Helmut Koester]] states that aside from Marcion, &quot;there is no certain evidence for its usage,&quot; prior to ''ca.'' 150.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Koester. ''Ancient Christian Gospels''. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Trinity Press International, 1999. p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 2nd century, an edited version of the Gospel of Luke was the only gospel accepted by [[Marcion]], a heretic who rejected Christianity's connection to Jewish scripture.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marcion.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Before AD 70====
A minority argument for a date between AD 37 and AD 61 for the Gospel&lt;ref&gt;A. Harnack, ''The Date of Acts and the Synoptic Gospels'' (1911), p. 90; I. H. Marshall, ''Luke'', p. 35 (1974); A. J. Mattill Jr., ‘The Date and Purpose of Luke-Acts: Rackham reconsidered, in ''[[Catholic Biblical Quarterly]]'' 40 (1978), pp. 335-350.&lt;/ref&gt; typically suggests that Luke's address to &quot;Most Excellent Theophilus,&quot; may be a reference to the Roman-imposed High Priest of Israel between AD 37 and AD 41, [[Theophilus ben Ananus]].

Christian scholar Donald Guthrie reports that some think Luke collected much of his unique material during the imprisonment of Paul in Caesarea, when Luke attended to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=Donald|title=New Testament Introduction|publisher=Apollos|location=Leicester, England|year=1990|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul mentions Luke, in passing, several times as traveling with Paul. Guthrie notes that much of the evidence for dating the Gospel at any point is based upon conjecture.

An argument for an early date is put forward by Matthew Slick:

&quot;None of the gospels mention the destruction of the Jewish temple in 70 A.D.  This is significant because Jesus had prophesied concerning the temple when He said &quot;As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down,&quot; (Luke 21:6, see also Matt. 24:1; Mark 13:1).  This prophecy was fulfilled in 70 A.D. when the Romans sacked Jerusalem and burned the temple.  The gold in the temple melted down between the stone walls and the Romans took the walls apart, stone by stone, to get the gold.  Such an obvious fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy most likely would have been recorded as such by the gospel writers who were fond of mentioning fulfillment of prophecy if they had been written after 70 A.D.  Also, if the gospels were fabrications of mythical events then anything to bolster the Messianic claims -- such as the destruction of the temple as Jesus said -- would surely have been included.  But, it was not included suggesting that the gospels (at least Matthew, Mark, and Luke) were written before 70 A.D.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://carm.org/when-were-gospels-written-and-by-whom&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audience and authorial intent===
It is thought that like Mark (but unlike Matthew), the intended audience is international. Luke portrays his subject as regarded in a positive light by Roman authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt; For example, the [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus|Jews are said to be responsible for Jesus' crucifixion]], with [[Pontius Pilate]] finding no wrong in him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC self&quot;/&gt;

The Gospel is addressed to the author's patron, Theophilus, which in Greek simply means ''friend of God''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G2321&amp;Version=KJV Strong's G2321]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''(be)loved by God'' or ''loving God'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Bauer lexicon]], 2nd edition, 1958, page 358&lt;/ref&gt; and may not be a name but a generic term for a Christian. However, as the patron is described as 'Most Excellent Theophilus', this would indicate that the patron is in fact a governor or other highly ranked Roman official, as 'most excellent' is also used in other texts as a title for highly ranked officials.

==Content summary==
The Gospel of Luke tells the story of Jesus' miraculous birth, ministry of healing and parables, passion, resurrection, and ascension. Christian scholar [[Donald Guthrie]] claims, “it is full of superb stories and leaves the reader with a deep impression of the personality and teachings of Jesus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
Luke is the only gospel with a formal introduction, in which the author explains his methodology and purpose. It states that many others have already &quot;undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bauckham translation&quot;&gt;translation from Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses'' (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), pp. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; The author adds that he too wishes to compose an orderly account for Theophilus, so that Theophilus &quot;may know the certainty of the things [he has] been taught&quot;.

===Birth narratives and genealogy===
Like Matthew, Luke recounts a royal genealogy and a virgin birth for Jesus. Unlike Matthew, who traces Jesus' birth back through the line of David to Abraham in order to appeal to his Jewish audience,&lt;ref name =&quot;Ehrman1&quot;&gt;[[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]], The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings (Fourth Edition). New York: Oxford. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in Luke the evangelist traces Jesus' lineage back to Adam, indicating a universal sense of salvation.&lt;ref name =&quot;Ehrman1&quot;/&gt; Luke's birth narrative features the Christmas story,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;biblical literature.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 22 Jan 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature].&lt;/ref&gt; in which Mary and Joseph travel to Bethlehem for a [[Census of Quirinius|census]], the newborn Jesus is laid in a feeding trough (or manger), angels proclaim him the savior for all people, and [[adoration of the shepherds|shepherds come to adore him]]. Also unique to Luke is John the Baptist's birth story and three canticles (including the Magnificat) as well as the only story from Jesus' boyhood.

===Miracles and parables===
Luke emphasizes Jesus' miracles, recounting 20, four of which are unique. Like Matthew, it includes important sayings from the Q source, such as the [[Beatitudes]]. Luke's version of the Beatitudes differs from Matthew's, and Luke's seems closer to the source in Q.&lt;ref name = &quot;5GLuke&quot;&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. &quot;Luke&quot; p. 271-400&lt;/ref&gt; More than a dozen of Jesus' most memorable parables are unique to Luke, including the [[Good Samaritan]], the [[Parable of the Unjust Steward|Corrupt Steward]] and the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]].

===Role of women===
More than the other gospels, Luke focuses on women as playing important roles among Jesus' followers, such as [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Martha]], and [[Mary of Bethany]]. The Gospel of Luke is the only Gospel which contains the [[Annunciation]] of the Birth of Jesus to Mary his mother (1:26-38).

Compared to the other canonical gospels, Luke devotes significantly more attention to women. The Gospel of Luke features more female characters, features a female prophet ({{bibleverse-nb||Luke|2:36|31}}), and details the experience of pregnancy ({{bibleverse-nb||Luke|1:41–42|31}}).

Prominent discussion is given to the lives of [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], the mother of [[John the Baptist]] and of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]] (ch. {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|2|31}}).

===Last supper===
Luke is the only gospel that treats the Last Supper the way Paul does, as the institution of a liturgy to be repeated by his followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vermes 301&quot;&gt;Vermes, Geza. The authentic gospel of Jesus. London, Penguin Books. 2004. p. 301- 307.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Geza Vermes, Paul is to be considered the primary source for this interpretation because he says he received this insight from direct revelation rather than from the other apostles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vermes 301&quot;/&gt; The verses in question are not found in certain older manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977. p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bart Ehrman concludes that they were added in order to support the theme of Jesus' atoning death, a theme found in Mark but that the evangelist excluded from the original Luke.&lt;ref name = &quot;JInt&quot;&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Jesus, Interrupted]], HarperCollins, 2009. ISBN 0-06-117393-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trials and crucifixion===
[[Image:Joseph von Führich 001.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Road to Emmaus appearance]]'', based on Luke 24:13-32, painted by [[Joseph von Führich]], 1830.]]
Luke emphasizes that Jesus had committed no crime against Rome, as confirmed by Herod, Pilate, and the thief crucified with Jesus. It is possible that the author of Luke was trying to gain the respect of the Roman authorities for the benefit of the church by stressing Jesus' innocence.&lt;ref&gt;V. George Shillington, ''An introduction to the study of Luke-Acts'', Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 11. ISBN 0-567-03053-9&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is also noted that Luke downplays Roman involvement in Jesus' execution and places [[Responsibility for the death of Jesus|responsibility]] more on the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Gibson, Shelly Matthews, ''Violence in the New Testament'', Continuum International Publishing Group, pg. 132, 2005. ISBN 0-567-02500-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Knight, ''Luke's gospel'', Psychology Press, pg. 145, 2005. ISBN 0-415-17322-1&lt;/ref&gt; In Luke's Passion narrative, Jesus prays that God forgive those who crucify him and his assurance to a crucified thief that they will be together in Paradise.

===Resurrection appearances===
Luke's accounts differ from those in Mark and Matthew. Luke tells the story of two disciples on the road to Emmaus, and (as in John) Jesus appears to the Eleven and demonstrates that he is flesh and blood, not a spirit. Some scholars suggest that by writing of the &quot;flesh and bones&quot; properties of the resurrected Jesus, the author was making an [[apologetic]] response to [[docetic]] or [[gnostic]] views about Jesus' body, or to views that the disciples had merely seen his ghost. However, scholar Daniel A. Smith writes that the author was more likely concerned with those in Christian circles who may have believed that the resurrection as merely &quot;spiritual&quot; and that it could have occurred without the transformation of the natural body.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel A. Smith (2010) ''Revisiting the Empty Tomb: The Early History of Easter'', Fortress Press, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' commission (the [[Great Commission]]), to the disciples to carry his message to all the nations, affirms Christianity as a universal religion. The Book of Acts, also written by Luke to the same Theophilus, declares about Jesus that &quot;he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days...&quot; {{bibleverse||Acts|2:3|9}}

The detailed narration of the ''[[Road to Emmaus appearance]]'' in {{bibleverse||Luke|24:13-32|NIV}} is at times considered one of the best sketches of a biblical scene in the Gospel of Luke.&lt;ref&gt;''Luke for Everyone'' by Tom Wright, 2004 ISBN 0-664-22784-8 page 292&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Biblical canon]] --&gt;
{{See also|Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts}}
The earliest [[manuscript]]s of the Gospel of Luke are three extensive [[papyrus]] fragments dating from the late 2nd century or early 3rd century. [[Papyrus 4|P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;]] is probably the earliest,&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;Gregory (2003) p.27+30&lt;/ref&gt; dating from the late 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;P4 contains Lk 1:58-59, 62-2:1,6-7; 3:8-4:2,29-32,34-35; 5:3-8; 5:30-6:16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papyrus 75|P&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;]] dates from the late 2nd century/early 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;P75 contains Lk 3:18-4:2+; 4:34-5:10; 5:37-18:18+; 22:4-24:53 and [[Gospel of John|John]] 1:1-11:45, 48-57; 12:3-13:10; 14:8-15:10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Willker&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/%7Ewie/texte/Papyri-list.html Complete List of Greek NT Papyri]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally [[Papyrus 45|P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;]] (mid-3rd century) contains an extensive portion of all four Gospels. In addition to these major early papyri there are 6 other papyri ([[Papyrus 3|P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Papyrus 7|P&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Papyrus 42|P&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Papyrus 69|P&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Papyrus 82|P&lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Papyrus 97|P&lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;]]) dating from between the 3rd-8th century which also have small portions of Luke's Gospel.&lt;ref name=Willker&gt;Willker Last Update: 09.06.2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of New Testament papyri]]&lt;/ref&gt; The early copies, as well as the earliest copies of Acts, date after the Gospel was separated from Acts.

The [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]], 4th-century [[codex|codices]] of the Greek bible, are the oldest manuscripts that contain the full text of Luke. [[Codex Bezae]] is a 5th- or 6th-century [[Western text-type]] manuscript that contains Luke in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] versions on facing pages. This text-type appears to have descended from an offshoot of the main manuscript tradition, departing from more familiar readings at many points. Verses {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:19–20|31}} are omitted only in Codex Bezae and a handful of [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] manuscripts. Nearly all other manuscripts including Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus and Church Fathers contain the &quot;longer&quot; reading of Luke 22:19 and 20. Verse 22:20, which is very similar to {{bibleverse|1|Cor|11:25}}, provides the only gospel support for the doctrine of the [[New Covenant]]. Verses {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:43–44|31}} are found in Western text-type. But they are omitted by a diverse number of ancient witnesses and are generally marked as such in modern translations. See [[Bruce M. Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament'' for details.

==Disputed verses==
Some argue that early Christian scribes introduced numerous accidental and deliberate alterations into New Testament documents.&lt;ref name = &quot;May Metzger&quot;&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977. p. 1196&lt;/ref&gt; Textual critics have used principles of textual criticism to tentatively identify which variants are original.
Bart D. Ehrman cites two cases where [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox Christians]] may have altered the text in order to prevent its being used to support heretical beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bart D. Ehrman. Misquoting Jesus.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jesus is baptized, some early witnesses attest that Luke's gospel had [[God the Father]] say to Jesus, &quot;This day I have begotten you.&quot; In orthodox texts (and thus in most modern Bibles), this text is replaced by the text from Mark.  Ehrman concludes that the original text was changed because it had [[adoptionist]] overtones.

When Jesus prays in the garden of Gethsemane, the text refers to his being comforted by an angel and sweating drops like blood ([[Christ's agony at Gethsemane|verses 43-44]] in {{niv|Luke|22:40-46|Luke 22:40-46}}). These two verses disrupt the literary structure of the scene (the [[chiasmus]]), they are not found in all the early manuscripts, and they are the only place in Luke where Jesus is seen to be in agony. Ehrman concludes that they were inserted in order to counter [[doceticism]], the belief that Jesus, as divine, only ''seemed'' to suffer. While probably not original to the text, these verses reflect 1st-century tradition.&lt;ref name = &quot;May Metzger&quot;&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
