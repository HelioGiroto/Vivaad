{{Christian Eschatology}}
The '''Whore of Babylon''' or &quot;Babylon the Great&quot; is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[allegory|allegorical]] figure of [[evil]] mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]] in the [[Bible]]. Her full title is given as &quot;Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth.&quot; ({{lang-el|Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη, ἡ μήτηρ τῶν πορνῶν καὶ τῶν βδελυγμάτων τῆς γῆς}}; transliterated ''Babylōn ē Megalē, ē mētēr tōn pornōn kai tōn bdelygmatōn tēs Gēs''.)

==Symbolism==
The Whore is associated with the [[Antichrist]] and the [[the Beast (Revelation)|Beast of Revelation]] by connection with an equally evil kingdom. ''(The word &quot;Whore&quot; can also be translated as &quot;Idolatress&quot;.)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4204 πόρνη]: From Greek.

The Whore's [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] downfall is [[prophecy|prophesied]] to take place in the hands of the beast with seven heads and ten horns. There is much speculation within [[Christian eschatology]] on what the Whore and Beast symbolize as well as the possible implications for contemporary interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/a92.htm Rome or Jerusalem]?

The “great whore”, of the biblical book of Revelation is featured in chapters 17 and 18. Many passages define symbolic meanings inherent in the text.

||&lt;sup&gt;17:1&lt;/sup&gt;
||And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:2&lt;/sup&gt;
||With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. ''[&quot;Fornication&quot; is interpreted/translated as &quot;idolatry&quot; in the Amplified Bible (AMP), the New American Bible mentions &quot;harlotry&quot;]''
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:3&lt;/sup&gt;
||So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:4&lt;/sup&gt;
||And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:5&lt;/sup&gt;
||And upon her forehead was a name written a mystery: Babylon The Great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the Earth. ''[King James Version; the New International Version uses &quot;prostitutes&quot; instead of &quot;harlots&quot;].''
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:6&lt;/sup&gt;
||And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:9&lt;/sup&gt;
||And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sat. ''[King James Version; the New International Version Bible and the New American Bible use &quot;hills&quot; instead of &quot;mountains&quot;]''.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:10&lt;/sup&gt;
||And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:11&lt;/sup&gt;
||And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:12&lt;/sup&gt;
||And the ten horns which thou saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:15&lt;/sup&gt;
||And he said unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sat, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
||&lt;sup&gt;17:18&lt;/sup&gt;
||And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.

Some exegetes interpret the passage as a scathing critique of a servant people of Rome who do the Empire's bidding, interpreting that the author of Revelation was speaking of the [[Herodians]] - a party of Jews friendly to Rome and open to her influence, like the Hellenizers of centuries past - and later, corrupt [[Hasmoneans]], where the [[ethnarch|ruler]] of Jerusalem or [[Roman Judaea]] exercised his power at the pleasure of the Emperor, and was dependent on Roman influence, like [[Herod the Great]] in the [[Gospel according to Luke]].

In [[4 Ezra]] (2 Esdras/4 Esdras; see [[Esdras#Differences in names|the article on the naming conventions of the Books of Ezra]]),&lt;ref&gt;4 Ezra 3:1–2, 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; [[2 Baruch]]&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 10:1–3, 11:1, 67:7&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sibylline oracles]],&lt;ref&gt;Sibylline oracles 5.143, 159–60&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Babylon&quot; is a cryptic name for Rome.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ca/books?id=KuauhZijcb4C&amp;pg=PA69&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the [[New Testament]], in [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 5:13; some&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ca/books?id=4vUkZpLbOooC&amp;pg=PA41&lt;/ref&gt; speculate that &quot;Babylon&quot; is used to refer to Rome. In Revelation 17:9 it is said that she sits on &quot;seven mountains&quot; (the King James Version Bible—the New International Version Bible uses the words &quot;seven hills&quot;), typically understood as the [[seven hills of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Wall, R.

According to the ''[[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;''The characteristics ascribed to this Babylon apply to Rome rather than to any other city of that age: (a) as ruling over the kings of the earth (Revelation 17:18); (b) as sitting on seven mountains (Revelation 17:9); (c) as the center of the world's merchandise (Revelation 18:3, 11–13); (d) as the corrupter of the nations (Revelation 17:2; 18:3; 19:2); (e) as the persecutor of the saints (Revelation 17:6).''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/B/babylon-in-the-new-testament.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic Church===
====Pre-Reformation views====
[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] equated the [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[simony]] in the office of the Papacy with the Whore of Babylon in Canto 19 of his [[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]:

:''Di voi pastor s'accorse il Vangelista,
:quando colei che siede sopra l'acque
:puttaneggiar coi regi a lui fu vista. . .''
::(&quot;Shepherds like you the Evangelist had in mind when he saw the one that sits upon the waters committing fornication with the kings.&quot;)

====Reformational view====
{{See also|Antichrist (historicism)}}
[[File:Whore of Babylon 1522 Luther New Testament.jpg|thumb|Whore of Babylon wearing a [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] from a woodcut in [[Luther Bible|Luther's translation]] of the New Testament]]
[[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicist]] interpreters commonly used the phrase &quot;Whore of Babylon&quot; to refer to the Roman Catholic Church. [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] writers from [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) (who wrote ''[[On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church]]''), [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564), and [[John Knox]] (1510–1572) (who wrote ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]'') taught this association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bilhartz |first=Terry D. |editor= |title=Urban Religion and the Second Great Awakening |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pK_DqHjUfg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA115,M1 |year= |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=Madison, NJ |isbn=0-8386-3227-0 |page=115 |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edwards, Jr.|first=Mark |title=Apocalypticism Explained: Martin Luther, PBS.org|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/apocalypse/explanation/martinluther.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Church]] denies the claim that it is being referred to by the Book of Revelation as the Whore of Babylon.

Most early Protestant Reformers believed, and the modern [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] teaches, that in Bible prophecy a woman represents a church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=i18-QVydZp4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA807&amp;dq=bible+prophecy+woman+represents+church&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vbTITKuDFpHOvQPV8tyVCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commentary on Daniel and Revelation]. Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keys To Bible Symbols&quot;&gt;[http://www.bibleuniverse.com/articles/keys-to-bible-symbols.aspx Keys To Bible Symbols] see Woman, pure and Woman, corrupt on bottom of page&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I have likened the daughter of Zion To a lovely and delicate woman.&quot; (Jeremiah 6:2 {{smallcaps|[[nkjv]]}}) A harlot, it is argued, is representative of a church that has been unfaithful:

:&quot;Go, take yourself a wife of harlotry
:And children of harlotry,
:For the land has committed great harlotry
:By departing from the {{Lord}}.” (Hosea 1:2 {{smallcaps|[[nkjv]]}})&lt;ref&gt;See also &quot;They have committed adultery with their idols&quot; (Ezekiel 23:37).&lt;/ref&gt;

They also believed that the primary location of this unfaithful church is stated in the same chapter.

:&quot;And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.&quot; (Revelation 17:18)

The connection noted above on the [[seven hills of Rome]] is argued to locate the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walvoord, John F pg. 603-610&quot;&gt;Walvoord, John F. &quot;Every Prophecy of the Bible&quot;. pg. 603–610. ISBN 978-1-56476-758-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaHaye, Tim. &quot;Revelation Unveiled&quot;. pg. 262–271. ISBN 978-0-310-23005-2 (softcover).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mystery-babylon.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of the Pope as the Antichrist was written into Protestant creeds such as the [[Westminster Confession of Faith|Westminster Confession]] of 1646. The identification of the Roman Catholic Church with the Whore of Babylon is kept in the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' (whose 1917 edition identified &quot;ecclesiastical Babylon&quot; with &quot;apostate Christendom headed by the [[Holy See|Papacy]]&quot;).

====Traditionalist Catholic view====
Some [[traditionalist Catholic]]s who hold the position of [[Sedevacantism]], most notably the [[Most Holy Family Monastery]], believe that a counterfeit bride – a Counter-Catholic Church – will arise in the end times in order to deceive faithful Catholics; they teach that this counterfeit Church is the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after  the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Most&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/apocalypse.php|title= Is the Vatican II sect the Whore of Babylon prophesied in the Apocalypse?|publisher =[[Most Holy Family Monastery]]|accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seventh-Day Adventist view====
Because [[Ellen Gould White]], founder of the [[Seventh-Day Adventists]], concluded that &quot;Spiritual Babylon&quot; would have worldwide influence, affecting &quot;all nations&quot;, she wrote, in a book called ''[[The Great Controversy (book)|The Great Controversy]]'' (often reprinted as &quot;American in Prophecy&quot;: one of the large corpus of Ms White's writings), that Imperial Rome could not meet the criteria, as she wrote that it only had influence in the [[Old World]] (the New World had not yet been discovered at the time of Jesus). Thus, Ellen Gould White concluded that the true &quot;Whore of Babylon&quot; must be the &quot;Roman&quot; [[Catholic Church]] (disregarding the other 22 ''[[sui iuris]]'' [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches), giving lasting impetus and inspiration to the strong [[anti-Catholicism]] present throughout much of Adventism through its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crcbermuda.com/reference/ellen-white-books-g-m/great-controversy/1899-chap-3-an-era-of-spiritual-darkness The Great Controversy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jehovah's Witnesses view===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that the Whore of Babylon represents &quot;the world empire of false religion&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005146 What Does The Bible Really Teach - Jehovah's Witnesses Official Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; referring to all elements of worldly religions that do not adhere to biblical truth as published by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watchtower Bible and Tract Society]] (WTS) and as interpreted and defined by the [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses]] (the institutional and leadership organizations of Jehovah's Witnesses). This includes, but is not limited to, [[Christendom#JW|Christendom]], a term they use to refer to &quot;professed Christianity&quot; (Nominal Christianity) as opposed to &quot;true Christianity&quot;. Jehovah's Witnesses literature often mentions the Catholic religion when discussing &lt;em&gt;The Great Harlot&lt;/em&gt; of Babylon, and the subsequent attack on her by the political powers, signaling the beginning of the &quot;great tribulation&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1962, p. 229 par. 6 Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania | &quot;Christendom Has Failed God! After Her End, What?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1961, p. 229 par. 6 &quot;When All Nations Unite Under God's Kingdom&quot; Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania | Revelation 11:15-18:&lt;/ref&gt;

They believe that the harlot&amp;mdash;the empire of false religion and an enemy of God&amp;mdash;has persecuted God's prophets and people, and that 'false religion'&amp;mdash;all religion except for Jehovah's Witnesses&amp;mdash;commits and has committed &quot;fornication&quot; with the world's political and commercial elements.&lt;ref&gt;''What Does the Bible ''Really'' Teach?'' p. 219 par. 2 - p. 220 par. 3 published by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and theologians point out that although Rome was the prevailing pagan power in the 1st century when the Book of Revelation was written, the symbolism of the whore of Babylon refers not to an invading infidel of foreign power, but to an apostate false queen, a former &quot;bride&quot; who has been unfaithful and who, even though she has been divorced and cast out because of unfaithfulness, continues to falsely claim to be the &quot;queen&quot; of the spiritual realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/library/Hunting_the_Whore_of_Babylon.asp Hunting the Whore of Babylon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Connelly. &quot;The Indispensable Guide to Pratically Everything: Bible Prophecy and End Times&quot;. ISBN 978-0-8249-4772-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepreteristpost.com/t2-the-transformation-of-jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; This symbolism did not fit the case of Rome at the time. Proponents of this view suggest that the &quot;seven mountains&quot; in Rev 17:9 are the seven hills on which Jerusalem stands and the &quot;fall of Babylon&quot; in Rev 18 is the fall and [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD]]&lt;ref&gt;A commentary on the Apocalypse of John, Edmondo Lupieri, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;
The dress of the whore of Babylon is similar to the Jerusalem High Priest (Exodus 28:6).

Several Old Testament [[prophet]]s referred to Jerusalem as being a spiritual harlot and a mother of such harlotry (Isaiah 1:21; Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:1–11; Ezekiel 16:1–43; Ezekiel 23, Galatians 4:25). Some of the these Old Testament prophecies as well as the warnings in the New Testament concerning Jerusalem are in fact very close to the text concerning Babylon in Revelation, suggesting that John may well have actually been citing those prophecies in his description of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=NfVWbFl7fbUC&amp;pg=PA53 Revelation: The Apocalypse of St. John By John Drane, Richard Harries, p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in Matthew 23:34–37 and Luke 11:47–51, Jesus himself assigned all of the bloodguilt for the killing of the prophets and of the saints (of all time) to the Pharisees of Jerusalem, and, in Revelation 17:6 and 18:20,24, almost identical phrasing is used in charging that very same bloodguilt to Babylon. This is also bolstered by Jesus' statement that &quot;it's not possible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.&quot; (Luke 13:33).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=jJQXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA252 A new and original exposition of the book of Revelation, pp. 252–253]&lt;/ref&gt;
