== Fundamentalist Christianity ==
The name of this ought to be Fundamentalist Protestantism because it excludes examples of fundamentalism in non-Protestant groups such as Roman Catholicism or Eastern/Oriental Orthodoxy.
--[[Special:Contributions/96.227.235.245|96.227.235.245]] ([[User talk:96.227.235.245|talk]]) 23:29, 3 November 2009 (UTC)
: Are there any specific examples of &quot;fundamentalist&quot; groups within Roman-Catholicism or other Orthodoxy? [[User:Jwesley78|Jwesley78]] ([[User talk:Jwesley78|talk]]) 23:59, 3 November 2009 (UTC)

::Opus Dei perhaps? And I'm not simply talking about the anti-Christian/Catholic depictions as in certain recent novels. [[Special:Contributions/203.25.1.208|203.25.1.208]] ([[User talk:203.25.1.208|talk]]) 07:27, 15 January 2010 (UTC)

::: My impression has been that within Christianity, at least in the USA, the word &quot;fundamentalism&quot; generally refers to extremist, Biblical-literalist Protestantism.  While there are certainly extremist attitudes and movements in, for example, Roman Catholicism, they tend to focus on absolutist acceptance of the teachings of the Roman Church rather than the text of the Bible, and in my experience they are usually not described as &quot;fundamentalist.&quot;   (I'd never heard of &quot;fundamentalist Catholicism&quot; until I read this article.)

::: &quot;Fundamentalist Islam,&quot; on the other hand, is a commonly used term referring to extremist, militant Islam, although I don't know if there is a more specific definition, whether it is specific to Sunni or Shia Islam or whether either one can be &quot;fundamentalist,&quot; etc.  My impression has been that following the 2001 terrorist attacks, when &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot; started to be discussed a lot more in the US mainstream media (often in association with terrorist groups), it started becoming politically incorrect to use this word to describe Christians.  Around this time I noticed that Christians who had formerly been happy to describe themselves as fundamentalist suddenly seemed to start calling themselves &quot;evangelical&quot; instead (during the 16th century, &quot;evangelical&quot; was synonymous with &quot;Protestant&quot; or &quot;Lutheran,&quot; although it's mutated quite a bit since then), and it seemed like the mainstream media stopped calling militant Protestants &quot;fundamentalist,&quot; too, likewise substituting the term &quot;evangelical.&quot; [[User:Mia229|Mia229]] ([[User talk:Mia229|talk]]) 18:29, 20 July 2012 (UTC)

==Fundamentalist = Extremist?==

Without proper citation, I feel the following sentence should be removed form the opening section:
&quot;Some left-leaning and centrist Christians since the turn of the twentieth century have taken to the use of the word 'extremist' instead, feeling that use of 'fundamentalism' provides the views of such groups with an authority they do not deserve.&quot;

The fundamentalists beliefs are held by many mainstream protestant denominations (e.g., Southern Baptists, most Pentecostals, most Methodists, most Presbyterians), and many of these are even shared with the Catholic church.  To say that other (even &quot;centrist&quot;) Christians refer to fundamentalists as &quot;extremists&quot; seems unlikely.  Furthermore, I see no reason for the term &quot;fundamentalist&quot; to imply that they have more &quot;authority&quot;, but merely that they have a stricter set of beliefs.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jwesley78|Jwesley78]] ([[User talk:Jwesley78|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jwesley78|contribs]]) 03:28, 12 September 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I feel that the opening paragraph of this article uses the word 'militant' too freely. It almost implies that there will be a large section of &quot;people destroyed this and killed this in the name of...&quot;, however there is no such section. I personally group the words militant and extremist together, so if references to extremism were removed, what do you think about removing references to 'militant'? It implies a sort of violence associated with Fundamental Christianity, which this article does not portray. [[User:MattFromOntario|MattFromOntario]] ([[User talk:MattFromOntario|talk]]) 14:02, 11 April 2011 (UTC)
::militant = violent??? not in ordinary English usage. It means intense devotion to a  cause, and an eagerness to pick intellectual fights (not fist fights) [see the long Marsden quote at the end of this page] [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 14:10, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

The words evangelical should not be associated with Fundamentalism at all, Evangelical movement belongs in a differant category in and of itself!it should also be noted that there are multiple organizations that have been formed to represent Fundamentalist most of these are associated with the Baptist. as a Fundamentalist I know of no other groups in this era that call themselves Fundamentalist! in the early development of fundamentalism there were many groups that made an impact on the Fundamental movement such as R.A.Torrey,H.A.Ironsides,Johnathan Edwards,John Rice, and there were also the puritan authors who had some influence. In europe there was Charles Spurgeon and I almost forgot Charles Finney! One of the Biggest contentions with the fundamentalist were with the Roman Catholics and they shouldn't be included at all when discussing the beginings of fundamentalist! the Roman catholics teamed up with the evangelicals in the early seveties but have no place in Fundamentalism at all! (Oddtodd40)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Oddtodd40|Oddtodd40]] ([[User talk:Oddtodd40|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Oddtodd40|contribs]]) 02:30, 26 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: See my comment above about other uses the term &quot;evangelical&quot; has had (historically) and may have acquired (recently — the latter is just my opinion, mind you, but FWIW, I'm not the only one to have observed this trend).  The Evangelical movement that Oddtodd40 describes does sort of have some things in common with fundamentalism but is less extreme.  (The word &quot;evangelical&quot; derives from a Latinised form of the Greek word for &quot;gospel&quot; (Greek _eu_ &quot;good&quot; + _angelion_ &quot;message; news&quot; = Old English _gōdspel_ (_gōd_ &quot;good&quot; + _spel_ &quot;news; story&quot;) &gt; Modern English &quot;gospel&quot;), and was intended as a reference to the emphasis on Scriptural authority in proto-Protestantism early Protestantism (the teachings of Wycliffe, Hus, Luther, Calvin, et al.) and in the more recent Evangelical movement.)  The way that some fundamentalists seem to have shifted to calling themselves &quot;evangelical&quot; (presumably in an effort to make themselves appear more moderate and perhaps disassociate themselves from fundamentalist Islam, which I would say is strongly associated with terrorism in the minds of many Americans) may be causing some confusion about this.

: I take issue with the claim that many, let alone most, [[mainline Protestants]] have fundamentalist beliefs.  (Read the Wikipedia article if you don't believe me.)  It's true that *some* mainline Protestants (a term that refers to certain &quot;classic&quot; Protestant churches in the US and Canada — Anglican/Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Reformed, American (Northern) Baptist, Congregationalist, and Disciples of Christ.  Most of these were strongly influenced by the Lutheran, Anglican, Calvinist (Reformed/Presbyterian), and Wesleyan (Methodist) movements (the Disciples of Christ arose from an early 19th-century movement that was characterised mainly by an effort to renounce specific denominational beliefs and practises and become &quot;pure&quot; Christians).  (I'm not positive about the Moravian Church, which originated with the Czech [[Hussite]] church, although Hus's teachings were similar to, and perhaps largely based upon, those of Wycliffe, another Mediaeval theologian considered one of the fathers of the Protestant Reformation.  I would guess that it is, since the Moravian Church in the USA is in full communion with the Episcopal Church.)  Some members of these denominations share some beliefs with fundamentalists, and some churches within mainline denominations could be considered evangelical, but mainline denominations are not accurately described as &quot;fundamentalist.&quot;  Whether Southern Baptists count as &quot;mainline&quot; is rather dubious (the sources cited in the above-linked Wikipedia article don't seem to think so).  The Methodist and Presbyterian denominations are both more moderate, although they both include some Evangelical (*not* fundamentalist) churches; Pentecostalism is not considered &quot;mainline;&quot; and Mormonism is not even Protestant (&quot;mainline&quot; churches are by definition Protestant). 

: Regarding the idea that &quot;fundamentalist&quot; equates to &quot;authoritative&quot; — I'm not sure, but I think that may have been the original idea behind the coining of the term &quot;fundamentalist:&quot; fundamentalists wanted to paint themselves as basing their beliefs solely on Scripture, which for them is the highest authority.   (Of course, most of them don't know a word of Greek, let alone Hebrew, so they're basing their &quot;literal interpretation&quot; of the Bible on translations, often not even the most authoritative of translations!  Ironically, the &quot;King James only&quot; movement was started by fundamentalists and is still fundamentalist-dominated, even though the early-17th century KJV — which is widely considered by Biblical scholars familiar with the ancient languages of the original texts of Scripture to be more poetic than accurate in its translation — was commissioned by the head of the decidedly non-fundamentalist Church of England, King James I of England and VI of Scotland.  The translators — all Anglican clergy — were directed by the King to ensure that the new translation be consistent with Anglican theology.)

==Ecumenical analysis of the fundamentals==
Instead of asking whether fundamentalists are necessarily anti-Catholic, a good idea would be to analyze whether the fundamentalist doctrines are in any way shared by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. Many of their beliefs are similar or comparable, while others are not. [[User:ADM|ADM]] ([[User talk:ADM|talk]]) 00:12, 9 May 2009 (UTC)  

*Virgin birth : yes. The [[council of Ephesus]] authoritatively handed down this Gospel teaching. Catholics also believe in the Immaculate-Conception, which is a step further than the fundamentals.
*Inerrancy of Scripture : yes. It is affirmed at the Second Vatican Council's declaration [[Dei Verbum]].      
*Deity of Jesus : yes. This is a normative teaching of the ecumenical [[council of Nicea]].
*Subsitutionary atonment : yes. It was originally a Catholic doctrine that was borrowed by Calvinists during the Reformation.    
*Authenticity of miracles : yes. This is also affirmed by the document Dei Verbum.
*Bodily resurrection of Jesus : yes. This was notably affirmed by Catholic bishop [[Ignatius of Antioch]] against proponents of [[docetism]].
*Pre-millenial Second Coming : no. The Church teaches [[amillenialism]], a doctrine opposed to early beliefs on [[chiliasm]], and so its beliefs about the Second Coming are not the same as most fundamentalists.
*Sola scriptura : no. This view is not shared, since Catholic teaching holds that the Word of God and the Body of Christ are closely related.

:: First of all, could you sign your post?  It would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

:: Now, on to the actual topic...it's true that many of the beliefs of fundamentalists (sensu stricto) are also contained in Roman Catholic teaching (I'm not as familiar with Orthodox Christianity, e.g., so I'm going to stick to RC vs. fundamentalist).  However, until relatively recently, anti-Catholic sentiments were very common among American Protestants, including fundamentalists.  (General attitudes — even if held by clergy as well as laity — are distinct from *teachings*, of course, but this is a significant element that has separated the fundamentalist movement from strict RCism despite many similarities in their teachings.)  When [[JFK]] was running for President, he managed to answer to the satisfaction of the American Protestant majority the question that kept coming up about whether, if faced with a conflict between the laws or best interests of the United States and a demand by the Vatican (a foreign government).  A lot of American Protestants had viewed Roman Catholics as being unable to perform the duties of the President of the USA (and possibly other political or judicial offices) due to a perceived conflict of interest.

:: You noted the contrast concerning _sola scriptura_ (&quot;Scripture alone&quot; — i.e., all relevant teachings supposedly contained within the Bible), but you didn't note the various other &quot;solas&quot; which are common elements in the teachings of most Protestant denominations (if sometimes not interpreted in exactly the same way), presumably including fundamentalist ones.

:::* _sola fide_, &quot;faith alone&quot; — justification (I've never been clear on precisely what this means in Christian jargon) by faith alone, in contrast to good works (charitable deeds &amp; stuff like that)

:::* _sola Christus_, &quot;Christ alone&quot; — Christ as sole mediator between God and his people (this refers to a few things, notably that neither the clergy nor the Saints can act as mediators)

:::* _sola gratia_, &quot;grace alone&quot; — salvation is a gift from God, not dependent on the individual's merits but only on God's free grace

:::* _soli Deo gloria_, &quot;glory to God alone&quot; ̄ — only God himself is worthy of glory (not human beings, such as the church hierarchy (including the Popes) or the Saints)

::(The Wikipedia article on [[Protestantism]] goes into these in more depth, IIRC.)

:: Also, anyone know whether fundamentalists (sensu stricto) have a single consistent view on transubstantiation?

== Higher Criticism ==

To expand the Higher Criticism topic. American Bible Students were reacting to the aggressive and often poorly researched revisionist statements and claims being made by Higher Critics. Modern American Skeptics often raise well thought out objections to what they see as fabrication or fantasy in religion. The Higher critics of the 19th century were presenting a case as ridiculous as the Scopes Monkey Trial Case. The challenge to modern Fundamentalism is to address the New School of Skeptics who are far more challenging than the limp 19th centuary revisionist 'scholars'.[[User:Johnwrd|Johnwrd]] ([[User talk:Johnwrd|talk]]) 23:46, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
:Got a source we can use? Bowler suggests it was more to do with Modernists accepting progressive ideas, which the fundamentalists found problematic in relation to original sin. . [[User:Dave souza|dave souza]], [[User talk:Dave souza|talk]] 22:53, 5 July 2009 (UTC)
it should be noted that while catholics believe some of the same things they use a differant Bible version. in modern fundamentalism the king james is the only excepted Bible, It should be further noted that in the earlier years of this movement there were only two Bibles considered useful the King James and the revised standard which was abandoned when they discovered the many errors in the revised standard (Oddtodd40)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Oddtodd40|Oddtodd40]] ([[User talk:Oddtodd40|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Oddtodd40|contribs]]) 02:41, 26 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== What Is the Heritage Movement? ==

Under the Section &quot;Breakup&quot;, the following reference is made: &quot;Many groupings, large and small, were produced by this schism. Neo-evangelicalism, Reformed and Lutheran Confessionalism, the ''Heritage movement'', and Paleo-Orthodoxy have all developed distinct identities&quot;

Just what is the Heritage Movement?

I find nothing describing it in terms of religion in general or fundamentalism in particular.
From what I find it refers to the movement in England to preserve old buildings. The other terms all have researchable definitions, not so for Heritage Movement [[User:LAWinans|LAWinans]] ([[User talk:LAWinans|talk]]) 21:40, 5 July 2009 (UTC)


== Is this article meaningless? ==

In Feb 2008, Soxwon wrote &quot;''This article is in bad shape. There are no cites in the historical section, the definition of Fundamentalist Christianity can't seem to focus on anything meaningful, many schools of religion are given w/o elaboration as to their meaning or their role, lots of weasel words, a list of generalizations with almost no citations, and in general a lot of assertions that have no citations to back them up.''&quot;

That is still true.  The problem is that with the best will in the world, it is probably not possible to write a decent article on the subject, because the word &quot;fundamentalist&quot; is virtually meaningless.  Or, to be precise, it has several different definitions, and these vary according to time (the word is no longer used in the same way that it was used in the early 20th century), with place (the American usage is not quite the same as the British usage), and according to the circles one moves in (different groups of people use the word in different ways.)  Hence I believe that to have an article which describes something called &quot;Fundamentalist Christianity&quot; and tries to chart its history and development is simply not possible.  It may, however, be possible to have an article on the different ways in which the word is defined and understood.

::the solution perhaps is to closely follow the major scholarly studies -- the reliable sources such as books by Marsden, Sandeen,  and Balmer. I have tried to do this add have also added information based on the scholarly journals. They all agree that fundamentalism is especially characterized by aggressive attacks on liberal modernism.

::I agree with [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]]. The study of fundamentalist Christianity is a perfectly legitimate academic enterprise. Though there may be both broad and narrow ways of understanding the phenomenon, there are Wikipedia articles to cover the spectrum: one on Religious Fundamentalism in general, and individual articles on, e.g., various religious bodies that are part of the American fundamentalist movement. Studies like Martin Marty's (1987-1995) Fundamentalism Project at the University of Chicago would be good examples of thinking about the broader religious phenomenon, and George Marsden's work is an excellent example of the historical examination of the movement's origins and development within the U.S.[[Special:Contributions/134.2.162.84|134.2.162.84]] ([[User talk:134.2.162.84|talk]]) 13:40, 29 July 2011 (UTC)

==Fundamentalism and evangelicals==
The RS (eg Marsden, Baumer, Queen) agree that fundamentalism and evangelicalism are overlapping categories. for example the Southern Baptist denomination is both fundamentalist and evangelical. The distinction is one of style, with the more aggressive anti-liberal evangelicals called fundamentalists. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 05:18, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

:I agree that they are overlapping, per certain meanings of the terms, but even if we consider one a subset of the other, the langage I removed is misleading at best. The distinction is ''not'' just one of style. While I do not dispute that historians are RSs, the historian's meaning of &quot;fundamentalism&quot; is not the same as other meanings of &quot;fundamentalism&quot;-- ''and'' the historian's meaning of &quot;fundamentalism&quot; is a poor choice to treat as the main or only meaning in a Wikipedia article. 
:If you think such other ideas are able to be sorced, then sorce them. For example, the&quot;Southern Baptist denomination&quot; is not even unified under one theology or catagory. Each local church sets its own theology and practises. &lt;sup&gt;'''[[User:Carlaude|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;şṗøʀĸ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;şṗøʀĸ:&lt;/span&gt;''']] [[User talk:Carlaude|&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;τᴀʟĸ&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:47, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
::Per &quot;keep quote from Marsden&quot;-- if any of the text is a quoted from from Marsden then it needs quotations marks around it.

::good point about using quotation marks and I will add them.  Marsden actually says about fundamentalism, : 
:::''Briefly it was militantly anti-modernists Protestant evangelicalism.  Fundamentalists were evangelical Christians, close to the traditions of the dominant American revivalist establishment of the 19th century, who in the 20th-century militantly oppose both modernism in theology and the cultural cultural changes that modernism endorsed.  Militant opposition to modernism was what most clearly set off the fundamentalism from a number of closely related traditions, such as evangelicalism, revivalism, Pietism, the Holiness movement, millenarianism, Reformed confessionalism, The Baptist traditionalism, and other denomination orthodoxies.  Fundamentalism was a &quot;movement&quot; in the sense of a tendency or development in Christian thought that gradually took on its own identity as a patchwork coalition of representatives of other movements.  Although it developed a distinct life, identity, and eventually a subculture of its own, it never existed wholly independently of the older movements from which it grew.  Fundamentalism was a loose, diverse, and changing federation of cool belligerents united by their fierce opposition of modernist attempts to bring Christianity into line with modern thought.''

Andy, there are two scope issues here. 1) being the theological school based on the [[The Fundamentals|The Fundamentals or The Fundamentals: A Testimony To The Truth]] and 2) then wider issue of [[religious fundamentalism]] in its Christian form. What we need to do here is separate the theological terminology i.e. school of christian thought on [[The Fundamentals]] and it current application to many schools of religious thought that protest Industrialization/Modernity/Globalization/Secularism.

:As I have already said, either the article needs to be broader, or the title changed. As ResidentAnthropologist notes, the article is about a 'theological school', whereas someone coming to the article may well expect it to be about 'religious fundamentalism in its Christian form' - and treating it as a worldwide phenomenon, rather than the U.S.-centric viewpoint here. As it stands, the article seems to imply that 'religious fundamentalism in its Christian form' is only found amongst U.S. Protestants, whereas it is also evident amongst some Catholics, some Mormons (without going into the debate as to whether they are actually 'Christian' in the accepted sense), and no doubt elsewhere.

:::As I have already said, renaming the article is an option. The other is to revise the article so as to include 'religious fundamentalism in its Christian form' more generally. I have no particular wish one way or the other - one could argue that the broader definition is best covered by the general [[Religious Fundamentalism]] article, and that this article, given a less ambiguous name, can perfectly well cover the narrow definition - so nothing else needs to be done (other than maybe a hatnote). This is probably the simplest solution. I should make it clear that I'm no expert on the subject, and only arrived at the article through questions raised regarding the Norway shootings (and again, I'm not stating that the term 'Christian fundamentalist' is particularly relevant there - only that it was uses as a descriptor). If the world at large is using terms like 'Christian fundamentalist', one might expect Wikipedia to either cover the topic in 'global' terms, or to at least guide the reader to the appropriate article. As it stands, we do neither. So yes, renaming seems the logical path to follow. Does anyone have a suggestion for a title which clarifies the situation?

I seriously disagree with how the article has been changed over the past year. In the lede, &quot;fundamentalist&quot; seems to be equated with &quot;militantism&quot;.  This is clearly pushing the [[WP:POV|point of view]] of [[George M. Marsden]] to the exclusion of other alternative (and less negative) views. Compare this to the lede from a year ago [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fundamentalist_Christianity&amp;oldid=369832782 here], in which &quot;fundamentalism&quot; is described as referring to their &quot;fundamental&quot; beliefs, and &quot;fundamentalists&quot; identified themselves as such in opposition to &quot;[[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]]&quot;.  &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[User:Justin W Smith|Justin W Smith]]&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Justin W Smith|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Justin W Smith|stalk]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 20:32, 27 July 2011 (UTC)

If I was so surprised to see it as a Marsden-owned term, others will be too. That is not in any way a general view of the term and fundamentalism and pacifism can also happen together among many Christians. The definition needs to change to reflect that this is a special Marsden definition, not the general usage of the term in US English.

As another scholar points out, &quot;One of the major distinctives of fundamentalism is militancy.&quot; [''Millennialism in the Korean Protestant Church'' by Pak (2005) p. 211] A Catholic scholar says: &quot;Essentially, fundamentalists see themselves as defending authentic Christian religion ...

: [[User:ResidentAnthropologist]] is right.  There's an [[equivocation]] here.  The &quot;fundamentalism&quot; referred to by  Marsden in [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2218336 his 1977 article] is different.  Marsden distinguishes fundamentalism from what most would consider &quot;fundamentalism&quot; today, e.g., Evangelicalism and pentecostalism. He says: &quot;Fundamentalism shares traits with many other movements to which it has been related (such as pietism, evangelicalism, revivalism, conservatism, confessionalism, millenarianism, and the holiness and pentecostal movements), but it has been distinguished most clearly from these by its militancy in opposition to modernism. &quot; &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[User:Justin W Smith|Justin W Smith]]&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Justin W Smith|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Justin W Smith|stalk]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 23:19, 27 July 2011 (UTC)

:::But there is an often overlooked distinction between Evangelicals (including Pentecostals) and Fundamentalists in that they are radically more separatist in their dealings with non-Christian society if I'm not mistaken. And they are far more opposed to Pentecostals, where as Pentecostals are generally accepted among other Evangelicals, such as their membership in the NAE. So there is a distinction between Protestant Fundamentalist and Evangelicals. Evangelicals are softer in relation to culture and society while Fundamentalists strongly reject it. Isn't that right?

::The '''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' in its entry on Christian fundamentalism says this:

::{{quote|'''Christian fundamentalism'''    A reaction by Protestants in Britain and the United States from the 1800s onwards to modernist readings of the Bible which challenged the literal truth of the supernatural and miraculous episodes of biblical history, and the status of Scripture as a direct and unchallengeable revelation of the word of God. In particular, fundamentalists resisted the teaching of Darwinian evolutionary science in American public schools (culminating in the famous Scopes ‘Monkey trial’ in Tennessee in 1925 , in which a teacher was convicted under a state law which forbade the teaching of Darwinism ).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The more overtly political incarnation of Christian fundamentalism stems from the alliance of religious and political conservatism in the American South. From the 1970s onwards, groups such as the ‘Moral Majority’ became powerful populist lobbies in state and national politics on issues ranging from family and welfare policy to defence and foreign affairs, particularly during the Presidency of Ronald Reagan . }}

:::::::::My understanding of &quot;Christian fundamentalism&quot; as a distinct conservative Protestant movement today, is that it represents that wing of the original fundamentalist movement that called for strong opposition and separation from those denominations joining the Federal Council of Churches during the 1940s. They were represented instead by the [[American Council of Christian Churches]]. Those fundamentalists that opted for a less radical alternative opted to form the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and began to call themselves &quot;new evangelicals&quot; now simply evangelical. These new evangelicals were more tolerant of Pentecostals. Thus, evangelicalism is a softer form of fundamentalism, but they are not the same thing. Is the Marsden source online so I can look at it?

:::::The discussion seems to be going a bit astray.

It's also a matter of undue weight: since &quot;Christian fundamentalism&quot; isn't a theoretical or scholarly construct, but a common label found in everyday conversation and journalism, why is Marsden the definitive voice? The article doesn't say. If I were just a reader coming here to see the definition of &quot;Christian fundamentalism,&quot; the list of beliefs currently in the third paragraph might be more useful. The first paragraph emphasizes militancy, but militancy alone is not sufficiently defining, and the word &quot;militant&quot; appears only once more in the body text. So the problem is that the intro doesn't reflect &quot;relative emphasis&quot; in the article per [[WP:LEDE]]; neither Marsden nor militancy dominates the article in the way that the first paragraph leads one to expect.

[[Church militant]] has a venerable usage that far predates fundamentalism and goes to the earliest days of Christianity in the Roman Empire when a Christian believer was called &quot;miles&quot; (soldier) and a non Christian was called a civilian (&quot;paganus&quot;) on account of the stark difference in discipline between the two.

It wasn't meant to.  But most of the discussion I'm seeing here about the pros and cons of the term militant doesn't seem terribly informed about how long churches have called themselves that , or how it came to be so, so I figured linking [[church militant]] might help explain that it is not a recently applied exonym for a few sects like 'fundamentalist', rather it includes just about all churches.  As for the etymology of pagan, I think master etymologist [[Ernest  Weekley]] probably put it best, in his etymological dictionary.

== Proposed reshuffle of lede ==

Proposing to move around parts of the lede so it is more NPOV for first paragraph, so it looks like this:

&lt;&lt;Christian Fundamentalism, also known as Fundamentalist Christianity, or Fundamentalism,[1] arose out of British and American Protestantism in the late 19th century and early 20th century among evangelical Christians.[6] The founders reacted against liberal theology, actively asserted that the following ideas were fundamental to the Christian faith: the inerrancy of the Bible, Sola Scriptura, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and the imminent personal return of Jesus Christ.

The name is taken from the title of a series of essays published between 1910 and 1915 by the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now Biola University), The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth. The term &quot;Fundamentalism&quot; entered the English language in 1922 and is often capitalized when referring to the religious movement.[1] As an organized movement it began within Protestant churches—especially Baptist and Presbyterian—in the United States in the early 20th century. Many such churches adopted a &quot;fighting style&quot; and certain theological elements, such as Dispensationalism,[5] but since 1930 Fundamentalism has not been an organized movement and has no national body or official statement.

The term fundamentalist is controversial into the 21st century; it is often used to attack or ridicule an adherent (labelled &quot;fundy&quot; or &quot;fundie&quot;), although it was coined by movement leaders. Some who hold these beliefs reject the label of &quot;fundamentalism&quot;, seeing it as too pejorative[7] while to others it has become a banner of pride. Such Christians prefer to use the term fundamental as opposed to fundamentalist (e.g., Independent Fundamental Baptist and Independent Fundamental Churches of America).[8] This term is sometimes confused with Christian legalism.[9][10]&gt;&gt;

The rest of the lede (with all the &quot;militant&quot; business) would be moved to a new section on &quot;Historiography of Fundamentalism&quot;, a much-needed section anyway. [[User:Wikibojopayne|Wikibojopayne]] ([[User talk:Wikibojopayne|talk]]) 07:43, 25 August 2011 (UTC)

&lt;&lt;Fundamentalism is defined by historian George M. Marsden as &quot;militant anti-modernist Protestant evangelicalism.&quot; Marsden explains that Christian fundamentalists were American evangelical Christians who in the 20th century opposed &quot;both modernism in theology and the cultural changes that modernism endorsed. Militant opposition to modernism was what most clearly set off fundamentalism.&quot;[2] Other historians agree that militancy is a core characteristic of the movement.[3] The broader term &quot;evangelical&quot; includes the Fundamentalists as well as people with similar or identical religious beliefs who do not engage the outside challenge to the Bible as actively.[4]&gt;&gt;
::the first paragraph won't work.  It assumes falsely that the &quot;Fundamentals&quot; book defined the movement. It did not--it only provided the name. (Better read Marsden more closely) The movement began in the 1920s and leaving out all the key leaders is a serious blunder. In addition the confused passage about the terminology does not belong in the lede (it mixes up evangelical and fundamentalist approaches.

:::First, the book is mentioned the second paragraph, not the first. Second, it is not implied that the movement came from the book, but only that the movement got its name from the book. Third, I'm not adding any of this information to the lede; it's already there and I'm just shifting around the material. If there is an issue with the material, it's no skin off my back. --[[User:Wikibojopayne|Wikibojopayne]] ([[User talk:Wikibojopayne|talk]]) 07:28, 25 August 2011 (UTC)

I'm not saying either of these latter uses is right or wrong, just that people interpret the word differently.

== Church Militant ==

The term, '''militant''', is linked to an article entitled, '''The Church Militant''', which states &quot;the Church Militant (Ecclesia Militans), comprising Christians on earth who are living; Christian militia, who struggle against sin, the devil and &quot;..the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places&quot; (Ephesians 6:12).&quot;

Yes, the term &quot;Church Militant&quot; applies to Fundamentalists. However, the term &quot;militant&quot; does not since it connotes an entirely different meaning and agenda. According to the &quot;The Church Militant&quot; article, the term &quot;Church Militant&quot; should be applied evenly across the denominational and theological spectrum except for perhaps the most liberal Christian groups.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Stevizard|Stevizard]] ([[User talk:Stevizard|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stevizard|contribs]]) 13:46, 30 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
