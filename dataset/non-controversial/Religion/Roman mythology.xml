      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19571">[[File:Altar Mars Venus Massimo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|[[Romulus and Remus]], the [[Lupercal]], [[Father Tiber]], and the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] on a [[relief]] from a pedestal dating to the reign of [[Trajan]] (AD 98-117)]]
'''Roman mythology''' is the body of traditional stories pertaining to [[ancient Rome]]'s [[founding of Rome|legendary origins]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious system]], as represented in the [[Latin literature|literature]] and [[Roman art|visual arts of the Romans]]. &quot;Roman mythology&quot; may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period.

The Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism is an important theme. When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they are more concerned with ritual, [[augur]]y, and institutions than with [[theology]] or [[cosmogony]].&lt;ref&gt;John North, ''Roman Religion'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000) pp. 4ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Roman religion and [[myth]] is complicated by the early influence of [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]] on the [[Italian peninsula]] during Rome's [[protohistory]], and by the later artistic imitation of [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literary models]] by Roman authors.  The Romans were curiously eager to identify [[List of Roman deities|their own gods]] with those of the [[Greeks]] (see ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''), and reinterpret stories about [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek deities]] under the names of their Roman counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;North, ''Roman Religion'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome's early myths and legends also have a dynamic relationship with [[Etruscan religion]], less documented than that of the Greeks.

While Roman mythology may lack a body of divine narratives as extensive as that found in Greek literature,&lt;ref&gt;North, ''Roman Religion'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romulus and Remus]] suckling the she-wolf is as famous as any image from [[Greek mythology]] except for the [[Trojan Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Latin literature was more widely known in Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], the interpretations of Greek myths by the Romans often had the greater influence on narrative and pictorial representations of &quot;[[classical mythology]]&quot; than Greek sources. In particular, the versions of Greek myths in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', written during the reign of [[Augustus]], came to be regarded as [[canon (literary)|canonical]].

==The nature of Roman myth==
[[File:Rimini219.jpg|thumb|In this wall painting from [[Pompeii]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] looks on while the physician [[Iapyx]] tends to the wound of her son, [[Aeneas]]; the tearful boy is her grandson [[Ascanius|Ascanius, also known as Iulus]], legendary ancestor of [[Julius Caesar]] and the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]]]
Because [[ritual]] plays the central role in Roman religion that myth held for the Greeks, it is sometimes doubted that the Romans had much of a native mythology.  This perception is a product of [[Romanticism]] and the [[classics|classical scholarship]] of the 19th century, which valued Greek civilization as more &quot;authentically creative.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, ''The Myths of Rome'' (University of Exeter Press, 2004), preface (n.p.).&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century, however, Roman myths were an inspiration particularly for [[Western painting|European painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, ''The Myths of Rome'', preface.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman tradition is rich in historical myths, or [[legend]]s, concerning the foundation and rise of the city. These narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. In Rome's earliest period, history and myth have a mutual and complementary relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Grandazzi, ''The Foundation of Rome: Myth and History'' (Cornell University Press, 1997), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[T.P. Wiseman]] notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Roman stories still ''matter'', as they mattered to [[Dante]] in 1300 and [[Shakespeare]] in 1600 and the [[founding fathers of the United States]] in 1776. What does it take to be a [[Roman citizenship|free citizen]]? Can a [[superpower]] still be a [[republic]]? How does well-meaning [[authority]] turn into murderous [[tyranny]]?&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, ''The Myths of Rome'', preface.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Major sources for Roman myth include the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Vergil]]  and the first few books of [[Livy]]'s history. Other important sources are the ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' of [[Ovid]], a six-book poem structured by the [[Roman calendar|Roman religious calendar]], and the fourth book of elegies by [[Propertius]]. Scenes from Roman myth also appear in Roman [[wall painting]], [[Roman currency|coins]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]], particularly [[relief]]s.

===Founding myths===
:''Main article: [[Founding of Rome]].''
The ''Aeneid'' and Livy's early history are the best extant sources for [[Founding of Rome|Rome's founding myths]]. Material from Greek heroic legend was grafted onto this native stock at an early date.  The Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] was cast as husband of [[Lavinia]], daughter of King [[Latinus]], patronymical ancestor of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]],  and therefore through a [[Latin kings of Alba Longa|convoluted revisionist genealogy]] as forebear of [[Romulus and Remus]].  By extension, the Trojans were adopted as the mythical ancestors of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Lusus Troiae]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other myths===

The characteristic myths of Rome are often political or moral, that is, they deal with the development of [[Roman Constitution|Roman government]] in accordance with divine law, as expressed by [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], and with demonstrations of the individual's adherence to moral expectations ''([[mos maiorum]])'' or failures to do so.

==Religion and myth==
{{Ancient Roman religion}}
{{Main|Religion in ancient Rome}}
Divine narrative played  a more important role in the system of Greek religious belief than among the Romans, for whom ritual and cult were primary. Although Roman religion was not based on [[scriptures]] and [[exegesis]], priestly literature was one of the earliest written forms of [[Latin literature|Latin prose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses Hadas]], ''A History of Latin Literature'' (Columbia University Press, 1952), p. 15 [http://books.google.com/books?id=QnvOnY6ydngC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22commentarii+pontificum%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1932&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22commentarii%20pontificum%22&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The books ''(libri)'' and commentaries ''(commentarii)'' of the [[College of Pontiffs]] and of the [[augur]]s contained religious procedures, prayers, and rulings and opinions on points of religious law.&lt;ref&gt;C.O. Brink, ''Horace on Poetry. Epistles Book II: The Letters to Augustus and Florus'' (Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 64 [http://books.google.com/books?id=loI8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%22commentarii+pontificum%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1932&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22commentarii%20pontificum%22&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although at least some of this archived material was available for consultation by the [[Roman senate]], it was often ''occultum genus litterarum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De domo sua'' 138.&lt;/ref&gt; an arcane form of literature to which by definition only priests had access.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Linderski]], &quot;The ''libri reconditi'',&quot; ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 89 (1985) 207–234.&lt;/ref&gt; Prophecies pertaining to world history and Rome's destiny turn up fortuitously at critical junctures in history, discovered suddenly in the nebulous [[Sibylline books]], which according to legend were purchased by [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] in the late 6th century BC from the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]. Some aspects of archaic Roman religion were preserved by the lost theological works of the 1st-century BC scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], known through other classical and Christian authors.

[[File:Triade Capitolina img126.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Capitoline Triad]]]]
At the head of the earliest pantheon were the so-called [[Archaic Triad]] of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, whose [[Flamines maiores|flamens were of the highest order]], and Janus and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]. According to tradition, the founder of Roman religion was [[Numa Pompilius]], the [[Sabine]] second [[king of Rome]], who was believed to have had as his consort and adviser a Roman goddess or [[nymph]] of fountains and prophecy, [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]]. The Etruscan-influenced [[Capitoline Triad]] of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva later became central to official religion, replacing the Archaic Triad — an unusual example within [[Indo-European religion]] of a supreme triad formed of two female deities and only one male. The cult of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] was established on the [[Aventine Hill]], but the most famous Roman manifestation of this goddess may be [[Diana Nemorensis]], owing to the attention paid to her cult by [[J.G. Frazer]] in the [[mythography|mythographical]] classic ''The Golden Bough''.

The gods represented distinctly the practical needs of daily life, and they were scrupulously accorded the rites and offerings considered proper. Early Roman divinities included a host of &quot;specialist gods&quot; whose names were invoked in the carrying out of various specific activities. Fragments of old ritual accompanying such acts as plowing or sowing reveal that at every stage of the operation a separate deity was invoked, the name of each deity being regularly derived from the verb for the operation. [[Tutelary deity#Ancient Rome|Tutelary deities]] were particularly important in ancient Rome.

Thus, [[Janus]] and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] guarded the door and hearth, the [[Lares]] protected the field and house, [[Pales]] the pasture, [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] the sowing, [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] the growth of the grain, [[Pomona]] the fruit, and [[Consus]] and [[Ops]] the harvest. Even the majestic [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the ruler of the gods, was honored for the aid his rains might give to the farms and vineyards. In his more encompassing character he was considered, through his weapon of lightning, the director of human activity and, by his widespread domain, the protector of the Romans in their military activities beyond the borders of their own community. Prominent in early times were the gods [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]], who were often identified with each other. Mars was a god of war; he was honored in March and October. Quirinus is thought by modern scholars to have been the patron of the armed community in time of peace.

The 19th-century scholar [[Georg Wissowa]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Wissowa]], ''De dis Romanorum indigetibus et novensidibus disputatio'' (1892), full text (in Latin) [http://books.google.com/books?id=FYlbAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22De+dis+Romanorum+indigetibus+et+novensidibus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; thought that the Romans distinguished two classes of gods, the ''[[di indigetes]]'' and the ''di novensides'' or ''[[novensiles]]'': the ''indigetes'' were the original gods of the Roman state, their names and nature indicated by the titles of the earliest priests and by the fixed festivals of the calendar, with 30 such gods honored by special festivals; the ''novensides'' were later divinities whose cults were introduced to the city in the historical period, usually at a known date and in response to a specific crisis or felt need. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] and others, however, have argued that this distinction cannot be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnaldo Momigliano]], &quot;From Bachofen to Cumont,&quot; in ''A.D. Momigliano: Studies on Modern Scholarship''  (University of California Press, 1994), p. 319; Franz Altheim, ''A History of Roman Religion'', as translated by Harold Mattingly (London, 1938), pp. 110–112; [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North and S.R.F. Price. ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 158, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Hannibalic War|war with Hannibal]], any distinction between &quot;indigenous&quot; and &quot;immigrant&quot; gods begins to fade, and the Romans embraced diverse gods from various cultures as a sign of strength and universal divine favor.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922) pp. 157 and 319; J.S. Wacher, ''The Roman World'' (Routledge, 1987, 2002), p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign gods===
[[File:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mithras]] in a Roman wall painting]]
The absorption of neighboring local gods took place as the Roman state conquered the surrounding territory. The Romans commonly granted the local gods of the conquered territory the same honors as the earlier gods of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman state religion]]. In addition to [[Castor and Pollux]], the conquered settlements in Italy seem to have contributed to the Roman pantheon [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Minerva]], [[Hercules]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and deities of lesser rank, some of whom were Italic divinities, others originally derived from the Greek culture of [[Magna Graecia]]. In 203 BC, the cult object embodying [[Cybele]] was brought from [[Pessinus]] in [[Phrygia]] and welcomed with due [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#caerimoniae|ceremony]] to Rome, centuries before the territory was annexed formally. Both [[Lucretius]] and [[Catullus]], poets contemporary in the mid-1st century BC, offer disapproving glimpses of her wildly ecstatic cult.

In some instances, deities of an enemy power were formally invited through the ritual of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|evocatio]]'' to take up their abode in new sanctuaries at Rome.

Communities of foreigners ''([[Peregrinus (Roman)|peregrini]])'' and former slaves ''(libertini)'' continued their own religious practices within the city. In this way [[Mithras]] came to Rome and his popularity within the [[Roman army]] spread his cult as far afield as [[Roman Britain]]. The important Roman deities were eventually identified with the more [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] Greek gods and goddesses, and assumed many of their attributes and myths.
