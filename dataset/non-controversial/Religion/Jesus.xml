Bart Ehrman states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of Pontius Pilate is the most certain element about him. John Dominic Crossan states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be.

&lt;!--|ethnicity = [[Jews|Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy-Jill Levine]] writes that the entire category of ethnicity is itself fraught with with difficulty. Beyond recognizing that “Jesus was Jewish,” rarely does the scholarship address what being “Jewish” means. In the [[New Testament]], written in [[Koine Greek]], Jesus was referred to as an [[Ioudaios]] on three occasions, although he did not refer to himself as such. These three occasions are (1) by the [[Biblical Magi]] in [[Matthew 2]] who referred to Jesus as [[Jesus, King of the Jews|&quot;basileus ton ioudaion&quot;]]; (2) by the 
[[Samaritan woman at the well]] in [[John 4]] when Jesus was travelling out of Judea; and (3) by the Romans in all four gospels during [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]] who also used the phrase [[Jesus, King of the Jews|&quot;basileus ton ioudaion&quot;]] (''see [[John Elliott (historian)|John Elliott]] in the Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus 2007; 5; 119''). According to [[Amy-Jill Levine]], in light of the Holocaust, the Jewishness of Jesus increasingly has been highlighted.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

=== Year of birth ===
{{further|Anno Domini|Common Era|Year zero}}
Two independent approaches have been used to estimate the year of the birth of Jesus, one involving analysis of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] accounts in the Gospels of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] along with other historical data, and the other working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]], as also discussed in the next section.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 ISBN 0-310-31201-9 pages 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;

In its Nativity account, the Gospel of Matthew associates the birth of Jesus with the reign of [[Herod the Great]], who is generally believed to have died around 4 BC/BCE.&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 ISBN 0-86012-006-6 page 731&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] states that: &quot;Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king&quot; and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 /&gt; Luke's gospel also describes the birth as taking place during the [[Census of Quirinius|first census]], which is generally believed to have occurred in 6 AD/CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVermes2006|Vermes (2006)]] p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars generally assume a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC/BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars assume that Jesus was born sometime between 7 and 2 BC/BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the historians and Biblical scholars who place the birth and death of Jesus within this range include [[#refCarson1992|Carson et. al. (1992)]] pp. 54, 56&lt;br/&gt;[[#refGrant1977|Grant (1977)]] p. 71.&lt;br/&gt;[[#refMeier1991|Meier (1991)]] p. 214.&lt;br/&gt;[[#refSanders1993|Sanders (1993)]], pp. 10–11&lt;br/&gt;[[#refWitherington1998|Witherington (1998)]] No. 3:12–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The year of Jesus' birth has also been estimated in a manner that is independent of the Nativity accounts, by using information in the [[Gospel of John]] to work backwards from the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that Jesus was &quot;about 30 years of age&quot; at the start of his ministry.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt; As discussed in the section below, by combining information from [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] with the writings of [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]], it has been estimated that around 27–29 AD/CE, Jesus was &quot;about thirty years of age&quot;.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scarola /&gt; Some scholars thus estimate the year 28 AD/CE to be roughly the 32nd birthday of Jesus and the birth year of Jesus to be around 6–4 BC/BCE.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 ISBN 1-56338-347-0 pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Christian feasts related to the Nativity have had specific dates (e.g. December 25 for [[Christmas]]) there is no historical evidence for the exact day or month of the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''Aspects of the liturgical year in Cappadocia (325–430)'' by Jill Burnett Comings 2005 ISBN 0-8204-7464-9 pages 61–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Faith &amp; philosophy of Christianity'' by Maya George 2009 ISBN 81-7835-720-8 page 287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of Jesus' Birth'' by Edwin D.

There have been different approaches to estimating the date of the start of the ministry of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J.

In ''Chronos, kairos, Christos:'' Paul L. Maier specifically states that he considers the Temple visit date in John at &quot;around 29 AD/CE&quot;, using various factors that he summarizes in a chronology table. Maier's table considers 28 AD/CE to be roughly the 32nd birthday of Jesus, and at http://www.mtio.com/articles/aissar30.htm Paul Meir clearly states that 5 BC/BCE was the year of birth of Jesus. Paul N. Anderson dates the temple incident at &quot;around 26–27 AD/CE&quot; Jerry Knoblet estimates the date as around AD 27 AD/CE. In their book, Robert Fortna &amp; Thatcher estimate the date at around AD/CE 28. Köstenberger &amp; Kellum (page 140) make the same statement as Maier, namely that the 32nd birthday of Jesus was around 28 AD/CE when his ministry began.&lt;/ref&gt; A third method uses the date of the [[death of John the Baptist]] and the marriage of [[Herod Antipas]] to [[Herodias]] based on the writings of Josephus, and correlates it to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:4|Matthew 14:4]].&lt;ref name=AmyJill55 &gt;Craig Evans, 2006 &quot;Josephus on John the Baptist&quot; in ''The Historical Jesus in Context'' edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al.

Bromiley 1982 ISBN 0-8028-3782-4 pages 694–695&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimation of the date based on the Gospel of Luke relies on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]] that the ministry of [[John the Baptist]] which preceded that of Jesus began &quot;in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar&quot;.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt; Given that [[Tiberius]] began his reign in 14 AD/CE, this yields a date about 28–29 AD/CE.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdmans246 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ | last = Hoehner| first = Harold W | authorlink = Harold Hoehner|year= 1978|publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0-310-26211-9|pages= 29–37| url = http://books.google.com/?id=6z-NcR7fVSIC&amp;dq=CHronological+Aspects+of+the+Life+of+Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke states that John's ministry began in the fifteenth year of the reign of [[Tiberius Caesar]], when [[Pontius Pilate]] was governor of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], and [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] was [[tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]], and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of [[Iturea]] and [[Trachonitis]], and [[Lysanias]] was tetrarch of [[Abilene (biblical)|Abilene]], during the [[List of High Priests of Israel|high priesthood]] of [[Annas]] and [[Caiaphas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimation of the date based on the Gospel of John uses the statements in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:13|John 2:13]] that Jesus went to the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]] around the start of his ministry and in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] that &quot;Forty and six years was this temple in building&quot; at that time.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L.

[[File:Josephus Antiquitates Iudaice.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1466 copy of [[Antiquities of the Jews]].]]
A number of approaches have been used to estimate the year of the death of Jesus, including information from the [[canonical gospels]], the chronology of the life of [[Paul the Apostle]] in the New Testament correlated with historical events, as well as different [[astronomy|astronomical]] models, as discussed below.

The 4 gospels report that Jesus was crucified by [[Pontius Pilate]], who governed Judaea from 26 to 36 AD/CE. Jewish historian Josephus,&lt;ref name=Theissen64 &gt;[[#refTheissen1998|Theissen (1998)]] pp. 64–72&lt;/ref&gt; writing in ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (''c.'' 93 AD/CE), and the early 2nd century Roman historian [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref name=Theissen81 &gt;[[#refTheissen1998|Theissen (1998)]] pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt; writing in ''[[The Annals]]'' (''c.'' 116 AD/CE), also state that Pilate ordered the execution of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Joel B.|year=1997|title=The Gospel of Luke : new international commentary on the New Testament|page=168|url=http://books.google.com/?id=koYlW6IoOjMC&amp;pg=PR85&amp;dq=Joel+B.+Green,+The+Gospel+of+Luke,+(Eerdmans,+1997),+page+168|isbn=0-8028-2315-7|publisher=W.B.

The estimation of the date of the [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|conversion of Paul]] places the death of Jesus before this conversion, which is estimated at around 33–36 AD/CE.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner /&gt; The estimation of the year of Paul's conversion relies on a series of calculations working backwards from the well established date of his trial before [[Junius Annaeus Gallio|Gallio]] in [[Achaea]] Greece ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#18:12|Acts 18:12–17]]) around 51–52 AD/CE, the meeting of [[Priscilla and Aquila]] which were expelled from Rome about 49 AD/CE and the 14-year period before returning to Jerusalem in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#2:1|Galatians 2:1]].&lt;ref name=Barnett19 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesner &gt;''Paul's early period: chronology, mission strategy, theology'' by [[Rainer Riesner]] 1997 ISBN 978-0-8028-4166-7 page 19–27 (page 27 has a table of various scholarly estimates)&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining period is generally accounted for by Paul's missions (at times with [[Barnabas]]) such as those in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#11:25|Acts 11:25–26]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/2 Corinthians#11:23|2 Corinthians 11:23–33]], resulting in the 33–36 AD/CE estimate.&lt;ref name=Barnett19 &gt;''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times'' by Paul Barnett 2002 ISBN 0-8308-2699-8 pages 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger77 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J.

[[Isaac Newton]] was one of the first astronomers to estimate the date of the crucifixion and suggested Friday, April 23, 34 AD/CE.&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton|Newton, Isaac]] (1733). &quot;[[s:Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel/Part I Chap XI|Of the Times of the Birth and Passion of Christ]]&quot;, in ''[[s:Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel|Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 astronomer [[Bradley E.

Although the four canonical gospels, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], are the main sources for the biography of Jesus’ life, other parts of the New Testament, such as the [[Pauline epistles]] which were likely written decades before them, also include references to key episodes in his life such as the [[Last Supper]], as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|1 Corinthians 11:23–26]].&lt;ref name=Blomb442 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fahlbusch52 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans465 &gt;The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary'' by Craig A.

Three of the four canonical gospels, namely Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are known as the [[synoptic Gospels]], from the Greek σύν (syn &quot;together&quot;) and ὄψις (opsis &quot;view&quot;), given that they display a high degree of similarity in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure.&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament Theology by Paul Haffner'' 2008 ISBN 88-902268-0-3 page 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to the Gospels'' by W. Graham Scroggie 1995 ISBN 0-8254-3744-X page 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{OED|synoptic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation in the fourth canonical gospel, i.e. John, differs from these three in that it has more of a thematic nature rather than a narrative format.&lt;ref name=Moloney3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the synoptic gospels and the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Moloney3 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' by Francis J. Moloney, Daniel J. Harrington 1998 ISBN 0-8146-5806-7 page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in general, the authors of the New Testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 ISBN 0-86012-006-6 pages 730–731&lt;/ref&gt; The gospels were primarily written as theological documents in the context of [[early Christianity]] with the chronological timelines as a secondary consideration.&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 &gt;''Interpreting Gospel Narratives: Scenes, People, and Theology'' by Timothy Wiarda 2010 ISBN 0-8054-4843-8 pages 75–78&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of the gospels being theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Turner613 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 ISBN 0-8010-2684-9 page 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiarda75 /&gt;&lt;ref name = autogenerated5&gt;[[#refSanders1993|Sanders (1993)]] p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#21:25|John 21:25]] the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Gerald3 &gt;''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus'' by [[Gerald O'Collins]] 2009 ISBN 0-19-955787-X pages 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2nd century attempts have been made to ''[[Gospel harmony|harmonize]]'' the gospel accounts into a single narrative; [[Tatian]]'s [[Diatesseron]] perhaps being the first.&lt;ref name=Lancel &gt;''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'' by John C.

The five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus are his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].&lt;ref name=digby &gt;''Essays in New Testament interpretation'' by Charles Francis Digby Moule 1982 ISBN 0-521-23783-1 page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key'' by Vigen Guroian 2010 ISBN 0-8028-6496-1 page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 /&gt; These are usually bracketed by two other episodes: his Nativity at the beginning and the [[Pentecost|sending]] of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] at the end.&lt;ref name=digby /&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 &gt;''Scripture in tradition'' by John Breck 2001 ISBN 0-88141-226-0 page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel accounts of the teachings of Jesus are often presented in terms of specific categories involving his &quot;works and words&quot;, e.g. his [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] and [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]].&lt;ref name=Zuck100 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary'' by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 ISBN 0-88207-812-7 page 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WPent212 &gt;''The words and works of Jesus Christ'' by J. Dwight Pentecost 2000 ISBN 978-0-310-30940-6 page 212&lt;/ref&gt;

The gospels include a number of discourses by Jesus on specific occasions, e.g. the [[Sermon on the Mount]] or the [[Farewell Discourse]], and also include over 30 parables, spread throughout the narrative, often with themes that relate to the sermons.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated174&quot;&gt;''All the Parables of the Bible'' by Herbert Lockyer 1988 ISBN 978-0-310-28111-5 page 174&lt;/ref&gt; Parables represent a major component of the teachings of Jesus in the gospels, forming approximately one third of his recorded teachings, and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:10|John 14:10]] positions them as the revelations of [[God the Father]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JDPentecost10&quot;&gt;J.

=== Genealogy and Nativity ===
{{Gospel Jesus}}
{{Main|Genealogy of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus}}
The accounts of the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogy]] and Nativity of Jesus in the New Testament appear only in the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew. While there are documents outside of the New Testament which are more or less contemporary with Jesus and the gospels, many shed no light on the more biographical aspects of his life and these two gospel accounts remain the main sources of information on the genealogy and Nativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot; /&gt;

Matthew begins his gospel in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:1|1:1]] with the genealogy of Jesus, and presents it before the account of the birth of Jesus, while Luke discusses the genealogy in chapter 3, after the Baptism of Jesus in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:22]] when the voice from Heaven addresses Jesus and identifies him as the [[Son of God]].&lt;ref name=MaryBrown /&gt; At that point Luke traces Jesus' ancestry through [[Adam]] to God.&lt;ref name=MaryBrown &gt;''Mary in the New Testament'' by Raymond Edward Brown 1978 ISBN 0-8091-2168-9 page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nativity is a prominent element in the Gospel of Luke. It comprises over 10% of the text, and is three times the length of the nativity text in Matthew.&lt;ref name=Craddock &gt;{{cite book |author=Boring, M.

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:31|Luke 1:31-38]] Mary learns from the angel [[Gabriel]] that she will conceive and bear a child called Jesus through the action of the Holy Spirit. When Mary is due to give [[Virgin birth of Jesus|birth]], she and Joseph travel from [[Nazareth]] to Joseph's ancestral home in Bethlehem to register in the [[census of Quirinius]]. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#2:1|Luke 2:1–7]]. Mary gives birth to Jesus and, having found no place in the inn, places the newborn in a [[manger]]. An [[Annunciation to the shepherds|angel visits the shepherds]] and sends them to [[Adoration of the shepherds|adore the child]] in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#2:22|Luke 2:22]]. After presenting Jesus at the Temple, Joseph and Mary return home to Nazareth.&lt;ref name=&quot;marsh37&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of biblical tradition'' by David L. Jeffrey 1993 ISBN 0-8028-3634-8 pages 538–540&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his betrothal to Mary, Joseph is troubled in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:19|Matthew 1:19–20]] because Mary is pregnant, but in the first of [[St. Joseph's dream|Joseph's three dreams]] an angel assures him not be afraid to take Mary as his wife, because her child was conceived by the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Talbert29 &gt;''Matthew'' by Charles H. Talbert 2010 ISBN 0-8010-3192-3 pages 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 1:1–12]], the [[Biblical Magi|Wise Men]] or [[Magi]] bring gifts to the young Jesus as the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]. King Herod hears of Jesus' birth, but before the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] Joseph is [[St. Joseph's dream|warned by an angel in his dream]] and the family [[Flight to Egypt|flees to Egypt]], after which they return and settle in Nazareth.&lt;ref name=Talbert29 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris Matthew&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L.

=== Early life and profession ===
{{Main|Child Jesus}}
{{See also|Return of young Jesus to Nazareth}}
In the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, Jesus’ childhood home is identified as the town of Nazareth in [[Galilee]]. Joseph, husband of Mary, appears in descriptions of Jesus’ childhood and no mention is made of him thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Saint Joseph: His Life and His Role in the Church Today'' by Louise Bourassa Perrotta 2000 ISBN 0-87973-573-2 pages 21 and 110–112&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, and [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] mention Jesus’ brothers and sisters, but the Greek word ''adelphos'' in these verses, has also been translated as brother or kinsman.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A–D'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1979 ISBN 0-8028-3781-6 page 551&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:3|Mark 6:3]] Jesus is called a ''tekton'' (τέκτων in Greek), usually understood to mean [[carpenter]]. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:55|Matthew 13:55]] says he was the son of a ''tekton''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vine1940&quot; /&gt;{{rp|170}} ''Tekton'' has been traditionally translated into English as &quot;carpenter&quot;, but it is a rather general word (from the same root that leads to &quot;technical&quot; and &quot;technology&quot;) that could cover makers of objects in various materials, even builders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | title = An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon: The Seventh Edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek–English Lexicon | publisher = Clarendon Press | place = Oxford | page = 797 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, John ''Jesus: A Short Life'', Lion Hudson , 2008, ISBN 0-8254-7802-2 pages 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the New Testament accounts, the specific association of the profession of Jesus with woodworking is a constant in the traditions of the 1st and 2nd centuries and [[Justin Martyr]] (d. ca. 165) wrote that Jesus made [[yoke]]s and [[plough]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fiensy, David ''Jesus the Galilean'' Gorgias Press, 2007, ISBN 1-59333-313-7 page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baptism and temptation ===
{{Main|Baptism of Jesus|Temptation of Christ|John the Baptist}}

In the gospels, the accounts of the Baptism of Jesus are always preceded by information about John the Baptist and his ministry.&lt;ref name=Blomberg224 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellum141 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 ISBN 978-0-8054-4365-3 page 141–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alister16 /&gt; In these accounts, John was preaching for penance and repentance for the remission of sins and encouraged the giving of [[alms]] to the poor (as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:11|Luke 3:11]]) as he baptized people in the area of the River Jordan around [[Perea (Holy Land)|Perea]] about the time of the commencement of the ministry of Jesus. The Gospel of John ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:28|1:28]]) specifies &quot;Bethany beyond the Jordan&quot;, i.e. [[Bethabara]] in Perea, when it initially refers to it and later
[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:23|John 3:23]] refers to further baptisms in [[Ænon]] &quot;because there was much water there&quot;.&lt;ref name=BigPic &gt;''Big Picture of the Bible - New Testament'' by Lorna Daniels Nichols 2009 ISBN 1-57921-928-4 page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sloyan11 &gt;''John'' by Gerard Stephen Sloyan 1987 ISBN 0-8042-3125-7 page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The four gospels are not the only references to John's ministry around the River Jordan. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#10:37|Acts 10:37–38]], Peter refers to how the ministry of Jesus followed &quot;the baptism which John preached&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2003&quot;/&gt; In the [[Antiquities of the Jews]] (18.5.2) 1st century historian Josephus also wrote about John the Baptist and his eventual death in Perea.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 ISBN 90-5356-503-5 page 583&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Behold the Man: The Real Life of the Historical Jesus'' by Kirk Kimball 2002 ISBN 978-1-58112-633-4 page 654&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teachings and preachings ===
{{Main|Sermon on the Mount|Parables of Jesus}}
{{See also|Sermon on the Plain|Five Discourses of Matthew|Farewell Discourse|Olivet Discourse}}
[[File:Jesus-Christ-from-Hagia-Sophia.jpg|thumb|upright|Jesus Christ [[Pantocrator]] – ancient [[mosaic]] from [[Hagia Sophia]].]]

In the New Testament the teachings of Jesus are presented in terms of his &quot;words and works&quot;.&lt;ref name=Zuck100 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WPent212 /&gt; The words of Jesus include a number of sermons, as well as [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] that appear throughout the narrative of the synoptic gospels (the Gospel of John includes no parables). The works include the [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]] and other acts performed during his ministry.&lt;ref name=WPent212 /&gt; Although the canonical gospels are the major source of the teachings of Jesus, the [[Pauline epistles]], which were likely written decades before the gospels, provide some of the earliest written accounts of the teachings of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Blomb442 &gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 ISBN 0-8054-4482-3 pages 441–442&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament does not present the teachings of Jesus as merely his own preachings, but equates the words of Jesus with divine revelation, with John the Baptist stating in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:34|John 3:34]]: &quot;he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God&quot; and Jesus stating in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#7:16|John 7:16]]: &quot;My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me&quot; and again re-asserting that in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:10|John 14:10]]: &quot;the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated98&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=And108 &gt;''The missions of Jesus and the disciples according to the Fourth Gospel'' by Andreas J.

Bromiley 1988 ISBN 0-8028-3785-9 page 571–572&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Matthew'' by Charles H. Talbert 2010 ISBN 0-8010-3192-3 page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Parables represent a major component of the teachings of Jesus in the gospels, the approximately thirty parables forming about one third of his recorded teachings.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated174&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JDPentecost10&quot; /&gt; The parables may appear within longer sermons, as well as other places within the narrative.&lt;ref name=Howick7 &gt;''The Sermons of Jesus the Messiah'' by E. Keith Howick 2003 ISBN 978-1-886249-02-8 pages 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' parables are seemingly simple and memorable stories, often with imagery, and each conveys a teaching which usually relates the physical world to the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lisco9-11&quot;&gt;Friedrich Gustav Lisco 1850 ''The Parables of Jesus'' Daniels and Smith Publishers, Philadelphia pages 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashton Oxenden, 1864 The parables of our Lord? William Macintosh Publishers, London, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracle of Jesus also often include teachings, providing an intertwining of his &quot;words and works&quot; in the gospels.&lt;ref name=WPent212 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated95&quot;/&gt; Many of the miracles in the gospels teach the importance of faith, for instance in [[Cleansing ten lepers]] and [[Daughter of Jairus]] the beneficiaries are told that they were healed due to their faith.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Donahue, Daniel J. Harrington. ''The Gospel of Mark.'' Zondervan 1981.

At about the middle of each of the three synoptic gospels, two related episodes mark a turning point in the narrative: the Confession of Peter and the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=KingsburyMark &gt;''The Christology of Mark's Gospel'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury 1983 ISBN 0-8006-2337-1 pages 91–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barton132 &gt;The Cambridge companion to the Gospels'' by Stephen C. Barton ISBN 0-521-00261-3 pages 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes begin in [[Caesarea Philippi]] just north of the [[Sea of Galilee]] at the beginning of the final journey to [[Jerusalem]] which ends in the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Karris &gt;''The Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament'' by Robert J. Karris 1992 ISBN 0-8146-2211-9 pages 885–886&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes mark the beginnings of the gradual disclosure of the identity of Jesus to his disciples; and his prediction of his own suffering and death.&lt;ref name=Lee21 &gt;''Transfiguration'' by Dorothy A.

Peter's Confession begins as a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:13|Matthew 16:13]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#8:27|Mark 8:27]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:18|Luke 9:18]].

Harrington 2002 ISBN 0-8146-5965-9 page 336&lt;/ref&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:17|Matthew 16:17]] Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and states: &quot;flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.&quot; In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles ''[[Christ]]'' and ''[[Son of God]]'' which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his [[God the Father|Father in Heaven]] had revealed it to Peter.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneTeacher&quot;&gt;''One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 ISBN 3-11-018151-7 pages 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneTeacher&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus God and Man'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 1968 ISBN 0-664-24468-8 pages 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] appears in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#17:1|Matthew 17:1–9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#9:2|Mark 9:2–8]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:28|Luke 9:28-36]].&lt;ref name= Lee21 /&gt;&lt;ref name= Nobbs &gt;''The Content and the Setting of the Gospel Tradition'' by Mark Harding, Alanna Nobbs 2010 ISBN 978-0-8028-3318-1 pages 281–282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barton132&gt;The Cambridge companion to the Gospels'' by Stephen C.

=== Final week: betrayal, arrest, trial, and death ===
The description of the last week of the life of Jesus (often called the [[Passion week]]) occupies about one third of the narrative in the canonical gospels.&lt;ref name=Turner613 /&gt; The narrative for that week starts by a description of the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|final entry]] into Jerusalem, and ends with his crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Blomberg224 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cox155 /&gt;

[[File:Juan de Juanes 003.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The [[Last Supper]] has been depicted by many artistic masters.&lt;ref name=Zuffi &gt;''Gospel figures in art'' by Stefano Zuffi 2003 ISBN 978-0-89236-727-6 pages 254–259&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey which Jesus had started in Galilee through [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] and Judea.&lt;ref name=Cox155 /&gt; Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Gospel of John includes the [[Raising of Lazarus]] episode, which builds the tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to that tension.&lt;ref name=Cox155 /&gt;

During the week of his &quot;final ministry in Jerusalem&quot;, Jesus visits the Temple, and has a [[Cleansing of the Temple|conflict with the money changers]] about their use of the Temple for commercial purposes. This is followed by a debate with the priests and the elder in which [[Authority of Jesus Questioned|his authority is questioned]]. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot]], decides to [[Bargain of Judas|betray Jesus]] for [[thirty pieces of silver]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockyer106 &quot; /&gt;

Towards the end of the week, Jesus has the [[Last Supper]] with his disciples, during which he institutes the [[Eucharist]], and prepares them for his departure in the [[Farewell Discourse]]. After the supper, Jesus is [[Kiss of Judas|betrayed with a kiss]] while he is in [[agony in the garden]], and is [[Arrest of Jesus|arrested]]. After his arrest, Jesus is abandoned by most of his disciples, and [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies him]] three times, as [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|Jesus had predicted]] during the Last Supper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox182 &quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans 2005 ''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John's Gospel, Hebrews-Revelation'' ISBN 0-7814-4228-1 page 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is first [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|questioned by the Sanhedrin]], and is then [[Pilate's Court|tried by Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea. During these trials Jesus says very little, and is mostly silent. After the [[Flagellation of Christ|scourging of Jesus]], and his mocking as the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] Pilate orders the crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to the New Testament Christology'' by Raymond E. Brown, 1994 ISBN 0-8264-7190-0 pages 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Senior&quot; /&gt;

Thus the final week that begins with his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem|entry into Jerusalem]], concludes with his crucifixion and burial on that Friday, as described in the next 5 sub-sections. The New Testament accounts then describe the [[resurrection of Jesus]] three days later, on the Sunday following his death.

In the four canonical gospels, Jesus' [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] takes place at the beginning of the last week of his life, a few days before the [[Last Supper]], marking the beginning of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion narrative]].&lt;ref name=M133 &gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 ISBN 1-931018-31-6 pages 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boring256 &gt;''The people's New Testament commentary'' by M.

In the three synoptic gospels, entry into Jerusalem is followed by the [[Cleansing of the Temple]] episode, in which Jesus expels the money changers from the Temple, accusing them of turning the Temple to a den of thieves through their commercial activities.

[[File:Juan de Juanes 002.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Jesus with the [[Eucharist]] (detail), by [[Juan de Juanes]], mid–late 16th century.]]
In the New Testament, the Last Supper is the final meal that Jesus shares with his [[Twelve Apostles#The Twelve Apostles|twelve apostles]] in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels, and Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#11:23|11:23–26]]), which was likely written before the gospels, also refers to it.&lt;ref name=Fahlbusch52 &gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, 2005 ISBN 978-0-8028-2416-5 pages 52–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CEvans465&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:20|Matthew 26:20]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:17|Mark 14:17]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:21–23|Luke 22:21–23]] [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#13:1|John 13:1]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCox180 &gt;[[#refCox2007|Cox (2007)]] pp. 180–191&lt;/ref&gt;

In all four gospels, during the meal, Jesus [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|predicts that]] one of his Apostles will betray him.&lt;ref name=Cox182 &gt;[[#refCox2007|Cox (2007)]] p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is described as reiterating, despite each Apostle's assertion that he would not betray Jesus, that the betrayer would be one of those who were present. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:23|Matthew 26:23-25]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#13:26|John 13:26-27]] Judas is specifically singled out as the traitor.&lt;ref name=Fahlbusch52 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans465 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox182 &quot;/&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:26|Matthew 26:26-29]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:22|Mark 14:22-25]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:19|Luke 22:19-20]] Jesus takes bread, breaks it and gives it to the disciples, saying: &quot;This is my body which is given for you&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fahlbusch52 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ODCC&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church / editors, F. L. Cross &amp; E. A. Livingstone 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3, article ''Eucharist''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread and wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:58|John 6:58-59]] (the [[Bread of Life Discourse]]) has a Eucharistic nature and resonates with the &quot;words of institution&quot; used in the synoptic gospels and the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 ISBN 90-5356-503-5 page 792&lt;/ref&gt;

In all four gospels Jesus predicts that Peter will deny knowledge of him, stating that Peter will disown him three times before the [[rooster]] crows the next morning. The synoptics mention that after the [[arrest of Jesus]] Peter denied knowing him three times, but after the third denial, heard the rooster crow and recalled the prediction as Jesus turned to look at him. Peter then began to cry bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;''Peter: apostle for the whole church'' by Pheme Perkins 2000 ISBN 0-567-08743-3 page 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel according to Matthew, Volume 1'' by Johann Peter Lange 1865 Published by Charles Scribner Co, NY page 499&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel of John provides the only account of Jesus washing his disciples' feet before the meal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris John&quot; &gt;Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. &quot;Matthew&quot; pp. 272–85.&lt;/ref&gt; John's Gospel also includes a long sermon by Jesus, preparing his disciples (now without Judas) for his departure. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:1|Chapters 14-17]] of the Gospel of John are known as the ''[[Farewell discourse]]'' given by Jesus, and are a rich source of [[Christology|Christological]] content.&lt;ref name=Gail142 &gt;''John'' by Gail R.

While in the Garden, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] appears, accompanied by a crowd that includes the Jewish priests and elders and people with weapons. Judas [[the kiss of Judas|gives Jesus a kiss]] to identify him to the crowd who then arrests Jesus.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; One of Jesus' disciples tries to stop them and uses a sword to cut off the ear of one of the men in the crowd.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; Luke states that Jesus [[miracles of Jesus|miraculously healed]] the wound and John and Matthew state that Jesus criticized the violent act, insisting that his disciples should not resist his arrest. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:52|Matthew 26:52]] Jesus makes the well known statement: ''[[Live by the sword, die by the sword|all who live by the sword, shall die by the sword]]''.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;

Prior to the arrest, in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:31|Matthew 26:31]] Jesus tells the disciples: &quot;All ye shall be offended in me this night&quot; and in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:32|32]] that: &quot;But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.&quot; After his arrest, Jesus' disciples go into hiding.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;

After questioning, with few replies provided by Jesus, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus innocent, but the crowd insists on punishment.

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:53|Mark 14:53]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:54|Luke 22:54]] Jesus was taken to the high priest's house where he was mocked and beaten that night.

In the gospel accounts Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defense and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the questions of the priests, prompting an officer to slap him. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:62|Matthew 26:62]] the lack of response from Jesus prompts the high priest to ask him: &quot;Answerest thou nothing?&quot;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:67|Matthew 26:67]] [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:65|Mark 14:65]] [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:63|Luke 22:63-65]] [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:22|John 18:22]]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:61|Mark 14:61]] the high priest then asked Jesus: &quot;Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&quot; And Jesus said, &quot;I am&quot; — at which point the high priest tore his own robe in anger and accused Jesus of blasphemy. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:70|Luke 22:70]] when asked: &quot;Are you then the Son of God?&quot; Jesus answers: &quot;You say that I am&quot; affirming the title [[Son of God]].&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke's presentation of Jesus: a christology'' by Robert F.

Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate.&lt;ref name=Niswonger /&gt; Pilate then calls together the Jewish elders, and says that he has &quot;found no fault in this man.&quot;&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

The use of the term king is central in the discussion between Jesus and Pilate.

The trial by Pilate is followed by the [[Flagellation of Christ|flagellation]] episode, the soldiers mock Jesus as the King of Jews by putting a purple robe (that signifies royal status) on him, place a [[Crown of Thorns]] on his head, and beat and mistreat him in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#27:29|Matthew 27:29-30]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#15:17|Mark 15:17-19]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#19:2|John 19:2-3]].&lt;ref name=Senior&gt;''The Passion of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew'' by Donald Senior 1985 ISBN 0-89453-460-2 page 124&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is then sent to Calvary for crucifixion.&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;

After the trials, Jesus made his way to [[Calvary]] (the path is traditionally called [[via Dolorosa]]) and the three synoptic gospels indicate that he was assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]], the Romans compelling him to do so.&lt;ref name=Evans2003 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A.

The soldiers then crucified Jesus and cast lots for his clothes.

A number of [[relic]]s associated with Jesus have been claimed and displayed throughout the history of Christianity. Some people believe in the authenticity of some relics; others doubt the authenticity of various items. For instance, the sixteenth century Catholic theologian [[Erasmus]] wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics, and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the [[True Cross|cross]] used in the [[Crucifixion of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dillenberger|1999|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, while experts debate whether Christ was crucified with three or with four nails, at least thirty [[Holy Nail]]s continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;HN&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle =Holy Nails|title=Holy Nails|first= Herbert|last=Thurston}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some relics, such as purported remnants of the [[Crown of Thorns]], receive only a modest number of pilgrims, others such as the [[Shroud of Turin]] (which is associated with an approved [[Catholic devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]]) receive millions of pilgrims, which in recent years have included [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Pope John Paul II|authorlink=Pope John Paul II|title=Pope John Paul II's address in Turin Cathedral|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_24051998_sindone_en.html|publisher=Holy See|date=1998-05-24|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=== Analysis of the gospels ===
{{Main|Higher criticism|Textual criticism|Historical reliability of the Gospels}}
The historical-critical method (or higher criticism) is used to examine the Bible for clues about the historical Jesus, whereby sayings and events that are more likely to be genuine in the opinion of scholars are used to construct their portraits of Jesus. Standard historical methods are used to discern the authorship of each book, and its likely date of composition.&lt;ref name = &quot;JInt&quot;&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Jesus, Interrupted]], HarperCollins, 2009. ISBN 0-06-117393-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[extant text]]s which refer to Jesus are [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s letters (mid-1st century), which affirm Jesus' crucifixion. Keulman and Gregory hold that the [[Gospel of Thomas]], a collection of 114 sayings of Jesus, predates the four orthodox gospels, and believe it may have been composed around mid-1st century.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Keulman, Critical Moments in Religious History, Mercer University Press, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew F. Gregory, Christopher Mark Tuckett, The Reception of the New Testament in the Apostolic Fathers, Oxford University Press, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Synoptic problem Markan priority.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[Markan priority]] hypothesis.]]
Biblical scholars hold that the works describing Jesus were initially communicated by [[oral history|oral tradition]], and were not committed to writing until several decades after Jesus' crucifixion. After the original oral stories were written down in Greek, they were transcribed, and later translated into other languages. The books of the New Testament had mostly been written by 100 AD/CE, making them, at least the synoptic gospels, historically relevant.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The New Testament was complete, or substantially complete, about AD 100, the majority of the writings being in existence twenty to forty years before this...the situation is encouraging from the historian's point of view, for the first three gospels were written at a time when many were alive who could remember the things that Jesus said and did... At any rate, the time elapsing between the evangelic events and the writing of most of the New Testament books was, from the standpoint of historical research, satisfactorily short.&quot; Bruce, F. F.: ''The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?'', pp. 12–14, InterVarsity Press, USA, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel tradition certainly preserves several fragments of Jesus' teaching.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There is no reason to doubt that we have in the Gospel tradition several authentic fragments of His [Jesus Christ's] teaching (albeit in Greek translation).&quot; &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Markan priority]] hypothesis holds that the Gospel of Mark was written first ''c.'' 70 AD/CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/mark.html|title=Early Christian Writings: Gospel of Mark|accessdate=2008-01-15|last=Peter|first=Kirby|date=2001–2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Achtemeier|first=Paul J.|encyclopedia=The Anchor Bible Dictonary|title=The Gospel of Mark|year=1991–|publisher=Doubleday|volume=4|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-385-19362-9|page=545|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meier|first=John P.|authorlink=John P.

The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: [[Oxford University Press]]. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Q source]] hypothesis supported by a majority of modern scholars, the gospels were written not by the [[four evangelists]] themselves but derived from other sources.&lt;ref name = &quot;JInt&quot;/&gt; A minority of prominent scholars, such as J. A. T. Robinson, have maintained that the writers of the gospels of Matthew, Mark and John were either apostles and eyewitness to Jesus' ministry and death, or were close to those who had been.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyd, Gregory P 370-380&quot;&gt;Boyd, Gregory. &quot;The Jesus Legend: The Case for the Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition&quot;.

Scholars use [[textual criticism]] to determine which variants among manuscripts is original and how much they may have changed. Contemporary textual critic [[Bart D. Ehrman]] cites numerous places where he maintains that the gospels, and other New Testament books, were apparently altered by Christian scribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MisJ&quot; /&gt; [[Craig Blomberg]], [[F. F. Bruce]] and [[Greg Boyd (theologian)|Gregory Boyd]] view the evidence as conclusive that very few [[interpolation|alterations]] were made by Christian scribes, while none of them (three or four in total) were important.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyd, Gregory P 370-380&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Strobel, Lee 1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce, F.F. 1981&quot;/&gt; According to Normal Geisler and William Nix, &quot;The New Testament, then, has not only survived in more manuscripts than any other book from antiquity, but it has survived in a purer form than any other great book─a form that is 99.5% pure&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce, F.F. 1981&quot;/&gt;{{rp|p.367}}

=== Historical analysis ===

====Historicity of events====
{{Main|Historicity of Jesus}}
[[Image:P52 recto.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|P52]], a papyrus fragment from a codex (''c''. 90–160), one of the earliest known New Testament manuscripts.]]
Modern scholars consider the [[baptism of Jesus]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]] to be the two historically certain facts about him, [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] stating that these &quot;two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent&quot;.&lt;ref name=JDunn339&gt;''''Jesus Remembered'' by James D. G. Dunn 2003 ISBN 0-8028-3931-2 page 339&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn states that these two facts &quot;rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts&quot; that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt; [[Bart Ehrman]] states that the crucifixion of Jesus on the orders of [[Pontius Pilate]] is the most certain element about him.&lt;ref&gt;''A Brief Introduction to the New Testament'' by Bart D. Ehrman  2008 ISBN 0-19-536934-3 page 136&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dominic Crossan]] states that the crucifixion of Jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crossan, John Dominic |title=Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography |isbn=0-06-061662-8 |year=1995 |publisher=HarperOne |quote=That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be, since both Josephus and Tacitus...agree with the Christian accounts on at least that basic fact. |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Craig Blomberg]] states that most scholars in the third [[quest for the historical Jesus]] consider the crucifixion indisputable.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'' by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 ISBN 0-8054-4482-3 pages 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; Although scholars agree on the historicity of the crucifixion, they differ on the reason and context for it, e.g. both [[E.P. Sanders]] and [[Paula Fredriksen]] support the historicity of the crucifixion, but contend that Jesus did not foretell of his own crucifixion, and that his prediction of the crucifixion is a Christian story.&lt;ref name=Ernest125/&gt; [[Geza Vermes]] also views the crucifixion a historical event but provides his own explanation and background for it.&lt;ref name=Ernest125&gt;''A Century of Theological and Religious Studies in Britain, 1902–2002'' by Ernest Nicholson 2004 ISBN 0-19-726305-4 pages 125–126&lt;/ref&gt; [[John P. Meier]] views the crucifixion of Jesus as historical fact and states that based on the ''[[criterion of embarrassment]]'' Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.&lt;ref name=JMeier126&gt;John P. Meier &quot;How do we decide what comes from Jesus&quot; in ''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight 2006 ISBN 1-57506-100-7 pages 126–128&lt;/ref&gt; Meier states that a number of other criteria, e.g. the criterion of ''[[multiple attestation]]'' (i.e. confirmation by more than one source), the ''criterion of coherence'' (i.e. that it fits with other historical elements) and the ''criterion of rejection'' (i.e. that it is not disputed by ancient sources) help establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event.&lt;ref name=JMeier132&gt;John P. Meier &quot;How do we decide what comes from Jesus&quot; in ''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight 2006 ISBN 1-57506-100-7 pages 132–136&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portraits of Jesus====
{{Main|Historical Jesus|Quest for the historical Jesus}}
Although scholars agree on basic historical facts such as the crucifixion of Jesus, the various &quot;portraits of Jesus&quot; they construct often differ from each other, and from the descriptions found in the gospels.&lt;ref name=ScottK117 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 ISBN 978-0-8054-4365-3 pages 117–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jesus 1993 p. 57&quot;&gt;[[#refSanders1993|Sanders (1993)]] p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The portraits of Jesus constructed by scholars often share a number of common, and at times overlapping building blocks, such as healer, philosopher, sage, apocalyptic preacher, or social reformer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunn47 &quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=ScottK117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fredriksen&quot; /&gt; However, Bart Ehrman and separately Andreas Köstenberger contend that given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life.&lt;ref name=ScottK117 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehrman22&gt;''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium'' by Bart D. Ehrman 1999 ISBN 0-19-512473-1 pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans337 &gt;''Studying the Historical Jesus: Evaluations of the State of Current Research'' by Craig A. Evans 1998 ISBN 90-04-11142-5 pages 337–341&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars have suggested caution when reading modern meanings into terms such as rabbi at Jesus' time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Galilean Jewishness of Jesus: retrieving the Jewish origins of Christianity'', Bernard J. Lee, (Paulist Press, 1988), page 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Jesus the title rabbi was merely a general title for &quot;teachers of the Law&quot; and did not involve an official appointment.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer Dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 ISBN 0-86554-373-9 page&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Hengel]] states that as a &quot;teacher of Wisdom&quot;, Jesus was not a typical representatives of the official establishment of the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Early Christology'' by Martin Hengel 1995 ISBN 0-567-09705-6 page 93&lt;/ref&gt; William Herzog states that although Jesus was called a rabbi and a teacher he rejected the title rabbi in the synoptic gospels and did not identify himself with the established notion of rabbi at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Prophet and teacher: an introduction to the historical Jesus'' by William R. Herzog 2005 ISBN 0-664-22528-4 page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

An attribute used by many scholars to describe Jesus is a healer, a number of the same scholars also stating that he preached the restoration of God's kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;TM1998&quot;&gt;[[#refTheissen1998|Theissen (1998)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= autogenerated7&gt;[[Robert W.

=== First century Jewish religious movements ===
Scholars refer to the religious background of the early 1st century to better reconstruct Jesus' life. Some scholars identify him with one or another group.

'''[[Pharisees]]''' were a powerful force in 1st-century Judaea. Early Christians shared several beliefs of the Pharisees, such as resurrection, retribution in the next world, angels, human freedom, and Divine Providence.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pharisees&quot;, Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Temple, the Pharisaic outlook was established in Rabbinic Judaism. Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a Pharisee.&lt;ref&gt;Based on a comparison of the gospels with the [[Talmud]] and other Jewish literature. [[Hyam Maccoby|Maccoby, Hyam]] ''Jesus the Pharisee,'' Scm Press, 2003. ISBN 0-334-02914-7; Falk, Harvey ''Jesus the Pharisee: A New Look at the Jewishness of Jesus,'' Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers (2003). ISBN 1-59244-313-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jesus' day, the two main schools of thought among the Pharisees were the [[House of Hillel]], which had been founded by the eminent [[Tannaim|Tanna]], [[Hillel the Elder]], and the [[House of Shammai]]. Jesus' assertion of hypocrisy may have been directed against the stricter members of the House of Shammai, although he also agreed with their teachings on divorce.{{Bibleref2c|Mk|10:1–12}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Neusner|Neusner, Jacob]] (2000). ''A Rabbi Talks With Jesus''. Montreal; Ithaca: McGill-Queen's University Press. ISBN 978-0-7735-2046-2. Rabbi Neusner contends that Jesus' teachings were closer to the House of Shammai than the House of Hillel.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus also commented on the House of Hillel's teachings ([[Babylonian Talmud]], [[Shabbat]] 31a) concerning the [[Shema Yisrael|greatest commandment]]{{Bibleref2c|Mk|12:28–34}} and the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]].{{Bibleref2c|Mt|7:12}} Historians do not know whether there were Pharisees in Galilee during Jesus' life, or what they would have been like.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActJ&quot;&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Sadducees]]''' were particularly powerful in Jerusalem. They accepted the written Law only, rejecting the traditional interpretations accepted by the Pharisees, such as belief in retribution in an afterlife, resurrection of the body, angels, and spirits. After Jesus caused a disturbance at the Temple, it was to have been the Sadducees who had him arrested and turned over to the Romans for execution. After the fall of Jerusalem, they disappeared from history.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sadducees&quot;. Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Essenes]]''' were apocalyptic [[asceticism|ascetics]], one of the three (or four) major Jewish schools of the time, though they were not mentioned in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Based on a comparison of the gospels with the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], especially the [[Teacher of Righteousness]] and Pierced Messiah. [[Robert Eisenman|Eisenman, Robert]] ''James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 1998. ISBN 0-14-025773-X; [[Hartmut Stegemann|Stegemann, Hartmut]] ''The Library of Qumran: On the Essenes, Qumran, John the Baptist, and Jesus.'' Grand Rapids MI, 1998. See also Broshi, Magen, &quot;What Jesus Learned from the Essenes&quot;, ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]],'' 30:1, pg. 32–37, 64. Magen notes similarities between Jesus' teachings on the virtue of poverty and divorce, and Essene teachings as related in Josephus' ''The Jewish Wars'' and in the [[Damascus Document]] of the Dead Sea Scrolls, respectively. See also Akers, Keith ''The Lost Religion of Jesus.'' Lantern, 2000. ISBN 1-930051-26-3&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars theorize that Jesus was an Essene, or close to them. Among these scholars is [[Pope Benedict XVI]], who supposes in his book on Jesus that &quot;it appears that not only John the Baptist, but possibly Jesus and his family as well, were close to the Qumran community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI, Jesus of Nazareth, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Zealots]]''' were a revolutionary party opposed to Roman rule, one of those parties that, according to Josephus inspired the fanatical stand in Jerusalem that led to its destruction in the year 70 AD/CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross-2005-Zealots&quot;&gt;&quot;Zealots&quot;. Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Luke identifies Simon, a disciple, as a &quot;zealot&quot;, which might mean a member of the Zealot party (which would therefore have been already in existence in the lifetime of Jesus) or a zealous person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross-2005-Zealots&quot; /&gt; The notion that Jesus himself was a Zealot does not do justice to the earliest Synoptic material describing him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mythical view ===
{{Main|Christ myth theory}}
{{See also|Jesus Christ in comparative mythology|Quest for the historical Jesus}}

The term &quot;Christ myth theory&quot; is an umbrella term that applies to a range of arguments that in one way or another question the authenticity of the existence of Jesus or the essential elements of his life as described in the Christian gospels.&lt;ref name=GertTh23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Haber27 /&gt;&lt;ref name=VVoorst7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Haber47 /&gt; One viewpoint is that there was no real historical figure Jesus and that he was invented by Christians. Another viewpoint is that there was a person called Jesus, but much of the teachings and miracles attributed to him were either invented or symbolic references.

[[File:David Friedrich Strauß sitzend mit Buch.jpg|thumb||150px|[[David Strauss]], the 19th century founder of Christ myth theory.&lt;ref name=Camb214 /&gt;]]
Among the variants of the Jesus myth theory, the notion that Jesus never existed has little scholarly support, and although some modern scholars adhere to it, they remain a distinct minority; most scholars involved with historical Jesus research believe that his existence can be established using documentary and other evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;voorst16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=CambridgeJesus /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;powell168&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weaver71&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britac2006&quot;/&gt;

In the context of historical theories, the hypothesis that Jesus never existed is a rather recent topic, and in antiquity his existence was never doubted, even by those who were critical of Christian teachings.&lt;ref name=Rahner730 /&gt; In the early 18th century, friction between the church establishment and some theologians, coupled with the growing emphasis on [[rationalism]], resulted in discord between the English [[Deism|deists]] and the church, and [[John Toland]], [[Anthony Collins]] and [[Thomas Woolston]] planted the seeds of discontent.&lt;ref name=Camb214 &gt;The Cambridge companion to Jesus by Markus N.

The beginnings of the formal denial of the existence of Jesus can be traced to late 18th-century France, and the works of [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Constantin-Volney]] and [[Charles François Dupuis|Charles Dupuis]].&lt;ref name=Weaver45 &gt;''The historical Jesus in the twentieth century, 1900–1950'' by Walter P.

By the beginning of the 20th century, [[Arthur Drews]], [[William Benjamin Smith|William B. Smith]] and [[John M. Robertson]] became the most recognized proponents of the Christ myth theory.&lt;ref name=Weaver45 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVanVoorst2000|Van Voorst (2000)]] pp. 11–15&lt;/ref&gt; However, these authors were not performing purely [[atheist]] attacks on Christianity, e.g. Drew did not consider religion as outdated, but argued for a different form of religious consciousness.&lt;ref name=Weaver45 /&gt; W. B. Smith argued for a symbolic interpretation of gospel episodes and contended that in a parable such as [[Jesus and the rich young man]] the rich young man never existed and symbolically referred to the land of Israel.&lt;ref name=Weaver55 &gt;''The historical Jesus in the twentieth century, 1900–1950'' by Walter P. Weaver 1999 ISBN 1-56338-280-6 pages 55–59&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also argued that Jesus never healed anyone physically, but only spiritually cured them of their paganism.&lt;ref name=Weaver55 /&gt; J. M. Robertson on the other hand viewed the gospel accounts as a collection of myths gathered by a large number of anonymous authors, over time.&lt;ref name=Weaver55 /&gt;

When [[Marxist–Leninist atheism]] became part of the state ideals in communist Russia in 1922, the theories of Arthur Drew gained prominence there.&lt;ref name=Leslie729 /&gt; The communist state not only supported the Christ myth theory but embellished it with scientific colloquialisms, and school textbooks began to teach that Jesus never existed, making Russia a bastion of Jesus denial.&lt;ref name=Leslie729 &gt;''Jesus: the complete guide'' by Leslie Houlden page 729&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Russia after Lenin: politics, culture and society, 1921–1929'' by Vladimir N.

In the 20th century, scholars such as [[George Albert Wells|G. A. Wells]], [[Alvar Ellegård]], and [[Robert M. Price]] produced a number of arguments to support the Christ myth theory. Non-scholarly works on the Jesus myth theory have since been published by mass-media authors such as [[Earl Doherty|Doherty]], [[Timothy Freke|Freke]] and [[Peter Gandy (author)|Gandy]]. In parallel, a number of historians and biblical scholars such as [[Paula Fredriksen]], [[Geza Vermes]], [[E.P. Sanders]] and others involved in the [[quest for the historical Jesus]] performed detailed analyses of historical and biblical documents. Almost all of these scholars accept the existence of Jesus, but differ on the accuracy of the details of his life within the biblical narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Graham. ''The Gospels and Jesus''.

The Christ myth theory is still being debated in the 21st century, with [[Graham Stanton]] stating in 2002 that the most thorough analysis of the theory had been by G. A. Wells.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Graham. ''The Gospels and Jesus''. Oxford University Press, 2002; first published 1989, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; But Wells' book ''[[Did Jesus Exist?]]'' was criticized by [[James D.G.

Dunn]], 1985 ''The Evidence for Jesus'' ISBN 0-664-24698-2 page 29&lt;/ref&gt; And the debates continue, e.g. Wells changed his views over time and while he used to argue that there was no historical evidence supporting the existence of Jesus, he later modified his position, and in his later book ''The Jesus Myth'' accepted the possible existence of Jesus based on historical sources, although still disputing the gospel portrayals of his life.&lt;ref name= Houlden660 &gt;''Jesus in history, thought, and culture: an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by James Leslie Houlden 2003 ISBN 1-57607-856-6 page 660&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= VVoorst14 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Familiar stranger: an introduction to Jesus of Nazareth'' by Michael James McClymond 2004 ISBN 0-8028-2680-6 page 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Well's views see: G.A.

== Religious perspectives ==
{{Main|Religious perspectives on Jesus}}
Apart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do Jews today. For their part, Christian [[Church Fathers]], [[Ecumenical Council]]s, Reformers, and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. [[Christian sect]]s and [[Christian schisms|schisms]] have often been defined or characterized by competing descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, [[Manichaeans]], [[Gnostics]], Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their own religious accounts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge companion to Jesus'' edited by Markus N.

=== Christian views ===
{{Main|Jesus in Christianity|Christology}}
{{see also|Christian denominations}}
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize key elements of the shared beliefs among major denominations based on their [[catechism|catechetical]] or [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] texts.&lt;ref name=CathLuther1 &gt;Jackson, Gregory Lee, ''Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison'' 1993 ISBN 978-0-615-16635-3 Part One: &quot;Areas of Agreement&quot;, pages 11–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Orthodox Church: An Introduction to Its History, Doctrine'' by John Anthony McGuckin 2010 pages 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Basic Christian doctrine'' by [[John H. Leith]] 1993 ISBN 0-664-25192-7 pages 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, but especially from the [[canonical Gospels]], and New Testament letters, such as the [[Pauline Epistles|Letters of Paul]] and [[Johannine writings]]. 

These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his [[God the Son|divinity]], [[Hypostatic union|humanity]], and earthly life. Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the [[Son of God]] and the ''[[Christ]]''. In the New Testament Jesus indicates that he is the Son of God by calling God his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneTeacher&quot;/&gt; However, not all [[Christian denominations]] agree on all doctrines, and both [[East–West Schism|major and minor differences]] on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Great Schism&quot;, Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians consider Jesus the [[Christ]] and believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be [[reconciliation (theology)|reconciled to God]] and thereby are offered [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' p.649&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of the [[God the Father|Eternal Father]], as an &quot;agent and servant of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anselm &gt;''The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury'' by Dániel Deme 2004 ISBN 0-7546-3779-4 pages 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a the [[new Adam|new and last Adam]], new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to [[Adam and Eve|Adam's disobedience]].&lt;ref name=Pannenberg &gt;''Systematic Theology, Volume 2'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297–303&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there have been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] Christians generally believe that Jesus is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], [[God the Son]], and &quot;[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]&quot; (or both fully divine and fully human). [[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian]] Christians reject the notion of the [[Holy Trinity]], do not adhere to the [[ecumenical council]]s and believe that their interpretations of the Bible take precedence over the [[Christian creeds]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Donald Davis ''The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325–787): Their History and Theology'' 1990 by Leo Davis ISBN 978-0-8146-5616-7 page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians generally believe that Jesus [[Incarnation (Christianity)|having become fully human]], suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not [[Christian views on sin|sin]], but defeated death and rose to life after [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]]. According to the [[Bible]], God raised him from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pbI_wNPeJ-QC ''The Resurrection of Jesus''] by Eduard Riggenbach Page 69&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]], to [[Session of Christ|sit]] at the &quot;[[Right Hand of God]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mark|16:19}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|22:69}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|2:33}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:31}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|7:55–56}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|8:34}}, {{bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleref2|Col|3:1}}, {{bibleref2|Hebrews|1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|1:13}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|10:12}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|12:2}}, {{bibleref2|1Peter|3:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he will [[Second Coming|return to earth again]] for the [[Last Judgment]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]] in the [[World to Come]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|1:9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians not only attach theological significance to the works of Jesus, but also to his name. Devotions to the [[Holy Name of Jesus]] go back to the [[Early Christianity|earliest days of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Sylvester &gt;''Outlines of dogmatic theology, Volume 2 by Sylvester Hunter 2010 ISBN 1-146-98633-5 page 443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Houlden &gt;''Jesus: the complete guide'' by Leslie Houlden 2006 ISBN 0-8264-8011-X page 426&lt;/ref&gt; These devotions and feasts exist both in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Church|Western Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Houlden&quot;/&gt;

=== Jewish views ===
{{Main|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
{{see also|Jesus in the Talmud}}

Classic texts of Rabbinic Judaism reject any notion of an anthropomorphic God.  Tractate [[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] states explicitly that “if a man claims to be God, he is a liar.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] (2:1)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore Exodus Rabba 29 says, &quot;'I am the first and I am the last, and beside Me there is no God' I am the first, I have no father; I am the last, I have no brother. Beside Me there is no God; I have no son.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tmm/tmm08.htm Exodus Rabba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish Messianism|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no prophets after [[Malachi]], who delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], &quot;[http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]&quot;, Retrieved 2007-04-15; &quot;[http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]&quot;, [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]]&amp;nbsp;— ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved 2007-04-15; &quot;[http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&amp;o=350 Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?]&quot;, [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved 2007-04-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Talmud]] includes stories which some consider accounts of [[Jesus in the Talmud]], although there is a spectrum&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVanVoorst2000|Van Voorst (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt; from scholars, such as [[Johann Maier (talmudic scholar)|Maier]] (1978), who considers that only the accounts with the name ''[[Yeshu]]'' {{lang|he|יֵשׁוּ}} refer to the Christian Jesus, and that these are late redactions, to scholars such as [[Joseph Klausner|Klausner]] (1925), who suggested that accounts related to Jesus in the Talmud may contain traces of the [[historical Jesus]]. However the majority of contemporary historians disregard this material as providing information on the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;TM1998&quot;/&gt; Many contemporary Talmud scholars view these as comments on the relationship between Judaism and Christians or other sectarians, rather than comments on the historical Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Boyarin, ''Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Rubenstein ''Rabbinic Stories'' (The Classics of Western Spirituality) New York: The Paulist Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', an authoritative work of [[Halakha|Jewish law]], provides the last established consensus view of the Jewish community, in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10–12 that Jesus is a &quot;stumbling block&quot; who makes &quot;the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God&quot;.
{{quote|Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by [[Daniel]].

And they stumbled.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Dan.|11:14}} Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the [[prophet]]s spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments.

Numerous other titles are given to Jesus in [[Islamic literature]], the most common being ''al-Masīḥ'' (&quot;the messiah&quot;). Jesus is also, at times, called &quot;Seal of the Israelite Prophets&quot;, because, in general Muslim belief, Jesus was the last [[prophet]] sent by [[God]] to guide the Children of Israel. Jesus is seen in Islam as a precursor to Muhammad, and is believed by Muslims to have foretold the latter's coming.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI-Isa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; To aid in his ministry to the [[Jews|Jewish]] people, Jesus was given the ability to perform [[miracle]]s, all by the permission of God rather than of his own power.

The Qur'an emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human being who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Islamic texts forbid the association of partners with God (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''), emphasizing a strict notion of [[monotheism]] (''[[tawhid|tawhīd]]''). Like all [[Prophets of Islam|prophets in Islam]], Jesus is considered to have been a ''Muslim'' (i.e., one who submits to the will of God), as he preached that his followers should adopt the &quot;straight path&quot; as commanded by God.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI-Isa&quot;&gt;&quot;Isa&quot;, Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], Jesus&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam rejects the [[Christian]] view that Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] or the [[son of God]], that he was ever [[Crucifixion|crucified]] or [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]], or that he ever [[Atonement in Christianity|atoned]] for the sins of mankind. The Qur'an says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Last Judgment]], and God will vindicate him.&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, 5th Surah, vs. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muslim traditions, [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus was not crucified]] but instead, he was raised up by God unto the heavens. This &quot;raising&quot; is understood to mean through bodily [[Jesus in Islam#Ascension|ascension]]. Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth near the [[Last Judgment|day of judgment]] to restore justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI-Isa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot; /&gt;

In the 19th century [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of the [[Ahmadiyya Movement]], wrote that Jesus survived his ordeal on the cross. According to Ahmad Jesus fled Palestine after his apparent death and resurrection and migrated eastwards to further teach the gospels, reaching India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/jesus-in-india/index.html |title=Jesus in India |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahá'í views ===
In the teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], Jesus is considered to be a [[Manifestation of God|Manifestation of God]], a concept in the Bahá'í Faith that refers to what are commonly called [[prophet]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Jesus Christ in the Bahá'í Writings | first = Robert | last = Stockman | journal = Bahá'í Studies Review | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | location = London | publisher =Association for Baha'i Studies English-Speaking Europe | year = 1992 | url = http://bahai-library.com/stockman_jesus_bahai_writings}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bahá'í thought, Manifestations of God are the intermediary between God and humanity, serving as messengers and reflecting God's qualities and attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt; The Bahá'í concept also emphasizes the simultaneously existing qualities of humanity and divinity. In the station of divinity, they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; in the station of humanity, they show the physical qualities of common man.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt;  This concept is most similar to the Christian concept of incarnation.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockman&quot;/&gt; In Bahá'í thought, Jesus incarnated God's attributes as they were perfectly reflected and expressed, however Bahá'í teachings reject the Christian belief that Divinity was contained with a single human body because the Bahá'í teachings state that the essence of God is transcendent above the physical reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockman&quot;/&gt;

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes they can be seen as the spiritual &quot;return&quot; of all the previous Manifestations of God, and the appearance of each new Manifestation of God inaugurates a religion that supersedes the former ones, a sequence known as [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt; Through this process Bahá'í's believe God's plan unfolds gradually as mankind matures and some of the Manifestations arrive in specific fulfilment of the missions of previous ones. Bahá'í's believe that in this sense, Bahá'u'lláh is the promised return of Christ.&lt;ref name=&quot;psmith128&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = Peter |year = 2008 |title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher = Cambridge University Press |place = Cambridge

Bahá'í teachings confirm many, but not all, aspects of the historical Jesus as portrayed in the Gospels. They believe in the Virgin Birth,&lt;ref name=Lepart118&gt;{{cite book | title = In the Glory of the Father: The Bahai Faith and Christianity | first = Brian D. | last = Lepard  | year = 2008 | publisher = Bahai Publishing | isbn = 1931847347 | page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the crucifixion, but see the resurrection and the miracles he performed as symbolic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith-jesus&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= peace |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page= 214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í thought also accepts Jesus' Sonship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith-jesus&quot;/&gt;

[[Buddhist]] views of Jesus differ.

Retrieved 2007-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt; regard Jesus as a [[bodhisattva]] who dedicated his life to the welfare of human beings. It was recorded in [[101 Zen Stories]] that the 14th century Zen master [[Gasan Jōseki]], on hearing some of the sayings of Jesus in the Gospels, remarked that he was &quot;an enlightened man&quot;, and &quot;not far from Buddhahood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Flesh Zen Bones: A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings|year=1998|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-0-8048-3186-4|editors=[[Nyogen Senzaki]] and Paul Reps|chapter=Story 16: Not far from Buddhahood|chapterurl=http://www.101zenstories.com/index.php?story=16|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m9CCTo258n8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A9780804831864&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-12-09|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] wrote, &quot;All over Central Asia, in Kashmir and Ladakh and Tibet and even farther north, there is a strong belief that Jesus or Isa travelled about there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jawarharlal Nehru|title=Glimpses of World History|location=New York|publisher=John Day Co.|year=1942|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Robert Van Voorst]] states that modern scholarship has &quot;almost unanimously agreed&quot; that claims of the travels of Jesus to Tibet, Kashmir or India contain &quot;nothing of value&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVanVoorst2000|Van Voorst (2000)]] page 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Borg]] states that the suggestions that an adult Jesus traveled to Egypt or India and came into contact with Buddhism are &quot;without historical foundation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' edited by James D.

[[Manichaeism]] (which at one point included [[Augustine of Hippo]] as a follower, who later opposed it) accepted Jesus as a prophet, along with [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Zoroaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Bevan|first=A.

The New Age movement generally teaches that [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Christhood]] is something that all may attain.

===Criticism===
{{Main|Criticism of Jesus}}
Criticism of Jesus has existed since the earliest days of Christianity. The New Testament states that Jesus was criticized by the Jewish authorities of his time, e.g. the [[Pharisee]]s and [[scribe]]s who criticized Jesus and his disciples for not observing the Mosaic Law, not washing their hands before eating ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:1-23|ESV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:1-20|esv}}), or gathering grain on the Sabbath ({{bibleverse||Mark|2:23-3:6|esv}}). Later critics included [[Celsus]] in the 2nd century and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] who wrote a 15 volume attack on Christianity as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, H., Origen:Contra Celsum, CUP (1965), p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Stevenson, ''A New Eusebius: Documents illustrating the history of the Church to AD 337''  1957; New Edition, revised by W. H. C. Frend, page 257, 1987. ISBN 0-281-04268-3&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jesus continued to be criticized by Judaism, and in the early 12th century, the [[Mishneh Torah]] (the last established consensus of the Jewish community) called Jesus a &quot;stumbling block&quot; who makes &quot;the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God&quot;. Criticism of Jesus continued into the 19th century, with [[Nietzsche]] being highly critical of Jesus. For instance, Nietzsche considered Jesus' teachings anti-natural in their treatment of topics such as sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, 1895, ''Twilight of the Idols, Morality as Anti-nature'', 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century [[Bertrand Russell]] was also critical of Jesus and in ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'' stated that Jesus was &quot;not so wise as some other people have been, and He was certainly not superlatively wise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1927). ''Why I am not a Christian'' in &quot;Why I am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects,&quot; 2004, Routledge Classics, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;
