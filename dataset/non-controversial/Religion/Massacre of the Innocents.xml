[[File:Giotto-innocents.jpg|thumb|''The Holy Innocents'' by [[Giotto di Bondone]].]]

The '''Massacre of the Innocents''' is the biblical narrative of [[infanticide]] and [[gendercide]] by [[Herod the Great]], the Roman appointed King of the [[Jews]]. The historicity of the incident is &quot;an open question that probably can never be definitively decided&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;'The Gospel of Matthew', Daniel J. Harrington. p 47: Liturgical Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; but according to the [[Gospel of Matthew]]&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 2:16-18&lt;/ref&gt; Herod ordered the execution of all young male children in the village of [[Bethlehem]], so as to avoid the loss of his throne to a newborn King of the Jews whose birth had been announced to him by the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]]. In typical Matthean style it is understood as the fulfillment of an [[Old Testament]] prophecy:&lt;ref&gt;('''Matthew 2:17''' - &quot;Then was fulfilled that being declared by Jeremiah the prophet so-saying.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through [[Jeremiah]] the prophet, saying, A voice was heard in [[Ramathaim-Zophim|Ramah]], Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jer3115/&gt;

The number of infants killed is not stated, however the '''Holy Innocents''' have been claimed as the first [[Christian martyrs]]. 

==Biblical account==
[[File:Kerald (Meister des Codex Egberti) 001.jpg|thumb|10th century [[illuminated manuscript]]]]

In [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s account, [[Biblical Magi|magi]] from the [[Orient|east]] go to Judea in search of the newborn king of the Jews, having &quot;seen his star in the east&quot;.  The King, [[Herod the Great]], directs them to Bethlehem, and asks them to let him know who this king is when they find him. They find Jesus and honor him, but an [[angel]] tells them not to alert Herod, and they return home by another way.

The Massacre of the Innocents is at [[Matthew 2:16]]-[[Matthew 2:18|18]], although the preceding verses form the context:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When [the Magi] had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] in a [[dream]]. Get up, he said, take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him. So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: &quot;Out of Egypt I called my son.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hosea|11:1|HE}}. See also [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy#Hosea 11:1]]&lt;/ref&gt; When Herod realised that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: &quot;A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jer3115&gt;Compare [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|31:15|NIV}}. See also [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy#Jeremiah 31:15]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Matthew's purpose is to present Jesus as the Messiah, and the Massacre of the Innocents as the fulfillment of passages in [[Hosea]], referring to the exodus, and [[Jeremiah]], to the Babylonian exile.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen L. Harris]], ''Understanding the Bible'', 2nd Ed. Palo Alto: Mayfield, 1985, p.274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond E. Brown pp.104-121&quot;&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''The Birth of the Messiah'', pp.104-121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] sees the story as patterned on the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] story of the killing of the Hebrew firstborn by Pharaoh and the birth of [[Moses]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond E. Brown pp.104-121&quot;/&gt;

==Historicity==

The single account of the Massacre comes in the [[Matthew 2:16|Gospel of Matthew]]: it is not mentioned elsewhere in the  [[Gospel#Canonical_gospels|gospels]] or by the Roman Jewish historian, [[Josephus]] (37 – c. 100).  

Modern liberal scholarship, says [[Marcus Borg]], regards the biblical accounts of the birth of Jesus as symbolic narratives rather than factual history.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus J. Borg, ''Meeting Jesus for the First Time'' (Harper San Francisco, 1995) page 22-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Paul L. Maier]], the majority of Herod biographers and theologians hold that the Massacre of the Innocents is &quot;legend and not historical&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;most recent biographies of Herod the Great deny it entirely.&quot; Paul L. Maier, &quot;Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem&quot;, in ''Chronos, Kairos, Christos II'', Mercer University Press (1998), p.172&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Geza Vermes]] and [[E. P. Sanders]], for example, regard the story as part of a creative [[hagiography]].&lt;ref name=Vermes&gt;[[Geza Vermes]], ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', London, Penguin, 2006, p22; [[E. P. Sanders]], ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', Penguin, 1993, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Eisenman]] argues that the story may have its origins in Herod's murder of his own sons, an act which made a deep impression at the time and which was recorded by [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eisenman, ''James The Brother of Jesus'', 1997, I.3 &quot;Romans, Herodians and Jewish sects,&quot; p.49; see also E. P. Sanders, ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', 1993, p.87-88&lt;/ref&gt;  Other arguments against historicity include the [[Argument from silence|silence]] of Josephus (who does record several other examples of Herod’s willingness to commit such acts to protect his power, noting that he &quot;never stopped avenging and punishing every day those who had chosen to be of the party of his enemies&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', {{sourcetext|source=The Antiquities of the Jews|book=Book XV}} (at Wikisource).&lt;/ref&gt; and the views that the story is an apologetic device or a constructed fulfilment of prophesy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Maier, &quot;Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem&quot;, in ''Chronos, Kairos, Christos II'', Mercer University Press (1998), p.172-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Some biblical scholars hold a generally sceptical view of the incident's historicity.  Whilst acknowledging that the episode &quot;contains nothing that is historically impossible&quot; Hill says that Matthew's &quot;real concern is ... with theological reflection on the theme of ''OT'' fulfilment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;David Hill: The Gospel of Matthew, p84;Marshall Morgan and Scott; 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. T. France]] argues for plausibility on the grounds, inter alia, that “the murder of a few infants in a small village [is] not on a scale to match the more spectacular assassinations recorded by Josephus”;&lt;ref&gt;R T France “The Gospel of Matthew” 2007 NICNT&lt;/ref&gt; Schnackenburg follows this line also,&lt;ref&gt;“The Gospel of Matthew”; Rudolf Schnackenburg. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gordon Franz points to Josephus' failure to mention other pivotal events in the first century AD, such as &quot;the episode of the golden Roman shields in Jerusalem which was the cause of the bad blood between Herod Antipas and Pontus (sic) Pilate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldolphin.org/innocents.html |title=ABR Slaughter of Innocent |publisher=Ldolphin.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In similar vein Barclay follows Carr in finding Josephus' silence not relevant, drawing a parallel with the diarist [[John Evelyn]]'s failure to mention the [[Massacre of Glencoe|masscre at Glencoe]].&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of Matthew, Wm Barclay,St Andrew Press, Revised Edition, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  Maier argues that sceptics have tended to &quot;regard opinion as fact, and have largely avoided a careful historical search into the parameters of the problem&quot;.  After analysing the arguments against the historicity of the infant massacre Maier concludes they all &quot;have very serious flaws&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Maier, &quot;Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem&quot;, in ''Chronos, Kairos, Christos II'', Mercer University Press (1998), p.185&lt;/ref&gt;  Maier follows Jerry Knoblet&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Knoblet, &quot;Herod the Great&quot;,  Hamilton Books (2005), p.166&lt;/ref&gt; in arguing for historicity based on the &quot;identical personality profiles that emerge of Herod&quot; in both Matthew and Josephus;&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Maier, &quot;Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem&quot;, in ''Chronos, Kairos, Christos II'', Mercer University Press (1998), p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later writings==
[[File:Matteo di Giovanni 002.jpg|thumb|right|''The Massacre of the Innocents at Bethlehem'', by [[Matteo di Giovanni]]]]

The story's first appearance in any source other than Matthew is in the apocryphal [[Gospel of James|Protoevangelium of James]] of c.150 AD, which excludes the [[Flight into Egypt]] and switches the attention of the story to the infant [[John the Baptist]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And when Herod knew that he had been mocked by the Magi, in a rage he sent murderers, saying to them: Slay the children from two years old and under. And Mary, having heard that the children were being killed, was afraid, and took the infant and swaddled Him, and put Him into an ox-stall. And Elizabeth, having heard that they were searching for John, took him and went up into the hill-country, and kept looking where to conceal him. And there was no place of concealment. And Elizabeth, groaning with a loud voice, says: O mountain of God, receive mother and child. And immediately the mountain was cleft, and received her. And a light shone about them, for an angel of the Lord was with them, watching over them.&quot;&lt;ref name=Protoevangelium&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0847.htm Protoevangelium of James] at newadvent.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first non-Christian reference to the massacre is recorded four centuries later by [[Macrobius]]  (c. 395-423), who writes in his ''Saturnalia'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When he [emperor Augustus] heard that among the boys in Syria under two years old whom Herod, king of the Jews, had ordered to kill, his own son was also killed, he said: it is better to be Herod's pig, than his son.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cum audisset inter pueros quos in Syria Herodes rex Iudaeorum intra bimatum iussit interfici filium quoque eius occisum, ait: Melius est Herodis porcum esse quam filium,&quot; (Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/2*.html Saturnalia, book II, chapter IV:11]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The story assumed an important place in later Christian tradition; Byzantine liturgy estimated 14,000 Holy Innocents while an early Syrian list of saints stated the number at 64,000. [[Copt]]ic sources raise the number to 144,000 and place the event on 29 December.&lt;ref&gt;E. Porcher, ed. and tr., ''Histoire d'Isaac, patriarche Jacobite d'Alexandrie de 686 à 689, écrite par Mina, évêque de Pchati'', volume 11. 1915.  [http://www.archive.org/details/patrologiaorient11pariuoft Texts in Arabic, Greek and Syriac], p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the narrative literally and judging from the estimated population of Bethlehem, the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1907–12) more soberly suggested that these numbers were inflated, and that probably only between six and twenty children were killed in the town, with a dozen or so more in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=cathen&gt;[http://ww.newadvent.org/cathen/07419a.htm Holy Innocents] in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': &quot;The Greek Liturgy asserts that Herod killed 14,000 boys (''ton hagion id chiliadon Nepion''), the Syrians speak of 64,000, many medieval authors of 144,000, according to Apocalypse 14:3. Writers who accept the historicity of the episode reduce the number considerably, since Bethlehem was a rather small town. Joseph Knabenbauer brings it down to fifteen or twenty (''Evang. S. Matt.'', I, 104), August Bisping to ten or twelve (''Evang. S. Matt.''), [[Lorenz Kellner]] to about six (''Christus und seine Apostel'', Freiburg, 1908); cf. &quot;Anzeiger kath. Geistlichk. Deutschl.&quot;, 15 Febr., 1909, p. 32.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the arts==
[[File:Cornelis van Haarlem - Bethlehemse kindermoord.jpg|thumb|[[Cornelis van Haarlem]], ''Massacre of the Innocents'', 1590, [[Rijksmuseum]]]]
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens Massacre of the Innocents.jpg|thumb|[[Rubens]], ''[[Massacre of the Innocents (Rubens)|Massacre of the Innocents]]'', Toronto]]
[[File:1824 Navez Das Massaker der Unschuldigen anagoria.JPG|thumb|[[François-Joseph Navez]], ''The massacre of the innocents'', 1824]]

Medieval [[liturgical drama]] recounted Biblical events, including Herod's slaughter of the innocents. ''The Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors'', performed in Coventry, England, included a haunting song about the episode, now known as the [[Coventry Carol]]. The ''[[Ordo Rachelis]]'' tradition of four plays includes the [[Flight into Egypt]], Herod's succession by [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]], the return from Egypt, as well as the Massacre all centred on Rachel weeping in fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy.   These events were likewise in one of the Medieval [[N-Town Plays]].

The theme of the &quot;Massacre of the Innocents&quot; has provided artists of many nationalities with opportunities to compose complicated depictions of massed bodies in violent action. It was an alternative to the ''Flight into Egypt'' in cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]].  It decreased in popularity in [[Gothic art]], but revived in the larger works of the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]], when artists took inspiration for their &quot;Massacres&quot; from Roman reliefs of the battle of the [[Lapith]]s and [[Centaur]]s to the extent that they showed the figures heroically nude.&lt;ref name = &quot;Getty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collections/objects/o448.html |title=Getty Collection |publisher=Getty.edu |date=2009-05-07 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The horrific subject matter of the Massacre of the Innocents also provided a comparison of ancient brutalities with early modern ones during the period of religious wars that followed the Reformation - [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s versions show the soldiers carrying banners with the [[Habsburg]] double-headed eagle (often used at the time for Ancient Roman soldiers).

The 1590 version by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] also seems to reflect the violence of the [[Dutch Revolt]].  [[Guido Reni]]'s early (1611) ''[[Massacre of the Innocents (Guido Reni)|Massacre of the Innocents]]'', in an unusual vertical format, is at Bologna.&lt;ref name = &quot;WGA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/r/reni/1/innocent.html |title=Reni's painting at the Web Gallery of Art |publisher=Wga.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Flemish painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]] painted the theme more than once. One version, now in Munich, was engraved and reproduced as a painting as far away as colonial Peru.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spanish Colonial&quot;&gt;The ''Massacre of the Innocents'' in Cuzco Cathedral is clearly influenced by Rubens. See ''[http://www.codart.nl/Downloads/Courants/courant7.pdf CODART Courant]'', Dec 2003, 12. (2.5 MB pdf download)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another, his grand ''[[Massacre of the Innocents (Rubens)|Massacre of the Innocents]]'' is now at the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in [[Toronto]].  The French painter [[Nicolas Poussin]] painted ''The Massacre of the Innocents'' (1634) at the height of the [[Thirty Years' War]].

''The Childermass'', after a traditional name for the [[#Feast days|Feast of the Holy Innocents]], is the opening novel of [[Wyndham Lewis]]'s trilogy ''The Human Age''. In the novel ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' (''La Chute'') by [[Albert Camus]], the incident is argued by the main character to be the reason why Jesus chose to let himself be crucified&amp;mdash;as he escaped the punishment intended for him while many others died, he felt responsible and died in guilt. A similar interpretation is given in [[José Saramago]]'s controversial ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'', but there attributed to Joseph, Jesus' father, rather than to Jesus himself. As depicted by Saramago, Joseph knew of Herod's intention to massacre the children of Bethlehem, but failed to warn the townspeople and chose only to save his own child. Guilt-ridden ever after, Joseph finally expiates his sin by letting himself be crucified (an event not narrated in the New Testament).

The Massacre is the opening plot used in the 2006 movie ''[[The Nativity Story]]''.

The folk group [[Show of Hands]] wrote a song from the perspective of the families of the massacre, called &quot;Innocen'ts song/ Gwithian&quot;.

==Feast days==
[[File:William Holman Hunt - The Triumph of the Innocents - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''Triumph of the Innocents'' by [[William Holman Hunt]]]]
The commemoration of the massacre of these &quot;Holy Innocents&quot; — considered by some Christians as the first [[martyr]]s for Christ&lt;ref&gt;Sir William Smith and Samuel Cheetham , ''A dictionary of Christian antiquities'', ''s.v.'' &quot;Innocents, Festival of the&quot; notes [[Irenaeus]] (''Adv. Haer.'' iii.16.4) and [[Cyprian]] (''Epistle'' 56) at the head of an extensive list.&lt;/ref&gt;—first appears as a feast of the western church in the [[Leonine Sacramentary]], dating from about 485. The earliest commemorations were connected with the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]], 6 January: [[Prudentius]] mentions the Innocents in his hymn on the Epiphany. [[Pope Leo the Great|Leo]] in his homilies on the Epiphany speaks of the Innocents. [[Fulgentius of Ruspe]] (6th century) gives a homily ''De Epiphania, deque Innocentum nece et muneribus magorum'' (&quot;On Epiphany, and on the murder of the Innocents and the gifts of the Magi&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Prudentius, Leo and Fulgentius are noted in Sir William Smith and Samuel Cheetham, ''A dictionary of Christian antiquities'', ''s.v.'' &quot;Innocents, Festival of the&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the date of '''Holy Innocents' Day''', also called '''Childermas''' or '''Children's Mass''', varies. 27 December is the date for West Syrians ([[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]], and [[Maronite Church]]) and East Syrians ([[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]]s and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]). 28 December is the date in the [[Church of England]], the [[Lutheran Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (in which, except on Sunday, violet vestments were worn before 1961, instead of red, the normal [[liturgical colour]] for celebrating martyrs). The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates the feast on 29 December.

In the 1962 Roman Catholic calendar, the violet vestments for Holy Innocents were eliminated (red used instead), and if December 28 fell on Sunday, this feast was commemorated on the [[Sunday within the Octave of Christmas]]. This was changed in a later revision of the Church calendar.

In [[Spain]], [[Hispanic America]] and the [[Philippines]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} December 28 is a day for [[Practical joke|pranks]], equivalent to [[April Fool's Day]] in many countries. Pranks (''bromas'') are also known in Spain as ''inocentadas'' and their victims are called ''inocentes'', or alternatively, the pranksters are the &quot;inocentes&quot; and the victims should not be angry at them, since they could not have committed any ''[[sin]]''. One of the more famous of these traditions is the annual &quot;[[Els Enfarinats]]&quot; festival of [[Ibi, Spain|Ibi]] in Alicante, where the ''inocentadas'' dress up in full military dress and incite a flour fight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12087635 BBC News] report of the 2010 festival.&lt;/ref&gt; Various Catholic countries had a tradition (no longer widely observed) of role reversal between children and their adult educators, including [[boy bishop]]s, perhaps a Christianized version of the Roman annual feast of the [[Saturnalia]] (when even slaves played &quot;masters&quot; for a day). In some cultures it is said to be an unlucky day, when no new project should be started.

In addition, there was a medieval custom of refraining where possible from work on the day of the week on which the feast of &quot;Innocents Day&quot; had fallen for the whole of the following year until the next Innocents Day. This was presumably mainly observed by the better-off.  [[Philippe de Commynes]], the minister of King [[Louis XI of France]] tells in his memoirs how the king observed this custom, and describes the trepidation he felt when he had to inform the king of an emergency on the day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe de Commynes]] trans. Michael Jones, ''Memoirs'', pp. 253-4, 1972, Penguin, ISBN 0-14-044264-2&lt;/ref&gt;
