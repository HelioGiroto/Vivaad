'''Christian anarchism''' is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] and [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=2–4 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Locating Christian anarchism…In political theology…In political thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable, the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of [[Jesus]].

==Origins==

===Old Testament===
[[Jacques Ellul]] recounts that at the end of the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 21:25) there was no king in Israel and everyone did as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=84–88 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Old Testament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ellul1&gt;{{cite book |title=Anarchy and Christianity |last=Ellul |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Ellul |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=Wm. B.

He warned that a human king would lead to [[militarism]], [[conscription]] and [[Tax#History|taxation]], and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. [[Samuel]] passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they disregarded him and chose [[Saul]] as their king.&lt;ref name=ellul1 /&gt; Much of the subsequent [[Old Testament]] chronicles them trying to live with this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christian Anarchy: Jesus' Primacy Over the Powers|author=Vernard Eller|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|year=1987|url=http://www.hccentral.com/eller12/part8.html|quote=God and Samuel accept (and honor) Israel's (bad) decision as accomplished fact and proceed to live with it rather than try to reverse it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
[[Image:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Carl Heinrich Bloch]]'s depiction of the [[Sermon on the Mount]].]]
More than any other Bible source, the [[Sermon on the Mount]] is used as the basis for Christian anarchism.&lt;ref name=Sermon /&gt; [[Alexandre Christoyannopoulos]] explains that the Sermon perfectly illustrates Jesus' central teaching of love and [[forgiveness]]. Christian anarchists claim that the state, founded on violence, contravenes the Sermon and Jesus' call to [[Matthew 5:44|love our enemies]].&lt;ref name=Sermon /&gt;

[[Christian eschatology]] and various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul, have identified the state and [[political power]] as the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast]] in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=123–126 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Revelation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anarchy and Christianity |last=Ellul |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Ellul |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |location=Michigan |isbn= |page= |pages=71–74 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=55_Oa12YTt0C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |quote=The first beast comes up from the sea...It is given 'all authority and power over every tribe, every people, every tongue, and every nation' (13:7). All who dwell on earth worship it. Political power could hardly, I think, be more expressly described, for it is this power which has authority, which controls military force, and which compels adoration (i.e., absolute obedience).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not anarchism is compatible with the New Testament is a point of contention. Some hold that one cannot consistently be a Christian and anarchist simultaneously: these critics include Christians, anarchists, and those who reject both categories. For example, anarchists often cite the phrase &quot;[[no gods, no masters]]&quot; and Christians [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 13]] (see [[Christian_anarchism#State_authority|State authority]] below). Others criticize anarchism and Christianity by arguing that they are one and the same thing. In his last book of philosophy, [[Der Antichrist]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discussed the inseparable relationship between Christianity and anarchism:

{{quote|&lt;p&gt;There is a perfect likeness between Christian and anarchist: their object, their instinct, points only toward destruction…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Christian and the anarchist: both are decadents; both are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating, poisonous, degenerating, blood-sucking; both have an instinct of mortal hatred of everything that stands up, and is great, and has durability, and promises life a future…&lt;ref&gt;http://librivox.org/the-antichrist-by-nietzsche/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}}

===Early Church===
{{See also|Early Christianity}}
Several of the [[Church Fathers]]' writings suggest anarchism as God's ideal.&lt;ref name=ChristoyannopoulosEarlyChristians&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=243–246 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Early Christians}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Christians opposed the primacy of the State: &quot;We must obey God as ruler rather than men&quot; ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 4:19, 5:29, [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 6:1-6); &quot;Stripping the governments and the authorities bare, he exhibited them in open public as conquered, leading them in a triumphal procession by means of it.&quot; ([[Epistle to the Colossians|Colossians]] 2:15). Also some early Christian communities appear to have practised [[anarchist communism]], such as the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem group]] described in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], who shared their money and labor equally and fairly among the members.&lt;ref&gt;Hinson, E. Glenn. ''The Early Church: Origins to the Dawn of the Middle Ages'', (1996) pp 42–3&lt;/ref&gt; Christian anarchists, such as Keven Craig, insist that these communities were centred on true love and care for one another rather than [[liturgy]]. They also allege that the reason the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|early Christians were persecuted]] was not because they worshipped Jesus Christ, but because they refused to worship human [[Idolatry|idols]] claiming divine status (see [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]). Given that they refused to worship the [[Roman Emperor]] they refused to swear any [[oath of allegiance]] to the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref name=ChristoyannopoulosEarlyChristians /&gt;

[[Thomas Merton]] in his introduction to a translation of the ''[[Sayings of the Desert Fathers]]'' describes the early [[Christian monasticism|monastics]] as &quot;Truly in certain sense 'anarchists,' and it will do no harm to think of them as such.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Merton, Thomas. &quot;Wisdom of the Desert.&quot; Abbey of [[Gethsemani]] Inc. 1960. p.5&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the earliest period, women and men seem to have shared religious duties equally, though the public offices, such as missionary work and Temple observances, seem to have been held mostly by men.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Henry. ''The early church '', (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of [[Phoebe (Bible)|Phoebe]] in Romans 16:1-2: &quot;I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant (διάκονος) of the church in Cenchreae, that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and assist her in whatever business she has need of you; for indeed she has been a helper of many and of myself also.&quot; Referring here to Phoebe, the word rendered &quot;servant&quot; being in the Greek διάκονος (di'a·ko·nos), the parallel English word being deaconess, and in the context of the above quotation, this denotes a servant who is given servants to manage, in effect, a deaconess, one who delegates, a manager, though in most ways, [[Jewish Christianity]] did not differ from any of the other Jewish sects of [[Second Temple Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E., Christianity: An Introduction. Blackwell Publishing (2006). ISBN 1-4051-0899-1. Page 174: &quot;In effect, they [Jewish Christians] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief—that Jesus was the Messiah. Unless males were [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]], they could not be [[Salvation|saved]] (Acts 15:1).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion of the Roman Empire===
{{See also|Constantine I and Christianity|State church of the Roman Empire}}
For Christian anarchists the moment which epitomises the [[Great Apostasy|degeneration of Christianity]] is the conversion of [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]] after his victory at the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite book|first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |title=New Perspectives on Anarchism |pages=149–168 |year=2010 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham, MD |quote=[http://archive.org/details/ChristianAnarchism Christian Anarchism: A Revolutionary Reading of the Bible] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this event Christianity was legalised under the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, hastening the [[Christian Church|Church]]'s transformation from a humble bottom-up [[sect]] to an authoritarian [[Hierarchical organization|top-down organization]]. Christian anarchists point out that this marked the beginning of the &quot;[[Constantinian shift]]&quot;, in which Christianity gradually came to be identified with the will of the ruling elite, becoming the [[State church of the Roman Empire]], and in some cases (such as the [[Crusades]], [[Inquisition]] and [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]) a religious justification for violence.&lt;ref name=CA /&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Following Constantine's conversion, [[Alexandre Christoyannopoulos]] recounts that Christian pacifism and anarchism were submerged for nearly a millennium until the emergence of thinkers such as [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Petr Chelčický]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=246 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Christian pacifism - let alone Christian anarchism - was submerged for nearly a millennium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis of Assisi (c.1181–1226) was an [[asceticism|ascetic]] preacher, pacifist and nature lover. As the son of a wealthy family cloth merchant he led a privileged life and fought as a soldier, but radically changed his beliefs and practices after a spiritual awakening. Francis became a pacifist and eschewed material goods, attempting to follow in the footsteps of Jesus.&lt;ref name =&quot;ODCC Francis&quot;&gt;&quot;Francis of Assisi.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Maurin]], co-founder of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], was heavily influenced by Francis of Assisi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Revolution of the heart: essays on the Catholic worker |last= Coy |first=Patrick G. |authorlink= |year=1988 |publisher=Temple University Press |location= |page= |pages=19–22 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4dG87jxGDFcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=A%20Revolution%20of%20the%20Heart%3A%20Essays%20on%20the%20Catholic%20Worker&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=The influence of Francis of Assisi in Maurin's life was considerable. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Petr Chelčický's (c.1390–c.1460) work, specifically ''The Net of Faith'', influenced [[Leo Tolstoy]] and is referenced in his book ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page=38 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=Peter Chelčický}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
{{Prose|section|date=May 2011}}
;Adin Ballou: [[Adin Ballou]] (1803–1890) was founder of the [[Hopedale Community]] in Massachusetts, and a prominent 19th century exponent of pacifism, socialism and [[abolitionism]]. Through his long career as a [[Universalism|Universalist]] (and then [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) minister, he tirelessly sought social reform through his [[Christian radicalism|radical Christian]] and socialist views. Although he rejected anarchism both as a label and as a theory, he was extremely critical of &quot;human government&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page=39 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=Adin Ballou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy was heavily influenced by his writings.

;Henry David Thoreau: [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an American author, [[pacifism|pacifist]], nature lover, [[tax resistance|tax resister]] and [[individualist anarchist]]. He was an advocate of [[civil disobedience]] and a lifelong [[abolitionism|abolitionist]]. Though not commonly regarded as a Christian anarchist, his essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' does include many of the Christian anarchist ideals.

;William B. Greene: [[William B. Greene]] (1819–1878), an [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] based in the [[United States]], was a Unitarian minister, and the originator of a Christian Mutualism, which he considered a new dispensation, beyond God’s covenant with Abraham. His 1850 ''Mutual Banking'' begins with a discussion (drawn from the work of [[Pierre Leroux]]) of the Christian rite of communion as a model for a society based in equality, and ends with a prophetic invocation of the new Mutualist dispensation. His better-known scheme for mutual banking, and his criticisms of usury should be understood in this specifically religious context. Unlike his contemporaries among the [[nonresistance|nonresistants]], Greene was not a pacifist, and served as a Union Army colonel in the American Civil War.
[[File:Leo Tolstoy, portrait.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Leo Tolstoy]] wrote extensively about Christian pacifism and anarchism.]]
;Leo Tolstoy: [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910) wrote extensively on his anarchist principles, which he arrived at via his Christian faith, in his books ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', ''What I Believe (aka My Religion)'', ''The Law of Love and the Law of Violence'', and ''Christianity and Patriotism'' which criticised government and the Church in general. ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'' is regarded as a key Christian anarchist text.&lt;ref name=tolstoy /&gt; Tolstoy sought to separate [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christianity — which was merged with [[State (polity)|the state]] — from what he believed was the true message of Jesus as contained in the Gospels, specifically in the [[Sermon on the Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.org/details/TolstoyThePeculiarChristianAnarchist |title=Tolstoy the Peculiar Christian Anarchist |author=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy takes the viewpoint that all governments who wage war, and churches who in turn support those governments, are an affront to the Christian principles of [[Christian nonviolence|nonviolence]] and [[Nonresistance#Christian theology|nonresistance]]. Although Tolstoy never actually used the term &quot;Christian anarchism&quot; in ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', reviews of this book following its publication in 1894 appear to have coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O40-YRkO0t8C&amp;q=%22christian+anarchism%22&amp;dq=%22christian+anarchism%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=1900&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=6 |title=The review of reviews, Volume 9, 1894, p.306 |edited=William Thomas Stead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sIpNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22christian+anarchism%22&amp;dq=%22christian+anarchism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=G5jWTKDXNJ2ShAfI79iWBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA |title=The Speaker, Volume 9, 1894, p.254 |edited=Mather &amp; Crowther}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom. Tolstoy was a [[pacifism|pacifist]] and a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. His vision for an equitable society was an anarchist version of [[Georgism]], which he mentions specifically in his novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]''.

;David Lipscomb: [[David Lipscomb]] (1831&amp;ndash;1917) was a minister, author and member in the American [[Restoration Movement]]. He wrote a strong condemnation of [[civil authority]] called ''Civil Government: Its Origin, Mission, and Destiny, and the Christian's Relation to It'' (1889) and co-founded [[Lipscomb University]].

;Charles Erskine Scott Wood: [[Charles Erskine Scott Wood]] (1852–1944) was the author of a satirical bestseller, ''[[Heavenly Discourse]]'', which portrayed God and Jesus as anarchists opposed to churches, governments, war, and capitalism.

;Thomas J. Hagerty: [[Thomas J. Hagerty]] (c.1862–?) was a [[Catholic]] priest from New Mexico, USA, and one of the founding members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW). Hagerty is credited with writing the IWW Preamble, assisting in the composition of the Industrial Union Manifesto and drawing up the first chart of industrial organization. He was ordained in 1892 but his formal association with the church ended when he was suspended by his archbishop for urging miners in Colorado to revolt during his tour of mining camps in 1903. Hagerty is not commonly regarded as a Christian anarchist in the [[Tolstoyan]] tradition but rather an [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]]. Christian anarchists like Dorothy Day and Ammon Hennacy have been members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and found common cause with the [[axiom]] &quot;an injury to one is an injury to all.&quot;

;Nikolai Berdyaev: [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] (1874–1948), the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christian]] philosopher has been called the philosopher of freedom and is known as a Christian existentialist. Known for writing &quot;the Kingdom of God is anarchy&quot; he believed that freedom ultimately comes from God, in direct opposition to atheist anarchists such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], who saw God as the (symbolic) enslaver of humanity.

;Peter Maurin: [[Peter Maurin]] (1877–1949) was a [[France|French]] [[social activist]] and co-founder of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]. Maurin's vision to transform the [[social order]] consisted of establishing urban [[house of hospitality|houses of hospitality]] to care for the destitute; rural farming communities to teach city dwellers [[agrarianism]] and encourage a movement [[Back-to-the-land movement|back-to-the-land]]; and [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable discussions]] in community centres to clarify thought and initiate action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Revolution of the heart: essays on the Catholic worker |last= Coy |first=Patrick G. |authorlink= |year=1988 |publisher=Temple University Press |location= |page= |pages=16–23 |url= |quote=Peter Maurin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Léonce Crenier: [[Léonce Crenier]] (1888–1963) first rejected religion, becoming an [[anarcho-communist]] when he moved to [[Paris]] from rural [[France]] in 1911. In 1913 he visited his sister in [[Portugal]] where he stayed for several years. During this period he suffered a debilitating and agonising illness. Receiving the attentions of a particularly caring nurse, he survived, despite the gloomy predictions of the doctors. Converting to Catholicism, he became a [[monk]]. He is particularly known for his concept of [[Precarity (Social Christianity)|Precarity]], and was influential on Dorothy Day.
[[File:Jesus wanted poster.jpg|alt=|thumb|Cartoon by [[Art Young]], first published in ''[[The Masses]]'' in 1917 and later reprinted in Ammon Hennacy's autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of Ammon |last=Hennacy |first=Ammon |authorlink=Ammon Hennacy |year=1970 |publisher=Hennacy |location= |page=332 |pages= |url= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
;Ammon Hennacy: [[Ammon Hennacy]] (1893–1970) wrote extensively on his work with the Catholic Workers, the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]], and at the [[Joe Hill House]] of Hospitality. He was an [[Irish American]] Christian anarchist, [[draft dodger]], [[vegetarian]], and [[tax resister]]. He also tried to reduce his tax liability by taking up a lifestyle of simple living. His autobiography ''The Book of Ammon'' originally released as ''The Autobiography of a Catholic Anarchist'', describes his work in [[nonviolent]], anarchist, social action, and provides insight into the lives of Christian anarchists in the United States of the 20th century. His other book is ''The One-Man Revolution in America''.

;Dorothy Day: [[Dorothy Day]] (1897–1980) was a journalist turned social activist. She was a member of the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] and devout member of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. She became known for her social justice campaigns in defense of the poor, forsaken, hungry and homeless. Alongside [[Peter Maurin]], she founded the [[Catholic Worker]] Movement in 1933, espousing nonviolence, and hospitality for the impoverished and downtrodden. Dorothy Day was declared [[Servant of God]] when a cause for sainthood was opened for her by Pope John Paul II. Among books she authored was her autobiography ''[[The Long Loneliness]]''.

;Jacques Ellul: [[Jacques Ellul]] (1912–1994) was a French thinker, sociologist, theologian and Christian anarchist. He wrote several books against the &quot;technological society&quot;, and some about Christianity and politics, like ''Anarchy and Christianity''. Similar to the theology of one of his main influences, [[Karl Barth]], Ellul's works and ideas are considered [[dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinyou.net/pages/ellul.html|title=A Synopsis and Analysis of the Thought and Writings of Jacques Ellul|author=James A. Fowler|publisher=Christ in You Ministries|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Philip Berrigan: [[Philip Berrigan]] (1923–2002) was an internationally renowned [[peace activist]] and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] priest. He and his brother [[Daniel Berrigan]] were on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list for illegal [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] actions against war.

;Ivan Illich: [[Ivan Illich]] (1926–2002) was a [[libertarian-socialism|libertarian-socialist]] social thinker, with roots in the Catholic Church, who wrote critiques of technology, energy use and compulsory education. In 1961 Illich founded the Centro Intercultural de Documentación (CIDOC) at Cuernavaca in Mexico, in order to &quot;counterfoil&quot; the Vatican's participation in the &quot;modern development&quot; of the so-called Third World. Illich's books ''Energy and Equity'' and ''Tools for Conviviality'' are considered classics for [[social ecology|social ecologists]] interested in [[appropriate technology]], while his book [[Deschooling Society]] is still revered by activists seeking alternatives to compulsory schooling. Ivan's views on Jesus as an anarchist are highlighted in a speech he made at a chapel in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidtinapple.com/illich/1988_Educational.html|title=The Educational enterprise in the Light of the Gospel|author=Ivan Illich|year=1988|location=Chicago|quote=Jesus was an anarchist savior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Vernard Eller: [[Vernard Eller]] (1927–2007) was a minister in the [[Church of the Brethren]] and author of ''Christian Anarchy: Jesus' Primacy Over the Powers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christian Anarchy: Jesus' Primacy Over the Powers|author=Vernard Eller|publisher=Wm.

==Anarchist biblical views and practices==

===Church authority===
With some notable exceptions, such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], many Christian anarchists are critical of [[Christian Church|Church]] [[dogma]] and [[ritual]]s. Christian anarchists wish that Christians were less preoccupied with performing rituals and preaching [[dogmatic theology]], and more with following Jesus' teaching and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=167–175 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Deceptive Dogmas...Sanctimonious self-righteousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Ellul and [[Dave Andrews]] claim that Jesus did not intend to be the founder of an [[institution]]al religion, whilst Michael Elliot believes one of Jesus' intentions was to bypass human intermediaries and do away with priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anarchy and Christianity |last=Ellul |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Ellul |coauthors= |year=1988 |publisher=Wm.

===Pacifism and nonviolence===
{{Main|Christian pacifism|Anarcho-pacifism}}
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Deserter'' (1916) by [[Boardman Robinson]].]]
Christian anarchists, such as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], [[Jacques Ellul]], and [[Dave Andrews]], follow Jesus' call to not resist evil but [[turn the other cheek]]. This teaching they argue can only imply a condemnation of the state as the police and army hold a [[monopoly of the legitimate use of force|monopoly over the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name=CritiqueofViolence /&gt; They believe [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] will only be guided by the grace of God if they show compassion to others and turn the other cheek when confronted with violence. Christian anarchists believe [[violence begets violence]] and the [[Deontological ethics|ends never justify the means]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page=52 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=The cycle of violence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Christian anarchists practice the principles of [[nonviolence]], [[nonresistance]] and turning the other cheek. To illustrate how nonresistance works in practice, [[Alexandre Christoyannopoulos]] offers the following Christian anarchist response to [[terrorism]]:

{{Quote|The path shown by Jesus is a difficult one that can only be trod by true martyrs. A &quot;[[martyr]],&quot; etymologically, is he who makes himself a witness to his faith. And it is the ultimate testimony to one’s faith to be ready to put it to practice even when one’s very life is threatened. But the life to be sacrificed, it should be noted, is not the enemy’s life, but the martyr’s own life — killing others is not a testimony of love, but of anger, fear, or hatred. For Tolstoy, therefore, a true martyr to Jesus’ message would neither punish nor resist (or at least not use violence to resist), but would strive to act from love, however hard, whatever the likelihood of being crucified. He would patiently learn to forgive and turn the other cheek, even at the risk of death. Such would be the only way to eventually win the hearts and minds of the other camp and open up the possibilities for reconciliation in the &quot;[[War on Terror|war on terror]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |url=http://archive.org/details/TurningTheOtherCheekToTerrorism |title=Turning the Other Cheek to Terrorism: Reflections on the Contemporary Significance of Leo Tolstoy's Exegesis of the Sermon on the Mount |pages=41–42 |date= April 2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Simple living===
{{Main|Simple living}}
Christian anarchists, such as [[Ammon Hennacy]], [[Peter Maurin]] and [[Dorothy Day]], often advocate [[voluntary poverty]]. This can be for a variety of reasons, such as withdrawing support for government by reducing taxable income or following Jesus' teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/dorothyday/daytext.cfm?TextID=150 |title=More About Holy Poverty. Which Is Voluntary Poverty. |author=[[Dorothy Day]] |date=February 1945 |work= |publisher=[[The Catholic Worker]] |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus appears to teach voluntary poverty when he told his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], &quot;It is easier for a camel to go through the [[eye of a needle]] than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God&quot; (Mark 10:25) and &quot;You cannot serve both God and [[Mammon]]&quot; (Luke 16:13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=A Penny a Copy: Readings from the Catholic Worker |first=Tom | last=Cornell |authorlink=Tom Cornell |first2=Robert | last2=Ellsberg|authorlink2=Robert Ellsberg |year=1995 |page=198 |publisher=Orbis Books |quote=At its deepest level voluntary poverty is a way of seeing the world and the things of the world.… The Gospels are quite clear: the rich man is told to sell all he has and give to the poor, for it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. And we are clearly instructed that 'you can not serve God and Mammon'. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State authority===
The most common challenge for anarchist theologians is interpreting Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] 13:1–7, in which [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] demanded obedience to governing authorities and described them as God's servants exacting punishment on wrongdoers.&lt;ref name=Romans&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=181–182 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Paul's letter to Roman Christians, chapter 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2013:1-7&amp;version=NIV BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: Romans 13:1–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Romans 13:1–7 holds the most explicit reference to the state in the New Testament but other parallel texts include [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:1, [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 13:17 and [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 2:13-17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=191–192 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Similar passages in the New Testament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%203:1&amp;version=NIV; BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: Titus 3:1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:17&amp;version=NIV; BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: Hebrews 13:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:13-17&amp;version=NIV; BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: 1 Peter 2:13-17]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|right|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]]]]
Established theologians, such as C.E.B. Cranfield, have interpreted Romans 13:1–7 to mean the Church should support the state, as God has sanctified the state to be his main tool to preserve social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Christian's Political Responsibility According to the New Testament|author=C.E.B.

Christian anarchists and pacifists, such as [[David Lipscomb]], [[Jacques Ellul]] and [[Vernard Eller]], do not attempt to overthrow the state given Romans 13 and Jesus' command to turn the other cheek.&lt;ref name=ellul /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchy: Jesus' Primacy Over the Powers |last=Eller |first=Vernard |authorlink=Vernard Eller |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=Wm.

The Christian has been clearly forbidden to take vengeance or execute wrath, but he is to live peaceably with all men, to do good for evil. Then a Christian cannot be an officer or executor of this higher power}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eller articulates this position by restating the passage this way:
{{quote|Be clear, any of those human [authorities] are where they are only because God is allowing them to be there. They exist only at his sufferance. And if God is willing to put up with...the Roman Empire, you ought to be willing to put up with it, too. There is no indication God has called ''you'' to clear it out of the way or get it converted for him. You can't fight an Empire without becoming ''like'' the Roman Empire; so you had better leave such matters in God's hands where they belong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hccentral.com/eller12/part1.html Christian Anarchy (Eller) 1]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Christians who interpret Romans 13 as advocating support for [[Civil authority|governing authorities]] are left with the difficulty of how to act under tyrants or dictators.&lt;ref name=Alex /&gt; [[Ernst Käsemann]], in his ''Commentary on Romans'', challenged the mainstream Christian interpretation of the passage in light of German Lutheran Churches using this passage to justify [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Käsemann, Ernst, ''Commentary on Romans'', (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's letter to Roman Christians declares &quot;For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong.&quot; However Christian anarchists point out an inconsistency if this text were to be taken literally and in isolation, as both Jesus and Paul were executed by the governing authorities or &quot;rulers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Alex /&gt;

There are also Christians anarchists, such as [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Ammon Hennacy|Hennacy]], who do not see the need to integrate Paul's teachings into their [[subversion|subversive]] way of life. Tolstoy believed Paul was instrumental in the church's &quot;deviation&quot; from Jesus' teaching and practices, whilst Hennacy believed &quot;Paul spoiled the message of Christ&quot; (see [[Jesuism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church and State |last=Tolstoy |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Tolstoy |coauthors= |year=1882 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=This deviation begins from the times of the Apostles and especially from that hankerer after mastership Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of Ammon |last=Hennacy |first=Ammon |authorlink=Ammon Hennacy |coauthors= |year=1970 |publisher=Hennacy |location= |isbn= |page=475 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=Paul and the Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hennacy and [[Ciaron O'Reilly]], in contrast to Eller, advocate nonviolent [[civil disobedience]] to confront state oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=199–201 |url= |accessdate= |quote=For (non-violent) civil disobedience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swearing of oaths===
In the Sermon of the Mount (Matthew 5:33-37) Jesus tells his followers to [[Expounding of the Law#Oaths|not swear oaths]] in the name of God or Man. Tolstoy, [[Adin Ballou]] and [[Petr Chelčický]] understand this to mean that Christians should never bind themselves to any oaths as they may not be able to fulfil the will of God if they are bound to the will of a fellow-man. Tolstoy takes the view that all oaths are evil, but especially an [[oath of allegiance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=67–69 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Swear not at all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax===
Some Christian anarchists [[tax resistance|resist taxes]] in the belief that their government is engaged in immoral, unethical or destructive activities such as [[war]], and paying taxes inevitably funds these activities, whilst others submit to taxation.&lt;ref name=taxes&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=192–197 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Jesus' advice on taxes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwtrcc.org/anarchists.php|title=Anarchists and War Tax Resistance|publisher=National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adin Ballou wrote that if the act of resisting taxes requires physical force to withhold what a government tries to take, then it is important to submit to taxation.  Ammon Hennacy, who, like Ballou also believed in [[nonresistance]], eased his conscience by [[simple living|simply living]] below the [[income tax threshold]].&lt;ref&gt;“Ammon Hennacy” in Gross, David M. (ed.) ''We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader'' (2008) ISBN 1-4348-9825-3 pp. 385-393&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax supporters cite &quot;[[Render unto Caesar...|give to Caesar what is Caesar's]]&quot; (Matthew 22:21) and [[Epistle to the Romans|Paul's letter to Roman Christians]] (Romans 13:6-7).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2013:6-7&amp;version=NIV BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: Romans 13:6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Jacques Ellul]] does not interpret Matthew 22:21 as advocating support for taxes but as further advice to [[simple living|free oneself from material attachment]]. Ellul believes the passage shows that Caesar may have rights over the [[fiat money]] he produces, but not things that are made by God, as he explains:&lt;ref name=taxes /&gt;

{{quote|&quot;Render unto Caesar...&quot; in no way divides the exercise of authority into two realms....They were said in response to another matter: the payment of taxes, and the coin. The mark on the coin is that of Caesar; it is the mark of his property. Therefore give Caesar this money; it is his. It is not a question of legitimizing taxes! It means that Caesar, having created money, is its master. That's all. Let us not forget that money, for Jesus, is the domain of [[Mammon]], a satanic domain!&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, Jacques: [http://www.jesusradicals.com/wp-content/uploads/anarchism-and-christianity.pdf ''Anarchism and Christianity''], p.20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Vegetarianism===
{{See also|Christian vegetarianism|Anarchism and animal rights}}
[[Vegetarianism]] in the Christian tradition has a long history commencing in the first centuries of [[Christian Church|Church]] with the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] who abandoned the &quot;world of men&quot; for intimacy with the [[Trinity|God]] of [[Jesus Christ]]. Vegetarianism amongst [[hermit]]s and [[monk|Christian monastics]] in the [[Eastern Christian]] and [[Roman Catholic]] traditions remains common to this day as a means of simplifying one's life, and as a practice of [[asceticism]].  Leo Tolstoy, Ammon Hennacy and [[Théodore Monod]] extended their belief in nonviolence and compassion to all living beings through vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anniversary Essays on Tolstoy |last=Miller |first=Robin Feuer |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University |location= |page= |pages=52 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G9KwMaSPEF0C&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote=Tolstoy's famous embrace of vegetarianism was triggered in large part by his intensifying philosophy of non-violence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'Thou shalt not kill' does not apply to murder of one's own kind only, but to all living beings; and this Commandment was inscribed in the human breast long before it was proclaimed from Sinai.&quot;{{spaced ndash}}[[Leo Tolstoy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of Ammon |last=Hennacy |first=Ammon |authorlink=Ammon Hennacy |year=1970 |publisher=Hennacy |location= |page=125 |pages= |url= |quote=I had been vegetarian since 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=olMgmIYuMPYC&amp;pg=PA192|title=Four centuries of geological travel|author=Geological Society of London|year=2007|quote=Monod became a vegetarian and an ardent pacifist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present-day Christian anarchist groups==

===Brotherhood Church===
The [[Brotherhood Church]] is a Christian anarchist and pacifist community. The Brotherhood Church can be traced back to 1887 when a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] minister called John Bruce Wallace started a magazine called &quot;''The Brotherhood''&quot; in [[Limavady]], [[Northern Ireland]]. An [[intentional community]] with [[Quaker]] origins has been located at [[Stapleton Colony|Stapleton]], near [[Pontefract|Pontefract, Yorkshire]], since 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Brotherhood Church|author=Alfred G. Higgins|page=52|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrotherhoodchurch.org/history.htm|title=The Brotherhood Church history|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Worker Movement===
[[File:Dorothy Day 1934.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Dorothy Day]], co-founder of the [[Catholic Worker Movement|Catholic Workers]].]]
Established by [[Peter Maurin]] and [[Dorothy Day]] in the early 1930s, the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] is a Christian movement dedicated to nonviolence, [[personalism]] and [[voluntary poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=24 and 260 |url= |accessdate= |quote=The Catholic Worker movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 130 Catholic Worker communities exist in the United States where &quot;[[houses of hospitality]]&quot; care for the homeless. The [[Joe Hill House]] of hospitality (which closed in 1968) in Salt Lake City, Utah featured an enormous twelve feet by fifteen foot mural of Jesus Christ and [[Joe Hill]]. Present-day Catholic Workers include [[Ciaron O'Reilly]], an Irish-Australian civil rights and anti-war activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=28–29 |url= |accessdate= |quote=Ciaron O'Reilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Klejment, professor of history at [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]], wrote of the Catholic Worker Movement:

{{quote|The Catholic Worker considered itself a Christian anarchist movement. All authority came from God; and the state, having by choice distanced itself from [[Christian perfectionism]], forfeited its ultimate authority over the citizen...Catholic Worker anarchism followed Christ as a model of [[nonviolent revolution]]ary behavior...He respected individual conscience. But he also preached a prophetic message, difficult for many of his contemporaries to embrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Revolution of the heart: essays on the Catholic worker |last=Klejment |first=Anne |coauthors=Patrick Coy |year=1988 |publisher=Temple University Press |location= |page= |pages=293–294 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Catholic Worker Movement has consistently protested against war and violence for over seven decades. Many of the leading figures in the movement have been both anarchists and pacifists, as [[Ammon Hennacy]] explains:

{{quote|&lt;p&gt;Christian Anarchism is based upon the answer of Jesus to the [[Pharisees]] when Jesus said that he without sin should be the first to cast the stone, and upon the [[Sermon on the Mount]] which advises the return of good for evil and the turning of the other cheek. Therefore, when we take any part in government by voting for legislative, judicial, and executive officials, we make these men our arm by which we cast a stone and deny the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dictionary definition of a Christian is one who follows Christ; kind, kindly, Christ-like. Anarchism is voluntary cooperation for good, with the right of secession. A Christian anarchist is therefore one who turns the other cheek, overturns the tables of the moneychangers, and does not need a cop to tell him how to behave. A Christian anarchist does not depend upon bullets or ballots to achieve his ideal; he achieves that ideal daily by the One-Man Revolution with which he faces a decadent, confused, and dying world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of Ammon |last=Hennacy |first=Ammon |authorlink=Ammon Hennacy |year=1970 |publisher=Hennacy |location= |page=0 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}}

Maurin and Day were both baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church and believed in the institution, thus showing it is possible to be a Christian anarchist and still choose to remain within a church.  After her death, Day was proposed for sainthood by the [[Claretian Missionaries]] in 1983. [[Pope John Paul II]] granted the [[Archdiocese of New York]] permission to open Day's cause for sainthood in March 2000, calling her a [[Servant of God]].
