'''Port-Royal-des-Champs''' was an [[abbey]] of [[Cistercian nuns]] in [[Magny-les-Hameaux]], in the [[Vallée de Chevreuse]] southwest of [[Paris]] that launched a number of culturally important institutions.

==History==
The abbey was established in 1204, but became famous  when its discipline was reformed in 1609 by its [[abbess]], [[mother (religious title)|Mother]] [[Marie Angelique Arnauld]] (1591-1661).  The [[Arnauld family]] became its patrons and the abbey's subsequent history was directed by a number of the members of that family.  In 1625 most of the nuns moved to a new Port-Royal in Paris, which subsequently became ''[[Port-Royal Abbey, Paris|Port-Royal de Paris]]'' (or, more commonly, ''Port-Royal'') while the older one was known as ''Port-Royal des Champs'' (&quot;Port-Royal of the fields&quot;).  

At the original site, several schools were founded, which became known as the &quot;[[Petites écoles de Port-Royal|Little Schools of Port-Royal]]&quot; (''Les Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal'').  These schools became famous for the high quality of the education they gave. [[theatre|Playwright]] [[Jean Racine]] was a product of Port-Royal education. In 1634 [[Jean du Vergier de Hauranne|Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, Abbé de Saint-Cyran]], became [[spiritual director]] of the abbey; he was a companion of [[Jansenius]] and the implementer of [[Jansenism]] in France.  From that point forward, the abbeys and schools of Port-Royal became intimately associated with that school of theology.

{{main|Port-Royal Logic}}
''La logique, ou l'art de penser'', the ''Logique de Port-Royal'', was an important textbook on logic first published anonymously in 1662 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] and [[Pierre Nicole]], two prominent members of the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] movement; [[Blaise Pascal]] likely contributed considerable portions of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Miel. &quot;Pascal, Port-Royal, and Cartesian Linguistics,&quot; ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', '''30''', (April 1969:261-271).&lt;/ref&gt; As it was written in the vernacular, it became quite popular and was in use, as a paradigm of traditional [[term logic]], into the twentieth century, introducing the reader to logic, and exhibiting strong Cartesian elements in its metaphysics and epistemology (Arnauld having been one of the main philosophers whose objections were published, with replies, in [[Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.  

The atmosphere of serious study and Jansenist piety attracted a number of prominent cultural figures to the movement, including [[theology|theologian]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[Blaise Pascal]].  Pascal defended the schools publicly against the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in the Jansenist controversies which agitated the French [[Roman Catholic Church]], writing his [[Provincial Letters]] in 1657.  Perhaps even more striking, several important persons of the court were close to Jansenism, such as the Duke of [[Luynes]] or the Duke of [[Liancourt]]. Members of the [[Arnauld]] family have managed to have important jobs such as [[Simon Arnauld, marquis de Pomponne|Simon Arnauld de Pomponne]], Minister of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].  The Jesuits, on the other hand, enjoyed predominance in political and theological power in France and Europe, providing a personal [[confessor]] to the King, etc.

[[Image:Port-RoyalRemoval.jpg|thumb|Port-royal|200px|left|Nuns being forcibly removed from the abbey in 1709.]]
As a result of the Jesuit attacks on Jansenism, the schools of Port-Royal were regarded as tainted with [[heresy]]. Louis XIV wanting peace in the church, the elementary schools were forcibly closed by [[papal bull]] in 1660, following the [[formulary controversy]].  In 1661, the monastery was forbidden to accept [[novice]]s, heralding its eventual dissolution.  The abbey itself was abolished by a bull from [[Pope Clement XI]] in 1708, the remaining nuns forcibly removed in 1709, most of the buildings themselves razed in 1710. The chapel, containing Mère Angélique's tomb, as well as some buildings, still exist in the vast grounds of what eventually became Paris' leading maternity hospital, known as Port-Royal Hospital.

A celebrated history of Port-Royal and its influence was written by [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] in 1837-1859.

==Ruins==
The remains of the monastery of Port-Royal-des-Champs may still be seen at [[Magny-les-Hameaux]], in the [[Vallée de Chevreuse|Chevreuse valley]].
