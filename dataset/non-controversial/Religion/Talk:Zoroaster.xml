==Claim about home on &quot;Ditya River&quot; in error?==

Hi - I was interested to read that Zarathustra's home was said to be on the Ditya River, and went to avesta.org to read more. It turns out that there is no mention whatsoever of any Ditya River or anything similar in Yasna 9 or 17, as translated on that site. Does this article rely on an alternative translation? If so, that should be specified. If not, the error should be corrected. Thanks. [[User:Mrcautious|Mrcautious]] ([[User talk:Mrcautious|talk]]) 04:47, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

==Edit Request==

Sorry to be critical of a piece that's apparently so erudite, but it's also almost unreadable - at least to me. Could someone with some knowledge of the subject as well as the ability to write clear English PLEASE have a go at a rewrite?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Numero60|Numero60]] ([[User talk:Numero60|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Numero60|contribs]]) 20:36, 8 December 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The article contains the following sentence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos (cf. Agathias 2.23-5, Clement Stromata I.15), which—so Cumont and Bidez—did derives from a Semitic form of his name. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is clearly something grammatically wrong in this sentence. Unfortunately I don't know hot to fix it, because I don't know how Cumon and Bidez are, and thus don't know exactly what is supposed to be stated here. Hopefully somebody more knowledgeable can help out here -- I just wanted to point out the error. Thanks.

==Place==
This article appears to be written by someone very familiar with Iran and surrounding regions.  Can anyone help out by adding in more modern references (modern day Tehran for example) or a map?[[User:Friedonc|Friedonc]] ([[User talk:Friedonc|talk]]) 18:18, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

As far as I know, Zoraster was born and died in Balk, present-day Afghanistan. Can someone please find the citations to add this?

The exact place isn't known, but there is more proof he was born in North Western Iran in the biggest and oldest fire temple of Zoroastronism. Please do not change it to Balk, the exact place isn't known.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2.221.160.67|2.221.160.67]] ([[User talk:2.221.160.67|talk]]) 20:35, 24 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I find it peculiar that the &quot;Place&quot; section argues quite clearly that the specific place of Zoroaster is unknown, yet the introduction claims that his birthplace has been established to be in Sistan! I would prefer that traditional, ancient scholarly accounts, and modern scholarly accounts all be cited with equal regard. Places such as Balkh (Afghanistan) and Urmia (Azerbaijan) should be mentioned. So little is known about &quot;the real Zoroaster&quot; that speaking of a &quot;true birthplace&quot; is in the domain of opinion rather than fact. [[User:Kaweah|Kaweah]] ([[User talk:Kaweah|talk]]) 10:47, 22 October 2012 (UTC)
:I just noticed that the reference to Sistan was inserted recently by an unsigned and unsourced edit, so I undid the edit in question. [[User:Kaweah|Kaweah]] ([[User talk:Kaweah|talk]]) 11:36, 22 October 2012 (UTC)

== Poor Scholarship ==


The article is devoid of insight and is hopelessly one-sided. There is no recognition of the fact that Indian and Iranian history and religion are closely interrelated. There is no mention of Gaumata or Gotama buddha who was a contemporary. Herzfeld wrote that Gaumata was Zoroaster's adversary and in the Buddhist texts Devadatta was the adversary of Gotama. In fact the tacit assumtion of all scholars that Zoroastrianism is the oldest religion is untenable. If one rejects the Nepalese frauds it becomes clear that Zoroastrianism and Buddhism belong to the same milieu and were sister religions. That Zoroastrianism was not the religion of the Sakas and Kushanas is stated categorically by Harmatta and other scholars (&quot;History of Civilizations of Central Asia&quot;, vol. II by J. Harmatta,p.315). The fact that Gaumata was Gotama and that there were many Buddhas before Gotama is not known to scholars such as Frye, Boyce and Briant. In his work 'Fihrist' al-Nadim also makes no mention of the Zoroastrians and states that the Shamaniya who regarded Buddha as their Prophet formed the majority of the people before Islam. A similar view is expressed by Al-beruni who was a greater scholar than Diodorus. The recently discovered Bactrian Buddhist texts mention six pre-Gotama Buddhas. Mary Boyce wrote much but had a very shallow perspective. Why does the Persepolis tablets make no mention of Zoroaster? The reason may be, as Ranajit Pal maintains in his book &quot;Non-Jonesian Indology and Alexander&quot;, p. 190. that Zoroaster was known by the name Devadatta among the Elamite scribes. Pal suggests that Damidada of the tablets may be Zoroaster.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mejda|Mejda]] ([[User talk:Mejda|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mejda|contribs]]) 08:19, 11 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Poor scholarship, perhaps. In fact most of articles here on the Eastern religions sees relatively poor scholarship compared to Judeo-Christian faith, which has been dissected since Enlightenment and is still being dissected. At the very least, scholarly consensus has it that the so-called &quot;pre-Gotama Buddhas&quot; is but a myth conjured by Indian Buddhists to bolster the authority of their faith, much as Jainism's appeal to ancient Tirthankara's and Hinduism's &quot;memory&quot; of Vishnu's Avatara's. That Zoroastrianism and Hinduism are more ancient than Buddhism there is no doubt.

==Philosophy==
The section could be filled out a bit - I'm still confused about what the philosophy is.  Perhaps a link to another page?  Also, the poet, is that Zoroaster?  [[User:Friedonc|Friedonc]] ([[User talk:Friedonc|talk]]) 18:20, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

== Origins of Philosophy ==

I used the exact format and language as Oxford, since they are qualified and the experts on the field. By using the same format and language as Oxford, then it is no longer assertion related to history, and the citation is exact and proper. Oxford is more of an authority than any person here involved in these discussion.
The Oxford dictionary on page 409 states the following: The title of the page is Chronology. “In this chronology  broadly ’philosophical’ events mentioned in the body of the dictionary are in the second column.”  It dates the events in this order; 
“1500 BC    Beginning of the Vedic period in India.”
 “630 BC    Zoroaster.” 
The readers should know that this is the exact format and language used by Oxford Universityon page 409. ([[User:Dvakili|Dvakili]] ([[User talk:Dvakili|talk]]) 05:29, 5 July 2008 (UTC)).

I removed the opening paragraph on the philosophy section for several reasons.
* The section is about Zoroasterian philosophy and the opening paragraph is an assertion related to history
* The quotation from the Dictionary of Philosophy is misleading.  That states that Zoroasterianism was an event in the history of philosophy (and one earlier one is given so not the first) which does not support the statement that Zoroaster was the first philosopher
* The paragraph is badly phrased and reads as an assertive statement.  It may be appropriate to have a phrase at the end (not the start) which states that Zoroaster was one of the key events in the pre-history of philosophy, with a proper citation (rather than a page reference in the text).

:::I agree with Snowded. I don't even see the point of Dvakili's addition. Was it to say that Zoroaster was the first philosopher? That's an absurd and unverifiable claim, even if Oxford makes it (which it doesn't). If anything, the quoted passage implies that Vedic Indians were the first philosphers. Instead of a direct quotation from the dictionary, Dvakili could have simply written &quot;Zoroaster's ministry is the second-earliest event mentioned in the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy's chronology of philosophy.&quot; That statement is true and uncontroversial, while still revealing Zoroaster's immense significance in the history of philosophy. --[[User:Phatius McBluff|Phatius McBluff]] ([[User talk:Phatius McBluff|talk]]) 19:23, 5 July 2008 (UTC)

=== Recently added ===
''According to Oxford dictionary of philosophy (page 409),the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy originated amongst the Indo-Iranians, by the name of Mazad-Yasna, meaning worship of wisdom. Oxford University dates this event to 3500 years ago. The first philosopher in the chronology of philosophy is Zarathushtra. According to Oxford dictionary of philosophy (page 405) Zarathushtra's philosophy entered to influence western tradition through Judaism, and therefore on Middle Platonism.''

:This argument is becoming absurd.

:Dvakili, Snowded's wording does not contradict Oxford. Snowded reworded your insertion because he felt (as I do) that it was awkwardly phrased.

:I admit, I have no problem with something like the following: &quot;''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'' lists Zoroaster's ministry (630 BC) as the second event on its chronology of major events in the history of philosophy, following the beginning of the Vedic period in India (1500 BC).&quot; That's completely accurate; it's more precise than what Snowded wrote; and it hopefully avoids making the (unsupportable) claim that Zoroaster was the world's second philosopher.

:However, I like Snowded's wording much better than yours. In fact, without proper context, it's unclear what your insertion is supposed to mean. If you just say that Oxford has a list of philosophical events containing Vedic India and then Zoroaster, what does that mean? Is it supposed to mean that Zoroaster is the second-oldest philosopher after the Vedic sages? That's an unsupportable assertion. Scholars have no way of determining how many philosophers have existed throughout history. Is it supposed to mean that Zoroaster was a philosopher? That's at least iffy: Zoroaster was much more an Isaiah than a Descartes. As far as I can tell, you wanted to add the quote from Oxford in order to say that scholars recognize Zoroaster as a major figure in the development of philosophy -- and that's exactly what Snowded's wording says. 

:If I've misinterpreted your intention, then please explain what point you're trying to get across by adding that quote, and we can reword the article accordingly. Remember, we ideally want to write a concise paraphrase of what a source is saying, not simply insert an out-of-context quote from that source. --[[User:Phatius McBluff|Phatius McBluff]] ([[User talk:Phatius McBluff|talk]]) 02:40, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

== Birthdate &amp; historicity of Spitama Zarathushtra ==

According to tradition, &amp; Greek sources,  Zarathushtra was born to the family  of Haetat-aspa   ( his great grand father) of  the Spitaman  section of the priestly Athrawan  tribe  around  7100BC  in the town of Rae (Raya), along the banks of the river Veh-daiti, (one of the 6 tributaries of the now dried River Harah-vaiti/Vedic: Saras-wati) north east of Drangiana ( Zarangiana) , a mountainous territory around Lake Hamun  and the Helmand river in  Seistan  (Iran-Afghanistan).
In the Vendidad,  Raya is listed between the Helmand river and Caxra (assumed to be modern Carx near Ghazna in southeast Afghanistan) and is therefore different from Median Raga and modern  Ray.
This river Harah-vaiti, prominently mentioned in the Gathas as that purifying celestial river of Prosperity that leads one to self realization, was said to flow from the mountains to the Ocean.
A large number of vedic hymns are similarly dedicated to this divine river Saraswati.
 In the Avesta, the Khordad Yasht is dedicated to it. (The Vedic “Saa” becomes “Kh” or “Khw” in Avesta)
Zarathushtra is traditionally referred to as one who had achieved “perfection”; the “perfect man” : the Naro-ish Nara &amp; his birthday is thus called Khordad Saal.

This mountaineous land known as Harah-vaiti in Avestic times is listed in the Vendidad as one of the 16 aryan lands.
The fertile plains bordering this divine river are mentioned in the Vendidad as the 15th land (out of 16) called Hapta Hendu (Vedic Sapta Sindhu) &amp; located in the modern undivided Punjab.
According to Avestan geography  the region of the Haêtumant River extends in a southwest direction from the point of confluence of the Arghandâb with the Helmand. (Gnoli, 1980, p. 66)
ARACHOSIA, province (satrapy) in the eastern part of the Achaemenid empire around modern Kandahar (southern Afghanistan), which was inhabited by the Iran Arachosians or Arachoti. 
The Old Persian form of its name is Harauvatis (h-r-u-v-t-i); this form is the etymological equivalent of Vedic Sarasvati - (fem., name of a river, properly &quot;rich in waters/lakes&quot; and derived from saras- &quot;lake, pond&quot;); thus the province is named after its main river, the modern Argandab (in Greek called Arachotos), a tributary of the Helmand. The same region appears in the Avestan Videvdat (Vendidad 1.12) under the indigenous dialect from Haraxv aiti - (whose -axv a- is typical non-Avestan); of these two forms Old Pers. Harauvatis (remodeled nom. -is) is rendered by Elamite Ha(r)-ra-u-ma-ti-is, Ha(r)-ru-ma-ti-is, etc., and &quot;Arachotic&quot; (and Median) *Haraxvati- by Aramaic hrhwty (cf. R.A. Bowman, Aramaic Ritual Texts from Persepolis, Chicago, 1970, p.192b); Elamite Har-ku-(ut-)ti-is (Dsf 39, Xph 16 and Persepolis tablets; see R.T. Hallock, Persepolis Fortification Tablets, Chicago, 1969, p.691a); Greek Arachosia; and, reflecting a form with metathesis, *Harauxati, Babylonian KURa-ru-ha-at-ti(-'), a-ru-hat0 , and Aramaic hrwhty (DB) respectively.

Spencer gives details from Malcom's &quot;History of Ancient Persia&quot; and states that for 2598 years some four dynasties ruled over Persia from Yama Vivanghao (Yama Vaivaswat in Sanskrit) in whose time the Deluge commenced (end of the ice age), i.e., in 9844 B.C. The rule of these four dynasties ended therefore in approximately 7200 B.C. By this time, Kai Vishtaspa became ruler of Persia. Sage Kaksivan (RV 1-122-13) speaks of one Istasva who is identified with Vishtaspa by E.S.Bharucha (quoted by Hodivala). This king is supposed to have ruled for 120 years, and so his period can be fixed in the vicinity of  7100B.C.  Zarathustra  was a contemporary of King Vishtaspa, and therefore his date can be worked out to be around 7100BC . On the basis of astronomy, Spencer determines Zarathustra's date to be around 7052 B.C., coinciding with the dates determined above.   
Traditionally, Zarathushtra has been considered a master mathematician &amp; astronomer. He is said to have calculated the rare coincidence of sunrise in Sistan (Afghanistan)with its longitudinal equinox in 7037BC &amp; called it Nav-roz, or new year. 

The Varsagira battle (referred to in hymn I.100 of the Rig Veda) is identified by many Zarathushti scholars as a civil war between the Iranians and Indian (Bharatas) sections of the Indo-Iranian tribes, at the time of Zarathushtra.  The hymn (in I.100.17) names five persons as being the main protagonists in the battle: 
In the Rigveda, Istasva (Vistaspa) is mentioned in verse I.122.13, roughly translated by Sayana  as follows: “What can Istava, Istarasmi, or any other princes do against those who enjoy the protection of Mitra and Varuna. Note the reverence to the common divinities.
a. The leader of the Varsagiras is Rjrasva.  He is identified by most scholars with the Arej-ataspa or Arj-aspa the Turanian, who is referred to in the Avesta as the main enemy of Vistapa and his brothers (Aban Yasht.5.109, 113; and Gosh Yasht, .9.30). Later Iranian tradition (as in the Shahname) goes so far as to hold Zarathustra himself to have been killed by Arjaspa. 
b. Sahadeva is one of the four companions of Rjrasva in the battle.  He is correctly identified by S.K. Hodiwala  , with the Hushdiv remembered in the Shahname (Chapter 462) as one of the main enemies of Vistaspa in the battle, who led Arjaspa’s troops from the rear.  Although not mentioned in the Avesta, Hushdiv is a natural development of Hazadaeva, which would be the exact Avestan equivalent of the Vedic name Sahadeva. 
c. The other three companions of Rjrasva in the battle are AmbarIsa, Bhayamana and Suradhas.
In the “Cama Memorial Volume, E.”  Sheheriarji quotes RV I.100.17  to identify the other persons mentioned in the said Rigvedic verse by showing that the names of certain persons known to be connected with Arjaspa in the Avesta bear the same meanings as the names of the persons in the said verse.  Thus he says that AmbarIsa is identical with Bidarfsha (= Av.  Vidarafshnik) brother of ArjAspa, since both the names mean ‘one with beautiful garments’.  Similarly, Bhayamana = Vandaremaini, father of Arjaspa, both meaning ‘the fearless one’; also Suradhas = Humayaka, brother of Arjaspa, as both the words mean ‘one with much wealth’

 
Hodiwala correctly identifies Humayaka, Arjaspa’s comrade in the Avesta (Aban Yasht, Yt.5.113) with Somaka, the son of Sahadeva (IV.15.7-10).
There is a strong likelihood that the Suradhas of I.100.17 is the same as the Somaka of IV.15.7-10.
This War also appears to have set the Avestics living in the Sapta-Sindhu homeland towards the North, and West directions . This date is in wonderful agreement with Greek sources about the times of Zarathushtra.

The main priestly enemies of the Zarathushtra &amp; his followers are the Angras (Vedic Angirases) who are condemned throughout the Avesta right down from the Gathas of Zarathushtra. The Angarisas are that section of the Atharwaan  tribe that split from the Ahura  tradition &amp; took up worship of multiple Devas (Deified Man, elevated to Godly heights). They were the composers of the early portions of the Rig Veda. The Gathas &amp; Avesta refer to  the Angirases (from which the term Angra mainyu- the evil mentality is derived),  as enemy priests &amp; their two branches, the Usiks (Vedic Usijs/Ausijas) mentioned in Ys 44.20 and Gaotemas (Gautamas), both of whom originated in and dominated the early Period of the Rig Veda compositions. The Angarisas are mentioned by Zarathushtra himself in the Gathas ( Ys48.10  ) &amp; designated as karapan (a derogatory word used in  reference to enemy priests who are extremely ritual oriented to the extent of being blind &amp; deaf to righteous intelligent reasoning) &amp; in whose hymns alone we find references to the conflict of the Vedics with the Zarathushtis.

The original Atharwaan priestly tribe had by Zarathushtras’  time split into two sections, the Angirasas, who worshipped Devas  &amp; the Brighus (Spitamaas  of the Avesta), who worshiped Asuras .  One may note that Brighu means blazing white flame &amp; Spitamas means brilliantly bright. We see the Vedics &amp; the Persians use such linguistically interchangeable terms to describe each other throughout. The Brighus had a calender based on the orbit of Venus (Shukra) &amp; the angirasas had one based on Jupiter (Brihas-pati) reflecting their alliance to the specific philosopher.

The Puranas allude to a cosmic war between the Devas, led by Brihaspati of the Angirasa line of seers &amp; the Asuras (Ahuras), led by Shukra (our Kava Ushana) of the Brighu line of seers. As such the Asura-Daeva split was already in place by Zarathushtras’ time.

It should however be noted that Zarathushtra refers to evil  “Daevas”,  as &quot;Mashya&quot; or mortals, meaning egotistic mortals who have taken the mantle of &quot;God-hood&quot;. It refer to  un-desirable/degenerate aspects of behaviour, akin to Vedic “Divs”; which is the destructive aspect of Hindu Gods.
It has been wrongly assumed for some time that the daevas of the Mazdayasna are the same as the Vedic devas and therefore Zarathushtra inverted the deva-asura dichotomy of the Vedic period. In reality, the situation is much more complex with the Vedic Gods changing their attributes over time. We thus find that the Vedic (middle &amp; later) and the Zarathushtrian systems are much less diverse than is generally assumed. 
This is borne out in Kashmiri  (Pandit) scriptures that considers Divs (Daeva) as evil &amp; opposed to the Devas who are Gods.

On the other hand, nothing can exemplify the hostility faced by Zarathushtra from the Asuras  than the fact his chief enemy  from  infancy, childhood to adulthood was an evil magician,  Dur-asuran.

On the other hand the Vedas refer to their enemies , the asuras, as militant, unethical &amp; prone to violence, the almost clinical definition of middle eastern Ashuras, who represent the Priest-Warrior caste split amongst Indo-Iranian times in an earlier time frame.

However the main enemy is defined as the Druj; or the Vedic Druh/Drugh/Dhroga , a word/term derived from the root “Dru” meaning to deceive &amp; identifying the inimical tribe Druhyus .  Reference to them occurs throughout the Gathas &amp; Rigveda in the sense of “demonic deceiver” 

From the Vandidad portion of the Kem-na Maz-da Prayer:
: “ Apa-nasyat Druksh, nasyat druksh, dvarat druksh vinasyat, apaakhedhre apa-nasyehe, maa merin-chainish gaethaao, astavaitish ashaahe.”

May the liar, the demonic deceiver, perish, rendering the righteous material world free from its depravations.

It is therefore clear that Zarathushtra arose at this time of multipolar spiritual confusion,  to raise the ancient faith out of its  failings. 

The Ground level situation faced by Zarathushtra can be summed up as follows:
During the Indo_Iranian Era the religious doctrine referred to a Single Creator who was both Creator &amp; Destroyer. This exclusive CREATOR was called Ahu-ra (Vedic Asu-ra) or Life Force, &amp; exemplified by the vedics as Shiva/Rudra.
Starting from an initial expansion to his spouse (Parvati) &amp; his Son (Ganesh); over a period of time, the term Asura became plural &amp; a galaxy of Asuras take stage, each with his/her own independent existence. This expansion of God-hood ended up encompasing   negative entities  such as Bhairava, (the wrathfull destroyer),  Mahakala, (wrath, druj, adorned with snakes &amp; bones)  Kuvera, (4 armed, God of wealth) , Asura-maya (the builder of illusions), Rahu-Ketu (Maleficent last 2 planets of the  solar system, or astrologically, the 2 extreme positions of the moon’s orbit), Vasuki and Vritra (Serpents-Gods). This philosophy, exemplified by the Priest-Warrior caste split, spread as far as the middle east where it was called Ashura the warrior God.
As the concept of a single exclusive Creator was usurped by a host os Asuras; over time, a 
class of &quot;Gods&quot; , namely the Devas, the shining, visible, Mortal ones (originally temporal lords, literally lord of the land, a philosopher-king, in the kavya mold, who was Deified ); came about as theological rivals. Devas  were originally mortal &amp; 
“Mashya” (mortal) in the Gathas, Avesta &amp; the Vedas. Thus Kings of the land, based on their material wealth &amp; power appointed themselves God. We see this in the Pharoes of Egypt.
Daevas included Indra,(mainly) and others. Indra,was a warrior based entity whose attributes were expanded from the original Aryan hero Vrita. Over time (the Vedas being composed over 6000 years) Previous “asuras” were re-incorporated as devas, over different periods of time, as in Varuna, Shiva, Savitr (our Khwtr), Agni,(our Atar-sh),  Soma (our Hoama) , Mithra  &amp; Saraswati (our Ha-urva-tat).
Society ended up getting classified as Ahuras (those who follow Ahura) &amp; Devas (those who follow Devas).
   These were times when belief in multiple Gods was the norm. When each God was feared for his/her wrath, jealousy; &amp; obedience was demanded in  ways so demeaning that man was reduced to a thoughtless entity, a plaything for the perverse games of the Gods. 

In effect therefore, Zarathushtra challenged the existing definition of Asuras as numerous demi-gods under one supreme, &amp; placed Ahura-Mazda, the Loving, compassionate, lord of intellect &amp; wisdom, as the supreme creator. We are ofcourse believers in Ahura, the single, self created Life force as opposed to numerous Daevas who are mortals (Mashya) elevated to Godhood &amp; having an independent existence.
While Ahura Mazda is fashioned along the lines of Rudra/Shiva, being all  powerful, self created, there is a vital distinction. Whereas Asura’s attributes is also that of destroyer, Ahura Mazda is the Loving, compassionate God who knows no wrath &amp; whose strength is knowledge &amp; enlightenment. Unlike Shiva who parades around with a Damroo (Drum) made of skulls, Zarathushtra carries a staff with a Gao-mukh (face of a cow) to represent the selfless mother earth (Gey-ush Urvaan). So while Shiva represents a dualist nature of both creator &amp; destroyer, Ahura Mazda is the absolute creator &amp; epitome of perfection (Ha-urva-tat) . Being a loving God, there is no provision for him to be destructive; as destruction is considered evil. Death itself is considered a temporary victory of evil over good. For Zarathushtra, the only source of destruction is poor, unintelligent, un-righteous choices made by man (Angra-Mainyu). He maintains the definition of Ahura as the formless, self created one,  jettisons the independent multitude into one single entity. He also jettisons all negative entities such as Vrita (evil snakes), association with bones, destruction &amp; wrath (Asura Bhairav, Mahakala) that have crept into the then existing philosophy. This pits him against his own tribe.

In Ys30.10 Zarathushtra mentions “Skenda” (identified in the hindu scriptures as the son of Shiva, &amp; subject to various trials &amp; tribulations during his lifetime), allegorically, as the self destructive fate of those willfully opposing Truth.

Work is worship (epitomized in the Yenghe Hatam mantra) therefore becomes the epitaph of the Daena, underlining the real reason for preference of worship, facing a living, breathing fire (Atar-sh) as opposed to an idol or image worship.  An image although a good focal point of devotion, obscures the true aim of worship, namely the necessity of continuous, Intelligent (Wise), compassionate acts of Selfnessness; in a way mimicking the requirement to regularly &amp; diligently feed the divine fire (Atar-sh).

Kashmiri theology has  a three-way division consisting of devas, asuras, and daevas; wherein Deva or devata is a positive (sattwa) power related to knowledge &amp; understanding; Asura (rajas), a power related to activity, &amp; Daeva (tamas), a power related to blind acquisitiveness.  Sometimes the term rakshasa (monster) is used interchangeably with daeva. The Rakshasa’s behavior was exemplified by a form of marriage (unfortunately still common in Islamic Iran) involving the violent seizure or rape of a girl after the defeat or destruction of her relatives  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.73.62.215|70.73.62.215]] ([[User talk:70.73.62.215|talk]]) 03:22, 14 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

He is obviously connected with the Achaemenid dynasty, as he is called the persian.
: Avestan Zaraθuštra is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian *zarat-uštra-, which is in turn “perhaps”[1] a zero-grade form of *zarant-uštra-. This is supported by reconstructions from later Iranian languages – in particular from Middle Persian Zartosht, which is the form the name has in the ninth- to twelfth-century Zoroastrian texts.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_dynasty

The town flourished and attained prominence and political repute with the rise of the first Babylonian dynasty. It was the &quot;holy city&quot; of Babylonia by approximately 2300 BC, and the seat of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 612 BC. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius the Great, Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy (Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north), as well as a centre of learning and scientific advancement. In Achaemenid Persia, the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalised and flourished, and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations. The city was the administrative capital of the Persian Empire, the preeminent power of the then known world, and it played a vital part in the history of that region for over two centuries. Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon

From this Article
The second, and &quot;more serious&quot;[24] factor for the association with astrology was the notion that Zoroaster was a Babyloniann. The alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos (cf. Agathias 2.23-5, Clement Stromata I.15), which—so Cumont and Bidez—derived from a Semitic form of his name. The Pythagorean tradition considered the mathematician to have studied with Zoroaster in Babylonia (Porphyry Life of Pythagoras 12, Alexander Polyhistor apud Clement's Stromata I.15, Diodorus of Eritrea, Aristoxenus apud Hippolitus VI32.2). Lydus (On the Months II.4) attributes the creation of the seven-day week to &quot;the Babylonians in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes,&quot; and who did so because there were seven planets. The Suda's chapter on astronomia notes that the Babylonians learned their astrology from Zoroaster. Lucian of Samosata (Mennipus 6) decides to journey to Babylon &quot;to ask one of the magi, Zoroaster's disciples and successors,&quot; for their opinion.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster

While the theorem that now bears his name was known and previously utilized by the Babylonians and Indians, he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof. It must, however, be stressed that the way in which the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers, implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources.[5] Because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that Pythagoras himself worked on or proved this theorem. For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta-mathematical problems. Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of Plato over two centuries after the death of Pythagoras, mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to Pythagoras. This attribution has stuck, down the centuries up to modern times.[6] The earliest known mention of Pythagoras's name in connection with the theorem occurred five centuries after his death, in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch.

This section on some alleged global conspiracy of mathematicians is irrelevant to this discussion and a waste of valuable space. Zarathushtra was not a mathematician, nor did he ever visit Athens. He *probably* never made it west of modern-day Afghanistan.

== OR? ==

the piece {&quot;Nietzsche creates a characterization of Zarathustra as the mouthpiece for Nietzsche's own ideas against morality. Nietzsche did so because—so says Nietzsche in his autobiographical Ecce Homo (IV/Schicksal.3)—Zarathustra was a moralist (&quot;was the exact reverse of an immoralist&quot; like Nietzsche) and because &quot;in his teachings alone is truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue.&quot; Zarathustra &quot;created&quot; morality in being the first to reveal it, &quot;first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things.&quot; Nietzsche sought to overcome the morality of Zarathustra by using the Zarathustrian virtue of truthfulness; thus Nietzsche found it piquant to have his Zarathustra character voice the arguments against morality.[f]'&quot;} (in the section [[Zoroaster#In_the_post-classical_era]]) has to be removed as it is based on quotation from Nietzsche's own work and hence [[WP:OR]]. The point is that 1. Nietzsche can not be considered &lt;u&gt;immoralist&lt;/u&gt;, the way we understand the word in 2009. (read [[Nietzsche#Morality|Nietzsche Morality]]) 2. A person who wrote [[Beyond_Good_and_Evil_(book)|Beyond good and evil]] is certainly moralist.--[[User:Xashaiar|Xashaiar]] ([[User talk:Xashaiar|talk]]) 22:23, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

:First of all, just because something &quot;is based on quotation from Nietzsche's own work&quot; does not qualify it as OR. Secondly, you are not in a position to claim that &quot;a person who wrote Beyond good and evil is certainly moralist&quot;, and that work has nothing to do with ''Thus spake...'', hence again OR. Third, Nietsche is not an authority on Zoroaster, and his opinion on Zoroaster is ''only'' relevant in a discussion of Nietsche's own work. Doing anything else with it is OR. Fourth, Nietsche ''did'' use &quot;Zarathustra as the mouthpiece for Nietzsche's own ideas against morality&quot;, and it does not matter whether we are discussing Victorian-era morality, or 2009 morality - the fact remains that Nietsche ''identified himself'' in a certain way, and used the ''name'' &quot;Zoroaster&quot; as a hand-puppet to criticize society. Those are the points made by that section, and if you have a problem with the word &quot;morality&quot;, then perhaps that needs to be explained, but it does not invalidate what the paragraph said. Fifth, it would be much appreciated if you did not forward your post-1979 emigree vocabulary vis-a-vis the use of the word &quot;Persian&quot; as if it belonged in the academic sphere. Ironically, the insertion itself ignores Victorian-era diction, and this article is in any case not the place to discuss such matters. Sixth, your citation style is not compatible with the citation style used by this article.
:So, all in all, it would be appreciated if you undid your edits (removals and additions), and put them up discussion instead.

::::In the previous section of this talk page someone stated &quot;Also please form full sentences so the audience can follow you better.&quot; I think this was worth mentioning once again. What are you really talking about. Let us go into details. The paragraph that does not bother you is:
:::::&quot;&lt;u&gt;Nietzsche creates a characterization of Zarathustra as the mouthpiece for Nietzsche's own ideas against morality. Nietzsche did so because—so says Nietzsche in his autobiographical Ecce Homo (IV/Schicksal.3)—Zarathustra was a moralist (&quot;was the exact reverse of an immoralist&quot; like Nietzsche) and because &quot;in his teachings alone is truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue.&quot; Zarathustra &quot;created&quot; morality in being the first to reveal it, &quot;first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things.&quot; Nietzsche sought to overcome the morality of Zarathustra by using the Zarathustrian virtue of truthfulness; thus Nietzsche found it piquant to have his Zarathustra character voice the arguments against morality.&lt;/u&gt;
::::::1. This is improper english. 2. &lt;u&gt;Nietzsche creates a characterization of Zarathustra as the mouthpiece for Nietzsche's own ideas against morality.&lt;/u&gt; who says this? (although one should look at [[WP:AWW]] as well.) This sentence contradicts [[WP:MORALIZE]]. 3. What is the point of having this paragraph? 4. the paragraph I had added, had the point that D. Ashouri summarizes as &quot;By choosing the name of ‘Zarathustra’ as prophet of his philosophy, as he has expressed clearly, he followed the paradoxical aim of paying homage to the original Aryan prophet and reversing his teachings at the same time. The original Zoroastrian world view interprets being essentially on a moralistic basis and depicts the world as an arena for the struggle of the two fundamentals of being, Good and Evil, represented in two antagonistic divine figures.&quot; and my only POV was that: this choice and change of name &lt;u&gt;Zoroaster-&gt;Zarathustra&lt;/u&gt; is significant. In fact if you think about it, my sentence express that &quot;immorality, morality&quot; conflict you point to more concretely and moreover gives reference to an RS. Do you get this point? 5. The sentence &lt;u&gt;Nietzsche sought to overcome the morality of Zarathustra by using the Zarathustrian virtue of truthfulness; thus Nietzsche found it piquant to have his Zarathustra character voice the arguments against morality.&lt;/u&gt; is also problematic: First the sentence does not make much sense, secondly you use the same name to refer to two-differently-symbolized characters (cf. the quote from Ashouri). Do you get this point?

::::: As in the section above this one, I do write in complete sentences. I am surprised that you would put yourself down to the same level as someone who found it difficult to comprehend a simple ten-word question.
::::: Anyway... 1) No, it is not improper English. It may be unnecessarily convoluted and difficult to understand, but its not improper English. 
::::: 2) As I said before, Nietsche ''himself'' says he employs &quot;Zarathustra&quot; to express Nietzsche's own ideas against morality, or as Nietsche called himself, [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp9/ot_zoreur_20050829.html &quot;the first immoralist&quot;]. This article also ''says'' Nietsche said it himself, and cites chapter and verse that he said it in. Really. And no, it does not contradict [[WP:MORALIZE]], which refers to letting facts speak for themselves. There is no evaluation ''at all'' of what Nietsche said. The mere fact that the word &quot;morality&quot; appears (Nietsche's own word) does not in any way constitute a relationship to WP:MORALIZE. 
::::: 3) Are you asking what is the point of a paragraph that describes Nietsche's use of Zoroaster as his literary avatar? I would have thought that the answer was obvious: The section is titled &quot;Western perceptions&quot;, and Nietsche's use of Zoroaster as his alter-ego [http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp9/ot_zoreur_20050829.html is a classic example of &quot;Western perceptions&quot;]. &quot;In the history of the Western perceptions of Zoroaster nothing remained the same after Friedrich Nietzsche&quot;.
::::: 4a) Upto your &quot;... and my only POV was that ...&quot; everything is essentially fine. It is not significantly different to what the paragraph already said. Indeed, you may even wish to read the preceding summary more carefully yourself: the key terms &quot;choosing the name&quot; and &quot;paradoxically&quot; are clues that would assist you in revising your notions about Nietsche. 
::::: 4b) Everything after &quot;and my only POV was that&quot; is not fine. Nietche's opinion on Zoroaster is strictly with respect to his own fantasy figure, and that is as far as anyone may go. This article is not about Nietsche, nor is Nietsche's opinion relevant here for anything but ''Nietsche's'' own appropriation of the name &quot;Zarathustra&quot; to represent himself. And you may also [[WP:NOT#SOAPBOX|not]] instrumentalize this article (or any other article on Wikipedia) as your [[WP:SOAPBOX]]. If you have a trouble with that policy, then file a case at [[WP:RFC]] to get the policy changed.
::::: 5) I get the point, and I concur. Incidentally, it is not &quot;my&quot; use that you are making a case out of. I did not write that sentence you refer to (or, for that matter, the paragraph as it stands now). [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoroaster&amp;diff=177163110&amp;oldid=177126519 This is how I had written it]. If you are interested in ''why'' Nietsche characterterized himself as an &quot;immoralist&quot; (a subject irrelevant to this article), then you ought to read the same chapter in Ecce Homo yourself, and abstain from making wide-sweeping claims of what Nietsche was or wasn't, or what he was thinking. He was not thinking what ''you'' think he thought.
::::: With respect to owning the article, I suggest you reflect on your four-time forcing of your opinion here, your self-acknowledged attempt to use this article as a soapbox, your disregard of conventions used in this article, your disregard of WP:REVERT, and your disregard of WP:BRD. These actions speak volumes for the license you give yourself, and the disregard of everyone/everything else here.

Say, would it be out of line to show the opinion that Zarathushtra was a Hindu Brahmin who moved to Iran? According to an English documentary I've seen, entitled &quot;The Story of God&quot;, that is precisely who he was, a Hindu Brahmin reformer, much like the Buddha.

(2) As Paul B points out, it does not in fact say that Zoroaster was a Hindu Brahmin. It says that he was an ''Aryan'' Brahmin -- a reasonable inference, considering that the pre-Zoroastrian religion of Iran was probably much like the ancient Vedic religion. Zoroaster was certainly an &quot;Aryan&quot; (i.e. an Indo-European), and he was a priest. I admit that I don't know whether the ancient Iranians called their priests &quot;Brahmins&quot;, but the Vedic Indians certainly did.

:::Anyhoo, I think there's a lesson to be taken away from the overblown argument above: Whenever someone (e.g. an anonymous editor) suggests a source that is readily available for viewing on YouTube, always check the source itself; don't rely on the editor's description of it.

== Zarathushtra Help Me ==

Lord Ahura-Mazda! You people do go nuts, don't you? I was actually inquiring as to whether anyone could refresh my memory on this point of Z. being a Hindu Brahmin. Someone did clarify that as well as clarifying the documentary.

Also, to the point of Brahmanism, it is truly misleading to try to say there are &quot;Aryan&quot; Brahmins and &quot;Hindu&quot; Brahmins. Uhhh... who were the Hindus? Oh! ARYANS!

As to certain people's apparently vicious hatred of documentaries, do you think they are any worse than Wikipedia? What, are you now going to shoot down every line in Wikipedia that has a documentary as its source??

:In regard to the Hindu vs Aryan thing, I don't think that Paul meant to imply that Hindus and Aryans were two different groups. Rather, the point is that the documentary calls Zoroaster only an Aryan, not a Hindu. (There are Aryans who aren't Hindus -- Iranians, for example.)

*Oh, one moment if you please... those of Iran, undoubtedly related and perhaps highly like Aryans, are not technically &quot;Aryans&quot;, nor should they be called that. They always should be referenced as Persians, unless you have a more ancient knowledge than anyone else on earth. You will say &quot;Persians descend from Aryans&quot;, but we do not know that. For example, we know the Celts and Aryans were aware of their relationship--does that make my Scots neighbor an Aryan too? Therefore it is even less productive to say that someone could have been an Aryan Brahmin, because there is technically no &quot;Brahmin&quot; (''Brahmana'') outside Hindu-believing India. And what the heck have any of you got against documentaries? I think the support for &quot;The Story of God&quot; shown here is a wonderful thing... and those of you who know the documentary know that it stated very carefully that it was a legend that Zoroaster might have been a Hindu Brahmin looking to reform Hinduism. [[User:RevAntonio|RevAntonio]] ([[User talk:RevAntonio|talk]]) 20:07, 26 April 2009 (UTC)
::The word &quot;Aryan&quot; can be used in several different ways. Celts are &quot;Aryans&quot; if you use the term as a synonym for &quot;Indo-European&quot;, as it often was in the early 20th century. If you use it as a synonym for &quot;Indo-Iranian&quot;, then they are not &quot;Aryan&quot;. It's just a word. There are many other words that have similar ambiguities. The Scots are &quot;British&quot; in that they live in the British isles. However if you use &quot;British&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Brythonic&quot;, they are not British. The Bretons are British in one sense, and they are not British but French in another sense. The same fuzziness is true of the use of &quot;Brahmin&quot;. The word was being used in the docmentary as the best extant term that would be the culturally appropriate equivalent of &quot;priest&quot;, that's all.

*No one is getting upset. The upset is only in stupidity regarding historical terms and definitions.

If you want to say something not quite as stupid, you could say &quot;Vedic-like&quot;, but I wish people could stop saying there were Aryans outside India. Even &quot;Vedic-like&quot; would draw laughs from the serious scientific community. Further, I don't actually see the need to emphasize Hinduism when discussing Zarathushtra. It's not really helpful. It matters little from today's viewpoint whether Zarathushtra was a HINDU Brahmin or not.

*All right, firstly, I will apologize for earlier belligerence. I acknowledge the ancient use of ''Aryana'' and related forms. What I tried to get across here is that it was suggested Zarathushtra may have been a HINDU Brahmin, that there were no Brahmins, Hindu or otherwise, in Iran (that we know), and that those folk did NOT generaly refer to themselves as ''Aryanam''--the people in India did do.[[Special:Contributions/75.21.96.166|75.21.96.166]] ([[User talk:75.21.96.166|talk]]) 22:35, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

::Hi again.

I'm not sure who actually said he was one; it seems more sources think he might have been a &quot;Magi&quot;.

*A fair answer to this query is that '''it is impossible to trace roots directly back from Christianity and Islam to the Zarathushtri or to Judaism'''.

It's like saying Islam descends from Christinaity when you say Christianity descends from Judaism. There is off-shooting, I guess, or perhaps borrowing, but no line of descent. Christianity was not even an offshoot of Judaism: they went well out of the way to emphasize they were not Jews. And just ask a Muslim if he is anything other than a Mohamedan!

**Actually, it is fair to say that Christianity is a heresy of Judaism and that Islam is a heresy of ''both'' Christianity and Judaism.  Whether current religious leadership wants to admit these facts or not, Judaism, Christianity and Islam all three borrowed much from Indian Hinduism, as did all the other &quot;pagan&quot; or &quot;multi-theistic&quot; religions.  Both Buddha and Zarathustra preached heresies of Hinduism.  What all religions have in common is a reliance on the faith of the individual adherents. Faith is a belief in things unseen and un-knowable.  Any article about a religion should point this out.

== What was his true name? ==

I've known for awhile now that Zoroaster is an Anglicized version of the name we render as Zarathustra, and that it comes from the Latinized version of the name. But what is the true name of this prophet rendered in English (in other words the direct Anglicized version from the Avestan name)? Is it really Zarathustra, or is it Zartosht as he is known in Persian? Or is it a third Anglicized version that I have not heard?

Also, since Zarathustra is the name which is still the closer rendering of his true name (even if it isn't the exact Anglicized version), shouldn't that be the name of this article? [[Special:Contributions/71.191.199.74|71.191.199.74]] ([[User talk:71.191.199.74|talk]]) 17:21, 9 January 2010 (UTC)

== Renaming ==
Suggest renaming to Zarathushtra or the Avestan transliteration.

# The name Zoroaster, replacing the Avestan/Persian &quot;zar[o]&quot; (meaning &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;golden&quot;) with the Greek word &quot;zoro&quot; (meaning &quot;undiluted&quot;), is a cultural substitution rather than a translation. For example, while the name &quot;John&quot; in the west references the original &quot;Yehokanan,&quot; in China its similar-sounding substitute &quot;Yuē-hàn&quot; is phonetic substitution. So while the Hebrew original means &quot;[[Yahweh]] is gracious&quot;, the Chinese means &quot;treaty/covenant + brush/pen.&quot; Thus we try to avoid cultural substitutions like these, even if they are Greek in origin.
# The Greek θ (and its IPA descendant /θ/) give a useful non-digraph representation of a [[voiceless dental fricative]], but it is still not standard English as is the digraph &quot;th.&quot; 

These arguments are not contradictory. The issue of replacing &quot;θ&quot; with the common digraph is quite different from the issue using exonyms as &quot;standard English,&quot; or Greek exonyms based on cultural substitution. -[[User:Stevertigo|Stevertigo]] ([[User:Stevertigo/Log|w]] | [[User_talk:Stevertigo|t]] | [[Special:Contributions/Stevertigo|e]]) 22:22, 1 June 2010 (UTC)

I agree with [[User:Stevertigo]]. I do not know if the change &quot;Zoroaster --&gt; Zarathustra&quot; can be made with support of any wiki policy, but since there is no controversy here and the original Avestan name is (in view of Greek Zoroaster) better, nicer, more appropriate, I would support that change of title.

But your point here is entirely incorrect, as all of the names you mention are in fact ''transliterations'' from the originals, not ''cultural substitutions'' as &quot;Zoroaster&quot; is. Let's take them one by one: 1) &quot;'''Confucius'''&quot; is an approximate ''phonetic transcription'' of the Chinese &quot;Kǒng zǐ,&quot; with the only important difference being the &quot;[[-us]]&quot;/&quot;[[-ius]]&quot; suffix, which is a nominal convention in Roman names and has philological, not cultural, usage. &quot;子&quot; (&quot;zǐ,&quot; &quot;child/son/daughter&quot;) in his actual name is itself a common Chinese affix found in names that has arguably neutral semantics (cf. [[Chinese style name]]). 2) '''Mark Antony''' is directly and clearly descended from &quot;M·ANTONIVS·M·F·M·N&quot; ie. ''Marcus Antonius Marci Filius Marci Nepos'', and the etymologies are directly Western. Note however that the article, while titled with the English transliteration, uses the endonym &quot;Marcus Antonius&quot; first, followed by the explicit notation &quot;&lt;u&gt;known in English as Mark Antony&lt;/u&gt;&quot; for the English. If this is a form you like, we can take that into consideration for this article as a compromise. 3) The English name &quot;'''Jesus'''&quot; [d͡ʒiːzʌs] or [d͡ʒiːzɘs] does not sound like the Hebrew &quot;Yeshua,&quot; [jɛːʃuːa], but the differences are all attributable to natural and not deliberate causes: a) representational differences between alphabets (&quot;י&quot;→&quot;Y&quot;→&quot;IE&quot;)  b) [[vowel shift]] over time (&quot;IE&quot;→&quot;J&quot;[j]→&quot;J&quot;[d͡ʒ]) and c) the addition (again) of the Roman -us/-ius as an affix for a proper name. Again a case where there is no deliberate cultural substitution of semantics going on. So, if you could find better examples to support your point, by all means. -SC
# PaulB wrote: ''&quot;There is nothing &quot;destructive&quot; about this at all. It's the norm within academia.&quot;'' - There are many &quot;norms&quot; within &quot;academia.&quot; Which &quot;academia&quot; are you talking about? Perhaps you mean distinctly English academia, and not Persian academia? Or perhaps you mean secular academia, and not religious or even Mazdayasna academia. Maybe you just mean &quot;Western academia.&quot; In which case you are using &quot;academia&quot; here to simply mean &quot;The West&quot; or &quot;Western culture.&quot; By &quot;norm[s]&quot; perhaps you just mean &quot;conventions.&quot; -SC
# PaulB wrote: ''&quot;Data, btw, is wrong. Despite being an android from the future, he's strangely expressing a very 20th century American obsession with cultural ownership of identity.&quot;''' - &quot;Despite being an android from the future,&quot; Data is nevertheless not wrong about his own name: An individual's name is theirs and no-one elses.

:::This long list of points is, once again, largely irrelevant. A lot of text does not make your argument more convincing if most of it is off the point. I understood your point about the difference between transliteration and cultural substitution the first time you made it (hence my reply &quot;whether or not it arose from a cultural substitution or anything else is essentially irrelevant&quot;). So, to repeat, '''''it's irrelevant'''''. And I know perfectly well how Jesus came to be called Jesus.  I'm just not interested in parading irrelevant learning. That some ancient Greeks got their onomastics in a twist is an interesting historical fact. It's already briefly addressed in the article. It ''led to'' the current situation that Zoroaster is the most commonly used form in English. [[WP:Common name]] makes no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate ''reasons'' why a version of a name became common. Full stop. Even the version &quot;Zarathusta&quot; is normally used with reference to Nietzsche. The version &quot;Zarathushtra&quot; is very singificantly less common. I disagree with your points about cultural ownership of identity, but to explain why would fill this page with even more pointless and irrelvant verbiage. The fact remains that names differ between languages, and the use of the common name within the language is the rule.

::::Umm. Article naming choice is always an issue of policy, and the policy (here: -&gt; [[WP:UCN]] &lt;-) is: &quot;Articles are normally titled using the most common English-language name of the subject of the article. In determining what this name is, we follow the usage of reliable sources, such as those used as references for the article.&quot; I have no idea whether &quot;Zoraster&quot; or &quot;Zarathustra&quot; is more common in the English-language serious historical literature. In the more casual material I'm familiar with, &quot;Zoraster&quot; is very very dominant, with &quot;Zarathustra&quot; almost always referring to the Nitzchean construct, not the historical figure. As PaulB points out, using the English common name is what Wikipedia does for all historical figures, even when that figure, or his peers and culture, used a different name. Other examples where Wikipedia uses an &quot;incorrect&quot; name are [[Eric the Red]] (real name &quot;Eiríkr Þorvaldsson&quot;), [[Mehmed I]] (&quot;Mehmet&quot; in Ottoman Turkish), [[Alexander the Great]] (&quot;Mégas Aléxandros&quot;), [[Roland]] (&quot;Hruodland&quot;), [[Pocohantas]] (&quot;Matoka&quot;, or &quot;Mrs. Rebecca Rolfe&quot;), and on and on and on.

=== Responses to Studerby, George ===
OK, lets just get these out of the way, so that Studerby can understand the difference here between a latter-day cultural substitution, and all of his examples which (like with PaulB's examples above: Confucius, Mark Antony, Jesus) are simple translations/transliterations:
# &quot;Erik the Red&quot; is, according to Britannica, a nickname he received during his youth referring to [[Ginger Kids|his hair]], and the Nordic original may in fact have been similar to the Norse: &quot;.&quot; 
# &quot;Mehmed&quot; is a transliteration of the rather common Arab name محمد, (ie. [[Muhammad (name)]]), which though in the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]] alphabet is romanized to &quot;Mehmet,&quot; in Arabic script form has the final letter د ([[dal]] [d]) not ﻂ (ti [t]). So &quot;Mehmed&quot; is a perfectly natural transliteration. And considering the phonemic closeness between [d] and [t], as well as the prevalance of the romanization &quot;Muhammad,&quot; not to mention the importance of preserving tri-consonantal roots, of which د [d] is the final, all mean that your example here is.. to borrow from PaulB's unfortunate language &quot;[besides the point].&quot;
# &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; is simply a translation of &quot;Megas&quot; (&quot;[the] great&quot;) &quot;Alexandros,&quot; with a particle translation of the English affix -er to the Greek &quot;-os.&quot; Both standard translations, and again without any semantic substitution. 
# &quot;Roland&quot; is the nominal transliteration of Frankish &quot;Hruodland,&quot; from the Germanic ''hrōd'' (&quot;fame&quot; + land &quot;land, territory&quot;). Anyone familiar with Germanic to Old English (this was 1300 years ago) phonology will see little issue with spelling differences. 
# &quot;Pocahontas&quot; apparently was her own &quot;childhood nickname&quot; in her own native [[Powhattan language]] that meant &quot;little wanton,&quot; and which was presented as her actual name &quot;out of a superstitious fear.&quot; The only relevant issue here is the substitution made for ostensibly cultural reasons, but again this happened in her own lifetime with her own nickname.
Studerby wrote: ''&quot;The point is that this is Wikipedia policy; the argument for changing the name is not a new argument.&quot;'' - Again, like PaulB above, you appear to have made a number of claims which are entirely refutable, only to fall back on an argument that Wikipedia policy somehow prohibits using actual endonyms, and allows only for the English exonyms &amp;mdash;simply because the are &quot;more common.&quot; There are thousands of ways in which this is not actually true, for example the Asian convention to use surnames first alone contradicts your view, or the Spanish-Latin use of matrilineal surnames, to say nothing of the countless Germanic, French and Nordic related articles which use special non-English letterforms and diacritics.

# George Herbert wrote: ''&quot;I understand the issue with wanting to be culturally relative and sensitive, but policy balances that with the desire to be most useful for English language readers. Useful in this sense means easy to find and relevant.&quot;'' - I appreciate such balances, but you might consider that the issue here is an example of the exception to the rule, where the mitigating issue of using something &quot;common&quot; also means using something that presents itself as ''not just culturally insensitive'', but supportive of an etymological thread that is entirely the [[WP:NOR|original research|]] of historical Greek historians. The argument for keeping Zoro- (&quot;Undiluted&quot;) rather than Zar[a]- (&quot;Golden&quot;) is simply an argument for preserving original research that, aside from its Occidental prevalence, perhaps otherwise has only the merit of certain lesser antiquity. -SC
# GWH: ''&quot;We specifically do not rename articles from the most common English language name - whether that be to a more technically accurate but limited usage jargon term, or to a more culturally or linguistically sensitive or accurate translation or transliteration.&quot;'' - There are always exceptions to the rules, and I suggest that you consider this one such a case. It could be that the article itself is incorrect in asserting that the zar[a] -&gt; zoro subtitution is entirely based on the phonetics (Persian ɒː has certain similarity to &quot;o&quot;), rather than a semantic substitution. If it is the latter, its Western culturalism. If its the former, then its simply an issue of [zɒːrɒː] being transliterated per Greek conventions.

And if I may repeat a suggestion I made above, please consider the [[Mark Antony]] case as an example of a compromise where the title remains &quot;Zoroaster&quot; but the leading name is, well, ''his actual name''. -[[User:Stevertigo|Stevertigo]] ([[User:Stevertigo/Log|w]] | [[User_talk:Stevertigo|t]] | [[Special:Contributions/Stevertigo|e]]) 00:09, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
::The issue is how easy it is for english-language-natives, with their cultural and educational background, to find the article and clearly understand that they found what they were looking for.
::It doesn't matter if the most common usage in english is &quot;wrong&quot; - that's what we use.
::The alternate proposal you made, where the actual article lead is Zar- with Zor- below it slightly (which you implemented a bit ago in the article) doesn't make finding the article harder, and shouldn't in any significant manner confuse people as to whether the article they found was what they were looking for (your inclusion of Zor- prominently below it should make that clear).  As it doesn't cause problems for either of these goals I see nothing wrong with it, and generally support the new language, though I think that I slightly prefer moving the Zoroaster spelling a bit more prominently to the front (perhaps parenthetically in the first sentence, following the immediate lede).

:::Great. Thank you. Yeah, I figured out from the Mark Antony example that the form [English title/ Endonym first] seems to be fair to both points of view here. Though there's sometimes a little bit of a strange feeling when first seeing a different name than the title, its mitigated by treating the English exonym in bold right afterward. I don't personally think &quot;Zo-&quot; is too far down, and humbly suggest that maybe its just that initial strangeness that you are dealing with. If this is a good compromise, and Ive seen a few articles with this form, then its mitigating aspect of appeasing both Anglophile and endonym camps should quickly enough override the strangeness. In any case, I'll look to see if the form you suggest, putting the English form into the onomastic parenthetical, works a little better for you.

:Ehm, Ive always known/read his name as Zarathustra, first time i seen &quot;Zoroaster&quot; being used,
altough im not native english speaker so i cant say for sure, but at most places (public, generally less academic)
an overwhelming majority seem to use Zarathustra.

as an example, here's a google search on:
Zarathustra  =  5 450 000 result
Zoroaster =  2 480 000 result

I know, it's just a google search, but still interesting i think regarding the discussion above.

==Baruch Spinoza?==
In the Philosophy section, it says that Zoroastrians note the similarities between Zoroaster's philosophy and Spinoza's. This may very well be true, but it should at least be cited, and it should ideally specify the ideas in question.

== Zar-, zar[at]- ==
The article previously read: 
:&quot;The first half of the name does not otherwise appear in Avestan, which makes it necessary to seek a meaning in the etymology of the name.&quot;

While the second half of the sentence appears to be superfluous writing, the first part I took as accurate, and after some refactoring, the same passage is part of a different section which integrates the two: 
:&quot;While the first half of the name &quot;zarat-&quot; is strongly referenced to mean &quot;golden,&quot; (cf. meanings) from the old Eastern-Iranian (and Modern Persian) &quot;zar-&quot; (-زر), it does not itself appear in Avestan.&quot; 

The issue here now is that the phrase &quot;[zarat-] does not itself appear in Avestan&quot; does not appear to be true, or is else referencing zarat- in its exact form explicitly to the exclusion of related zar- based words, which, as online Avestan dictionaries plainly show, are straightforward. For example ''zairi-'' (golden/yellow), ''zairitem'' (golden/green), ''zaranaênem'' (golden, of gold).[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/aveol-BF-X.html][http://www.avesta.org/avdict/avdict.htm#ratu]. So it seems to be a case where the emphasis of &quot;does not itself appear&quot; is strongly typed, to the point of being plainly innacurate. -[[User:Stevertigo|Stevertigo]] ([[User:Stevertigo/Log|w]] | [[User_talk:Stevertigo|t]] | [[Special:Contributions/Stevertigo|e]]) 21:04, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

== Muslim attitudes at the time of conquest of Iran ==
the section of Muslim view of Zoroaster and his religion is silent on an essential point - for the Muslim rulers of Iran the divine inspiration or lack of it in the local religion was not just an issue of speculative theology. Rather, it was a question of whether to classify Iranians as &quot;pagans&quot; who had to be converted or killed or else let them live as &quot;ahl al kitab&quot;. Apparently the first course of action was, at the time, not feasible, which is why they were so quick at figuring out that Zoroaster was in fact a prophet of God.

[[Mary Boyce]]'s scholarship was highly respected, gaining her an international reputation and fellowship at numerous academic societies and institutions. Her speciality remained the religions of speakers of Eastern Iranian languages, in particular Manichaenism and [[Zoroastrianism]].

== Date of Birth in Iranian tradition and today ==
In the first second paragraph it written &quot;...and Iranian tradition places him at about 570 BC&quot;, it is not true. Zoroastrians OFFICIALLY (at least in Iran) believe that the prophet was born 3748 years ago (~1738 BC), on 6th day of month Farvardin. So this part of the article is wrong. I will remove it. If you want to change it back to 570 BC, please give a reference this time. [[Special:Contributions/115.133.209.99|115.133.209.99]] ([[User talk:115.133.209.99|talk]]) 20:22, 10 July 2010 (UTC)

:: A good lede for a ''concept article'' often does summarize the entire concept. But a good lede for an ''object article'' such as this one often simply cannot get into every detail. We have to decide what is or is not essential, according to [[WP:WEIGHT]]. I know what [[WP:LEDE]] says, I helped write it.
::Zaro's birth just isn't all that interesting to note in the first few sentences, and in fact little of ''anyone's'' notability, is attributable to the circumstances surrounding their birth. For a quasi-mythical figure like Zaro, where information about their human lives is surrounded in a religious mythos, notes about their lives in general are not essential either. Ultimately people like Zaro, ''Jesus etc.'' are more symbolic than human, and that's the way their articles have to be treated.

[[User:S. J. Reddi|S. J. Reddi]] ([[User talk:S. J. Reddi|talk]]) 19:43, 11 April 2012 (UTC)== Commented-out undocumented paragraph ==

I commented-out a paragraph at the beginning of the &quot;In other religious systems&quot; section, thus:

&quot;Zorastrians do not believe in Abrahamic religions. They do believe that Abrahamic prophets where Ahrimani (Satanic). They also believe the followers of the main three Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) are followers of Ahriman (Satan). Zorastrians keep themselves away from followers of other religions in order to avoid devil's spirit.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} (based on an interview with Mr. Abramian, a zorastrian scholar, 2003)&quot; 

Aside from the fact that this writer uses a spelling of the name that is inconsistent with the rest of the article (and looks like a typing error), it cites no sources. [[User:Jmrowland|rowley]] ([[User talk:Jmrowland|talk]]) 22:37, 4 January 2012 (UTC)

 Usha was a vedic godess, the dawn godess, I therefore interpret Zarathustra to mean 'Zara'=golden, 'us' shine, 'ustra'
= shining star, thus we have &quot;Golden shining dawn star&quot; i.e. Venus and note that the syllable 'us' ocurrs again. The
meaning is synomous with the meaning of the surname 'Reddi' i.e. 'Re' a reference to a solar deity and the syllable 'di'
is a reference to 'day'. 'Re' thus became 'Redo' a latin verb meaning 'I return', the literal meaning was 'I return the 
day' hence the dawn. The origins I assume are Indo-Iranian since the ancient name for Tehran was 'Ray'. Reddi is an 
Indian upper caste name and the people of that name are of Dravidian origin so I must assume that there was some trade
and communication between the Iranian plateau and the Dravidian occupied regions of South India. The name was originally
accorded to a headman or community leader but later became a caste name and in turn a family name.[[Special:Contributions/86.164.41.251|86.164.41.251]] ([[User talk:86.164.41.251|talk]]) 06:41, 6 March 2012 (UTC)
  It must also be mentioned that the Reddis are a Vishnaivite caste, Vishnu being a solar deity as well, he brings light
for the dawn with his first step, the noon with the second and dusk with his third step hence the tilaka on the forehead
represents his step in the form of a 'U' shape as in 'Usha' the vedic dawn godess, Indians are fond of metaphysical
conceits of such a nature. Vishnu is also represented by a fire altar, the Yagna-Kunda, which in turn brings us back to 
Zoroastrianism and the fire temples of the Iranian plateau. The term 'rath' in the name 'Zarathustra' is also synonymous with the word'ratha' which in India means a chariot, which in turn represented the sun. They came from the east where the sun rises.[[Special:Contributions/86.151.51.18|86.151.51.18]] ([[User talk:86.151.51.18|talk]]) 21:33, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

== Similarities to the New Testament of the Bible ==

I think it would be pertinent to show the similarities between Zoroastrianism and Christianity's New Testament somewhere in the body of the main article. The similarities are so striking at times that the parallels between the two seem almost like plagiarism. Of course, we'd leave that up to the reader to decide. Specifically, I cite a peer-reviewed article by Susan B. Martinez Ph.D, &quot;A Time Odyssey: From Zarathustra to the Nazarene,&quot; from the Journal of Spirituality and Paranormal Studies (pp. 105-110).

I've changed it to &quot;His birthplace is uncertain but it is now generally thought that he was born in the eastern part of ancient [[Greater Iran]].&quot; Maybe that still needs tweaking, but it is better than a categorical statement about where he was born and reflects what the article says more accurately than your edit.
