==[[User:200.215.40.3|200.215.40.3]]'s Socks==

To me, it has been an honor to be blocked from editing Wikipedia. And it was you who gave me that opportunity. So, I must thank you: Thank you very much.

And I promise you this: From now on, I will be as hypocritical as possible, as many do.

As regards the article, the following is to be noted. All the time, the text has been, more or less, so [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pontiff&amp;oldid=179195362]. However, one day you came and, without any source or reference, simply put on your edits in the text. I tried to restore the truth, but you didn't allow. 

In my last edits, I have tried to be comprehensive towards your claims. So, I think you should accept them.  [[Special:Contributions/200.215.40.3|200.215.40.3]] ([[User talk:200.215.40.3|talk]]) 18:14, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

:Regarding the first comment, I do not find it acceptable AT ALL for you to take part on such edits. Absolutely everything has been explained on that IP's [[User talk:200.215.40.3|talk page]].

:Also, I notice that this IP is no longer active: I know what the sockpuppet accounts are though. You may not use them to get away from the issue—see [[WP:Sockpuppetry]].

:Wikipedia is not meant for any of your silly games, especially since you have been sufficiently warned. I am FULLY prepared to hand in this [[Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/200.215.40.3|lengthy report]], so no funny business, '''''please'''''. [[User:Troy 07|~ Troy]] ([[User talk:Troy 07|talk]]) 23:24, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

::On second thought, I can't take any chances, so I already have reported the user behind 200.215.40.3. Long term abuse on Wikipedia is strictly unacceptable and '''''is not to be taken lightly'''''. [[User:Troy 07|~ Troy]] ([[User talk:Troy 07|talk]]) 00:49, 22 July 2008 (UTC)
:::Quite frankly, there is no reason to accept 200.215.40.3's specific claims due to his/her abuse. However, the issue has already been dealt with as per [[Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Benkenobi is a retardate]], so to those who are reading this, there is no longer a need to be concerned about it.

==Meaning==
…1:18 P.M. E.S.T. David George DeLancey

I am just wondering Pontiff is of some sort a French Term-'ing',is it a terming also of Englands Famous castle Pontefract.

My wonder is the basis of pontiff meaning any, does or would then the invention of said name relate to the exceptance of any towards a reason or reasoning of,

just a note i shall now continue the ventures of searching the meanings of center portion and end portion of term word Pontefract wich will be 'te'-and fract wich may have something to do with the term'-ing,or word &quot;Welcome&quot; and not quite welcomeing for the ing would then be absorbed already within the castle though again may be obsorbed through the endities of circumstance wich possibly could mean a begining wich brings back to portion of word Ponte in word  Pontefract,my lesson continues,1:32 p.m. e.s.t.

:Have a look at the [[Pontefract]] talk page. 10 October 2009.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.28.35.247|92.28.35.247]] ([[User talk:92.28.35.247|talk]]) 12:36, 10 October 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
::Also see Ponte = bridge eg [[Ponte Vecchio]] &amp; [[Ponte dell'Accademia]].
Pontus = sea eg Pontus Euxinus (Back Sea) also Pontus/Pontos is a name for the god of the sea.
Fretum = strait eg Fretum Herculeum (Strait of Gibraltar) and Fretum Sicularum (Strait of Messina)
so clearly finding out origins is bit of a black art.
