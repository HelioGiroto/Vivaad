== Pain and fire ==

Sorry, Precor, but I must say the following comment, which you are insisting on inserting under the heading &quot;Pain and fire&quot;, seems to belong in a more generic part of the article. In any case it cannot be admitted to Wikipedia unless it is attributed to a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|reliable source]] and not put in as a personal editorial comment.
:There have been many theological concepts of purgatory over the centuries of Christianity. May scriptural interpretations point to the existence of the purgatory concept but scripture, as with many aspects of its interpretation, does not describe it in any detail and thus the theological beliefs pertaining to this theological concept is wide of breath. What is common among almost all interpretations related to Purgatory is that it is a spiritual place, or state, where the soul is purified of any remaining venal (or small) sins that accumulated before death but was not remitted to Christ for forgiveness before the end of one's life. [[User:Lima|Lima]] ([[User talk:Lima|talk]]) 05:48, 26 February 2009 (UTC)

== Changes by 75.220.110.8 ==

I have no objection in principle to capitalizing &quot;Hell&quot;, &quot;Heaven&quot;, &quot;Purgatory&quot;; but I believe that a systematic overthrow by a single editor of the established usage in an article is illegitimate.  Such a systematic change should be effected only after ensuring on the Talk page that there is support for it.

I have also restored the picture that was at the start of the article. The IP editor's replacement of it with one that reflects the popular image of a fiery purgatory would make the reader think that this is an essential part of the idea of purgatory.  I have moved that editor's fiery image to the section on &quot;Fire and pain&quot;, although I think it would be better to omit it completely.  The original picture shows that people do have several different images, not just one, of what purgatory is.

The Eastern Orthodox Church does consider itself to be one Church, even if composed of several &quot;local&quot; Churches, just as the (Roman) Catholic Church sees itself as one Church, even if composed of several [[particular Church]]es.  There are no grounds for changing one of these to the plural, while continuing to refer to the other in the singular.  [[User:Lima|Lima]] ([[User talk:Lima|talk]]) 07:02, 30 May 2009 (UTC)



== Sources needed for Purgatory in early Christianity  ==


I quote from the top of this article: &quot;Purgatory is the condition or process of purification in which the souls of those who die in a state of grace are made ready for Heaven. This is an idea that has ancient roots and is well-attested in early Christian literature, while the conception of purgatory as a geographically situated place is largely the creation of medieval Christian piety and imagination&quot; 
This is  a direct quote from the Enc. Brit. Again, there is no source showing the idea of Purgatory to have ancient roots and being well attested in early Christian literature. Some quotes from this early Christian literature are needed or any reference to Purgatory in early Christianity should be deleted.

:If it is a copyvio from EB it should be removed for that reason, or rewritten. But if it is from, or in, EB it is not unsourced, is it? [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 04:33, 29 November 2009 (UTC)

Do you feel it must be removed, yes or no? If it is well attested, it should be no problem to quote a text from the Early Christian literature.

== Any problems with the origin of the word Purgatory? ==

If anyone has a problem with the additions, please say so in a civil fashion. The references are accurate, and hyperlinks to the texts have been provided.  

[[User:Johncab593|Johncab593]] ([[User talk:Johncab593|talk]]) 04:10, 9 February 2010 (UTC)
:The problem was explained in my edit summary when I first removed them.  The translations of the word are a non-sequiter because that is not where the Catholic Church derives the teaching of purgatory.  In fact, of all the verses I've ever heard ANYONE try to use to support purgatory, not one of them used the word Sheol, Hades, Gehenna.  So the validity of purgatory does not, as your edit summarizes, depend on what sort of translation one accepts.  Hence it is a complete non-sequiter and pointless to include.  In fact, I would consider it borderline pov pushing because it attempts to make a conclusion for the reader based on things that are actually unrelated to the concept of purgatory.  What you are doing is making an argument against the existence of purgatory based entirely on the history of the WORD purgatory, but concepts often, if not ALWAYS exist before a term to define them does, yet you're trying to falsify purgatory based on the origin of the word.  Certainly you don't believe dinosaurs didn't exist until someone invented that word too, do you?  The article is about the concept of purgatory, not the word purgatory itself.  Hence, and I know I'm sounding a bit repetitive here, your edit has no purpose in the article.  I don't even have to look at the sources to know that.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 08:25, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

The references are accurate, and I've added two more by a Catholic authors. I am sorry you feel I was making a conclusion against Purgatory; I have tried to reword the language you seem to object to. I felt the numerous translations that preserve the distinction and the relatively few that avoid distinction actually imply quite the opposite.

As to the purpose, it is, in fact, the origin of the word Purgatory. By stating the key references I found useful, I hope to save the next person who does an in-depth study, pulling from the original Greek, some time.
[[User:Johncab593|Johncab593]] ([[User talk:Johncab593|talk]]) 19:56, 9 February 2010 (UTC)
:All that need be said of the origin of the English word &quot;purgatory&quot; (the noun) is: &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;The word &quot;purgatory&quot; is derived, through Anglo-Norman and Old French, from the Latin word ''purgatorium''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Purgatory,&quot; Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; There is no need for more.  On the origin of the Latin word &quot;purgatorium&quot; more can be said.  But the idea that the Latin word was used in the twelfth century to translate New Testament ᾅδης (Hades) is both unsourced and nonsense, and all the talk about how various Bibles in various languages translated ᾅδης and γέεννα (Gehenna) is irrelevant, since they translated neither word as &quot;purgatory&quot;. [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 20:02, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

I'll respect the opinon of two people, and remove the translation references until I get a 12th century Latin translation in my hands.
[[User:Johncab593|Johncab593]] ([[User talk:Johncab593|talk]]) 20:08, 9 February 2010 (UTC)
:The section does read very oddly at present, as though as many versions of the Latin Bible existed as of the bible in English, which is certainly not the case. There is no link to [[Vulgate]] that I can see; AFAIK this text was hardly ever altered.  It is all easily available online btw - [http://vul.scripturetext.com/1_kings/6.htm here] and in many other places. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 20:18, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

:Johncab, you completely missed what I was trying to say.  Please read what I typed above again.  Personally, I was actually pleasently surprised about the sources you used.  Normally someone trying to present information the way you are is using places like jesus-is-savior or chick.com.  The sources are not my problem.  The problem is that the whole point of your addition is irrelevant.  You're going on and on about the origins of the word purgatory and talking about how the existence of the concept depends on the origins of the word and how one accepts certain translations, but NO ONE derives the existence of purgatory from that stuff.  Hence, your addition is simply irrelevant.  It would be kind of like me adding a new section on the origins of the [[pope hat]] in the article on bishops.  There's just no point to it.[[User:Farsight001|Farsight001]] ([[User talk:Farsight001|talk]]) 20:42, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

Johnbod - I was actually looking for one translated in the time period; and all the bible hyperlinnks were removed (by me) after Esoglou's post. I have seen two authors reference the appearance of the word Purgatorium in a translation of the bible in the 12th century, which spurred its rapid appearance in multiple languages. I did assume, incorrectly as it turns out, that this became a common translation. While I seriously doubt that would appear in an internet version, I'll give it a look. Thanks for the link though, every bit helps! :D

Per Esoglou's comments in the history section, when I find the exact text I'm looking for, I'll post it in the &quot;History of Purgatory&quot; article.

Farsight - I actually got your point, and your criticism was helpful. I am in favor of the concept of purgatory, and overcoming the objection &quot;Purgatory isn't mentioned in the bible&quot; is actually where I was going with the text. I obviously failed in conveying that. :D  [[User:Johncab593|Johncab593]] ([[User talk:Johncab593|talk]]) 13:08, 11 February 2010 (UTC)
:It might appear in a gloss or commentary, but tinkering with the actual Latin Vulgate text was strongly discouraged for obvious reasons, and AFAIK changes between the 4th century &amp; at least the 16th were minimal, &amp; mostly due to copyists' errors in manuscripts.  There were some revisions in the light of the linguistic and textual research of [[Renaissance Humanism]] &amp; the 1592 &quot;Clementine&quot; printed edition was then standard until 1979, when a new revision was published.

== Lutheran section ==

Does anyone mind expanding the Lutheran section of this article? Mainly, it only speaks of &quot;praying for the dead&quot;, not on how [[Luther]] felt about purgatory as a process of purification... [[User:Shark96z|Shark96z]] ([[User talk:Shark96z|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Shark96z|contribs]]) 20:12, 10 February 2010 (UTC)
:Agreed. &quot;Praying for the dead&quot;, although does have to do with purgatory, seems to lean more towards [[veneration of saints]] or [[intercession of saints]]. I think it would be good to add what Lutheran churches believe. I know some, like the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], reject purgatory and others, like the [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church]] accept the doctrine. --[[User:Willthacheerleader18|Willthacheerleader18]] ([[User talk:Willthacheerleader18|talk]]) 23:33, 22 September 2010 (UTC)

== Sentence confused? ==

The sentence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And God being a just God would not condemn to hell a person who although not having satisfied restitution for a sin or sins, and therefore not currently ready for the rewards of heaven, the sufferings of hell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
doesn't quite make sense.  I think someone got a little tangled in the syntax; possibly, they were considering two ways of expressing the thought and mixed them together--or maybe they just omitted a phrase.

:Thanks for drawing attention to it.  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 20:09, 24 September 2010 (UTC)
Maybe these two Luther's quotes might be helpful for your purpose. Keep in mind that they come from Luther's writings of lesser accuracy (he did not write them by his own hand and it is doubtful whether he had any role in editing them). Yet, it is of great probability that the quotes in question reflect Luther's original ideas.
In the first quote, Luther plainly denies the idea of Purgatory, finding it in contradiction with his own doctrine of the righteousness by faith alone:
&quot;Augustine, Ambrose, and Jerome held nothing at all of purgatory. Gregory, being in the nighttime deceived by a vision, taught something of purgatory, whereas God openly commanded that we should search out and inquire nothing of spirits, but of Moses and the prophets.
Therefore, we must not admit Gregory's opininon on this point; the day of the Lord will show and declare the same, when it will be revealed by fire.
This sentence, &quot;And their works do follow them, must not be understood of purgatory, but of the doctrine of good works or of godly and ture Christians, and of heretics. Arius, the heretic, had his judgment; the fire of faith has declared it. For the las day will discover and declare all things.
God has, in his Word, laid before us two ways; one which by faith leads to salvation, - the other, by unbelief, to damnation.
As for purgatory, no place in Scripture makes mention thereof, neither must we any way allow it; for it darkens and undervalues the grace, benefits, and merits of our blessed, sweet Saviour Christ Jesus.
The bounds of purgatory extend not beyond this world; for here in this life the upright, good, and godly Christians are well and soundly scourged and purged.&quot;
Martin Luther, Table Talk, #DXV.  Quoted in Kerr, Hugh Thomson Jr, &quot;A Compend of Luther's Theology&quot;, Princeton, NJ: Westminster Press, 1943., p. 243.

However, the second quote apparently leaves some very restricted room for the intercessory prayer for the dead: 

&quot;Shall we pray for the dead? ... We have no command from God to pray for the dead; therefore, no one sins by not praying for them; for what God does not bid or forbid to do, in that no one can sin. Yet, on the other hand, since God has not permitted us to know, how it is with the souls of the departed and we must continue uninformed, as to how he deals with them, we will not and cannot restrain them, nor count it as sin, if they pray for the dead. For we are ever certain from the Gospel, that many have been raised from the dead, who, we must confess, did not receive, nor did they have their final sentence; and likewise we are not assured of any other, that he has his final sentence. 
Now since it is uncertain and no one knows, whether final judgment has been passed upon these souls, it is not sin if you pray for them; but in this way, that you let it rest in uncertainty and speak thus: Dear God, if the departed souls can be in a state that they may yet be helped, then I pray that thou wouldst be gracious. And when you have thus prayed once or twice, then let it be sufficient and commend them unto God.&quot;

== Anglicanism ==

Specific to the American church, the Thirty-Nine Articles are not an official statement of Anglican belief and have been relegated to an appendix of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer.  A &quot;soft view&quot; of purgatory can be found in Hymn 357 of the '82 Hymnal.  It should be remembered that Anglicans have continued to pray for the dead, whereas most Protestant denominations do not.  So while indulgences have been rejected along with specific statements about the nature of purgatory, the idea persists in Anglicanism.

== Source needed for Purgatory in Scripture ==

Under the 'Sin' section it reads:
&quot;This teaching is based on both Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition.&quot;

There needs to be a reference to where in Scripture this is found, and probably that only Catholics believe that their interpretation of Matthew 12:32 and 1 Cor. 3:11-15 is where it is found.  Protestants have a much different interpretation of these verses which do not support the idea of purgatory.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dockstand|Dockstand]] ([[User talk:Dockstand|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dockstand|contribs]]) 15:38, 1 December 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
