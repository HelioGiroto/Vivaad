      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9457">[[Messianic Judaism]] is a [[syncretic]] [[religion|religious movement]] that arose in the 1960s and 70s. It blends [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] theology with elements of [[Judaism|Jewish]] terminology and ritual. Messianic Judaism states that [[Jesus]] is not merely a man, but the [[Jewish Messiah]] and &quot;[[God the Son]]&quot; (one [[Hypostasis (religion)|person]] of the [[Trinity]]), and that [[Salvation#Christianity|salvation]] is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Any [[halakha|Jewish law]]s or customs that are followed are cultural and do not contribute to attaining salvation. Belief in the messiahship and divinity of Jesus, which Messianic Judaism shares, is viewed by many [[Christian denomination]]s and [[Jewish religious movements]] as being a defining distinction between [[Christianity]] and Judaism.
