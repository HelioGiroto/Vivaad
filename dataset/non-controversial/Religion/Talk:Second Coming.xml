== most biblical sources irrelevant ==

most biblical sources at the beginning of the article refer to assension to heaven or the kingdom of god, not the second coming. check them out. unless i don't know of some kind of connection between all those that makes them the same. even if some kind of logic makes the same it has to be addressed. without it, they are logically different things.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:161.76.99.106|161.76.99.106]] ([[User talk:161.76.99.106|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/161.76.99.106|contribs]]) 04:10, April 20, 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

It ''is'' relevant because that was when He promised to return.

== Imbalanced Representation ==

Each paragraph outlining basic religious beliefs has at least a sizable paragraph summarizing the beliefs the religious set of ideas, with one exception. May I suggest adding a few summarizing points about the beliefs of the Latter-day Saint beliefs on the second coming, rather than leaving it saying that the Latter-day Saints have many notable distinctive and specific beliefs? Just because there are many differences in Latter-day Saint beliefs and the specificity of those beliefs does not mean that they are not worth summarizing as is done with every other group. I would suggest at least a few points so that readers have some idea of what those distinctions are, not just knowing that there is a distinction. If we're going for brevity, let's be brief across the board and say that each group simply has distinctive beliefs. I would be happy to attempt a Latter-day Saint summary if there is agreement. Thank you.

== Quality: I hope, I hope.... ==

I hope when Christ returns in the 2nd coming, he will somehow be busy with other things and not get to see this page. Quality here is so low, it would be embarrassing for the human race. I will not edit this page, but you guys who do edit it should do something to improve it before the event.

== Impossible to prove ==

There are no hard facts supporting the second coming of christ or any other religious deity, therefore the entire page should be presented as fiction. Until you provide hard evidence of a deity returning to earth, edits claiming that this has no basis in reality should be preserved.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Hangover72|Hangover72]] ([[User talk:Hangover72|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hangover72|contribs]]) 21:53, 27 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::@ Hangover72, Wikipedia isn't interested in truth or fact.  It is only interested in if a topic can be supported by reliable sources about the topic.  So, no one is interested in your opinion about it being fiction or no.  Keep your POV to yourself.  It is a topic of note because millions of people believe in it.

If this or any other religious topic deserves a fiction tag due to the POV of people who don't agree with it, then you'll have to also throw a fiction tag on anything to do with evolution because there are a lot of people who don't agree with that, either.  One's personal belief or disbelief is not the measuring stick for Wikipedia.  [[Special:Contributions/152.133.13.2|152.133.13.2]] ([[User talk:152.133.13.2|talk]]) 17:47, 8 March 2011 (UTC)

He's not saying lots of people disagree he's saying theres no factual evidence to back up christs second coming.

:It is a fact, though, that the New Testament authors '''''wrote''''' about a return of Christ. This is easy to prove. It is impossible to prove that beliefs in predicted, or future, events are true, but it can be proved that Christians '''''wrote''''' that Christ was going to return.

I just saw this amazing section! [[WP:Fringe]] was written for this. This type of item just pushes Wikipedia down the ladder of respect and makes it loo like a joke.

==Hinduism section, [[WP:OR]], [[WP:WEIGHT]]?==
''Copied here. Inclined to delete entire section... but wait on comments''
'''Hinduism'''
In modern times some traditional Indian religious leaders have since moved to embrace Jesus as an [[Avatar]], or incarnation, of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harekrishnatemple.com/bhakta/chapter27.html |title=Krishna and Jesus Christ |publisher=Harekrishnatemple.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this, the Indian guru [[Yogananda|Paramahansa Yogananda]], author of ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', scribed an extensive commentary on the Gospels published in the two-volume set ''The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You''.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa. ''The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You.'' Self-Realization Fellowship, 2004. '''ISBN''' 978-0876125557&lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of the [[Gnostic Gospels]], the book offers a mystical interpretation of the Second Coming in which it is understood to be an inner experience, something that takes place within the individual heart.

Stating that &quot;Paramahansa Yogananda was sent to the West by Jesus Christ himself&quot; with the said intent to &quot;restore the original Christian teachings among his followers&quot;, in ''Revelations of Christ'' [[Swami Kriyananda]], Yogananda's disciple and Ex-minister of the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]], provides a distilled commentary on the life and teachings of Christ, all of which is meant to serve as an anticipatory primer to Yogananda's more philosophically nuanced treatment in ''The Second Coming of Christ''. Turning directly to The Bible, Kriyananda argues for a more scripturally mature Christianity in which The Second Coming is treated not in terms of a profane materialism - one which favors a literal, physical and subsequently anti-spiritual resurrection - but rather unfolds in accordance with the more spiritual aspirations of The Book of Luke; for &quot;Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.&quot; (Luke 17:21)

Thus Hinduism's consideration of itself as an Eastern extension of the Christian Gospel, however, is neither unique to Yogananda or his disciple, Swami Kriyananda. Similarly, [[Srila Prabhupada]], author [[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]] and founder  of the [[Hare Krishna Movement]], has propounded the same pluralistic, nonsecular view: that &quot;'Christ' is another way of saying Krsta and Krsta is another way of pronouncing [[Krishna]], the name of God.&quot; Stating that &quot;A son may call his father 'Father', but the father also has a specific name. Similarly, God is the general name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose specific name is Krishna&quot;, &quot;Therefore&quot;, he writes, &quot;whether you call God 'Christ', 'Krsta', or 'Krishna', ultimately you are addressing the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://krishna.org/christ-and-krishna-the-name-is-the-same/&lt;/ref&gt;

::That quote was only a fragment, not the sentence, which begins with the qualifying words: &quot;In Christianity...&quot; The second sentence begins with the words &quot;This belief...&quot; referring back to the previous sentence, so obviously the questioned fragment is part of a belief within Christianity.
