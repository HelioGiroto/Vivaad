'''Christmas Eve''' is the [[evening]] or entire day preceding [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], the [[Christmas worldwide|widely celebrated]] annual festival commemorating [[Nativity of Jesus|the birth]] of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. It occurs on December 24 in the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian Church]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Christmas Eve&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ytOHbLdtSY4C&amp;pg=PA314&amp;dq=Christmas+Eve+is+holiday+Jesus+encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=COTRTpGrPKaxiQKDkM3jDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Living Religions: an encyclopedia of the world's faiths|accessdate=2010-12-29|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|year=1997|author=Mary Pat Fisher|quote=Christmas is the celebration of Jesus' birth on earth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in [[Christendom]] and the [[Western world]], where it widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day.

One reason celebrations occur on Christmas Eve is because the traditional Christian liturgical day starts at sunset,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerusalem Center&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jcjcr.org/kyn_article_view.php?aid=50|title=Christian Calendar |accessdate=2010-12-29|publisher=Jerusalem Center for Jewish-Christian Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; an inheritance from Jewish tradition,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=A dictionary of Jewish-Christian relations| last=Kessler| first=Edward| coauthors=Neil Wenborn| year=2005| pages=274| publisher=Cambridge university Press| location=Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is based in the story of creation in Genesis: &quot;And there was evening, and there was morning – the first day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Genesis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Bible - NIV| url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;version=TNIV| year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This liturgical day is followed for all days in the Eastern rite,&lt;ref name=&quot;Metropolitan&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metropolitancantorinstitute.org/liturgy/DailyCycle.html|title=The Daily Cycle of Services|accessdate=2010-12-29|publisher=Metropolitan Cantor Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the custom of beginning Christmas celebration (as well as Sunday and the other major festivals) in the preceding evening is preserved in western Churches that have altered the liturgical day to start at midnight, for example the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Liturgy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/100/Start/97|title=Catholic Liturgy|accessdate=2010-12-29|publisher=The Vatican}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many churches still ring their [[church bell]]s and hold [[Christian prayer|prayers]] in the evening before holidays; for example, the Nordic [[Lutheran]] churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;NE&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ne.se/helgm%C3%A5lsringning|title=Helgmålsringning|accessdate=2010-12-29|publisher=Natinalencyclopedin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, such as the Scandinavian, Christmas Eve is simply referred to as &quot;Christmas Evening&quot;.

Since Christian tradition holds that [[Jesus]] was born at night (based in Luke 2:6-8), Midnight Mass is celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midnight, in commemoration of his birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vatican Today&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecatholicspirit.com/news/from-the-vatican/vatican-today-december-28-2010/|title=Vatican Today|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of Jesus being born at night is reflected in the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as &quot;Heilige Nacht&quot; (&quot;Holy Night&quot;) in German, &quot;Nochebuena&quot; (&quot;the Good Night&quot;) in Spanish and similarly in other expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song [[Silent Night|&quot;Silent Night, Holy Night&quot;]].

Christmas is also celebrated as a secular holiday by some non-Christians;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth A. Dice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2zMZC-WkJv4C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Christmas+Eve+celebrated+non-Christians&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3676TsP-M9DMiQL73b2YAQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Christmas%20Eve%20celebrated%20non-Christians&amp;f=false|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|year=2009|page=39|quote=Christmas is one of the most widely celebrated holidays in the world.

==Religious traditions==
===Western churches===
[[Image:Pastrage.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Traditional [[Mass (liturgy)|Midnight Mass]] with Shepherds in [[Provence]].]]

[[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Anglican]]s traditionally celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Midnight Mass]], which begins either at or sometime before [[midnight]] on Christmas Eve.  This ceremony, which is held in churches throughout the world, celebrates the birth of Christ, which is believed to have occurred at night.

In recent years some churches have scheduled their &quot;Midnight&quot; Mass as early as 7&amp;nbsp;pm  In Spanish-speaking areas, the Midnight Mass is sometimes referred to as ''[[Misa del Gallo]]'', or &quot;Missa do Galo&quot;, in Portuguese (&quot;Rooster's Mass&quot;).  In the [[Philippines]], this custom lasts for nine days, starting on December 16 and continuing daily up to December 24, during which Filipinos attend dawn Masses, usually starting at around 4:00–5:00&amp;nbsp;am  In 2009 [[Holy See|Vatican]] officials scheduled the Midnight Mass to start at 10&amp;nbsp;pm so the 82 year old [[Pope Benedict XVI]] would not have too late a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8430118.stm |title=Woman knocks Pope down at Christmas Mass|date=2009-12-25|publisher=British Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst not performing any kind of Mass [[:wikt:per se|per se]], the [[Church of Scotland]] has a [[New_Year's_Eve#Communities|Watchnight]] (similar to the one on [[New Year's Eve|Hogmanay]]) service beginning just before midnight, wherein [[Christmas carol|carols]] are sung.
[[File:Advent Wreath on Christmas Eve (Broadway United Methodist Church).jpg|thumb|300px|On Christmas Eve, the Christ Candle in the center of the [[Advent wreath]] is traditionally lit in many [[church service]]s. In candlelight services, while singing ''[[Silent Night]]'', each member of the congregation receives a candle and passes along their flame which is first received from the Christ Candle.]]
[[Lutheran]]s traditionally practice Christmas Eve [[Eucharist]]ic traditions typical of [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]]. &quot;Krippenspiele&quot; ([[Nativity play]]s), special festive music for organ, vocal and brass [[choir]]s and candlelight services make Christmas Eve one of the highlights in the Lutheran Church calendar. Christmas [[Vespers]] are popular in the early evening, and midnight services are also widespread in regions which are predominately Lutheran. The old Lutheran tradition of a Christmas Vigil in the early morning hours of [[Christmas Day]] (Christmette) can still be found in some regions. In eastern and [[middle Germany]], congregations still continue the tradition of &quot;Quempas singing&quot;: separate groups dispersed in various parts of the church sing verses of the song &quot;He whom [[Shepherd]]s once came Praising&quot; (Quem pastores) responsively.

[[Methodism|Methodists]] celebrate the evening in different ways. Some, in the early evening, come to their church to celebrate [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] with their families.  The mood is very solemn, and the only visible light is the [[Advent Wreath]], and the candles upon the [[Lord's Table]]. Others celebrate the evening with services of light, which include singing the song &quot;[[Silent Night]]&quot; as a variety of candles (including personal candles) are lit. Other churches have late evening services at 11&amp;nbsp;pm, so the church can celebrate Christmas Day together with the ringing of bells at 12&amp;nbsp;am Others offer Christmas Day services, as well.

The annual &quot;[[Nine Lessons and Carols]]&quot; broadcast from [[King's College, Cambridge]], on Christmas Eve, has established itself as one of the signs that Christmas has begun in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=nine&gt;{{citation|author=Alex Webb|title=Choir that sings to the world|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=24 December 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is broadcast outside the UK via the [[BBC World Service]], and is also bought by broadcasters around the world.&lt;ref name=nine/&gt;

Other churches hold a candlelight service. Some services re-enact the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]].
Each church is able to celebrate Christmas Eve evening and Christmas Day in its own special way.

===Eastern churches===
[[File:Nativity Icon.jpg|thumb|Russian icon of the Nativity.]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Christmas Eve is referred to as [[Paramony]] (&quot;preparation&quot;).  It is the concluding day of the [[Nativity Fast]] and is celebrated as a day of strict [[fasting]] by those devout Orthodox Christians who are physically capable of  doing so. In some traditions, nothing is eaten until the first star appears in the evening sky, in commemoration of the [[Star of Bethlehem]].  The [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] celebration begins earlier in the day with the celebration of the [[Royal Hours]], followed by the [[Divine Liturgy]] combined with the celebration of [[Vespers]], during which a large number of readings from the [[Old Testament]] are chanted, recounting the history of salvation. After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] at the end of the service, a new candle is brought out into the center of the church and lit, and all gather round and sing the [[Troparion]] and [[Kontakion]] of the Feast.

In the evening, the [[All-Night Vigil]] for the Feast of the Nativity is composed of [[Great Compline]], [[Matins]] and the [[First Hour]]. The Orthodox services of Christmas Eve are intentionally parallel to those of [[Good Friday]], illustrating the [[Orthodox theology|theological]] point that the purpose of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] was to make possible the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. This is illustrated in Orthodox [[icon]]s of the Nativity, on which the [[Christ Child]] is wrapped in [[swaddling clothes]] reminiscent of his [[burial shroud|burial wrappings]]. The child is also shown lying on a stone, representing the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]], rather than a [[manger]]. The [[Church of the Nativity|Cave of the Nativity]] is also a reminder of the cave in which Jesus was buried.

The services of Christmas Eve are also similar to those of the Eve of [[Epiphany_(holiday)#Eastern_Christian_Churches|Theophany]] (Epiphany), and the two [[Great Feasts]] are considered one celebration.

In some Orthodox cultures, after the Vesperal Liturgy the family returns home to a festive meal, but one at which [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek-Catholicism|Orthodox fasting rules]] are still observed; i.e., no meat or dairy products (milk, cheese, eggs, etc.) are consumed (see below for variations according to nationality). Then they return to the church for the All-Night Vigil.

The next morning,  Christmas Day, the Divine Liturgy is celebrated again, but with special features that occur only on Great Feasts of the Lord. After the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of this Liturgy, the faithful customarily greet each other with the [[kiss of peace]] and the words: &quot;Christ is Born!&quot;, to which the one being greeted responds: &quot;Glorify Him!&quot; (these are the opening words of the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] of the Nativity that was chanted the night before during the Vigil). This greeting, together with many of the [[hymn]]s of the feast, continue to be used until the [[leave-taking]] of the feast on December 29.

The first three days of the feast are particularly solemn. The second day is known as the [[Synaxis]] of the [[Theotokos]], and commemorates the role of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Nativity of Jesus]].  The third day is referred to simply as &quot;the Third Day of the Nativity&quot;. The Saturday and Sunday following December 25 have special [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]] readings assigned to them. December 29 celebrates the [[Holy Innocents]].

Orthodox Christians observe a festal period of [[Twelve Days of Christmas|twelve days]], during which no one in the Church fasts, even on Wednesdays and Fridays, which are normal fasting days throughout the year. During this time one feast leads into another: December 25–31 is the [[afterfeast]] of the Nativity;  January 2–5 is the [[forefeast]] of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

===Meals===
[[Image:Wigilia potrawy 554.jpg|thumb|Traditional Polish ''[[Wigilia]]'' meal.]]
{{See|List of Christmas dishes}}

In some parts of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] such as Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Poland]], and [[Lithuania]], a traditional meatless [[12-dishes Christmas Eve Supper]] is served on Christmas Eve before opening gifts. This is known as the &quot;Holy Meal&quot;. The table is spread with a white cloth symbolic of the [[swaddling clothes]] the [[Child Jesus]] was wrapped in, and a large white candle stands in the center of the table symbolizing [[Light of the World (Jesus)|Christ the Light of the World]]. Next to it is a round loaf of bread symbolizing Christ [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#Bread_of_Life|Bread of Life]].  [[Hay]] is often displayed either on the table or as a decoration in the room, reminiscent of the [[manger]] in Bethlehem. The twelve dishes (which differ by nationality or region) symbolize the [[Twelve Apostles]].

The Holy Meal was a common Eastern Orthodox tradition in the [[Russian Empire]], but during the era of the [[Soviet Union]] it was greatly discouraged as a result of the official [[atheism]] of the former former regime. It is coming back in Russia and continues to be popular in [[Ukraine]].

The main attribute of Holy Meal in [[Ukraine]] is [[kutia]], a sweet grain pudding. The other typical dishes are [[borscht]], [[Varenyky]], a traditional Christmas [[compote]] called ''uzvar'' and dishes made of [[fish]], [[phaseolus]] and [[cabbage]].

In accordance with the [[Serbian Christmas traditions|Christmas traditions of the Serbs]], their festive meal has a copious and diverse selection of foods, although it is prepared according to the rules of fasting. As well as a round, [[Leavening agent|unleavened]] loaf of bread and salt, which are necessary, this meal may comprise roast fish, cooked beans, [[sauerkraut]], noodles with ground walnuts, honey, and wine.

In [[Bulgaria]], the meal consists of an [[odd number]] of lenten dishes in compliance with the rules of fasting. They are usually the traditional [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[bob chorba]] (bean soup), fortune [[pita]] (pastry with a fortune in it), [[stuffed peppers]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discover-bulgaria.com/Travel_Results.aspx?CategoryID=450 Bulgarian Main Courses]&lt;/ref&gt; The meal is often accompanied with wine or Bulgaria's traditional [[alcoholic beverage]] [[rakia]].

While other Christian families throughout the world celebrate the Christmas Eve meal with various meats, Italians and Sicilians celebrate the traditional [[Catholic]] &quot;[[Feast of the Seven Fishes]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://feastofthesevenfishes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; which was historically served after a 24 hour fasting period.  Although pre-Christmas fasting is not a popular custom still practiced, Italian-Americans still enjoy meatless Christmas Eve feast&lt;ref name=&quot;rachael ray&quot;&gt;[http://www.rachaelray.com/article.php?article_id=69]&lt;/ref&gt; and attend the Midnight Mass.

In various cultures, a festive dinner is traditionally served for the family and close friends in attendance, when the first star (usually [[Sirius]]) arrives on the sky.

Families in some Slavic countries reserve a place for guests (alluding to Mary and Joseph looking for shelter in Bethlehem).

==Gift giving==
[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas presents sit underneath a Christmas tree. Many trace the custom of giving gifts to one another to the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] who brought gifts for the [[Christ child]] in the [[manger]].]]

During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'', and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 0-520-25104-0, pp. 68–79.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the night when [[Santa Claus]] (or some variant thereof) makes his rounds delivering gifts to good children.

In the Czech Republic, [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]] and Hungary, where [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]] (sveti Mikuláš/szent Mikulás) gives his sweet gifts on December 6, the Christmas gift-giver is the [[Christkind|Child Jesus]] ([[Ježíšek]] in [[Czech language|Czech]], Jézuska in Hungarian, Ježiško in [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and Isusek in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Christmas encyclopedia McFarland'' p.143. &amp; Co., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, presents are traditionally exchanged in the evening of December 24. Children are commonly told that presents were brought either by the [[Christkind]] (German for: Christchild),&lt;ref&gt;''The Christmas Almanack'' p.56. Random House Reference, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Weihnachtsmann]] (German name of [[Santa Claus]]). Both leave the gifts, but are in most families not seen doing so.

In Finland, ''[[Joulupukki]]'', and in Sweden ''[[Jultomten]]'', personally meets children and gives presents in the evening of Christmas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;''Llewellyn's Sabbats Almanac: Samhain 2010 to Mabon 2011'' p.64. Llewellyn Worldwide, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=5JF_kT43LjcC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=Jultomten&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X5ITTePQONO2hAezpOy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jultomten&amp;f=false Festivals of Western Europe] p.202. Forgotten Books, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Netherlands]], [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Latvia]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Quebec]], [[Romania]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Sweden]], Christmas presents are opened mostly on the evening of the 24th, – this is also the tradition among the [[British Royal Family]], due to their mainly German [[ancestry]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Fry]] revealed this during a discussion of Christmas [[tradition]]s during an edition of [[QI]]&lt;/ref&gt; – while in [[Italy]], the [[United States]], the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[English Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]], this occurs mostly on the morning of Christmas Day.

In other Latin American countries, people stay awake until [[midnight]], when they open the presents.

In [[Spain]], gifts are traditionally opened on the morning of January 6, [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany day]] (&quot;Día de Los Tres Reyes Magos&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Francis, Charles ''Wisdom Well Said'' p.224 Levine Mesa Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; though in some other countries, like [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], people receive presents both around Christmas and on the morning of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] day.

In the Netherlands they also celebrate [[Sinterklaas]] on December 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=H_AQzpSLRNoC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=netherlands+-+sinterklaas+december+5&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-qkTTYGtN4yGhQe6zsy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=netherlands%20-%20sinterklaas%20december%205&amp;f=false Concepts of person in religion and thought] Walter de Gruyter, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christmas Eve around the world==
[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Christmas Eve Candlelight Services.jpg|thumb|200px|A Christmas Eve candlelight [[service of worship|service]] in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].]]
Christmas Eve is celebrated in different ways around the world, varying by country and region. Elements common to many areas of the world include the attendance of special religious observances such as a midnight Mass or Vespers, and the giving and receiving of presents. Along with Easter, Christmastime is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as Advent, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, St. Nicholas Day, St. Stephen's Day, New Year's, and the Feast of the Epiphany.

The significant amount of vacation travel, and travel back to family homes, means that Christmas Eve is also frequently linked to social events and parties, worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fodor&quot;&gt;Eugene Fodor, ''Fodor's South 1980: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana'', 1979, at p. 87, available at [http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=sL54AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=christmas-eve+nightclubs&amp;q=christmas-eve#search_anchor Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Discourse&quot;&gt;Gary Sigley, ''A Chinese Christmas Story'', in Shi-xu, ed., ''Discourse as Cultural Struggle'', 2007, at p. 99, available at [http://books.google.com/books?id=PS57ocrF5dMC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=christmas-eve+nightclubs&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas-eve%20nightclubs&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture&quot;&gt;Adebayo Oyebade, ''Culture and Customs of Angola'', 2007, at pp. 103, 140, available at [http://books.google.com/books?id=DeVqVy21g9sC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=christmas-eve+nightclubs&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas-eve&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tonic&quot;&gt;[http://www.clubzone.com/events/Vancouver/165256/Twas-the-Night-Before-Christmas-at-Tonic See, e.g., Clubzone, ''Twas the Night Before Christmas @ Tonic @ Tonic Nightclub Vancouver BC'', 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohio&quot;&gt;[http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/4699254/OH/Akron/The-College-Night-Out/The-Interbelt See, e.g., Upcoming.org, ''The College Night Out'', 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the family gathering and religious worship activities that are central to Christmas Eve for [[Christians]] but which [[Jews]] do not typically engage in,&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesDeciding&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/16/garden/deciding-to-celebrate-christmas-or-not.html?pagewanted=all Brenda Lane Richardson, ''Deciding to Celebrate Christmas, or Not'', New York Times, December 16, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; a series of  events on the night of December 24 have been made available to Jews in various regions of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16339451/ ''Christmas Eve parties now a Jewish tradition'', Associated Press (MSNBC), December 23, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Matzo Ball]] events and parties are an option for single Jews.  Jews in interfaith relationships may prefer to participate in [[Chrismukkah]] events and parties. However, Jewish people are invited to Christmas Eve parties and plenty will attend, and some host Christmas Eve parties for others.

==Historical events==
A number of historical events have been influenced by the occurrence of Christmas Eve.

===Christmas truce===

{{Main|Christmas truce}}

During [[World War I]] in 1914 and 1915 an unofficial [[Christmas truce]] took place, particularly that between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[German Empire|German]] troops. The truce began on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1914, when [[German Army|German troops]] began decorating the area around their [[trench warfare|trenches]] in the region of [[Ypres]], Belgium, for [[Christmas]]. They began by placing candles on trees, then continued the celebration by singing [[Christmas carol]]s, most notably ''[[Silent Night (song)|Stille Nacht]]'' (''Silent Night''). The [[British Army|British troops]] in the trenches across from them responded by singing English carols. The two sides shouted Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were calls for visits across the &quot;[[No man's land]]&quot; where small gifts were exchanged. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently fallen soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Funerals took place as soldiers from both sides mourned the dead together and paid their respects. At one funeral in No Man's Land, soldiers from both sides gathered and read a passage from [[Psalm 23]]. The truce occurred in spite of opposition at higher levels of the military command. Earlier in the autumn, a call by [[Pope Benedict XV]] for an official truce between the warring governments had been ignored.

=== Apollo 8 reading from Genesis ===

{{Main|Apollo 8 Genesis reading}}

On December 24, 1968, in what was the most watched television broadcast to that date, the [[astronaut]]s [[William Anders|Bill Anders]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Frank Borman]] of [[Apollo 8]] surprised the world with a reading of the Creation from the [[Book of Genesis]] as they orbited the moon.  [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]], an [[atheist]] activist, filed a lawsuit under the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]]. The suit was dismissed by the [[US Supreme Court]].

In 1969, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a stamp ([[Scott number|Scott #]] 1371) commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the moon. The stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the [[Earthrise]] over the moon (NASA image AS8-14-2383HR) taken by Anders on Christmas Eve, and the words, &quot;In the beginning God...&quot;
