A '''priest''' or '''priestess''' is a person authorized to perform the [[Ritual#Religious_rituals|sacred rituals]] of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or multiple deities. They also have the authority or power to administer [[religious rite]]s; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the '''priesthood''', a term which also may apply to such persons collectively.

Priests and priestesses have existed since the earliest of times and in the simplest societies. They exist in all or some branches of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Shintoism]], [[Hinduism]]  and many other [[religion]]s. They are generally regarded as having positive contact with the [[deity|deity or deities]] of the religion to which they subscribe, often interpreting the meaning of events and performing the rituals of the religion. Priests are leaders to whom other believers will often turn for advice on spiritual matters. 

In many religions, being a priest or priestess is a full-time position, ruling out any other career. In other cases it is a part-time role. For example in the early [[history of Iceland]] the chieftains were titled ''[[goði]]'', a word meaning &quot;priest&quot;. As seen in the [[saga]] of [[Hrafnkels saga|Hrafnkell Freysgoði]], however, being a priest consisted merely of offering periodic sacrifices to the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods and goddesses; it was not a full-time role, nor did it involve ordination. 

In some religions, being a priest or priestess is by human election or human choice. In Judaism the priesthood is inherited in familial lines.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;priest&quot; is ultimately from [[ancient Greek|Greek]], via Latin ''[[presbyter]]'', the term for &quot;elder&quot;, especially elders of Jewish or Christian communities in [[Late Antiquity]]. It is possible that the Latin word was loaned into [[Old English]], and only from Old English reached other Germanic languages via the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]] to the continent, giving [[Old Icelandic]] ''prestr'', [[Old Swedish]] ''präster'', [[Old High German]] ''priast''. Old High German also has the disyllabic ''priester, priestar'', apparently derived from Latin independently via [[Old French]] ''presbtre''. The Latin ''presbyter'' ultimately represents Greek ''presbyteros'', the regular Latin word for &quot;priest&quot; being ''[[sacerdos]]'', corresponding to Greek ''hiereus''. 

That English should have only the single term ''priest'' to translate ''presbyter'' and ''sacerdos'' came to be seen as a problem in [[English Bible translations]]. The ''presbyter'' is the minister who both presides and instructs a Christian congregation, while the ''sacerdos'', offerer of [[sacrifice]]s, or in a Christian context the [[eucharist]], performs &quot;mediatorial offices between God and man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph B. Lightfoot, ''Epistle to the Philippians; a revised text, with introduction, etc.'', 2nd ed. 1869, p. 184 , cited after [[OED]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminine English noun, ''priestess'', was coined in the 17th century, to refer to female priests of the pre-Christian religions of classical antiquity. In the 20th century, the word was used in controversies surrounding the [[ordination of women]]. In the case of the [[ordination of women in the Anglican communion]], it is more common to speak of &quot;priests&quot;, regardless of gender.

== Historical religions ==
{{Further|Vedic priesthood|Druid}}
In historical [[polytheism]], a priest administers the [[sacrifice]] to a deity, often in highly elaborate [[ritual]]. In the [[Ancient Near East]], the priesthood also acted on behalf of the deities in managing their property.

Priestesses in antiquity often performed [[sacred prostitution]], and in Ancient Greece, some priestesses such as [[Pythia]], priestess at [[Delphi]], acted as [[oracle]]s.

=== Ancient priests and priestesses ===
* [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian]] '''Entu''' or [[EN (cuneiform)|EN]] were top-ranking priestesses who were distinguished with special ceremonial attire and held equal status to high priests. They owned property, transacted business, and initiated the [[hieros gamos]] [[ceremony]] with priests and kings.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Dening (1996), ''The Mythology of Sex'', Macmillan, ISBN 978-0-02-861207-2. Ch.3. [http://www.ishtartemple.org/myth.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nadītu]] served as priestesses in the temples of [[Inanna]] in the ancient city of [[Erech]]. They were recruited from the highest families in the land and were supposed to remain childless, owned property, and transacted business.
* The Sumerian word [[NIN (cuneiform)|NIN]], EREŠ in [[Akkadian]], is the sign for &quot;lady.&quot; NIN.[[DINGIR]] (Akkadian ''entu'') &quot;divine lady,&quot; a priestess.
* In Sumerian epic texts such as [[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]], '''Nu-Gig''' were priestesses in temples dedicated to [[Inanna]] and may be a reference to the [[goddess]] herself.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black (1998), ''Reading Sumerian Poetry'', [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-485-93003-X. pp 142. [http://books.google.com/books?id=Jj3bi8QAm1AC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=nu-gig&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C2DNteXFNr&amp;sig=-rAywUCNGugVuM_YqpYsamkvtow&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vk0RTKLDCsKblgfrpMzdBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nu-gig&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Puabi]] of [[Ur]] was a Semitic Akkadian [[Queen regent|queen]] or a priestess. In several other Sumerian city-states, the ruling governor or king was also a head priest with the rank of ''[[ensi]]'', such as at [[Lagash]].
* Control of the &quot;holy&quot; city of [[Nippur]] and its temple priesthood generally meant hegemony over most of Sumer, as listed on the ''[[Sumerian King List]]''; at one point, the Nippur priesthood conferred the title of queen of Sumer on [[Kugbau]], a popular taverness from nearby [[Kish]] (who was later deified as Kubaba).
* In the [[Hebrew Bible]], (קדשה) [[Qedesha]] or ''[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H06948&amp;t=kjv Kedeshah]'', derived from the root [[Q-D-Š]]&lt;ref name=&quot;kedeshah&quot;&gt;[[Blue Letter Bible]], [http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H06948&amp;t=kjv Lexicon results for ''qĕdeshah'' (Strong's H2181)], incorporating [[Strong's Concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=note2&gt;Also transliterated ''qĕdeshah'', ''q&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;deshah'', ''qědēšā'' ,''qedashah'', ''kadeshah'', ''kadesha'', ''qedesha'', ''kdesha''. A modern liturgical pronunciation would be ''k'deysha''&lt;/ref&gt; were [[temple prostitutes]] usually associated with the goddess [[Asherah]].
* '''Quadishtu''' served in the temples of the Sumerian goddess [[Qetesh]].
* '''Ishtaritu''' specialized in the arts of dancing, music, and singing and they served in the temples of [[Ishtar]].&lt;ref&gt;Plinio Prioreschi (1991), ''A History of Medicine'', Horatius Press, ISBN 1-888456-00-0. pp 376. [http://books.google.com/books?id=MJUMhEYGOKsC&amp;pg=PA376&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;dq=Ishtaritu+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NnvVXxLgAX&amp;sig=2myBoCB53iMJOeaksn6xZEWcZ5o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JplATPeEHYH-8Abmj43eDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], priestess [[Shamhat]], a temple prostitute, tamed wild [[Enkidu]] after &quot;six days and seven nights.&quot;
* [[En-hedu-ana]], [[Akkadian]] 2285 BC - 2250 BC was the first known holder of the title, &quot;En Priestess.&quot;
* [[Gerarai]] fourteen [[Athenian]] matrons of [[Dionysus]] who presided over sacrifices and participated in the festivals of [[Anthesteria]].

=== Ancient Egypt ===
In Egyptian ideology, the right and obligation to interact with the [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] belonged to the [[pharaoh]]. He delegated this duty to priests, who were effectively bureaucrats authorized to act on his behalf. Priests staffed [[Egyptian temple|temple]]s throughout Egypt, giving offerings to the [[cult image|cult statues]] in which the gods were believed to take up residence and performing other rituals for their benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Sauneron, Serge (2000) [1988]. ''The Priests of Ancient Egypt, New Edition''. Translated by David Lorton. Cornell University Press. pp. 32–36, 89–92&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about what training may have been required of priests, and the selection of personnel for positions was affected by a tangled set of traditions, although the pharaoh had the final say. In the [[New Kingdom]], when temples owned great estates, the high priests of the most important cult—that of [[Amun]] at [[Karnak]]—were important political figures.&lt;ref&gt;Sauneron 2000, pp. 42–47, 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

High-ranking priestly roles were usually held by men. Women were generally relegated to lower positions in the temple hierarchy, although some held specialized and influential positions, especially that of the [[God's Wife of Amun]], whose religious importance overshadowed the High Priests of Amun in the [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Doxey, Denise M., &quot;Priesthood&quot;, in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'' (2001), vol. III, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antonia Minor Louvre Ma 1228.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Antonia Minor]] as a priestess of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] (36 BCE–37 CE)]]

=== Ancient Rome ===
{{See also|College of Pontifices}}
In [[Ancient Rome]] and throughout [[Italy]], the ancient sanctuaries of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Proserpina]] were invariably led by female ''sacerdotes'', drawn from women of local and Roman elites. It was the only public priesthood attainable by Roman matrons and was held in great honor.&lt;ref&gt;A Roman matron was any mature woman of the upper class, married or unmarried. Females could serve public cult as [[Vestal Virgins]] but few were chosen, and then only from young maidens of the upper class.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, The Roman goddess Ceres, University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 4-5, 9, 20 (historical overview and Aventine priesthoods), 84 - 89 (functions of plebeian aediles), 104 - 106 (women as priestesses): citing among others Cicero, ''In Verres'', 2.4.108; Valerius Maximus, 1.1.1; Plutarch, ''De Mulierum Virtutibus'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Greece ===
* The [[Pythia]] was the title of a priestess at the very ancient temple of [[Delphi]] that was dedicated to the [[Earth Mother]]. She was widely credited for her [[prophecy|prophecies]]. The priestess retained her role when the temple was rededicated to [[Apollo]], giving her a prominence unusual for a woman in the male-dominated culture of [[classical Greece]].
* [[Phrygian Sibyl]] was the priestess presiding over an [[Apollo]]nian [[oracle]] at [[Phrygia]], a historical kingdom in the [[Anatolia]]n highlands.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Judaism ===
{{main|Kohen}}
In [[ancient Israel]] the priests were required by the [[Law of Moses]] to be of direct paternal descendency from [[Aaron]], Moses' elder brother. In Exodus 30:22-25 God instructs Moses to make a [[holy anointing oil]] to consecrate the priests &quot;for all of eternity.&quot; During the times of the two Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples in Jerusalem]], the Aaronic priests were responsible for the daily and special [[Jewish holiday]] offerings and sacrifices within the temples, these offerings are known as the ''[[korbanot]]''. 

In Hebrew the word &quot;priest&quot; is ''[[kohen]]'' (singular '''כהן''' ''kohen'', plural '''כּהנִים''' ''kohanim''), hence the family names ''Cohen'', ''Cahn'', ''Kahn'', ''Kohn'', ''Kogan'', etc. These families are from the [[tribe of Levi]] (Levites) and in twenty-four instances are called by scripture as such ([[Jerusalem Talmud]] to [[Mishna]]ic tractate Maaser Sheini p.&amp;nbsp;31a). 

Since the [[destruction of the Second Temple]], and (therefore) the cessation of the daily and seasonal temple ceremonies and sacrifices, [[Kohanim]] in traditional Judaism ([[Orthodox Judaism]] and to some extent, [[Conservative Judaism]]) continue to perform a number of priestly ceremonies and roles such as the [[Pidyon HaBen]] (redemption of a first-born son) ceremony and the [[Priestly Blessing]], and have remained subject, particularly in Orthodox Judaism, to a number of restrictions, such as restrictions on certain marriages and [[tumah and taharah|ritual purity]] (see [[Kohanic disqualifications]]). 

[[Orthodox Judaism]] regard the ''kohanim'' as being held in reserve for a future [[Third Temple|restored Temple]]. In all branches of Judaism, Kohanim do not perform roles of propitiation, sacrifice, or sacrament. Rather, a ''kohen'''s principal religious function is to perform the [[Priestly Blessing]], and, provided he is rabbinically qualified, to serve as an authoritative judge (''posek'') and expositor of Jewish [[halakha]] law.

With the growth of the [[Catholic Church]] and the formation of [[parish]]es, the word &quot;priest&quot; (''ἱερεύς'', ''sacerdos''), which Christians had since the 3rd century applied to [[bishop]]s and only in a secondary sense to [[presbyter]]s, began in the 6th century to be used of presbyters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Garhammer | first = Erich | editor = Erwin Fahlbusch | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Christianity | title = Priest, Priesthood &amp;nbsp;3. Roman Catholicism | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;lpg=PA348&amp;pg=PA348#v=onepage&amp;q=%22same%20tasks%20as%20bishops%22&amp;f=false | accessdate = 20 June 2012 | year = 2005 | publisher = Wm.

Today the term &quot;priest&quot; is used in [[Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], Anglicanism, and some branches of Lutheranism to refer to those who have been [[ordained]] to a ministerial position through receiving the [[sacrament]] of [[Holy Orders]], although &quot;presbyter&quot; is also used.&lt;ref&gt;An example of the use of &quot;presbyter&quot; is found in [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4U.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1554]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], non-sacramental denominations are more likely to use the term &quot;[[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]&quot; to refer to their pastors. The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (Mormon) upholds all priesthood positions of the primitive gospel of Jesus Christ by the ordination of the [[laying on of hands]] by one in [[authority]] to act in Christ's name, namely deacons, teachers, priests, elders, high priests, patriarchs and apostles.

The New Testament [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] draws a distinction between the Jewish priesthood and the high priesthood of [[Christ]]; it teaches that the sacrificial [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] by [[Jesus]] Christ on [[Calvary]] has made the Jewish priesthood and its prescribed ritual sacrifices redundant, along with the rest of the ceremonial acts of the [[Mosaic law]]. Thus, for Christians, Christ himself is the only high priest, and Christians have no priesthood independent or distinct from participation in the priesthood of Christ, the head of the Church. The one sacrifice of Christ, which he offered &quot;once for all&quot; ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|10:10|KJV}}) on the Cross, provides eternal sanctification and redemption. [[Catholics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P41.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1362&amp;ndash;1367]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Orthodox]],&lt;ref name=Doll&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Doll+%22church%27s+sacrifice%22 Peter M. Doll, ''Anglicanism and Orthodoxy'' (Peter Lang 2006 ISBN 9783039105809), pp. 206-207]&lt;/ref&gt; [[High Church]] [[Anglicans]],&lt;ref name=Doll/&gt; [[Lutherans]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} and some [[Methodists]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} consider the sacrifice to be &quot;re-presented&quot; in the [[Eucharist]].

The most known form of distinctive clothing for the priest is the easily identifiable [[clerical collar]] (or [[Roman collar]]), which takes form in either the traditional cassock, or modern day clerical shirt. The typical modern version consists of a white plastic tab, inserted into a specially made collar of a black shirt, although traditional cloth collars are still worn. 

==== Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy ====
{{Main|Priesthood (Catholic Church)}}
The most significant [[liturgy|liturgical]] acts reserved to priests in these traditions are the administration of the [[Sacrament]]s, including the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]] or [[Divine Liturgy]] (the terms for the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] in the Latin and Byzantine traditions, respectively), and the [[Sacrament of Reconciliation]], also called [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]. The sacraments of [[Anointing of the Sick]] (Extreme Unction) and [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] or [[Chrismation]] are also administered by priests, though in the Western tradition Confirmation is ordinarily celebrated by a [[bishop]]. In the East, Chrismation is performed by the priest (using oil specially consecrated by a bishop) immediately after Baptism, and Unction is normally performed by several priests (ideally seven), but may be performed by one if necessary. In the West, [[Baptism|Holy Baptism]] may be celebrated by anyone and [[Catholic marriage|Matrimony]] may be witnessed by a deacon, but most often these normally are administered by a priest as well. In the East, Holy Baptism and Marriage (which is called &quot;Crowning&quot;) may be performed only by a priest. If a person is baptized ''in extremis'' (i.e., when in fear of immediate death), only the actual threefold immersion together with the scriptural words ({{bibleverse||Matthew|28:19|KJV}}) may be performed by a layperson or deacon. The remainder of the rite, and Chrismation, must still be performed by a priest, if the person survives. The only sacrament which may be celebrated only by a bishop is that of [[Ordination]] (''cheirotonia'', &quot;Laying-on of Hands&quot;), or [[Holy Orders]].

In these traditions, only men who meet certain requirements may become priests. In Roman Catholicism the [[canon law|canonical]] minimum age is twenty-five. Bishops may dispense with this rule and ordain men up to one year younger. Dispensations of more than a year are reserved to the [[Holy See]] (Can. 1031 §§1, 4.) A Catholic priest must be [[Incardination and excardination|incardinated]] by his bishop or his major religious superior in order to engage in public ministry. In Orthodoxy, the normal minimum age is thirty (Can. 9 of Neocaesarea) but a bishop may dispense with this if needed. In neither tradition may priests marry after ordination. In the Roman Catholic Church, priests in the Latin Rite, which covers the vast majority of Roman Catholicism, must be [[Clerical celibacy|celibate]] except under special rules for married clergy converting from certain other Christian confessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married men may become priests in Eastern Orthodoxy and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], but in neither case may they marry after ordination, even if they become widowed. Candidates for bishop are chosen only from among the celibate. Orthodox priests will either wear a clerical collar similar to the above mentioned, or simply a very loose black robe that does not have a collar.

====Anglican or Episcopalian====&lt;!-- This section is linked from a number of articles under the title &quot;Anglican or Episcopalian&quot;. Please do not change the title unless ALL links are updated. --&gt;
The role of a priest in the [[Anglican Communion]] is largely the same as within the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Christianity]], except that [[canon law]] in almost every  [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] province restricts the administration of [[confirmation]] to the [[bishop]], just as with [[ordination]]. Whilst Anglican priests who are members of [[religious order]]s must remain [[celibate]] (although there are exceptions, such as priests in the Anglican Order of Cistercians), the [[secular clergy]] – ([[bishop]]s, priests, and [[deacon]]s who are not members of religious orders) – are permitted to marry before or after ordination. The Anglican churches, unlike the [[Roman Catholic]] or [[Eastern Christian]] traditions, have allowed the ordination of women as priests in some provinces since 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Observer|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/04/should-women-ever-be-made-bishops | title=Should women ever be bishops? | author= Emma John|date={{start date|2010|07|04}}|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice remains controversial, however; a minority of provinces (ten out the thirty-eight worldwide) retain an all-male priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male bishops speak out on female priests|author=Sulaiman Kakaire|url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9899&amp;Itemid=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Continuing Anglican Movement|Continuing Anglican]] churches do not ordain women to the priesthood.

As Anglicanism represents a broad range of theological opinion, its presbyterate includes priests who consider themselves no different in any respect from those of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and a minority who prefer to use the title ''[[presbyter]]'' in order to distance themselves from the more sacrificial theological implications which they associate with the word “priest.” While priest is the official title of a member of the presbyterate in every Anglican province worldwide, the ordination rite of certain provinces (including the [[Church of England]]) recognizes the breadth of opinion by adopting the title ''The Ordination of Priests (also called Presbyters)''. Historically, the term “priest” has been more associated with the “[[High Church]]” or [[Anglo-Catholic]] wing, whereas the term “[[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]” has been more commonly used in “[[Low Church]]” or Evangelical circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minister or Priest?|author=Anglican Church of Canada|url=http://www.anglican.ca/help/faq/minister-or-priest/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestantism====
The general priesthood or the [[priesthood of all believers]], is a [[Christian]] doctrine  derived from several passages of the [[New Testament]]. It is a foundational concept of [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Protestantism originated in the 16th-century Reformation, and its basic doctrines, in addition to those of the ancient Christian creeds, are justification by grace alone through faith, the priesthood of all believers, and the supremacy of Holy Scripture in matters of faith and order&quot; (&quot;The Protestant Heritage.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 20 September 2007 [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109446]&lt;/ref&gt; It is this doctrine that [[Martin Luther]] adduces in his 1520 ''[[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation]]'' in order to dismiss the medieval Christian belief that Christians were to be divided into two classes: &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;temporal&quot; or non-spiritual.

The conservative reforms of Lutherans are reflected in the theological and practical view of the ministry of the Church.  Much of European Lutheranism follows the traditional catholic governance of deacon, priest and bishop.  The Lutheran archbishops of Finland, Sweden, etc. and Baltic countries are the historic national primates or See of the original [[Catholic Church]] and some ancient cathedrals and parishes in the Lutheran church were constructed many centuries before the Reformation.  Indeed, ecumenical work within the Anglican communion and  among Scandinavian Lutherans mutually recognize the historic apostolic legitimacy and full communion.  Likewise in America, Lutherans have embraced the apostolic succession of bishops in the full communion with Episcopalians and most Lutheran ordinations are performed by a bishop. The Catholic Church, however, does not recognise Episcopalians or Lutherans as having legitimate [[apostolic succession]].
  
[[Ordained]] Protestant [[clergy]] often have the title of [[pastor]], [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[reverend]], etc. In some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, ordained clergy are called priests, while in others the term pastor is preferred.

=== Islam ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
No single Islamic office encompasses all the meanings of &quot;priest&quot; in the Christian sense, and some priestly functions are not performed by any office. The title [[mullah]], commonly translated &quot;cleric&quot; in the West and thought to be analogous to &quot;priest&quot;, is a title of address for any educated or respected figure, not even necessarily (though frequently) religious.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The nearest Islamic analogue to the parish priest, or to the &quot;pulpit [[rabbi]]&quot; of a synagogue, is the ''imam khatib.'' This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices: leader ''(imam)'' of the congregational prayer, which in larger mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers; and preacher ''(khatib)'' of the sermon or ''khutba'' at the required congregational prayer on Friday.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

=== Hinduism===
[[Image:Yajna1.jpg|right|x216px|thumb| text|A yagya being performed]] 
Hindu priests historically were members of the [[Brahmin]] caste. Priests are ordained and trained as well. There are two types of Hindu priests, ''[[pujari]]s'' and ''[[purohit]]s''. A ''pujari'' performs rituals in a temple. These rituals include bathing the ''[[murti]]s'' (the statues of the gods/goddesses), performing ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'', a ritualistic offering of various items to the Gods, the waving of a ''[[ghee]]'' or oil lamp also called an offering in light, known in Hinduism as ''[[aarti]]'', before the ''murtis''. ''Pujaris'' are often married.

A ''purohit'', on the other hand, performs rituals and ''[[saṃskāra]]s'' (sacraments) outside of the temple. There are special ''purohits'' who perform only funeral rites.

In many cases, a ''purohit'' also functions as a ''pujari''. Both women and men are ordained as ''purohits'' and ''pujaris''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womensenews.org/story/080226/indian-city-opens-doorway-female-hindu-priests&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_8012/is_20081018/ai_n39508201/ | work=The Times of India | first=Kamini | last=Mathai | title=Masti, mehendi mark Karva Chauth in city [Chennai] | date=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
In [[Zoroastrianism]], the priesthood is reserved for men and is a mostly hereditary position. The priests prepare a drink from a sacred plant, which is called the ''[[haoma]]'' ritual. They officiate the ''[[Yasna]]'', pouring libations into the sacred fire to the accompaniment of ritual chants.

===Taoism===
The [[Taoism|Taoist]] priest is called a [[Daoshi]] (道士 &quot;master of the Dao&quot; p.&amp;nbsp;488). Daoshi act as interpreters of the principles of Yin-Yang  [[Wu Xing|5 elements]] (fire, water, soil, wood, and metal p.&amp;nbsp;53) school of ancient Chinese philosophy, as they relate to marriage, death, festival cycles, and so on. The Daoshi seeks to share the benefits of meditation with his or her community through public ritual and liturgy (p.&amp;nbsp;326). In the ancient priesthood before the Tang, the priest was called ''Jijiu'' (&quot;libationer&quot; p.&amp;nbsp;550), with both male and female practitioners selected by merit. The system gradually changed into a male only hereditary ''Daoshi'' priesthood until more recent times (p.&amp;nbsp;550,551).&lt;ref&gt;Pregadio, Fabrizio (2008) ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1'' Psychology Press ISBN 0700712003

===Shintoism===
{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Yasaka-jinja 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Shinto priest and priestess]]
The shinto priest is called a {{nihongo|[[kannushi]]|神主||lit. &quot;Master of the [[kami]]&quot;}}, originally pronounced ''kamunushi'', sometimes referred to as a {{nihongo|'''shinshoku'''|神職||}}.  A Kannushi is the person responsible for the maintenance of a Shinto shrine, or [[Shinto shrine|jinja]], purificatory rites, and for leading worship and veneration of a certain kami.  Additionally, priests are aided by {{nihongo|[[miko]]|巫女||&quot;shrine maidens&quot;}} for many rites as a kind of shaman or medium.  The maidens may either be family members in training, apprentices, or local volunteers.

Saiin were female relatives of the Japanese emperor (termed saiō) who served as High Priestesses in Kamo Shrine. Saiō also served at Ise Shrine. Saiin priestesses usually were elected from royalty. In principle, Saiin remained unmarried, but there were exceptions. Some Saiin became consorts of the emperor, called Nyōgo in Japanese. The Saiin order of priestesses existed throughout the Heian and Kamakura periods.

===Africa===
The Yoruba people of western Nigeria practice an indigenous religion with a religious hierarchy of priests and priestesses that dates to AD 800-1000. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Ifá priests and priestesses bear the titles Babalowo for men and Iyanifa for females [http://books.google.com/books?id=B667ATiedQkC&amp;pg=PT365&amp;dq=babalawo+iyanifa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y2g_TJTWBISdlgewzdnBBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE0Q6wEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=babalawo%20iyanifa&amp;f=false].  Priests and priestess of the varied [[Orisa|Orisha]] are titled Babalorisa for men and Iyalorisa for women [http://books.google.com/books?id=X8waCmzjiD4C&amp;pg=PA451&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;dq=babalorisha+iyalorisha+orisha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hF6sfW1-I6&amp;sig=rYBDMA7-BHnUEzoMxohhoPMg3qA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=A2o_TJ-sOYaglAen_7z9Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=babalorisha%20iyalorisha%20orisha&amp;f=false].  Initiates are also given an Orisa or Ifá name that signifies under which deity they are initiated.  For example a Priestess of [[Osun|Oshun]] may be named Osunyemi and a Priest of [[Ifá]] may be named Ifáyemi. This ancient culture continues to this day as initiates from all around the world return to Nigeria for initiation into the traditional priesthood.

==Wicca==
According to [[Wicca]]n tradition, there is no separation between &quot;clergy&quot; and &quot;congregation&quot; and all initiates are generally considered to be priestesses and priests, though there is a growing movement toward allowing [[laity]] and not requiring active participation in circles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Wiccan-Ministers-Manual-Priests-Priestesses/dp/1434367444&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dress ==
The dress of religious workers in ancient times may be demonstrated in frescoes and artifacts from the cultures. The dress is presumed to be related to the customary clothing of the culture, with some symbol of the deity worn on the head or held by the person. Sometimes special colors, materials, or patterns distinguish celebrants, as the white wool veil draped on the head of the [[Vestal Virgin]]s. 
[[Image:AGMA Kylix femme autel.jpg|thumb|left|Priestess officiating before an altar while nude to demonstrate purity, Attic red-figure [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by Chairias, c. 510-500 BC, Ancient Agora Museum in Athens]]
Occasionally the celebrants at religious ceremonies shed all clothes in a symbolic gesture of purity. This was often the case in ancient times.  An example of this is shown to the left on a Kylix dating from c. 500 BC where a priestess is featured. Modern religious groups tend to avoid such symbolism and some may be quite uncomfortable with the concept. 

The retention of long [[skirt]]s and [[vestment]]s among many ranks of contemporary priests when they officiate may be interpreted to express the ancient traditions of the cultures from which their religious practices arose. 

[[Image:Choirhabit.jpg|thumb|An [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest in choir dress]]
In most Christian traditions, priests wear [[clerical clothing]], a distinctive form of street dress. Even within individual traditions it varies considerably in form, depending on the specific occasion. In [[Western Christianity]], the stiff white [[clerical collar]] has become the nearly universal feature of priestly clerical clothing, worn either with a [[cassock]] or a [[clergy shirt]]. The collar may be either a full collar or a vestigial tab displayed through a square cutout in the shirt collar. 

[[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] priests mostly retain the traditional dress of two layers of differently cut cassock: the ''rasson'' (Greek) or ''podriasnik'' (Russian) beneath the outer ''exorasson'' (Greek) or ''riasa'' (Russian). If a pectoral cross has been awarded it is usually worn with street clothes in the Russian tradition, but not so often in the Greek tradition.

Distinctive clerical clothing is less often worn in modern times than formerly, and in many cases it is rare for a priest to wear it when not acting in a pastoral capacity, especially in countries that view themselves as largely secular in nature. There are frequent exceptions to this however, and many priests rarely if ever go out in public without it, especially in countries where their religion makes up a clear majority of the population. [[Pope John Paul II]] often instructed Catholic priests and religious to always wear their distinctive (clerical) clothing, unless wearing it would result in persecution or grave verbal attacks.

Christian traditions that retain the title of priest also retain the tradition of special liturgical [[vestment]]s worn only during services. Vestments vary widely among the different Christian traditions.

In modern [[Pagan]] religions, such as [[Wicca]], there is no specific form of dress relegated to the clergy.  If there is, such as in some denominations of Wicca, it is a particular of the denomination in question, and not a universal practice.  However, there is a traditional form of dress, usually a floor-length [[tunic]] and a knotted cord [[cincture]], known as the ''cingulum''.

== Assistant priest ==
In many religions there are one or more layers of assistant priests.

In the [[Ancient Near East]], [[hierodule]]s served in temples as assistants to the priestess.

In ancient Judaism, the Priests (Kohanim) had a whole class of Levites as their assistants in making the sacrifices, in singing [[psalm]]s and in maintaining the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]. The Priests and the Levites were in turn served by servants called [[Nethinim]]. These lowest level of servants were not priests. 

An assistant priest is a priest in the Anglican and Episcopal churches who is not the senior member of clergy of the parish to which they are appointed, but is nonetheless in priests' orders; there is no difference in function or theology, merely in 'grade' or 'rank'. Some assistant priests have a &quot;sector ministry&quot;, that is to say that they specialize in a certain area of ministry within the local church, for example youth work, hospital work, or ministry to local light industry. They may also hold some diocesan appointment part-time. In most (though not all) cases an assistant priest has the legal status of [[curate|assistant curate]], although it should also be noted that not all assistant curates are priests, as this legal status also applies to many [[deacon]]s working as assistants in a parochial setting.

The corresponding term in the [[Catholic Church]] is &quot;parochial vicar&quot; - an ordained priest assigned to assist the pastor (Latin: ''parochus'') of a parish in the pastoral care of parishioners. Normally, all pastors are also ordained priests; occasionally an auxiliary bishop will be assigned that role.
