==How come this page is One sided written by muslims only. And doesn't include any negative verses against people of the book in the quran. Such as they are going to hell! Allah hates them! Fight them until they are subjigated to islamic law and pay the jizyah, or else convert (9:29)? Are we trying to present a fake view of islam where it was tolerant to non muslims and didn't conquer them and discriminate against them or something?==

Lying for Allah and the spread of islam is a great thing.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.149.230.65|78.149.230.65]] ([[User talk:78.149.230.65|talk]]) 12:40, 28 June 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Seventh-day Adventists==

I have inserted Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) claims (note in their official publications) to be Islam's true People of the Book as identified in the Qu'ran.  I have provided a link to the Seventh-day Adventist Church official flagship publication which explains its claim.  I have also provide a link to the SDA Churches special Islamic ministry called 'People of the Book Publications'.[[User:Sjdferg|Sjdferg]] ([[User talk:Sjdferg|talk]])&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 14:17, 23 July 2011.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt;

If people are going to delete things please have the courtesy of discussing it on the discussion page, in the same way I discuss the proposed additions here.[[User:Sjdferg|Sjdferg]] ([[User talk:Sjdferg|talk]])  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 14:37, 26 July 2011 (UTC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Further to the claim that the Adventism should (and was without forewarning in this discussion section) be deleted as 'undue weight', I am not saying other groups cannot or should not their own sections.  It would greatly assist and interest readers if there was an expansion of what different religious groups have, especially Jewish and Christian denominations, as to their understanding and relationship of the Islamic understanding of the term 'People of the Book'.  The passage on Seventh-day Adventism does not advocate the SDA position per se, it merely provides an explanation with quotes of the official Seventh-day Adventist Church citing official published material.  

Also, from a Muslim perspective (which is what the page is primarily about), and as noted in the proposed section, Seventh-day Adventists are viewed by Muslims as 'non-Christians'. Furthermore, many other Christian groups (including as noted on other wiki pages) claim likewise that Adventists are not 'Christians'.  Similar accusations often are made against Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormon's, which is why in wiki pages they also have their own little sections rather than simply being labelled in the 'Christian' section.  Adventists claim to have a special relationship with Muslims due to their similar beliefs and for that reason don't see themselves as 'Christian' within the context of interfaith dialogue with Muslims.  On that basis I would argue lumping Adventists in a generic Christian section is misleading.

To be fair and reasonable, I think the page should be expanded more generally to encompass the relationship between Catholic, Methodist, Baptist, Shaker and other groups cited and Islam, within the conceptual framework of the Koranic notion of 'People of the Book'.  A similar framework exists in many other wiki religious pages, where Catholic, 'Mainstream Protestant', Mormon, Jehovah's Witness and Adventist views are discussed in relation to a particular topic.  That is what I am advocating in this instance.  

Moreover, the Judae-Christian section as currently drafted is quite inadequate, because it really focuses on Jewish and Christian understandings of the general term 'People of the Book', rather than provide insight or relationship to the Islamic understanding of the term.  It has all this talk about the Wycliffe translation of the Bible etc and it basically has nothing to do with Islam or Islamic-Christian or Islamic-Jewish relationships.  It should be remembered that this article is primarily about Islam, and Islam's relationship to certain non-Islamic groups.  If people want a more generic discussion on the term 'People of the Book' that does not relate to Islam, then I suggest a more generic 'People of the Book' page be created, with this page being confined to Islamic understandings of 'People of the Book'.[[User:Sjdferg|Sjdferg]] ([[User talk:Sjdferg|talk]])  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 15:00, 26 July 2011 (UTC).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--Template:Undated--&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
*As an outsider looking in, I can tell you that [[WP:UNDUEWEIGHT]] is a valid concern, especially given the sourcing. [http://www.adventistworld.org/issue.php?issue=2010-1002&amp;page=11 This] may come from an &quot;official&quot; publication, but it's pretty thin to support such a huge section, and I note that it's very, very vague. For instance, claims are made about &quot;a spiritual leader of many thousands of Muslims in several countries, a sheikh,&quot; but the sheikh has no name, we don't know what his authority as a spiritual leader is, et cetera. The publication can support Seventh-Day claims, but not to the extent that you cited the conversation or to the extent that the publication claims that the sheik speaks for Islam. I hope this helps.

:::Sjdferg, you posted a lengthy section on the views of the SDA church regarding this term that far exceeds anything having to do with any other sect. This runs afoul of both [[WP:UNDUE]] and [[WP:SOAP]]. I don't think that the SDA view should necessarily go unmentioned, but this extended dissertation is unreasonable. --[[User:Steven J. Anderson|Steven J. Anderson]] ([[User talk:Steven J. Anderson|talk]]) 05:13, 27 July 2011 (UTC)
:::There, done. I also don't know where you got this mumbo-jumbo about &quot;forewarning,&quot; but there's no such policy on Wikipedia. I suggest you review [[WP:BRD]]. It works like this: You ''boldly'' added a large amount of material to the article; I ''reverted'' with an explanatory edit summary; Your next move is to ''discuss'' those edits on this talk page, ''not'' to re-add them and insist that the other person discuss first. --[[User:Steven J.

== Jews Christians and Sabians ? ==
&quot;The three types of adherents to faiths that the Qur'an mentions as people of the book are the Jews, Sabians and Christians.&quot; 

Here is the thing. The Quran doesn't explicitly say that these three are &quot;the people of the book&quot; !!

== Qur'an Quotes ==

Is 3:113-115 supposed to be an example of the Qur'an promoting tolerance toward People of the Book? Because what it actually says is that ''a small minority of them'' are decent people. 3:110 states this even more clearly: &quot;You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah. If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://quran.com/3/110&lt;/ref&gt; 3:118-119 goes on to say: &quot;O you who have believed, do not take as intimates those other than yourselves, for they will not spare you [any] ruin. They wish you would have hardship. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater. We have certainly made clear to you the signs, if you will use reason. Here you are loving them but they are not loving you, while you believe in the Scripture - all of it. And when they meet you, they say, &quot;We believe.&quot; But when they are alone, they bite their fingertips at you in rage. Say, &quot;Die in your rage. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://quran.com/3/118-119&lt;/ref&gt;

Just to be clear, I'm not debating whether or not Islam is tolerant of other religions, I'm just saying 3:113-115 is not in fact an example of the Qur'an calling for tolerance toward People of the Book, because when read in context, it's really just saying &quot;most of them are indeed horrible people, but there may be a few exceptions&quot;.
