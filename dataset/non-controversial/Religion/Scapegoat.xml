:'' This article describes scapegoat in its traditional historical sense. For scapegoat in the more modern social psychological sense of scapegoating see [[scapegoating]].''

[[File:William Holman Hunt - The Scapegoat.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' by [[William Holman Hunt]], 1854.]]
In modern usage a '''scapegoat''' is an individual, group, or country singled out for unmerited negative treatment or [[blame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outofthefog.net/CommonBehaviors/Scapegoating.html |title=Scapegoating |publisher=Out of the FOG |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[whipping boy]] or &quot;[[fall guy]]&quot; is a form of scapegoat.

Scapegoat derives from the common English translation of the Hebrew term ''azazel'' (Hebrew: עזאזל) which occurs in [[Leviticus]] 16:8 after the prefix ''la-'' (Hebrew לַ &quot;for&quot;).

In ancient Greece a cripple or beggar or criminal (the ''[[pharmakos]]'') was cast out of the community, either in response to a natural disaster (such as a plague, famine or an invasion) or in response to a calendrical crisis (such as the end of the year). In the Bible, the scapegoat was a [[goat]] that was designated (Hebrew לַעֲזָאזֵֽל ) ''la-aza'zeyl'' to be outcast in the desert as part of the ceremonies of the [[Day of Atonement]], that began during the Exodus with the original Tabernacle and continued through the times of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temples in Jerusalem]].

In psychology and sociology, the practice of selecting someone as a scapegoat has led to the concept of [[scapegoating]].

==Etymology==
{{main|Azazel}}
The verb &quot;to scapegoat&quot; (noun form &quot;scapegoating&quot;) is a modern [[intransitive]] or [[transitive verb|transitive]] coinage from the older transitive verb-noun construction &quot;to make (someone) a scapegoat.&quot;

Scapegoat derives from the common English translation of the Hebrew term ''azazel'' (Hebrew: עזאזל) which occurs in [[Leviticus]] 16:8 after the prefix ''la-'' (Hebrew לַ &quot;for&quot;). The lexicographer [[Gesenius]]&lt;ref&gt;Gesenius &quot;I have no doubt that it should be rendered 'averter'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brown–Driver–Briggs]] Hebrew Lexicon&lt;ref&gt;p736&lt;/ref&gt; give ''la-azazel'' (Hebrew: עזאזל) as a reduplicative intensive of the stem ''azel'' &quot;remove&quot;, hence ''la-azazel,'' &quot;for entire removal&quot;. This reading is supported by the [[Septuagint|Jewish Greek Bible]] translation as &quot;the sender away (of sins).&quot; Later Jewish sources in the [[Talmud]] (Yoma 6:4,67b)give the etymology of ''azazel'' as a compound of &quot;az&quot;, strong or rough, and &quot;el&quot;, mighty, that the goat was sent from the most rugged or strongest of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2203&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Azazel#6890 JewishEncyclopedia.com - AZAZEL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|&quot;And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for Azazel.1
:Footnote [1] 16:8 The meaning of Azazel is uncertain.[[English Standard Version|ESV]]}}
Alternatively, broadly contemporary with the Septuagint, the pseudepigrapical [[Book of Enoch]] may preserve Azazel as the name of a [[fallen angel]]&lt;ref&gt;Archie T. Wright ''The origin of evil spirits: the reception of Genesis 6.1-4'' Page 111 2005 &quot;However, the corresponding Aramaic fragment of / Enoch 10.4 does not use the name Azazel; instead, the name has been reconstructed by Milik to read Asa'el. Stuckenbruck suggests the presence of the biblical form Azazel in the Ethiopic&lt;/ref&gt; and from the [[Targums]] onwards the term ''azazel'' was also seen by some rabbinical commentators as the name of a Hebrew demon, fallen angel, or pagan deity.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David P. &quot;Azazel.&quot; Pages 1:536-37 in [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]]. Edited by David Noel Freedman et al. New York: Doubleday, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The symbolism of the Azazel goat'' Ralph D. Levy 1998 &quot;This is still fairly straightforward, and is translated by the majority of the versions as &quot;for Azazel&quot; (Targums Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan follow this understanding, as do the RSV, NRSV, REB, and Tanakh). KJV and NKJV have &quot;to be the scapegoat&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;The JPS guide to Jewish traditions - Page 224 Ronald L. Eisenberg, Jewish Publication Society - 2004 &quot;(Leviticus 16:8–10). In talmudic times, a popular rabbinic interpretation was that Azazel referred to the place to which the goat was sent, the eretz g'zera (inaccessible region) of Leviticus (16:22). Later, Azazel became associated with another.. .&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The two readings are still disputed today.&lt;ref&gt;The JPS Torah Commentary: Leviticus Nahum M. Sarna, Chaim Potok, Jewish Publication Society - 1989 &quot; According to the first, Azazel is the name of the place in the wilderness to which the scapegoat was dispatched; ... According to the second line of interpretation, Azazel describes the goat. The word ' aza''zel is a contraction&lt;/ref&gt;

English Bible versions traditionally follow the translation of the [[Septuagint]] and Latin [[Vulgate]] which interpret ''azazel'' as &quot;the goat that departs&quot; (Greek ''tragos apopompaios'', &quot;goat sent out&quot;, Latin ''caper emissarius'', &quot;emissary goat&quot;). [[William Tyndale]] rendered the Latin as &quot;(e)scape goat&quot; in his [[Tyndale Bible|1530 Bible]]. This translation was followed by following versions up to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in 1611: &quot;And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories|year=1991|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978087779603 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Invalid length.}}|page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern versions however either follow the reading as a demon, Azazel, or footnote &quot;for Azazel.&quot; as an alternative reading.

==History==
===Ancient Syria===
A concept superficially similar to the biblical scapegoat is attested in two ritual texts in archives at [[Ebla]] of the 24th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Zatelli |first=Ida |year=1998 |month=April |title=The Origin of the Biblical Scapegoat Ritual: The Evidence of Two Eblaite Text |journal=[[Vetus Testamentum]] |volume=48 |issue=2 |page= |pages=254–263 |ref=href }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were connected with ritual purification on the occasion of the king's wedding. In them, a she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of &quot;Alini&quot;; &quot;we&quot; in the report of the ritual involves the whole community. Such &quot;elimination rites&quot;, in which an animal, without confession of sins, is the vehicle of evils (not sins) that are chased from the community are widely attested in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;David P. Wright, ''The Disposal of the Impurity: Elimination Rites in the Bible and in Hittite and Mesopotamian Literature'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press) 1987:15-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
The Ancient Greeks practiced a scapegoating rite in which a cripple or beggar or criminal (the ''[[pharmakos]]'') was cast out of the community, either in response to a natural disaster (such as a plague, famine or an invasion) or in response to a calendrical crisis (such as the end of the year). The scholia refer to the ''pharmakos'' being killed, but many scholars reject this, and argue that the earliest evidence (the fragments of the iambic satirist Hipponax) only show the ''pharmakos'' being stoned, beaten and driven from the community.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James]], ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. Worsworth Reference. pp 578. ISBN 1-85326-310-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bible==
The scapegoat was a [[goat]] that was designated (Hebrew לַעֲזָאזֵֽל ) ''la-aza'zeyl''; either &quot;for absolute removal&quot; ([[Brown-Driver-Briggs]] Lexicon) or possibly &quot;for [[Azazel]]&quot; (some modern versions taking the term as a name) and outcast in the desert as part of the ceremonies of the [[Day of Atonement]], that began during the Exodus with the original Tabernacle and continued through the times of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temples in Jerusalem]].

Throughout the year, the sins of the ancient Israelites were daily transferred to the regular sin offerings as outlined in the Torah in [[Leviticus]] Ch 16. Once a year, on the tenth day of the seventh month in the Jewish calendar, the Day of Atonement, the High Priest of Israel sacrificed a bull for a sin offering for his own sins. Subsequently he took two goats and presented them at the door of the tabernacle with a view to dealing with the corporate sins of God's people — the nation of Israel. Two goats were chosen by lot: one to be &quot;The Lord's Goat&quot;, which was offered as a blood sacrifice, and the other to be the &quot;Azazel&quot; scapegoat to be sent away into the wilderness. The blood of the slain goat was taken into the Holy of Holies behind the sacred veil and sprinkled on the mercy seat, the lid of the ark of the covenant. Later in the ceremonies of the day, the High Priest confessed the sins of the Israelites to Jehovah placing them figuratively on the head of the other goat, the Azazel scapegoat, who &quot;took them away&quot; never to be seen again. The sin of the nation was thus &quot;atoned for&quot; (paid for) by the &quot;The Lord's Goat&quot; and &quot;The Azazel Goat&quot;.

In Christian thought this process prefigures the sacrifice of [[Christ]] on the cross through which God has been propitiated and sins can be expiated. Jesus Christ is seen to have fulfilled both of the Biblical &quot;types&quot; - the Lord's goat that deals with the pollution of sin and the scapegoat that removes the &quot;burden of sin&quot;. Christians believe that sinners who own their guilt and confess their [[sins]], exercising faith and trust in the person and sacrifice of [[Jesus]], are forgiven of their sins. 

Since the second goat was sent away to perish,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Golden Bough]]'' pp569 Sir [[James Frazer]], Worsworth Reference ISBN 1-85326-310-9&lt;/ref&gt; the word &quot;scapegoat&quot; has developed to indicate a person who is blamed and punished for the sins of others.
