According to the [[Torah]], the kingdoms of Sodom and Gomorrah were allied with the cities of [[Admah]], [[Zeboim (biblical)|Zeboim]] and [[Zoara|Bela]]. These five cities, also known as the &quot;cities of the plain&quot;, were situated on the [[River Jordan|Jordan river]] plain in the southern region of the land of [[Canaan]]. The Jordan river plain (which corresponds to area just north of the modern day [[Dead Sea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topicalbible.org/s/sodom.htm |title=Sodom |last=Smith |first=William |authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer) |date=circa 1863 |work=[[Smith's Bible Dictionary]] |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has been compared to the garden of Eden,{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|13:10|NIV|Gen.13:10}} being a land well-watered and green, suitable for grazing livestock.

[[Divine retribution|Divine judgment]] by [[Yahweh]] was then passed upon Sodom and Gomorrah along with two other neighboring cities that were completely consumed by fire and [[sulfur|brimstone]]. Neighboring Zoar was the only city to be spared during that day of judgment.{{Bibleref2c|Deuteronomy|29:23|NIV|Deut.29:23}}{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|10:19|NIV|Gen.10:19}} In Abrahamic traditions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of God's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;Religions of the World, Second Edition: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practises, J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]](S15)[[Al-Hijr]]:72-73&lt;/ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Jude|1:7}} Sodom and Gomorrah have been used as [[metaphor]]s for [[vice]] and [[homosexuality]] viewed as a deviation. The story has therefore given rise to words in several languages, including the English word ''[[sodomy]]'', used in so-called [[sodomy law]]s to describe a sexual &quot;crime against nature&quot; consisting of [[anal sex|anal]] and/or [[oral sex]], either [[homosexual]] or [[heterosexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2075271/ |title=What is sodomy |last=Koerner |first=Brendan |authorlink=Brendan I. Koerner |date=2002-12-10 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Sodom is derived from {{Hebrew Name|סְדוֹם|Sədom|Səḏôm}}, and [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Σόδομα}} ''Sódoma''. The name Gomorrah is derived from {{Hebrew Name|עֲמוֹרָה|ʿAmora|Ġəmôrāh/ʿĂmôrāh}}, and [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|''Γόμοῤῥα''}} / ''Gómorrha''. The exact meaning of the names is uncertain. The name ''Sodom'' could be a word from an early Semitic language ultimately related to the Arabic ''sadama'', meaning &quot;fasten&quot;, &quot;fortify&quot;, &quot;strengthen&quot;, and Gomorrah could be based on the root ''gh m r'', which means &quot;be deep&quot;, &quot;copious (water)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=B. Macdonald|title=&quot;East of the Jordan&quot;: Territories and Sites of the Hebrew Scriptures|publisher=American Schools of Oriental Research|year=2000|url=http://www.asor.org/pubs/macdonald.pdf|format=PDF|isbn=0-89757-031-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historicity==
The historical existence of Sodom and Gomorrah is still in dispute by archaeologists, as little archaeological evidence has ever been found in the regions where they were supposedly situated. The Bible indicates they were located near the [[Dead Sea]] ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|14:1-3|NIV}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Genesis|14:8-10|NIV}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Deuteronomy|34:3|NIV}}).

[[Strabo]] states that locals living near Moasada (as opposed to [[Masada]]) say that &quot;there were once thirteen inhabited cities in that region of which Sodom was the metropolis&quot;. Strabo identifies a limestone and salt hill at the south western tip of the Dead Sea, and Kharbet Usdum ruins nearby as the site of biblical Sodom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ferdinand|last=de Saulcy|title=Voyage autour de la mer Morte et dans les terres bibliques|publisher=Gide et J. Baudry|year=1853|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archibald Sayce]] translated an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] poem describing cities that were destroyed in a rain of fire, written from the view of a person who escaped the destruction; the names of the cities are not given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=&quot;The Overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah (Accadian Account)&quot; Records of the Past XI 115|author=A. H. Sayce}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sayce later mentions that the story more closely resembles the doom of [[Sennacherib]]'s host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hibbert Lectures, 1887: Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion|year=1887|author=Archibald Sayce|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 Giovanni Pettinato claimed that a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that had been found in the newly discovered library at [[Ebla]] contained the names of all five of the cities of the plain (Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Bela), listed in the same order as in Genesis. The names ''si-da-mu'' [TM.76.G.524] and ''ì-ma-ar'' [TM.75.G.1570 and TM.75.G.2233] were identified as representing Sodom and Gomorrah, which gained some acceptance at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hershel Shanks|date=September/October 1980|title=BAR Interviews Giovanni Pettinato|journal=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]|volume=6|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alfonso Archi states that, judging from the surrounding city names in the cuneiform list, ''si-da-mu'' lies in northern Syria and not near the Dead Sea, and ''ì-ma-ar'' is a variant of ''ì-mar'', known to represent [[Emar]], an ancient city located near Ebla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfonso Archi|date=November/December 1981|title=Are &quot;The Cities of the Plain&quot; Mentioned in the Ebla Tablets?|journal=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]|volume=7|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Shea points out in 1983 that on the 'Eblaite Geographical Atlas' [TM.75.G.2231], ''ad-mu-ut'' and ''sa-dam'' are good readings by Pettinato and correspond to Admah and Sodom, and they are contained in a list of cities that traces a route along the shores of, or quite possibly within the Dead Sea, whose position may have since shifted along its fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bryant G. Wood|date=Summer 1999|title=The Discovery of the Sin Cities of Sodom and Gomorrah|journal=[[Bible and Spade]]|volume=12|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the scientific consensus is reported as being that &quot;Ebla has no bearing on ... Sodom and Gomorra.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;Chavalas, Mark W., and K. Lawson Younger, Jr. (eds.) Mesopotamia and the Bible: Comparative Explorations. 2003. P.41&lt;/ref&gt;

If the cities actually existed, they might have been destroyed as the result of a natural cataclysm. Geologists have confirmed that no volcanic activity occurred within the last 4000 years. However, it is possible that the towns were destroyed by an [[earthquake]] in the region, especially if the towns lay along a major fault, the [[Jordan Rift Valley]]. However, there is a lack of contemporary accounts of seismic activity within the necessary timeframe to corroborate this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Penrose Harland|month=September | year=1943|title=Sodom and Gomorrah: The Destruction of the Cities of the Plain| journal=[[Biblical Archaeologist]]|volume=6|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible candidates for Sodom or Gomorrah are the sites discovered or visited by [[Walter E. Rast]] and [[R. Thomas Schaub]] in 1973, including [[Bab edh-Dhra]], which was originally excavated in 1965 by archaeologist Paul Lapp, only to have his work continued by Rast and Schaub following his death by accidental drowning in the waters off of Cyprus in 1970. Other possibilities also include [[Numeira]], [[es-Safi]], [[Feifeh]] and [[Khanazir]], which were also visited by Schaub and Rast. All sites were located near the [[Dead Sea]], with evidence of burning and traces of [[sulfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aish.com/societyWork/sciencenature/Biblical_Archeology_Sodom_and_Gomorrah.asp | title = Does Archeological Data Support the Biblical Story?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwTVFk1HK3Y&amp;feature=related]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological remains excavated from Bab edh-Dhra are currently displayed in Karak Archaeological Museum (Karak Castle) and Amman Citadel Museum.

Another possible candidate for Sodom is the Tall el-Hammam dig site which began in 2006 under the direction of Steven Collins.  Tall el-Hammam is located in the southern Jordan river valley approximately 14 kilometers Northeast of the Dead Sea, and seemingly fitting the Bible descriptions of the lands of Sodom.  The ongoing dig is a result of joint cooperation between Trinity South Western University and the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tallelhammam.com | title=tallelhammam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is 36 hectares, while the footprint size of general settlement extends beyond this—well over 40 hectares.  This size puts Tall el-Hammam as one of the largest Bronze sites that has been discovered in Jordan.  Analysis of the findings indicates that the site was occupied from the Chalcolithic period on up the Iron Age (however there may likely be period gaps as well, along with evidences of glazed artifacts—such as pottery and rocks, and destruction).  In addition there is evidence of Hellenistic, Eastern Roman, and Byzantium occupation on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tallelhammam.com/uploads/TeHEP_SEASON_FIVE_2010_REPORT.pdf | title=tallelhammam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] identifies the [[Dead Sea]] in geographic proximity to the ancient biblical city of Sodom.  However, he refers to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities of the Jews.''  Book I. Chapter 9.  Retrieved from: http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an ancient [[Sumer|Sumerian]] [[planesphere]], using modern astronomical software, a match for the sky as then existed was seen in the early morning around 4:30am on June 29, 3123 BC with an [[asteroid]] exploding in an airburst producing massive fiery plumes over the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceCh&quot;&gt;{{cite |title=Biblical Mysteries Explained (&quot;Lost Gospels&quot;) |publisher=[[Science Channel]] |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical narratives==
The [[Book of Genesis]] is the primary source that mentions the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. [[Major prophets|Major]] and [[minor prophets]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] have also referred to Sodom and Gomorrah to parallel their prophetic events. In suite, the [[New Testament]] also contains passages of parallels to the destruction and surrounding events that pertained to these cities and those who were involved. Later [[Deuterocanonical]] texts attempt to glean additional insights about these cities of the Jordan Plain.

=== Political climate ===
{{See also|Battle of the Vale of Siddim}}
In {{Bibleref2|Genesis|14|9|Genesis Chapter 14}}, Sodom and Gomorrah's political situation is described during the time biblical [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] had encamped in Sodom's territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Genesis|13:11-12|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Bibleref2|Genesis|13:13|9}} indicates that at that time, &quot;the men of Sodom ''[were]'' wicked and sinners before the {{LORD}} exceedingly.&quot; Sodom was ruled by king [[Bera (Bible)|Bera]] while Gomorrah was ruled by king [[Birsha]]. Their kingship, however, was not sovereign, because all of the river Jordan plain was under [[Elam]]ite rule for twelve years. The kingdom of Elam was ruled by king [[Chedorlaomer]].{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:1-4|9}}

In the thirteenth year of subjection to Elam, the five kings of the river Jordan plain aligned together to rebel against Elamite rule.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:4|9|v.4}} These kings included those of Sodom and Gomorrah as well as their neighbors: king [[Shinab]] of [[Admah]], king [[Shemeber]] of [[Zeboyim|Zeboiim]], and the unnamed king of [[Zoara|Bela]] (later called Zoar).{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:2|9|v.2}}

In response, Elam's king [[Chedorlaomer]], gathered additional forces from [[Shinar]], [[Ellasar]] and [[Goyim]] to suppress this rebellion from the cities of the plain.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:1-2|9|v.1,2}} They waged war in the Vale of [[Siddim]]{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:3,8|9|v.3,8}} in the fourteenth year. The battle was brutal with heavy losses in the cities of the plain, with their resultant defeat.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:10|9|v.10}} Sodom and Gomorrah were spoiled of their goods, and captives were taken, including Lot.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:11-12|9|v.11,12}}

The tide of war turned when Lot's uncle [[Abraham|Abram]] gathered an elite force that slaughtered king Chedorlaomer's forces in Hobah, north of [[Damascus]].{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:14-17|9|v.14-17}} The success of his mission freed the cities of the plain from under Elam's rule.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:18-20|9|v.18-20}}

=== Judgment{{anchor|Judgement}} ===
&lt;!--This section is linked to from [[Lot's wife]]--&gt;
In {{Bibleref2|Genesis|18|9}}, three men came, thought by most commentators to have been angels appearing as men,&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary on the Bible'', the &quot;three men&quot; were three heavenly beings in human bodies. &quot;Some think they were all created angels; others, that one of them was the Son of God, the Angel of the covenant.&quot; In {{Bibleref2|Genesis|18:3|9}}, the word &quot;Lord&quot; is the same word as in verse 1, but is plural, which would seem to indicate that Abraham could not determine that they were heavenly beings since they appeared as men. It wasn't until after the three had eaten, verses 9-15, that Abraham realized the true identity of his visitors and their purpose.[http://www.biblestudy.org/question/who-were-three-strangers-abraham-met.html three strangers]&lt;/ref&gt; to Abram (Abraham) in the plains of Mamre.

After the angels received the hospitality of Abraham and Sarah, his wife, the {{LORD}} revealed to Abraham that he would destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, because their cry was great, &quot;and because their sin is very grievous.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Gen|18:20|9}} In response, Abraham inquired of the {{LORD}} if he would spare the city if 50 righteous people were found in it, to which the {{LORD}} agreed he would not destroy it for the sake of the righteous yet dwelling therein.  Abraham then inquired of God for mercy at lower numbers (first 45, then 40, then 30, then 20, and finally at 10), with the {{LORD}} agreeing each time.{{Bibleref2c|Gen|18:22-33|9}}&lt;ref&gt;This is compared with the [[Sorites paradox]] in ''Geocomputation'', Stan Openshaw, Robert J. Abrahart, 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=zc0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA163 p. 167].&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the angels proceeded to Sodom and were met by Abraham's nephew [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], who convinced the angels to lodge with him, and they ate with Lot.

{{Bibleref2|Genesis|19:4-5|9}} (KJV) described what followed, which confirmed its end:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, ''[even]'' the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:&lt;br&gt;5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where ''[are]'' the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may &lt;u&gt;know them&lt;/u&gt;.
([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]: know them, [[New International Version|NIV]]: can have sex with them, [[New Jerusalem Bible|NJB]]: can have intercourse with them).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 21r .png|right|thumb|300px|The Sodom and Gomorrah motif from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] by [[Hartmann Schedel]], 1493. Note Lot's wife, already transformed into a salt pillar, in the center.]]

Lot refused to give his guests to the inhabitants of Sodom and, instead, offered them his two [[almah|virgin]] daughters &quot;which have not &lt;u&gt;known&lt;/u&gt; man&quot; and to &quot;do ye to them as ''[is]'' good in your eyes&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|Gen|19:8|9}} However, they refused this offer and threatened to do worse to Lot than they would have done to his guests, and then came near to break down the door. Lot's angelic guests rescued him and struck the men with blindness, thereby revealing to Lot that they were not ordinary men but angels, and they informed Lot of their mission to destroy the city.{{bibleref2c|Genesis|19:9-13|9}}

Then (not having found even 10 righteous people in the city), they commanded Lot to gather his family and leave. As they made their escape, one angel commanded Lot to &quot;look not behind thee&quot; (singular &quot;thee&quot;).{{bibleref2c|Genesis|19:17|9}} However, as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with [[fire and brimstone|brimstone and fire]] from the {{LORD}}, [[Lot's wife]] looked back at the city, and she became a pillar of salt.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:23-26|9}}

==Religious views==

===Jewish===
[[Rictor Norton]] views classical Jewish texts as stressing the cruelty and lack of [[hospitality]] of the inhabitants of Sodom to the &quot;stranger&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Inhospitable Sodomites&quot;&gt;[http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm The Inhospitable Sodomites]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' has information on the importance of hospitality to the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=937&amp;letter=H&amp;search=hospitality Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Sodom were seen as guilty of many other significant sins. [[Rabbi]]nic writings affirm that the Sodomites also committed economic crimes, blasphemy and bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A tale of two cities : Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament, early Jewish and early Christian traditions|author=James Alfred Loader|year=1990|publisher=Peeters Publishers|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the worst was to give money or even gold ingots to beggars, after inscribing their names on them, and then subsequently refusing to sell them food. The unfortunate stranger would end up starving and after his death, the people who gave him the money would reclaim it.

A rabbinic tradition, described in the [[Mishnah]], postulates that the sin of Sodom was related to property: Sodomites believed that &quot;what is mine is mine, and what is yours is yours&quot; (Abot), which is interpreted as a lack of compassion. Another rabbinic tradition is that these two wealthy cities treated visitors in a sadistic fashion. One major crime done to strangers was almost identical to that of [[Procrustes]] in Greek mythology. This would be the story of the &quot;bed&quot; that guests to Sodom were forced to sleep in: if they were too short they were stretched to fit it, and if they were too tall, they were cut up (indeed, in [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], the corresponding term for a [[Procrustean bed]] is a &quot;Sodom bed&quot;).

In another incident, [[Eliezer]], Abraham's servant, went to visit Lot in Sodom and got in a dispute with a Sodomite over a beggar, and was hit in the forehead with a stone, making him bleed. The Sodomite demanded Eliezer pay him for the service of [[bloodletting]], and a Sodomite judge sided with the Sodomite. Eliezer then struck the judge in the forehead with a stone and asked the judge to pay the Sodomite.&lt;!-- That sounds so bogus. --&gt;

The [[Talmud]] and the [[Book of Jasher (Biblical references)|book of Jasher]] also recount two incidents of a young girl (one involved Lot's daughter Paltith) who gave some bread to a poor man who had entered the city. When the townspeople discovered their acts of kindness, they burned Paltith and smeared the other girl's body with honey and hung her from the city wall until she was eaten by bees. ([[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] 109a.) It is this gruesome event, and her scream in particular, the Talmud concludes, that are alluded to in the verse that heralds the city's destruction: &quot;So&lt;ref&gt;[[Names of God in Judaism#HaShem|Hashem]]&lt;/ref&gt; said, 'Because the outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah has become great, and because their sin has been very grave, I will descend and see...'&quot;{{bibleref2c|Gen|18:20-21|JP}}

A modern orthodox position is one that holds, &quot;The paradigmatic instance of such aberrant behavior is found in the demand of the men of Sodom to 'know' the men visiting Lot, the nephew of Abraham, thus lending their name to the practice of 'sodomy'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Ethics and Halakhah For Our Time (2002); Cf. Genesis Rabbah 50:5, on Gen. 9:22 ff. More generally see M.Kasher, Torah Shlemah, vol. 3 to Gen 19:5.)[139]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar and activist [[Jay Michaelson]] proposes a reading of the story of Sodom that emphasizes the violation of hospitality as well as the violence of the Sodomites. &quot;Homosexual rape is the way in which they violate hospitality—not the essence of their transgression. Reading the story of Sodom as being about homosexuality is like reading the story of an ax murderer as being about an ax.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michaelson|first=Jay|title=God Vs. Gay? The Religious Case for Equality|year=2011|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807001592|url=http://www.beacon.org/productdetails.cfm?PC=2267|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaelson places the story of Sodom in context with other Genesis stories regarding Abraham's hospitality to strangers, and argues that when other texts in the Hebrew Bible mention Sodom, they do so without commentary on homosexuality. The verses cited by Michaelson include Jeremiah 23:14,{{bibleref2c|Jeremiah|23:14|KJ21}} where the sins of Jerusalem are compared to Sodom and are listed as adultery, lying, and strengthening the hands of evildoers; Amos 4:1-11 (oppressing the poor and crushing the needy);{{bibleref2c|Amos|4:1-11|KJ21}} and Ezekiel 16:49-50,{{bibleref2c|Ezekiel|16:49-50|KJ21}} which defines the sins of Sodom as &quot;pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and did ''toevah'' before me, and I took them away as I saw fit.&quot; Michaelson uses ''toevah'' in place of ''abomination'' to emphasize the original Hebrew, which he explains as being more correctly translated as &quot;taboo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michaelson|first=Jay|title=God vs. Gay|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian===
Several theories have been advanced in [[Christian]] thought concerning the sin of Sodom, two of which are prevailing opinions—a sexual and a nonsexual view.

The more prominent theory, representing orthodox Christian opinion, holds that the demand of Lot's countrymen was referring to a militant [[solicitation]] for homosexual sex—a same-sex orgy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wenham&quot;&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_attitude_wenham.html, &quot;The Old Testament Attitude to Homosexuality.&quot; ''Expository Times'', 102 (1991): 259-363]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Boswell | first = John | authorlink = John Boswell | title = Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press|year= 1980|page= 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contention between the two positions primarily focuses upon the meaning of the word ''know'', in verse 5:

{{quote|And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where [are] the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. —{{Bibleref2|Gen|19:5}}}}

Those who favor the non-sexual interpretation argue against a denotation of sexual behavior in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for ''know'' appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13-14 times)&lt;ref name=&quot;The Inhospitable Sodomites&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Gn|4:1,17,25}},{{Bibleref2-nb|Gn|24:16}},{{Bibleref2-nb|Gn|38:26}}; {{Bibleref2|Num|31:17,18,35}}; {{Bibleref2|Jdg|11:39}}, {{Bibleref2-nb |Jdg|19:25}}, {{Bibleref2-nb |Jdg|21:11,12}}; {{Bibleref2|1Sam|1:19}}, {{Bibleref2|1Ki|1:4}}, cf. {{Bibleref2|Mt|1:25}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk|1:34}}&lt;/ref&gt; of those references is it clearly used as a euphemism for realizing sexual intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rogers|last=Jack Bartlet|title=Jesus, the Bible, and Homosexuality: Explode the myths, heal the church|publisher=John Knox Press|year=2006|location=Louisville, Kentucky|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.&lt;ref&gt;D S. Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Tradition, p. 8; John J. McNeil, the Church and the Homosexual, p. 50; Daniel Helminiak, http://www.neednotfret.com/content/view/124/89/&lt;/ref&gt;

Countering this is the observation that one of the examples of &quot;know&quot; meaning to know sexually occurs only three verses later in the same narrative:

{{quote|Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing.... —{{Bibleref2|Genesis|19:8}}}}

The following is a major text in regard to these conflicting opinions:

{{quote|Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. —{{Bibleref2|Jude|1:7}}}}

This reference to &quot;going after strange flesh&quot; is understood in different ways to include something akin to bestiality, having illicit sex with strangers, having sex with angels, but most often God's destruction of the populations of the four cities is interpreted to mean [[homosexual]] (same-sex) relations.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. &quot;Homosexuality and 'Strange Flesh'&quot;. Web: 28 Mar 2010. [http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2596 Homosexuality and 'Strange Flesh']&lt;/ref&gt;

Many who interpret the stories in a non-sexual context contend that as the word for &quot;strange&quot; is akin to &quot;another&quot;, &quot;other&quot;, &quot;altered&quot; or even &quot;next&quot;, the meaning is unclear, and if the condemnation of Sodom was the result of sexual activities perceived to be perverse, then it is likely that it was because women sought to commit fornication with &quot;other than human&quot; angels,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition'', pp. 11-16; Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps referring to {{Bibleref2|Genesis|6}} or the apocryphal [[Book of Enoch]]. Countering this, it is pointed out that {{Bibleref2|Genesis|6}} refers to angels seeking women, not men seeking angels, and that both Sodom and Gomorrah were engaged in the sin Jude describes before the angelic visitation, and that, regardless, it is doubtful that the Sodomites knew they were angels. In addition, it is argued the word used in the King James Version of the Bible for &quot;strange&quot;, can mean unlawful or corrupted ({{Bibleref2|Rm.|7:3}}; {{Bibleref2|Gal.|1:6}}), and that the apocryphal [[Second Book of Enoch]] (different from the one Jude quotes from) condemns &quot;sodomitic&quot; sex (Enoch 10:3; 34:1),&lt;ref&gt;http://www38.bibliotecapleyades.net/enoch/2enoch01-68.htm&lt;/ref&gt; thus indicating that homosexual relations was the prevalent '''physical''' sin of Sodom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robgagnon.net/RevCountryman.htm response to prof. l. William Countryman's review in Anglican theological review; On Careless Exegesis and Jude 7, Robert A. J. Gagnon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the non-sexual and the [[homosexuality]] view invoke certain classical writings as well as other portions of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Homosexuality and Western Tradition, pp. 1-28; McNeil, Church and the Homosexual, pp. 42-50; Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, pp. 92-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robgagnon.net/articles/homoBalchHBTReview2.pdf review essay of homosexuality, science, and the &quot;plain sense&quot; of scripture, part 2, Robert A. J. Gagnon]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Now this was the sin of Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. —{{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|16:49-50}}}}

Here the nonsexual view focuses on the inhospitality aspect, while the other notes the description ''detestable'' or ''[[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]]'', the Hebrew word for which often denotes moral sins, including those of a sexual nature.&lt;ref&gt;Lv.18:22; 26-27,29,30; 20:13; Dt. 23:18; 24:4 1Ki. 14:24; Ezek. 22:11; 33:26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Straight &amp; Narrow?: Compassion and Clarity in the Homosexuality Debate, Thomas E. Schmidt&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gospel]] of Matthew (and corresponding verse) when [[Jesus]] warns of a worse judgment for some cities than Sodom, inhospitality is perceived by some as the sin, while others see it fundamentally being impenitence:

{{quote|If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. --{{Bibleref2|Matthew|10:14-15}}}}

The nonsexual view focuses on the cultural importance of hospitality, which this biblical story shares with other ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], where [[hospitality]] was of singular importance and strangers were under the protection of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peck |first=Harry Thurston |authorlink=Harry Thurston Peck |title=Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin//ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0062;query=id%3D%238285;layout=;loc=hospitium-1 |accessdate=2006-03-17 |year=1898 |publisher=Harper and Brothers |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orthodox position does not deny this important cultural aspect, but tends to see the refusal to repent as being the main issue behind Jesus's condemnation, with this being causative of the particular inhospitality shown by the cities Jesus referred to. In addition, they see the information regarding Sodom as best indicating that forced perverse sex was the specific means of inhospitality, and the primary physical sin of Sodom.

===Islamic===
{{Main|Islamic view of Lot}}

The Quran contains seven references to &quot;the people of Lut&quot;, the biblical Lot, but meaning the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah  (references 7:80–84, 11:77–83, 21:74, 22:43, 26:165–175, 27:56–59, and 29:27–33), and their destruction by Allah is associated explicitly with their sexual practices:&lt;ref&gt;Duran (1993) p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MC&quot;&gt;Kligerman (2007) pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'people of Lot' transgressed consciously against the bounds of God. Their avarice led to inhospitality and robbery, which in turn led to the humiliation of strangers by mistreatment and rape. It was their [[Islamic views on sin|abominable sin]] of homosexual sex which was seen as symptomatic of their attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|07|81|82|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cite quran|26|165|166&quot;&gt;{{cite quran|26|165|166|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon Lot's exhorting them to abandon their transgression against God, they ridiculed him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|29|29|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and threatened him with dire consequences;&lt;ref name=&quot;cite quran|26|165|166&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|54|33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|7|80|82|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lot only prayed to God to be saved from doing as they did. Then Gabriel met Lot and said that he must run from the town quickly, as Allah gave this command for Gabriel to give to Lot for saving his life. In the Quran it was written that Lot's wife was killed when she turned her head back to look at the disaster, and that only Lot was saved during the destruction of their town,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|26|168|169|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the understanding that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are identified in Genesis, but &quot;the location remains unnamed in the Qur'an&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=cGqy_OgxNU4C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=lot,+Sodom+and+Gomorrah+in+Quran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wR049CNG30&amp;sig=opwbbg4Ijwu-2PjZV47FNCpWC30&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9x1RUJ7bEIf68gS_6oCYBA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=lot%2C%20Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah%20in%20Quran&amp;f=false] Ishmael Instructs Isaac: An Introduction to the Qurʼan for Bible Readers By John Kaltner - Liturgical Press, 1999 - page 97&lt;/ref&gt;
