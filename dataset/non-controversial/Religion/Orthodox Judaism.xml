'''Orthodox Judaism''' is the approach to religious [[Judaism]] which adheres to the interpretation and application of the laws and ethics of the [[Torah]] as legislated in the [[Talmud]]ic texts by the [[Sanhedrin]] (&quot;[[Oral Torah]]&quot;) and subsequently developed and applied by the later authorities known as the ''[[Gaonim]]'', ''[[Rishonim]]'', and ''[[Acharonim]]''. Orthodox Jews are also called &quot;observant Jews&quot;; Orthodoxy is known also as &quot;Torah Judaism&quot; or &quot;traditional Judaism&quot;. Orthodox Judaism generally refers to [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] but can actually include a wide range of beliefs.

As of 2001, approximately 13 percent of American Jews&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishfederations.org/local_includes/downloads/7579.pdf (Table 2, pg. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; and 25 percent of Israeli Jews were Orthodox.  Among American synagogue members, 27 percent attended Orthodox synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishfederations.org/local_includes/downloads/7579.pdf (Table 9, pg. 25)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Orthodoxy is not a single movement or school of thought. There is no single rabbinic body to which all rabbis are expected to belong, or any one organization representing member congregations. In the United States, there are numerous Orthodox congregational organizations, such as [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]], the [[Orthodox Union]], and the [[National Council of Young Israel]]; none of which can claim to represent a majority of all Orthodox congregations.

The exact forms of what later came to be called Judaism during the times of Moses or during the eras of the ''[[Mishnah]]'' and [[Talmud]] cannot be known today, but Orthodox Jews believe that contemporary Orthodox Judaism maintains the same basic philosophy and legal framework that existed throughout [[Jewish history]], whereas the other denominations depart from it.  Orthodox Judaism, as it exists today, is an outgrowth that claims to extend from the time of Moses, to the time of the ''Mishnah'' and Talmud, through the development of [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]] and [[rabbinic literature]], until the present time.

In response to [[The Age of Enlightenment]], [[Jewish Emancipation]], and ''[[Haskalah]]'', elements within German Jewry sought to reform Jewish belief and practice in the early 19th century. They sought to modernize education in light of contemporary scholarship, they rejected claims of absolute divine authorship of the Torah, declaring only those biblical laws concerning 'ethics' to be binding, and stated that the rest of ''halakha'' (Jewish law) need not be viewed as normative for Jews in wider society. (see [[Reform Judaism]]).

[[File:Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.png|thumb|Rabbi S.R. Hirsch]]
In reaction to the emergence of Reform Judaism, a group of traditionalist German Jews emerged who supported some of the values of the [[Haskalah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Orthodoxy |title=YIVO &amp;#124; Orthodoxy |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but who wanted to defend a conservative, traditional interpretation of Jewish law and tradition. This group was led by those who opposed the establishnent of a new temple in Hamburg [1819] as reflected in the booklet &quot;Ele Divrei HaBerit&quot;. As a group of Reform Rabbis convened in Braunschweig, Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]] of Altona published a manifest in German and Hebrew &quot;Shlomei Emunei Yisrael&quot; having 177 Rabbis signing on. at this time the first Orthodox Jewish periodical was launched &quot;Der Treue Zions Waechter&quot; with the Hebrew supplement &quot;Shomer Zion HaNe'eman&quot; [1845 - 1855]. In later  years it was Rav Ettlinger's students Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] and Rabbi [[Azriel Hildesheimer]] of Berlin who deepened the awareness and strength of Orthodox Jewry. Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch commented in 1854 that&lt;blockquote&gt;It was not the 'Orthodox' Jews who introduced the word 'orthodoxy' into Jewish discussion. It was the modern 'progressive' Jews who first applied this name to 'old', 'backward' Jews as a derogatory term. This name was at first resented by 'old' Jews. And rightly so. 'Orthodox' Judaism does not know any varieties of Judaism. It conceives Judaism as one and indivisible. It does not know a Mosaic, prophetic and  rabbinic Judaism,  nor Orthodox and  Liberal Judaism. It only knows Judaism and non-Judaism. It does not know Orthodox and Liberal Jews. It does indeed know conscientious and indifferent Jews, good Jews, bad Jews or baptised Jews; all, nevertheless, Jews with a mission which they cannot cast off. They are only distinguished accordingly as they fulfil or reject their mission. (Samson Raphael Hirsch, Religion Allied to Progress, in JMW. p. 198)&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok, ''Judaism: history, belief, and practice'', Routledge, 2004, p.264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Hirsch held that Judaism demands an application of Torah thought to the entire realm of human experience&amp;mdash;including the secular disciplines.  His approach was termed the ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' approach, or &quot;neo-Orthodoxy.&quot;  While insisting on strict adherence to Jewish beliefs and practices, he held that Jews should attempt to engage and influence the modern world, and encouraged those secular studies compatible with Torah thought.  This pattern of religious and secular involvement has been evident at many times in Jewish history.  Scholars{{who|date=October 2010}} believe it was characteristic of the Jews in [[Babylon]] during the [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] and [[Geonim|Geonic]] periods, and likewise in early [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|medieval Spain]], shown by their engagement with both Muslim and Christian society.  It appeared as the traditional response to cultural and scientific innovation.

Some scholars believe that [[Modern Orthodoxy]] arose from the religious and social realities of Western European Jewry.  While most Jews consider Modern Orthodoxy traditional today, some{{Who|date=October 2009}} within the Orthodox community groups to its right consider it of questionable validity.  The neo-Orthodox movement holds that Hirsch's views are not accurately followed by Modern Orthodoxy. [See [[Torah im Derech Eretz]] and [[Torah Umadda]] &quot;Relationship with Torah im Derech Eretz&quot; for a more extensive listing.]

In the 20th century, a segment of the Orthodox population (notably as represented by the [[World Agudath Israel]] movement formally established in 1912) disagreed with Modern Orthodoxy and took a stricter approach. Such rabbis viewed innovations and modifications within Jewish law and customs with extreme care and caution.  Some observers and scholars refer to this form of Judaism as [[Haredi Judaism|&quot;Haredi Judaism&quot;, or &quot;Ultra-Orthodox Judaism&quot;]].  The latter term is controversial, and some consider the label &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot; pejorative.

Several media entities refrain from using the term “ultra Orthodox”, including the Religion Newswriters Association; JTA, the global Jewish news service; and the ''Star-Ledger'', New Jersey’s largest daily newspaper, according the New Jersey Press Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;divisive&quot;&gt;[http://www.jstandard.com/index.php/content/item/paper_loses_divisive_term/6507 Josh Lipowsky, &quot;Paper loses 'divisive' term&quot;], ''New Jersey Jewish Standard'', February 5, 2009, pp 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  New Jersey attorney Stephen E. Schwartz, Esq., convinced the ''Star-Ledger'' to become the first mainstream newspaper to drop the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;divisive&quot; /&gt;  Several local Jewish papers, including ''Jewish Week'' in New York and  ''Jewish Exponent'' in [[Philadelphia]] have also dropped use of the term.  According to Rabbi [[Sheldon Engelmayer|Shammai Engelmayer]], spiritual leader of Temple Israel Community Center in Cliffside Park and former executive editor of ''Jewish Week'', this leaves “Orthodox” as “an umbrella term that designates a very widely disparate group of people very loosely tied together by some core beliefs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;divisive&quot; /&gt;

The various approaches have proved resilient.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Some scholars estimate more Jewish men are studying in yeshivot (Talmudical schools) and Kollelim (post-graduate Talmudical colleges for married (male) students) than at any other time in history.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  In 1915 Yeshiva College (later [[Yeshiva University]]) and its [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] was established in [[New York, New York|New York]], New York for training in an Orthodox milieu.  A school branch was established in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], California.  A number of other influential Orthodox seminaries, mostly ''Haredi'', were established throughout the country, most notably in New York, [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland; and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], Illinois.  [[Beth Medrash Govoha]], the Haredi yeshiva in [[Lakewood, New Jersey]] is the largest Talmudic academy in the United States, with a student body of over 5,000 students.

==Diversity within Orthodox Judaism==
Orthodox Judaism's central belief is that Torah, including the Oral Law, was given directly from [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] to Moses and applies in all times and places.  ''Haredi'' Judaism asserts that it may no longer be changed in any fashion.  As a result, all Jews are required to live in accordance with the [[mitzvah|Commandments]] and [[Halakha|Jewish law]].

Since there is no one Orthodox body, there is [[Jewish principles of faith#No formal text canonized|no one canonical statement]] of [[Jewish principles of faith|principles of faith]]. Rather, each Orthodox group claims to be a non-exclusive heir to the received tradition of Jewish theology, while still affirming a literal acceptance of [[Maimonides]]' [[13 Principles of Faith|thirteen principles]].

Given this (relative) philosophic flexibility, variant viewpoints are possible, particularly in areas not explicitly demarcated by the Halakha.  The result is a relatively broad range of ''hashqafoth'' (Sing. ''[[hashkafa]]'' {{lang-he|השקפה}} – [[world view]], Weltanschauung) within Orthodoxy. The greatest differences within strains of Orthodoxy are over:

*the degree to which an Orthodox Jew should integrate and/or disengage from [[secularism|secular society]]
*based on varying interpretations of the [[Three Oaths]], whether [[Zionism]] is part of Judaism or opposed to it, and defining the role of the modern State of Israel in Judaism
*their spiritual approach to Torah such as the relative roles of mainstream [[Talmud]]ic study and [[Hasidic philosophy|mysticism]] or [[Mussar movement|ethics]]
*the validity of secular knowledge including critical Jewish scholarship of [[Rabbinic literature]] and [[Jewish philosophy|modern philosophical]] ideas
*whether [[Torah im Derech Eretz#Earning a livelihood|the Talmudic obligation to learn and practice a trade/profession]] applies in our times
*the centrality of [[yeshiva]]s as the place for personal Torah study
*the validity of authoritative spiritual guidance in areas outside of Halakhic decision ([[Da'as Torah]])
*the importance of maintaining non-Halakhic [[Minhag|customs]], such as dress, language and music
*the [[Role of women in Judaism#Orthodox Judaism|role of women]] in (religious) society
*the nature of the relationship with non-Jews

===Streams of Orthodoxy===
The above differences are realised in the various subgroups of Orthodoxy, which maintain significant social differences, and slight differences in understanding Halakha. These groups, broadly, comprise [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Haredi Judaism]], with most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] groups falling into the latter category.

*Modern Orthodoxy comprises a fairly broad spectrum of movements, each drawing on several distinct, though related, philosophies, which in some combination provide the basis for all variations of the movement today. In general, Modern Orthodoxy holds that Jewish law is [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and binding, while simultaneously attaching a positive value to interaction with contemporary society. In this view, Orthodox Judaism can “be enriched” by its intersection with modernity; further, “modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the Divine work of [[tikkun olam|transforming the world to benefit humanity]]”. At the same time, in order to preserve the integrity of halakha, any area of “powerful inconsistency and conflict” between Torah and modern culture must be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shma.com/feb01/berman.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern Orthodoxy, additionally, assigns a central role to the &quot;People of Israel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=Some%20Comments%20on%20Centrist%20Orthodoxy&amp;hyperlink=lamm21%2Ehtml&amp;type=Document&amp;category=Orthodoxy%20and%20Modernity&amp;authortitle=Rabbi%20Dr&amp;firstname=Norman&amp;lastname=Lamm&amp;pubsource=Tradition%2C%2022%3A3&amp;authorid=285 |title=Rabbi Norman Lamm: Some Comments on Centrist Orthodoxy |publisher=Edah.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Orthodoxy, in general, places a high [[nationalism|national]], as well as religious, significance on the [[State of Israel]], and Modern Orthodox institutions and individuals are, typically, [[Zionist]] in orientation.  It also practices involvement with non-orthodox Jews that extends beyond &quot;[[Baal teshuva#Orthodox outreach organizations|outreach]] ([[Kiruv]])&quot; to continued institutional relations and cooperation; see [[Torah Umadda#Centrality of the People of Israel|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''. Other &quot;core beliefs&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;HelmreichShinnar&quot;&gt;William B. Helmreich and Reuel Shinnar: [http://www.jcpa.org/cjc/jl-383-helmreich.htm Modern Orthodoxy in America: Possibilities for a Movement under Siege]&lt;/ref&gt;  are a recognition of the value and importance of secular studies, a commitment to equality of education for both men and women, and a full acceptance of the importance of being able to financially support oneself and one's family.

*Haredi Judaism advocates segregation from non-Jewish culture, although not from non-Jewish society entirely. It is characterised by its focus on community-wide Torah study. Haredi Orthodoxy's differences with Modern Orthodoxy usually lie in interpretation of the nature of traditional halakhic concepts and in acceptable application of these concepts.  Thus, engaging in the commercial world is a legitimate means to achieving a livelihood, but individuals should participate in modern society as little as possible. The same outlook is applied with regard to obtaining degrees necessary to enter one's intended profession: where tolerated in the Haredi society, attending secular institutions of higher education is viewed as a necessary but inferior activity. Academic interest is instead to be directed toward the religious education found in the yeshiva. Both boys and girls attend school and may proceed to higher Torah study, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18. A significant proportion of students, especially boys, remain in ''yeshiva'' until marriage (which is often arranged through facilitated dating – see [[shiduch]]), and many study in a ''[[kollel]]'' (Torah study institute for married men) for many years after marriage.  Most Orthodox men (including many Modern Orthodox), even those not in Kollel, will study [[Torah]] daily.

*[[Hasidic Judaism]] overlaps significantly with Haredi Judaism in its engagement with the secular and commercial world, and as regards social issues. It differs, however, in its origins and, relatedly, in its focus. The movement originated in [[Eastern Europe]] (what is now [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]) in the 18th century. Founded by [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the Baal Shem Tov (1698–1760), it originated in an age of persecution of the Jewish people, when a schism existed between scholarly and common European Jews.  In addition to bridging this class gap, Hasidic teachings sought to reintroduce joy in the performance of the commandments and in prayer through the popularisation of [[Jewish mysticism]] (this joy had been suppressed in the intense intellectual study of the Talmud).  The ''Ba'al Shem Tov'' sought to combine rigorous scholarship with more emotional mitzvah observance. In a practical sense, what distinguishes Hasidic Judaism from other forms of Haredi Judaism is the close-knit organization of Hasidic communities centered around a [[Rebbe]] (sometimes translated as &quot;Grand Rabbi&quot;), and various customs and modes of dress particular to each community. In some cases there are religious ideological distinctions between Hasidic groups, as well. Another thing that sets Hasidic Judaism apart from general Haredi Judaism is the strong emphasis placed on speaking [[Yiddish]]. In Hasidic households and communities Yiddish is spoken exclusively.

===In practice===
[[File:Talmud set.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Babylonian Talmud]]
For guidance in practical application of Jewish law, the majority of Orthodox Jews appeal to the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (&quot;Code of Jewish Law&quot; composed in the 16th century by Rabbi [[Joseph Caro]]) together with its surrounding commentaries.  Thus, at a general level, there is a large degree of uniformity amongst all Orthodox Jews.  Concerning the details, however, there is often variance: [[posek|decisions]] may be based on various of the [[Halakha#Codes of Jewish law|standardized codes of Jewish Law]] that have been developed over the centuries, as well as on the various ''[[responsa]]''.  These codes and responsa may differ from each other as regards detail (and reflecting the above differences, on the weight assigned to various issues).  By and large, however, the differences result from the [[Diaspora|historic dispersal of the Jews]] and the consequent development of differences among regions in their practices (see [[minhag]]).

*[[Mizrahi]] and [[Sephardi]]c Orthodox Jews base their practice on the ''Shulchan Aruch''. The recent works of Halakha, ''[[Kaf HaChaim]]'', ''[[Ben Ish Chai]]'' and ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' are considered authoritative in many Sephardic communities.  Thus Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews may choose to follow the opinion of the ''[[Ben Ish Chai]]'' when it conflicts with the ''Shulchan Aruch''.  Some of these practices are derived from the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] school of [[Isaac Luria]].
*[[Ashkenazi]]c Orthodox Jews have traditionally based most of their practices on the ''Rema'', the [[gloss]] on the ''Shulchan Aruch'' by Rabbi [[Moses Isserles]], reflecting differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardi custom.  In the post-World War II period, the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'' has become authoritative.  Ashkenazi Jews may choose to follow the ''[[Mishna Brurah]]'' instead of a particular detail of Jewish law as presented in the ''Shulchan Aruch''.
*[[Chabad]] [[Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] and many other Hasidic sects generally follow the rulings of [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] in the ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''.
*Traditional [[Yemenite Jews#Religious groups|Baladi]] and [[Dor Daim]] ([[Yemenite Jews]]) base most of their practices on the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', the compendium by [[Maimonides]] of halakha, written several centuries before the ''Shulchan Aruch''. The ''[[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|Talmidei haRambam]]'' also keep Jewish law as codified in the ''Mishneh Torah''.
*A smaller number, such as the [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] Jews, traditionally rule according to the ''[[Jerusalem Talmud]]'' over the ''[[Talmud Bavli|Babylonian Talmud]]''.
*[[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] consider the Shulchan Aruch as authoritative, but differ from other Sephardim by making less allowance for more recent authorities, in particular customs based on the [[Kabbalah]].  Some customs are based on Maimonides or the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]''.

Orthodox Judaism emphasizes practicing rules of [[Kashrut]], [[Shabbat]], [[Family Purity]], and [[Tefilah]] (Prayer).

Externally, Orthodox Jews can often be identified by their manner of dress and family lifestyle.  Orthodox women will traditionally dress modestly by keeping most of their skin covered. Additionally, most married women will cover their hair, most commonly in the form of a scarf, also in the form of hats, bandannas, or, sometimes, wigs.  Orthodox men traditionally wear a skullcap known as a ''[[kipa]]'' and often fringes called &quot;[[tzitzit]]&quot;.  Ashkenazi ''Haredi'' men often grow beards, wear black hats and suits, indoors and outdoors.

Orthodox Judaism is composed of different groups with intertwining beliefs, practices and theologies, although in their core beliefs, all Orthodox movements share the same principles.

Orthodoxy collectively considers itself the only true heir to the Jewish tradition. The Orthodox Jewish movements generally consider all non-Orthodox Jewish movements to be unacceptable deviations from authentic Judaism; both because of other denominations' doubt concerning the verbal revelation of Written and Oral Torah, and because of their rejection of Halakhic precedent as binding. As such, Orthodox groups characterise non-Orthodox forms of Judaism as heretical; see the article on [[Relationships between Jewish religious movements]].

Orthodox Judaism affirms [[monotheism]], or the belief in one God. Among the in-depth explanations of that belief are [[Maimonides|Maimonidean]] rationalism, [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic mysticism]], and [[Chassidic Philosophy]] (Chassidut). A few affirm self-limited omniscience (the theology elucidated by [[Gersonides]] in &quot;The Wars of the Lord&quot;.)

Orthodox Judaism maintains the historical understanding of Jewish identity. A Jew is someone who was born to a Jewish mother, or who converts to Judaism in accordance with Jewish law and tradition.  Orthodoxy thus rejects [[patrilineal descent]] as a means of establishing Jewish national identity. Similarly, Orthodoxy strongly condemns [[interreligious marriage|intermarriage]]. Intermarriage is seen as a deliberate rejection of Judaism, and an intermarried person is effectively cut off from most of the Orthodox community. However, some Orthodox Jewish organizations do reach out to intermarried Jews.

Orthodox Judaism holds that the words of the Torah, including both the Written Law  ([[Pentateuch]]) and those parts of the Oral Law which are ''halacha leMoshe m'Sinai'', were dictated by God to Moses essentially as they exist today. The laws contained in the Written Torah were given along with detailed explanations as how to apply and interpret them, the Oral Law. Although Orthodox Jews believe that many elements of current religious law were decreed or added as &quot;fences&quot; around the law by the rabbis, all Orthodox Jews believe that there is an underlying core of Sinaitic law and that this core of the religious laws Orthodox Jews know today is thus directly derived from Sinai and directly reflects the Divine will. As such, Orthodox Jews believe that one must be extremely careful in interpreting Jewish law. Orthodox Judaism holds that, given Jewish law's Divine origin, no underlying principle may be compromised in accounting for changing political, social or economic conditions; in this sense, &quot;creativity&quot; and development in Jewish law is limited.

However, there is significant disagreement within Orthodox Judaism, particularly between Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism, about the extent and circumstances under which the proper application of Halakha should be re-examined as a result of changing realities. As a general rule, Haredi Jews believe that when at all possible the law should be maintained as it was understood by their authorities at the [[haskalah]], believing that it had never changed. Modern Orthodox authorities are more willing to assume that under scrupulous examination, identical principles may lead to different applications in the context of modern life. To the Orthodox Jew, halakha is a guide, God's Law, governing the structure of daily life from the moment he or she wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep. It includes codes of behaviour applicable to a broad range of circumstances (and many hypothetical ones). There are though a number of meta-principles that guide the halakhic process and in an instance of opposition between a specific halakha and a meta-principle, the meta-principle often wins out. Examples of Halachic Meta-Principles are: ''Deracheha Darchei Noam''-the ways of Torah are pleasant, ''Kavod Habriyot''-basic respect for human beings, ''Pikuach Nefesh''-the sanctity of human life.

Orthodox Judaism holds that on [[Mount Sinai]] the Written Law was transmitted along with an Oral Law. The words of the Torah (Pentateuch) were [[Revelation|spoken to Moses by God]]; the laws contained in this Written Torah, [[613 mitzvot|the ''Mitzvot'']], were given along with detailed explanations in the oral tradition as to how to apply and interpret them. Furthermore, the Oral law includes principles designed to create new rules. The Oral law is held to be transmitted with an extremely high degree of accuracy. Jewish theologians, who choose to emphasize the more evolutionary nature of the Halacha point to a famous story in the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l52.htm |title=בבלי – מסכת מנחות |publisher=Mechon-mamre.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Moses]] is miraculously transported to the House of Study of [[Rabbi Akiva]] and is clearly unable to follow the ensuing discussion.

According to Orthodox Judaism, Jewish law today is based on the commandments in the Torah, as viewed through the discussions and debates contained in classical rabbinic literature, especially the Mishnah and the Talmud. Orthodox Judaism thus holds that the halakha represents the &quot;will of God&quot;, either directly, or as closely to directly as possible. The laws are from the word of God in the Torah, using a set of rules also revealed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, and have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care, and thus the Oral Law is considered to be no less the word of God. If some of the details of Jewish law may have been lost over the millennia, they were reconstructed in accordance with internally consistent rules; see [[Halakha#Rules by which early Jewish law was derived|The 13 rules by which Jewish law was derived]].

In this world view, the Mishnaic and Talmudic rabbis are closer to the Divine revelation; by corollary, one must be extremely conservative in changing or adapting Jewish law. Furthermore, Orthodox Judaism holds that, given Jewish law's Divine origin, no underlying principle may be compromised in accounting for changing political, social or economic conditions; in this sense, &quot;creativity&quot; and development in Jewish law is held to have been limited. Orthodox Jews will also study the Talmud for its own sake; this is considered to be the greatest [[mitzvah]] of all; see Torah study.

Haredi and Modern Orthodox Judaism vary somewhat in their view of the validity of Halakhic reconsideration. It is held virtually as a principle of belief among many Haredi Jews that halakhah never changes. Haredi Judaism thus views higher criticism of the Talmud as inappropriate, and almost certainly heretical. At the same time, many self-proclaimed Modern Orthodox Jews do not have a problem with historical scholarship in this area. See the entry on [[Attacks on the Talmud|historical analysis of the Talmud]].

Some Modern Orthodox Jews are also somewhat more willing to consider revisiting questions of Jewish law through Talmudic arguments. Although in practice such instances are rare, they do exist. Notable examples include acceptance of rules permitting farming during the [[Shmita]] year and permitting the advanced religious education of women.

==Orthodox movements, organizations and groups==

*[[Agudath Israel of America]] is the largest and most influential Haredi organization in America. Its roots go back to the establishment of the original founding of the Agudath Israel movement in 1912 in Katowitz, [[Prussia]] (now [[Katowice]], [[Poland]]). The American Agudath Israel was founded in 1939. There is an [[Agudat Israel]] (Hasidic) in Israel, and also [[Degel HaTorah]] (non-Hasidic &quot;[[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]]&quot;), as well as an [[Agudath Israel of Europe]]. These groups are loosely affiliated through the [[World Agudath Israel]], which from time to time holds a major gathering in Israel called a ''knessia''. Agudah unites many rabbinic leaders from the Hasidic Judaism wing with those of the non-Hasidic &quot;yeshiva&quot; world. It is generally non-nationalistic and ambivalent towards the modern [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Aguddah.html Agudath Yisrael] [http://www.shemayisrael.com/chareidi/archives5761/behar/adinner.htm More on Agudath Yisrael]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, known as the [[Orthodox Union]], or &quot;OU&quot;, and the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], &quot;RCA&quot; are organizations that represent Modern Orthodox Judaism, a large segment of Orthodoxy in the United States and Canada. These groups should not be confused with the similarly named [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] (described below).

*The [[National Council of Young Israel]], and the [[Council of Young Israel Rabbis]] are smaller groups that were founded as Modern Orthodox organizations, are Zionistic, and are in the right wing of Modern Orthodox Judaism. Young Israel strongly supports and allies itself with the settlement movement in Israel. While the lay membership of synagogues affiliated with the NCYI are almost exclusively Modern Orthodox in orientation, the rabbinical leadership of the synagogues ranges from Modern Orthodox to Haredi.

*The [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/gov/relaffs.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded with the intention of  representing all of Judaism within the State of Israel, and has two chief rabbis: One is Ashkenazic (of the East European and Russian Jewish tradition) and one is Sephardic (of the Mediterranean, North African, Central Asian, Middle-Eastern and of [[Caucasus]] Jewish tradition.) The rabbinate has never been accepted by most Israeli Haredi groups. Since the 1960s the Chief rabbinate of Israel has moved somewhat closer to the positions of Haredi Judaism.

*[[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]], and political parties such as [[Mafdal]] and [[National Union (Israel)]] all represent certain sectors within  the [[Religious Zionist]] movement, both in diaspora and Israel. The defunct&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica: Volume 8, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gush Emunim]], [[Meimad]], [[Tzohar]], [[Hazit]] and other movements represent over competing divisions within the sector. They firmly believe in the 'Land Of Israel for the People of Israel according to the principles Torah of Israel.', although [[Meimad]] are pragmatic about such programme. [[Gush Emunim]] are the settlement wing of [[National Union (Israel)]] and support widespread kiruv as well, through such institutions as [[Machon Meir]], [[Merkaz HaRav]] and Rabbi [[Shlomo Aviner]]. Another sector includes the [[Hardal]] faction, which tends to be unallied to the Government and quite centristic.

*[[Chabad Lubavitch]] is a branch of Hasidic Judaism widely known for its emphasis on [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|outreach]] and education. The organization has been in existence for 200 years, and especially after the Second World War, it began sending out emissaries (''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]]'') who have as a mission the bringing back of disaffected Jews to a level of observance consistent with authentic and proper norms (i.e., Orthodox Judaism). They are major players in what is known as the ''[[Baal teshuva|Baal Teshuva]]'' movement. Their mandate is to make nonobservant Jews more observant. Certain beliefs regarding the status of their past leader, and several of their outreach tactics and theology make them controversial in other orthodox groups.

*In Israel although it shares a similar agenda with the Sephardic [[Shas]] political party, Shas is more bipartisan when it comes to its own issues and non-nationalistic-based with a huge emphasis on [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Judaism. Shas has its own positions and plays a more prominent role in the government of the State, usually having something to say about almost every Jewish issue. It is usually in fierce contention with Agudat Yisrael in Israel.

*The Agudath HaRabbonim, also known as the [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] of the United States and Canada, is a small Haredi-leaning organization founded in 1902. It should not be confused with &quot;The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America&quot; (see above) which is a separate organization. While at one time influential within Orthodox Judaism, the Agudath HaRabbonim in the last several decades has progressively moved further to the right; its membership has been dropping and it has been relatively inactive. Some of its members are rabbis from Chabad Lubavitch; some are also members of the RCA (see above). It is currently most famous for its 1997 declaration (citing Israeli Chief Rabbi [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]] and Orthodox Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]) that the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movements are &quot;not Judaism at all.&quot;

*The [[Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada]] (CRC) was established in 1952. It is an [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]], Haredi organization, closely aligned with the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidic group, which has about 100,000 adherents (an unknown number of which are rabbis), and like-minded Haredi groups.

*The [[Halachic Organ Donor Society]] was formed in 2001 with mission of trying to increase organ donation from Jews to the general public (including to non-Jews). To date (2011), it has so far saved more than 200 lives, it has enlisted more than 200 [http://www.hods.org/english/about/rabbisE.asp Orthodox rabbis] to get organ donor cards, it has educated via its [http://www.hods.org/English/lecturesE.asp lecture series] more than 25,000 Jews around the world.

*The left-wing Modern Orthodox advocacy group, [[Edah]], formed from United States Modern Orthodox rabbis. Most of its membership came from synagogues affiliated with the Union of Orthodox Congregations and RCA (above). Their motto was, &quot;The courage to be Modern and Orthodox&quot;. Edah ceased operations in 2007 and merged some of its programs into the left-wing [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]].

*The [[Beis Yaakov]] educational movement, begun in 1917, introduced the concept of formal Judaic schooling for Orthodox women.
