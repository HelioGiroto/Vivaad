'''Criticism of religion''' is [[criticism]] of the concepts, doctrines, validity, and/or practices of [[religion]], including associated political and social implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Beckford|first=James A.|title=Social Theory and Religion| year=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-77431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Religious criticism has a long history. It goes at least as far back as the 5th century BCE in [[ancient Greece]] with [[Diagoras of Melos|Diagoras &quot;the atheist&quot; of Melos]], and the 1st century BCE in [[ancient Rome]] with [[Titus Lucretius Carus]]' ''[[De Rerum Natura]]''. It continues to the present day with the advent of [[New Atheism]], represented by authors and journalists such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Victor J. Stenger]], and the late [[Christopher Hitchens]]. Alternatively, &quot;religious criticism&quot; has been used by the literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] to describe a mode of religious discussion that is secular but not inherently anti-religion. Criticism of religion is complicated by the fact that there exist multiple definitions and concepts of religion in different cultures and languages. With the existence of diverse categories of religion such as [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], [[nontheistic religions|nontheism]] and diverse specific religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and many others; it is not always clear to whom the criticisms are aimed at or to what extent they are applicable to other religions.

Critics often consider religion to be outdated, harmful to the individual, harmful to society, an impediment to the progress of [[science]], encouraging of immoral acts or customs, and a political tool of social control.

==History==
The 1st century [[BCE]] Roman poet, [[Titus Lucretius Carus]], in his work ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'', wrote: &quot;But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men:&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |author=Titus Lucretius Carus| authorlink=Titus Lucretius Carus |title=De Rerum Natura |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A philosopher of the [[Epicurean]] school, Lucretius believed the world was composed solely of matter and void, and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Lucretius, like [[Epicurus]], felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lucretiu.htm |title=Lucretius (c.99&amp;nbsp;– c.55 BCE) |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did believe in gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford - Lucretius&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucretius – Stanford Encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion which he saw as superstition for teaching that gods interfered with the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latin-English: On Nature&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Nature of Things Translated by W.H.D. Rouse|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-99200-8|author=Lucretius|page=8|quote=This (superstition) or &quot;false religion&quot;, not &quot;religion,&quot; is the meaning of &quot;religio&quot;. The Epicureans were opposed, not to religion (cf. 6.68–79), but to traditional religion which taught that the gods govern the world. That Lucretius regarded &quot;religio&quot; as synonymous with &quot;superstitio&quot; is implied by &quot;super....instans&quot; in [line] 65.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], at the beginning of the [[16th century]] said: &quot;We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn014044534x&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author= Middlemore, S. G. C.; Burckhardt, Jacob; Murray, Peter; Burke, Peter |title=The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy |publisher=Penguin Classics |location= |year= 1990| pages= |isbn=0-14-044534-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Machiavelli, religion was merely a tool, useful for a ruler wishing to manipulate public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm |title=[[The Prince]] | first= Nicolo |last= Machiavelli | year = 1532| accessdate=2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 18th century [[Voltaire]] was a [[deism|deist]] and was strongly critical of religious intolerance.  Voltaire complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for not being baptised.  Voltaire claimed the real reason for these killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed.  Voltaire was also critical of [[Muslim]] intolerance. &lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/volrelig.html Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Also in the 18th century [[David Hume]] criticised teleological arguments for religion.  Hume claimed that natural explanations for the order in the [[universe]] were reasonable, see [[David Hume#Design argument|Design argument]].  Demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion was an important aim of Hume's writings.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ Hume on Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent times==
In the early 21st century the [[New Atheists]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]], were prominent as critics of religion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David|title=What are the merits of recent claims by atheistic scholars that modern science proves religion to be false and vain?|url=http://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/theology/atheists.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Atheists|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Austin Cline, criticism of religion from atheists is very unwelcome while comparable defense of religion by others is more tolerated. Cline believes this defensiveness happens because wider awareness of criticisms might cause a greater decrease in religious beliefs than has already occurred. &lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/b/2007/06/03/madeleine-bunting-atheists-shouldnt-criticize-religion.htm Madeleine Bunting: Atheists Shouldn't Criticize Religion, By Austin Cline]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of religious concepts==

[[File:Imagine no religion.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A sign that criticizes religion and draws attention to the [[September 11 attacks]], by the Connecticut Valley Atheists in Rockville's Central Park, [[Vernon, Connecticut|Vernon]] in December 2007. The group issued an explanatory press release, stating: &quot;Clearly, 9/11 is the work of fanatics. However, we feel that religion even in moderation provides a foundation for fanatical groups to thrive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvatheists.org/news/?p=1 &quot;The Vernon Atheist Display,&quot;] Press Release, CT Valley Atheists, December 17, 2007 . Retrieved October 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Some criticisms have been aimed at theistic religions such as :

* Religions sometimes posit facts that are conflict with certain scientific models or findings (e.g. [[evolution]], [[cosmology|origin of the universe]], [[miracles]]); for example, the claim that prayer has a beneficial effect on others has been disputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;sevenseven&quot;/&gt;
* Religions often require behaviors that are not sensible (such as the [[Old Testament]] prohibition against wearing garments of mixed fabrics, or punishing children of guilty parents).&lt;ref name=garments&gt;{{Cite book |title=God is Not Great |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens  | publisher=Random House, Inc. |year= 2007 |page=99 |isbn=0-7710-4142-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Religions often contain multiple conflicting accounts (for example, [[Internal consistency of the Bible|discrepancies in the Bible]] among the four [[Gospels]] of the [[New Testament]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman; [[Misquoting Jesus]], 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament: its transmission, corruption, and restoration'', pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E. Brown | title=The Birth of the Messiah: a commentary on the infancy narratives in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke|series=The Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library | date=1999-05-18 | publisher=Yale University Press | location= | isbn=0-300-14008-8 | page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterarguments against assumed conflict between the sciences and religions have been offered. For example, [[C. S. Lewis]], a Christian, suggested that all religions, by definition, involve faith, or a belief in concepts that cannot be proven or disproven by the sciences. However, some religious beliefs have not been in line with views of the scientific community, for instance [[Young Earth creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution%20statement.pdf|title=IAP Statement on the teaching of evolution|year=2006|publisher=the Interacademy Panel on international issues|accessdate = 2007-07-03|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070701142913/http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution+statement.pdf |archivedate = 2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some who criticize religions subscribe to the [[conflict thesis]], others do not. For example, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] agrees with C. S. Lewis and suggested that religion and science were [[non-overlapping magisteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gould, Stephen Jay |title=[[Rocks of Ages|Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]] |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year= 2002|pages= |isbn=0-345-45040-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist Richard Dawkins has said that religious practitioners often do not believe in the view of [[non-overlapping magisteria]] (NOMA).&lt;ref name=&quot;sevenseven&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|title=The God Delusion|edition=Paperback|year=2007|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicting claims of &quot;one true faith&quot;===
{{See also|Argument from inconsistent revelations}}
In the context of theistic belief, Stephen Roberts has claimed that he dismisses all gods in the same way others dismiss all other gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Like Rolling Uphill: realizing the honesty of atheism | first=Dianna | last=Narciso | isbn=1-932560-74-2 | page=6 | year=2003 | publisher=Llumina Press | location=Coral Springs, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey research from the US indicates that many people change their religious affiliation over time. Those with no religious affiliation are the fastest growing group. However, this group has a relatively low retention rate (46%) when compared to other groups. Such data suggest that significant numbers of people do not believe consistently that a single faith is uniquely true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf &quot;Changes in Americans’ Religious Affiliation,&quot;] ''U.S. Religious Landscape Survey: Chapter 2'', Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life, [[Pew Research Center]], February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of permanence===
Opsopaus and Hitchens note obsolete religions — which no longer have active adherents — are evidence that religions are not everlasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Opsopaus | first =John | authorlink =  | title =The Art of Haruspicy | work = | publisher = | date = | url =http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/Har.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Including [[Greek mythology]], [[Millerism]], [[Roman mythology]], [[Sabbatai Sevi]], and [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God is Not Great| first= Christopher| last=Hitchens | pages=169–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short work &quot;The Syrian Goddess&quot; by the ancient author [[Lucian of Samosata]] provides many examples of once thriving religions that had gone out of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 =Herbert A. | authorlink = | first2 =John | last2=Garstang | title =The Syrian Goddess | publisher = | year =1913 | location = | pages = | url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/index.htm | doi = | id = | last =1=Strong | unused_data =last 1=Strong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Development of religion}}

Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens, assert that theist religions and their scriptures are not divinely inspired, but man made to fulfill [[society|social]], [[biological]], and [[political]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=0-7139-9789-3|first=Daniel|last=Dennett|authorlink=Daniel Dennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The End of Faith]]|publisher=W.

===Narratives to provide comfort and meaning===

[[Daniel Dennett]] has argued that, with the exception of more modern religions such as [[Raëlism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Scientology]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dennett, Daniel Clement |title=Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon |publisher=Viking Adult |location= |year= 2006|pages= |isbn=0-670-03472-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies.  Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s, and the appearance of [[comet]]s (forms of  [[astrology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =When solar fears eclipse reason | work = | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-03-28 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm | doi = | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Comets in Ancient Cultures | work = | publisher =NASA | date = | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/media/f_ancient.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given current understanding of the physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically; Hitchens, Dawkins, and Onfray contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems is irrational and no longer useful.&lt;ref name=godisnotgreat&gt;{{Cite book| last=Hitchens | first=Christopher | authorlink=Christopher Hitchens | coauthors= | title=[[God is not Great|God is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]] | publisher= Twelve| year=2007 | location= New York| pages= | url= | doi= | isbn= 978-0-446-57980-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The God Delusion&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-55970-820-4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Onfray, Michel |authorlink=Michel Onfray |title=Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location= |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-55970-820-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opium of the people====
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Karl Marx]]]]
{{quotation|Religious suffering is, at the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]].|[[Karl Marx]]&lt;ref name=&quot;critright&quot;/&gt;}}

According to [[Karl Marx]], religion is a tool utilized by the [[ruling class]]es whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their [[capitalist]] economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as [[escapism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;critright&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx |chapter=Introduction | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right | publisher =Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher | month =February | year =1844 | location = | pages = | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx also viewed the Christian doctrine of [[original sin]] as being deeply [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable &quot;sinfulness&quot; of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which, Marx argued, can be changed through the application of collective social planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx | coauthors = | title =Das Kapital | publisher = | year =1867 | location =  | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm | doi = | id = | nopp =true| page =Volume 1, Part VIII  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses of the mind===
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Dawkins]], author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'' ]]
In his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] coined the term [[memes]] to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally, analogous to genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =[[The Selfish Gene]], 30th Anniversary edition  | publisher =  | year =2006 | location = | pages = | url =  | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later used this concept in the essay &quot;[[Viruses of the Mind]]&quot; to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Viruses of the Mind | work = | publisher = | year =1991 | url =http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Dawkins/viruses-of-the-mind.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] criticized the idea that &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot; are viruses of the mind, suggesting that Dawkins' &quot;account of religious motivation ... is ... far removed from evidence and data&quot; and that, even if the God-meme approach were valid, &quot;it does not give rise to one set of consequences ... Out of the many behaviours it produces, why are we required to isolate only those that might be regarded as diseased?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In his 1992–93 [[Gresham College]] lectures, written in collaboration with the psychiatrist Quinton Deeley and published as ''Is God a Virus?'', SPCK, 1995, 274 pp. The quotes here come from p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alister McGrath]] has responded by arguing that &quot;memes have no place in serious scientific reflection&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.125, quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] in support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.126&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;evolution&quot; of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than Darwinian,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' pp.137–138&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that &quot;[i]f religion is reported as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.136, citing [[Harold G. Koenig|Koenig]] and Cohen, ''The Link between Religion and Health'', OUP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness or delusion===
[[File:Bodies at Jonestown.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bodies recovered from the [[Jonestown]] massacre, in which members of a religious cult committed a mass murder/suicide]]
[[Richard Dawkins]] argues that religious belief often involves [[delusion]]al behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;The God Delusion&quot; /&gt; Others such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] compares religion to mental illness, saying it &quot;allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them ''holy''.&quot;&lt;!--Italicized in original--&gt;&lt;ref name=endoffaith&gt;{{Cite book| last=Harris | first=Sam | authorlink =Sam Harris (author) | title=The End of Faith | publisher=W.W.

[[Keith Ward]] in his book ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'' addresses the claim that religious belief is a [[delusion]]. He quotes the definition in the ''Oxford Companion to Mind'' as &quot;a fixed, idiosyncratic belief, unusual in the culture to which the person belongs,&quot; and notes that &quot;[n]ot all false opinions are delusions.&quot;  Ward then characterizes a delusion as a &quot;clearly false opinion, especially as a symptom of a mental illness,&quot; an &quot;irrational belief&quot; that is &quot;so obviously false that all reasonable people would see it as mistaken.&quot; He then says that belief in God is different, since &quot;[m]ost great philosophers have believed in God, and they are rational people&quot;.  He argues that &quot;[a]ll that is needed to refute the claim that religious belief is a delusion is one clear example of someone who exhibits a high degree of rational ability, who functions well in the ordinary affairs of life ... and who can produce a reasonable and coherent defense of their beliefs&quot; and claims that there are many such people, &quot;including some of the most able philosophers and scientists in the world today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Ward | first =Keith | authorlink =Keith Ward | title =Is Religion Dangerous? | publisher = Lion| year =2006 | location =London:Lion Hudson Plc | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-7459-5262-8 | page =172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immature stage of societal development===
&lt;!--religions&quot; subsection, placed here for better vertical alignment.--&gt;
[[File:Daniel Huntington Philosophy and Christian Art.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Natural philosophy|Philosophy]] and [[Christian Art]]. W. Ridgway, 1878]]

Philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] posited that many societal constructs pass through [[Law of three stages|three stages]], and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages by stating: &quot;From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subject, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions – each branch of our knowledge – passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive.&quot;

==Harm to individuals==
Some have criticized the effects of adherence to dangerous practices such self-sacrifice,&lt;ref name=&quot;self-sacrifice&quot;&gt;Branden, N. (1963), &quot;Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrifice,&quot; Ayn Rand – The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as unnatural restrictions on human behavior (such as [[teetotalism]] and [[Religion and sexuality|sexual prohibitions]]) and claim that these result in mental and emotional trauma of fear and guilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchins&quot; /&gt;

===Indoctrination of children===
{{See also|Indoctrination|Mind control|Religion and children}}
In the 19th century, Philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that teaching some ideas to children at a young age could foster resistance to doubting those ideas later on.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence.&quot;- Arthur Schopenhauer -''On Religion: A Dialogue''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]], use the term [[child abuse]] to describe the harm that some religious upbringings inflict on children which include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Dawkins&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Richard Dawkins | title=The God Delusion | chapter=Childhood, abuse and the escape from religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Christopher |last=Hitchens| title=God is Not Great| chapter=Is Religion Child Abuse?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fear of punishment, such as eternal damnation in a fiery hell
* Guilt about sexual urges
* Depriving children the opportunity to make their own free inquiry later, when they are mature, due to indoctrination

Dawkins states that he is angered by the labels &quot;Muslim child&quot; or &quot;Catholic child&quot;. He asks how a young child can be considered intellectually mature enough to have such independent views on the cosmos and humanity’s place within it. By contrast, Dawkins points out, no reasonable person would speak of a &quot;[[Marxism|Marxist]] child&quot; or a &quot;[[Tory]] child&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Dawkins&quot;/&gt; He suggests there is little controversy over such labeling because of the &quot;weirdly privileged status of religion&quot;.

On several occasions Dawkins has also made the controversial claim that sexually abusing a child is &quot;arguably less&quot; damaging than &quot;the long term psychological damage inflicted by bringing up a child Catholic in the first place&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Dawkins&quot; /&gt; This claim was later rebutted by [[Theodore Beale]] who wrote that Dawkins &quot;first provides anecdotal information from one woman who was raised Catholic, was sexually abused by a priest, and later had nightmares about Hell....Despite posing the proposition as a comparison, Dawkins does not bother to consider what, if any, the negative effects of childhood sexual trauma might happen to be&quot; and notes that &quot;half&quot; of the anecdotes Dawkins cites in favour of his case &quot;aren't even related to Catholicism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Vox|title=The Irrational Atheist|year=2008|publisher=Benbella Books, inc|pages=146–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beale cites several studies that attribute suicide to childhood sexual abuse rather than to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dr Jonathan R.T.|first=Davidson|coauthors=D.C.

===Jerusalem syndrome===
{{Main|Jerusalem syndrome}}
Jerusalem has lent its name to a unique psychological phenomenon where Jewish or Christian individuals who develop obsessive religious themed ideas or delusions (sometimes believing themselves to be Jesus Christ or another prophet) will feel compelled to travel to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome: Jewish Virtual Library|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jersynd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome|url=http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/show/features/2000/20000603/jerusalem.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt about normal sexual functions===
{{See also|Religion and sexuality}}

Hitchens asserts that some religions view some types of natural sexual activity (such as [[masturbation]]) as evil or immoral, and that this view can sometimes lead to [[neuroses]] or other ill effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchins&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=God is Not Great |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens | pages=205–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Darrel Ray who has worked as a clinical psychologist and occupational psychologist arranged a survey over sex and religion.  Ray claims his respondents generally indicate their sex lives improved after they abandoned religion.  Respondents whose previous religion was [[Mormon]]ism were most likely to report improved sex after deconversion.  [[Baptist]], [[Jehovah's Witness]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Seventh Day Adventist]] were also likely to report improved sex lives after abandoning their religion because those religions like Mormonism promote guilt over sex. However, his study was not peer reviewed and was allegedly not up to social science standards. &lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Health/atheists-best-sex-lives-claims-kansas-psychologists-survey/story?id=13679076#.UI0jLoZ_Whk Atheists Have Best Sex Lives, Claims Psychologist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens and Dawkins say that religions do tremendous harm to society in three ways:&lt;ref name=godisnotgreat /&gt; {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref name=&quot;The God Delusion&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

* Religions sometimes encourage war (Crusades, Jihad) , violence, and terrorism to promote their religious goals
* Religious leaders contribute to secular wars and terrorism by endorsing or supporting the violence
* Religious fervor is exploited by secular leaders to support war and terrorism

Although the causes of terrorism are complex, it may be that terrorists are partially reassured by their religious views that God is on their side and will reward them in heaven for punishing unbelievers.&lt;ref name=juerg /&gt;&lt;ref name=chrjhd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp |title=Christian Jihad: The Crusades and Killing in the Name of Christ |publisher=Cbn.com |date=1998-02-23 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suppression of scientific progress===
[[File:Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Galileo]] facing the [[Roman Inquisition]]]]
Early modern atheism developed in the 17th century, and Winfried Schroeder, a scholar of atheism, noted that science during this time did not strengthen the case for atheism.&lt;ref name=&quot;atheism science&quot; /&gt; In the 18th century, [[Denis Diderot]] argued that atheism was less scientific than metaphysics.&lt;ref name=&quot;atheism science&quot; /&gt; However, since the 19th century, both atheists and theists have said that science supports their worldviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;atheism science&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Atheism and Science|url=http://www.investigatingatheism.info/science.html#fn1|publisher=Investigating Atheism project - Cambridge and Oxford|quote=Atheists have appealed to science in defence of their atheism since the first avowedly atheistic manuscripts of the mid seventeenth century. However, as the German expert on atheism Winfried Schroeder has shown, the relationship between early modern atheism and science tended to embarrass rather than strengthen the fledgling atheism's case.[1]&quot; ; &quot;The renowned Denis Diderot, atheist and deist in turns, could still say in 1746 that science posed a greater threat to atheism than metaphysics.[3] Well into the eighteenth century it could be argued that it was atheism and not theism which required a sacrifice of the intellect. As Schroeder has pointed out, atheists were scientifically retrograde until at least the mid eighteenth century, and suffered from their reputation as scientifically unserious.[4]&quot; ; &quot;As John Hedley Brooke has pointed out, for every nineteenth century person considering these issues who followed figures such as Thomas Henry Huxley or Francis Galton in regarding evolution as devastating for religious belief, there were others, such as the Oxford theologian Aubrey Moore, who regarded Darwin's evolutionary theory as an opportunity for religion.[7]At the beginning of the twenty first century the situation remains very similar:.. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John William Draper]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], authors of the [[conflict thesis]], have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, [[morality]], origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective, and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress. Examples cited in their writings include the [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]] and [[Giordano Bruno]]'s execution.

During the 19th century the [[conflict thesis]] developed. According to this model, any interaction between religion and science must inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=David B.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|chapter=The Historiography of Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical conflict thesis was a popular [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its original form is almost entirely discarded by scholars today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Colin A.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|page=7|chapter=The Conflict Thesis |quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapin1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

===Morality===
{{See also|Human sacrifice|Honor killing|Morality and religion|Religious intolerance}}

Albert Einstein stated that no religious basis is needed in order to display ethical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Religion and Science| last=Einstein| first=Albert| work=New York Times Magazine| date=1930-11-09|newspaper=New York Times Magazine|quote=A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Peace laureate, Muslim, and human rights activist [[Shirin Ebadi]] has criticized dogmatic [[Islam]] as morally deficient, arguing that it elevates to [[morality|moral]] status many ancient and ill-informed rules that may have been designed for reasons of [[hygiene]], politics, or other reasons in a bygone era.&lt;ref&gt;Ebadi has spoken out against undemocratic Islamic countries justifying &quot;oppressive acts&quot; in the name of Islam. Speaking at the Earth Dialogues 2006 conference in Brisbane, Ebadi said her native [[Iran]] as well as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Yemen]] &quot;among others&quot; were guilty of human rights violations. &quot;In these countries, Islamic rulers want to solve 21st century issues with laws belonging to 14 centuries ago,&quot; she said. &quot;Their views of human rights are exactly the same as it was 1400 years ago.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2008}}&lt;!--What we have in this reference looks like it's all dealing with the application of sharia in conservative Muslim states, rather than a more general analysis of all &quot;dogmatic religions.&quot;--&gt; An example of this would be the idea that women and men must be kept separate, or that women who do not cover themselves up modestly have tendencies for immorality, or are in some way responsible for sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Kerbaj | first =Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Muslim leader blames women for sex attacks  | publisher =The Australian | date =2006-10-26 | location = | pages = | url =http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20646437-601,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Asked to Leave Seminar|author=Raid Qusti | url=http://arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=89107&amp;d=22&amp;m=11&amp;y=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins contends that theistic religions devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the Bible contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture, and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;The God Delusion&quot; /&gt;

====Treatment of homosexuals====
[[File:20051129 northlake-il5.jpg|frame|A [[Westboro Baptist Church]] picket in Northlake, Illinois, US on November 29, 2005]]
{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}

Many [[major religions]], most prominently traditional [[Christianity and homosexuality|Christianity]], [[Homosexuality and Islam|Islam]], [[Homosexuality and Hinduism|Hinduism]] and [[Homosexuality and Judaism|Orthodox Judaism]], consider [[homosexuality]] immoral. Singer [[Elton John]] said organized religion promotes the [[Homophobia|hatred of homosexuals]]: &quot;I think religion has always tried to turn hatred towards gay people... Organized religion does not seem to work. It turns people into really hateful [[lemming]]s and it's not really compassionate.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=When Elton met Jake &amp;#124; | work=[[The Observer]] url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1942193,00.html | location=London | date=13 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, conservative Christian groups such as the [[Christian Legal Society]] and the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and [[hate speech]]. These groups argue that such policies infringe their right to freely exercise religion as guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Simon | first=Stephanie | coauthors= | title=Christians Sue for Right Not to Tolerate Policies | work= | pages= | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=10 April 2006 | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1018310011.html?dids=1018310011:1018310011&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+2006&amp;author=Stephanie+Simon&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=Christians+Sue+for+Right+Not+to+Tolerate+Policies |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuality is illegal in most Muslim countries, and in many of these countries carries the death penalty. In July 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni|two Iranian men]], aged sixteen and eighteen, were publicly hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry. Human rights organisations estimate that hundreds of people have been executed for homosexuality by Iranian authorities since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Eke | first=Steven | coauthors = | title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' | wor = | pages= | language= | publisher=BBC News | date=28 July 2005 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many liberal religious groups, and particularly most New Age religions, are accepting of homosexuals and do not regard their behavior as sinful, in particular: the [[Anglican Church of Canada]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianity and homosexuality&quot;&gt;[[Christianity and homosexuality]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America#Homosexuality|Episcopal Church]], [[Homosexuality and religion#Judaism|Progressive Judaism]], [[Moravian Church]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Christianity and homosexuality&quot;/&gt; [[Homosexuality and religion#Neopagan religion|Neopaganism]], [[Raelism#Liberal views of sex|Raëlism]], the [[United Church of Canada#Beliefs and practices|United Church of Canada]], the [[Open and affirming|United Church of Christ]], [[Homosexuality and Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalism]], [[Homosexuality and Voodoo|Haitian Voodoo]], [[Homosexuality and Wicca|Wicca]], and the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], which was established almost specifically for this purpose.

====Racism====
[[File:Burning-cross2.jpg|thumb|right||Cross often used by [[Ku Klux Klan]] to intimidate minorities]]
Religion has been used by some as justification for advocating [[racism]]. The [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[Christian Identity]] movement, [[Mormon]] leaders, and some Post-Medieval [[Theology|Theologians]]{{Who|date=May 2010}} have made claims that white people are closer to God than other races. Religious terrorist organizations such as the forenamed Ku Klux Klan, [[Kach and Kahane Chai]] and others also hold ostensibly racist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Foreign Terrorist Organizations | work = | publisher = US Office of Counterterrorism | date =2005-10-11 | url =http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm | doi =  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Berlet |first = Chip |authorlink = Chip Berlet |year = 2004 |url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/idennlns.html |title = A New Face for Racism &amp; Fascism  |work = White Supremacist, Antisemitic, and Race Hate Groups in the U.S.: A Geneaology |publisher = Political Research Associates   |accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are arguments, however, that these positions may be as much reflections of contemporary social views as of what has been called [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ostensibly scientific&quot;: cf. Adam Kuper, Jessica Kuper (eds.), ''The social science encyclopedia'' (1996), &quot;Racism&quot;, p. 716: &quot;This [''sc. scientific''] racism entailed the use of 'scientific techniques', to sanction the belief in European and American racial superiority&quot;; ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Questions to sociobiology'' (1998), &quot;Race, theories of&quot;, p. 18: &quot;Its exponents [''sc. of scientific racism''] tended to equate race with species and claimed that it constituted a scientific explanation of human history&quot;; Terry Jay Ellingson, ''The myth of the noble savage'' (2001), 147ff. &quot;In scientific racism, the racism was never very scientific; nor, it could at least be argued, was whatever met the qualifications of actual science ever very racist&quot; (p. 151); Paul A. Erickson,Liam D. Murphy, ''A History of Anthropological Theory'' (2008), p. 152: &quot;Scientific racism: Improper or incorrect science that actively or passively supports racism&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LDS Church]] [[Black people and Mormonism|excluded blacks]] from the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] in the church, from 1860 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church|year=2002|first=Richard|last=Abanes|authorlink=Richard Abanes|isbn=1-56858-219-6|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most [[Fundamentalist Mormon]] [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects]] within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], rejected the LDS Church’s 1978 decision to allow African Americans to hold the priesthood, and continue to deny activity in the church due to race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primergroups&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title=The Primer, Helping Victims of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Polygamous Communities: Fundamentalist Mormon Communities |url=http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/cmsdocuments/The_Primer.pdf | publisher=Utah Attorney General’s Office and Arizona Attorney General's Office | accessdate= 29 June 2010 |month=June |year=2006 |page=41|format=PDF | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On the other hand, many Christians have made efforts toward establishing racial equality, contributing to the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title =Civil Rights Movement in the United States | work=MSN Encyclopedia Encarta | url =http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580647_2/Civil_Rights_Movement_in_the_United_States.html | publisher= Microsoft | accessdate = 3 January 2007 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023158759408|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The African American Review'' sees as important the role Christian [[revivalism]] in the [[black church]] played in the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Religious Revivalism in the Civil Rights Movement | work=African American Review | url =http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_4_36/ai_97515888 | date= Winter, 2002 | accessdate =2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], an ordained [[Baptist]] minister, was a leader of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], a Christian Civil Rights organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Martin Luther King: The Nobel Peace Prize 1964 | publisher =The Nobel Foundation | url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-bio.html | accessdate = 2006-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment of women====

{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
There have been reports that Islam authorizes the punishment of female [[rape]] victims, such as the Saudi Arabian case where a rape victim was sentenced to receive 90 lashes because she was in a car with a man that was not her relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newspaper article on rape victim| url=http://www.news24.com/Content/World/News/1073/1a77b84a4491420e9e0cd45cba11cb4f/15-11-2007-02-08/Rape_victim_gets_200_lashes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens and the [[United Nations]] also say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and harmful female [[genital modification and mutilation]], when the purposes range from deprivation of sexual satisfaction to discourage [[adultery]], insuring virginity to their husbands, or generating appearance of virginity.&lt;ref name=Hitchens223/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;unfpa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/News/pid/280 | title=Statement on the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation | first=Thoraya |last=Ahmed Obaid | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) | date=6 February 2007 | accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Witch hunts=====
[[Witch trials]] by the [[Christian]] churches from 1480 through 1800 often resulted in torture or death of the alleged witch. Some were influenced by the Old Testament in the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18, which prescribes &quot;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&quot;. These trials were unfair, [[witchcraft]] was often not in evidence, and the trials were generally used to punish assertive or independent women, such as [[midwife|midwives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Teijlingen |first= Edwin R.| title=Midwifery and the medicalization of childbirth: comparative perspectives|year=2004|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[activists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|title=Living in the lap of the Goddess: the feminist spirituality movement in America|year=1995|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=170–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruelty to animals====
[[File:Shechita.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Shechita]]]]
[[Shechita|Kosher slaughter]] has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary,&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland&gt;{{Cite book|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Emanuel|last=Melzer|pages=81–90|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as an [[antisemitic canard]] that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration,&lt;ref name=Poliakov&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Anti-semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w39m4aohL9gC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Léon|last=Poliakov|page=153|year=1968|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry.&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland/&gt; Sometimes, however, these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Community on Trial: The Aberdeen Shechita Case, 1893|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2010.0103|first=Kenneth|last=Collins|journal=[[Journal of Scottish Historical Studies]]|volume=30|page=75|date=November 2010|doi=10.3366/jshs.2010.0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in Scripture.&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland/&gt; In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon Genesis IX:3, and that &quot;these laws are binding on Jews today.&quot;&lt;ref name=Chabad2/&gt; More recently, kosher slaughter has attracted criticism from some groups concerned with [[animal welfare]], who contend that the absence of any form of [[anesthesia]] or stunning prior to the severance of the animal's [[jugular vein]] causes unnecessary pain and suffering.

Supporters of kosher slaughter counter that Judaism requires the practice precisely because it is considered humane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chabad2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222241/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Practice-Shechita.htm|title=Why Do Jews Practice Shechita?|author=Shechita UK|work=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by [[Temple Grandin]] and Joe M. Regenstein in 1994 concluded that, practiced correctly with proper restraint systems, kosher slaughter results in little pain and suffering, and notes that behavioral reactions to the incision made during kosher slaughter are less than those to noises such as clanging or hissing, inversion or pressure during restraint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grandin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Temple |last1=Grandin |first2=Joe M. |last2=Regenstein|date=March 1994|title=Religious slaughter and animal welfare: a discussion for meat scientists.|journal=Meat Focus International|publisher=CAB International|pages=115–123|url=http://grandin.com/ritual/kosher.slaugh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of ritual slaughter, such as [[Ritual_slaughter#Islamic_.E1.B8.8Eab.C4.AB.E1.B8.A5ah|Islamic ritual slaughter]], have also come under controversy.  Logan Scherer, writing for [[PETA]], said that animals sacrificed according to Islamic law can not be stunned before they are killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PETA Islam animals&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2009/12/08/the-cruelty-behind-muslim-ritual-slaughter.aspx | title=The Cruelty Behind Muslim Ritual Slaughter | publisher=PETA | date=December 8, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012 | author=Scherer, Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to [[Sharia]] law, and they say that Islamic law on ritual slaughter is designed to reduce the pain and distress that the animal suffers.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Islam Animals&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml | title=Treatment of animals: Islam and animals | publisher=BBC | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against religion promoting immoral behavior====
Some scientific studies show that the degree of religiosity is generally found to be associated with higher ethical attitudes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Conroy | first1=S.

Putnam|Robert Putnam]] showing that membership of religious groups was positively correlated with membership of voluntary organizations&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a recent study by [[Gregory S. Paul]] published in the ''Journal of Religion and Society'' argues for a positive correlation between the degree of ''public religiosity'' in a society and certain measures of dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html| journal=Journal of Religion and Society|title=Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies: A First Look|first=Gregory S.|last=Paul |location= Baltimore, Maryland|year=2005| volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis published later in the same journal contends that a number of methodological problems undermine any findings or conclusions to be taken from the research.&lt;ref name=&quot;moses.creighton.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt;

Survey research suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by [[The Barna Group]], a Christian-affiliated research organization, those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: [[cohabitation|cohabitating]] with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an [[abortion]], sexual relationships outside of marriage, [[gambling]], looking at [[pornography|pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior]], getting [[drunkeness|drunk]], and &quot;[[homosexuality|having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morality Continues to Decay&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040203202833/www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=152&amp;Reference=F &quot;The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay&quot; (archive copy at the [[Internet Archive]])], [[The Barna Group]], November 3, 2003 ([http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay &quot;The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay&quot; – Summary version posted on the Barna website])&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, a comprehensive study by [[Harvard University]] professor [[Robert Putnam]] found that religious people are more charitable than their irreligious counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Relgion &amp; Charity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pewforum.org/Religion-News/Religious-people-make-better-citizens-study-says.aspx|title =Religious people make better citizens, study says |publisher = [[Pew Research Center]]|quote=The scholars say their studies found that religious people are three to four times more likely to be involved in their community. They are more apt than nonreligious Americans to work on community projects, belong to voluntary associations, attend public meetings, vote in local elections, attend protest demonstrations and political rallies, and donate time and money to causes – including secular ones. At the same time, Putnam and Campbell say their data show that religious people are just &quot;nicer&quot;: they carry packages for people, don't mind folks cutting ahead in line and give money to panhandlers.|accessdate = 2007–10–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;better neighbors&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title =Religious people are 'better neighbors'| work = [[USA Today]] | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-11-15-column15_ST_N.htm | quote=However, on the other side of the ledger, religious people are also &quot;better neighbors&quot; than their secular counterparts. No matter the civic activity, being more religious means being more involved. Take, for example, volunteer work. Compared with people who never attend worship services, those who attend weekly are more likely to volunteer in religious activities (no surprise there), but also for secular causes. The differences between religious and secular Americans can be dramatic. Forty percent of worship-attending Americans volunteer regularly to help the poor and elderly, compared with 15% of Americans who never attend services. Frequent-attenders are also more likely than the never-attenders to volunteer for school and youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and for health care (21% vs. 13%). The same is true for philanthropic giving; religious Americans give more money to secular causes than do secular Americans. And the list goes on, as it is true for good deeds such as helping someone find a job, donating blood, and spending time with someone who is feeling blue. Furthermore, the &quot;religious edge&quot; holds up for organized forms of community involvement: membership in organizations, working to solve community problems, attending local meetings, voting in local elections, and working for social or political reform. On this last point, it is not just that religious people are advocating for right-leaning causes, although many are.

===Counterarguments to religion as harmful to society===
A common response to such criticisms is that those guilty of such actions are merely misguided [[extremists]] and don't represent mainstream religion, or that such things are only exceptions and that, by and large, religion is a positive civilizing influence on society.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Hector Avalos]] counters that this may be a [[No true Scotsman]] [[logical fallacy|fallacy]] in that decisions on which believers are considered &quot;mainstream&quot; and which ones are &quot;extremist&quot; are based on biases to support any given position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Austin |last=Cline |url= http://atheism.about.com/od/religiousviolencemyths/a/HijackReligion.htm |title=Myth: Religious Extremists Hijack True Religion, Give Religion a Bad Name |publisher=atheism.about.com |accessdate= 2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodore Beale]] responds to criticisms that religion harms society by arguing that religious individuals tend to be more generous and more likely to have children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrational Atheist&quot;/&gt; Religious belief appears to be the strongest predictor of charitable giving.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Arthur C.

Giving to non-religious charities by religious individuals was $88 higher.  Religious individuals are also more likely to volunteer time, donate blood, and give back money when accidentally given too much change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gose 2006&quot;/&gt;  A 2007 study by [[The Barna Group]] found that &quot;active-faith&quot; individuals (those who had attended a church service in the past week) reported that they had given on average $1,500 in 2006, while &quot;no-faith&quot; individuals reported that they had given on average $200.  &quot;Active-faith&quot; adults claimed to give twice as much to non-church-related charities as &quot;no-faith&quot; individuals claimed to give.  They were also more likely to report that they were registered to vote, that they volunteered, that they personally helped someone who was homeless, and to describe themselves as &quot;active in the community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/12-faithspirituality/102-atheists-and-agnostics-take-aim-at-christians &quot;Atheists and Agnostics Take Aim at Christians&quot;], ''The Barna Update'', [[The Barna Group]], 11 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corrupt purposes of leaders==
Many criticisms focus on the purposes of the leaders of the religions, rather than on the religious doctrines.

===Corrupt or immoral leaders===
[[File:In memoriam brigham young 2.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of [[Mormon]] leader [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young's]] wives]]
Hitchens has noted some leaders who have abused their positions for financial gains such as the Indian mystic [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] who owned 90 [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]] cars, cult leader [[David Koresh]], [[Joseph Smith]] who had about 27 wives, and [[Brigham Young]] who had about 57 wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God is not Great |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens | pages=155–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritarian political power===
{{See also|Theocracy|Censorship by religion}}
The term &quot;[[authoritarian]]&quot; is used to describe an organization, an institution, or a state that enforces strong and sometimes oppressive measures against those within its sphere of influence, generally without any attempt at gaining their consent and often not allowing criticism of its policies.

In this sense, some religious organizations can be seen as authoritarian, insofar as their goal is to define themselves as the ultimate authority by which the law of the land is granted.{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} As this divine source of authority is not to be criticized by non-religious arguments, it is the antithesis to [[secularism]].{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} A country where the above has been achieved is called a [[theocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Driscoll | first =James F  | authorlink = | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia – Theocracy  | work =  | publisher =New Advent | date = | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some religions also teach that there was, or is, a human with divinity or touched by divine guidance, and who is therefore infallible: for example [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] and, in certain circumstances, the [[Pope]].

===Divine mandate used for political gain===
{{See also|Imperial cult}}
The [[ancient Egypt]]ians believed that upon taking the throne, the [[pharaoh]] became the earthly embodiment of a god. They believed that in his role as both man and god, he was responsible for preserving not only the empire, but the universe itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Regine |last=Schulz |title=Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs |publisher=Könemann |location=Köln |year= 1998|pages= |isbn=3-89508-913-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of [[World War II]] the [[Emperor of Japan]] held a similar status,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Large|first=Stephen S.|title=Emperor Hirohito and Showa Japan: A Political Biography|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imperial cult|deification]] of Roman emperors was common practice following the reign of [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The imperial cult|first=Nigel |last=Pollard|publisher=BBC History| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/roman_religion_gallery_06.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems such as this equated political opposition to heresy, and served to support existing power structures by suppressing dissent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  On New Year's Day 1946, [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] (formally) declined claims of divinity with the [[Humanity Declaration]].

===Dominionism===
{{Main|Dominionism}}
{{See also|Dominion Theology|Christian Reconstructionism}}
The term [[dominionism]] is often used to describe a political movement among [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]]. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Human Race?&quot; by [[Francis Schaeffer|Francis A. Schaeffer]] and [[C. Everett Koop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Diamond | first =Sara | authorlink =Sara Diamond |  title =Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right | publisher =[[South End Press]] | year =1989 | location =Boston | pages = | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Tim LaHaye]], [[Rutherford Institute|John W. Whitehead]], and although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists believe they have a Christian duty to take &quot;control of a sinful secular society&quot;, either by putting fundamentalist Christians in office, or by introducing biblical law into the secular sphere.&lt;ref name=berlet1998 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Ansell | first=Amy E | authorlink = | title =Unraveling the Right: The New Conservatism in American Thought and Politics | publisher =Westview Press | year =1998 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn=0-8133-3147-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Schaeffer | first =Francis | authorlink =Francis Schaeffer | coauthors = | title =A Christian Manifesto | publisher =Crossway Books | year =1982  | location = | pages = | url = | doi = |  isbn=0-89107-233-0  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social scientists have used the word &quot;dominionism&quot; to refer to adherence to [[Dominion Theology]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Barron1992a&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Barron | first=Bruce | year=1992 | title=Heaven on Earth?
