{{Christianity|right}}

'''Early Christianity''' is generally considered as [[Christianity]] between the [[resurrection of Jesus]] around year 30 and the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.

The very first Christians (the [[Apostle (Christian)#The Twelve Apostles|Twelve Apostles]] and the [[Pentecost#New Testament|120 Disciples at Pentecost]], etc) were all [[Jews]] or [[Proselyte|biblical proselytes]],&lt;ref&gt;A &quot;gate proselyte&quot; or [[ger toshav]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|20:9-10|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Deut|5:13-14|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|14:20-29|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|16:10-14|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|24:13-14|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|26:11-12|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Deut|31:11-12|HE}}) is a &quot;resident alien&quot; who lives in the [[Land of Israel]] and follows some of the customs of Israel. They are not required to be [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity#Jewish background|circumcised]] nor to comply with the whole of the [[Torah]]. They are bound only to conform to the seven precepts of Noah, known as the [[Noahide Laws]], to be assured of a place in the [[World to Come#Jewish eschatology|world to come]].&lt;/ref&gt; either by birth or conversion, referred to by historians as the [[Jewish Christians]]. The [[New Testament]]'s [[Acts of the Apostles|Book of Acts]] and [[Epistle to the Galatians]] record that the first [[Christian church|Christian community]] was [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|centered in Jerusalem]] and its leaders included [[Simon Peter|Peter]], [[James the Just|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Galatians|2:9|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|1:13|NIV}}; See [[Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles]] for details&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus]], after [[Conversion of Paul|his conversion to Christianity]], claimed the title of &quot;Apostle to the Gentiles&quot;. Paul's influence on Christian thinking is said to be more significant than any other [[New Testament]] writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' ed. F.L. Lucas (Oxford) entry on Paul&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]], Christianity began to be recognized internally and externally as a [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|separate religion from Rabbinic Judaism]] which itself was refined and developed further in the centuries after the destruction of the Second Jerusalem Temple.

As shown by the numerous quotations in the [[New Testament]] books and other Christian writings of the 1st centuries, early Christians generally used and revered the [[Jewish Bible]] as [[Scripture]], mostly in the Greek ([[Septuagint]]) or Aramaic ([[Targum]]) translations, much of which is written in narrative form where &quot;in the biblical story God is the [[protagonist]], Satan (or evil people/powers) are the [[antagonist]]s, and God’s people are the [[Agonist (disambiguation)|agonists]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepracticalchristian.net/2009/12/a-view-from-above-the-bibles-big-picture/] A View From Above – The Bible’s Big Picture - Greg Chaney&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Bible-Worth-ebook/dp/B000FC2KC4/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1] How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth - Gordon D. Fee - Douglas Stuart - Harper Collins Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  

As the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]], the [[Pauline epistles|Letters of Paul]], the [[Canonical Gospels]] and various other works were also recognized as scripture to be read in [[church (building)|church]]. Paul's letters, especially [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[Pauline Christianity|established a theology based on Christ]] rather than on the [[Mosaic Law]], but most [[Christian denominations]] today still consider the [[Biblical law in Christianity|&quot;moral prescriptions&quot; of the Mosaic Law]], such as the [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|Ten Commandments]], [[Great Commandment]], and [[Golden Rule]], to be relevant. Early Christians demonstrated a wide range of beliefs and practices, many of which were later rejected as [[heresy|heretical]].

==History==
{{Main|History of early Christianity}}
The earliest followers of Jesus composed an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]], [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jewish sect]], which historians refer to as [[Jewish Christianity]]. The first part of the period, during the lifetimes of the [[Twelve Apostles]], is called the [[Apostolic Age]]. In line with the [[Great Commission]] attributed to the [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|resurrected Jesus]], the [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary]] activity [[Early centers of Christianity|spread Christianity]] to cities throughout the [[Hellenistic]] world and even beyond the [[Roman Empire]]. Though [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's influence on Christian thinking]] is said to be more significant than any other [[New Testament]] author,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; the relationship of [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism]] is still disputed.

Early Christians suffered [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|sporadic persecution]] because they refused to pay homage to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|emperor as divine]]. Persecution was on the rise in Asia Minor towards the end of the 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2004, p. 318 - &quot;If the letter [1 Peter] is indeed associated with Asia Minor, as its prescript suggests, it should probably be assigned to the first century, possibly near its end, when persecution of the Christians was on the rise&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Rome in the aftermath of the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD 64.

During the [[Ante-Nicene Period|Ante-Nicene period]] following the Apostolic Age, a great diversity of views emerged simultaneously with strong unifying characteristics lacking in the apostolic period. Part of the unifying trend was an increasingly harsh [[Anti-Judaism|rejection of Judaism]] and [[Judaizers|Jewish practices]]. Early Christianity gradually [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|grew apart from Judaism]] during the first two centuries and established itself as a predominantly gentile religion in the [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Roman Empire]].

What started as a religious movement within 1st century Judaism became, a few decades after the end of this period, the [[state church of the Roman Empire]], as well as a [[Early centers of Christianity#Outside the Roman Empire|significant religion outside the empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox&quot;&gt;[[Robin Lane Fox]], ''Pagans and Christians: In the Mediterranean World from the Second Century AD to the Conversion of Constantine'', London: Viking, 1986, ISBN 978-0-670-80848-9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Will Durant]], the [[Christian Church]] prevailed over [[Paganism]] because it offered a much more attractive doctrine and because the church leaders addressed human needs better than their rivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;Durant, Will. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
From the writings of early Christians, historians have tried to piece together an understanding of various early Christian practices including [[worship]] services, customs and observances. Early Christian writers such as [[Justin Martyr]] (100 – 165) described these practices.

===Baptism===
{{main|Baptism in early Christianity}}
Early Christian beliefs regarding baptism probably predate the New Testament writings. It seems certain that baptism was practised by numerous Jewish sects and certainly by Jesus and his disciples and was integral to nearly every manifestation of the religion of the Jews. John the Baptist had baptized many people before it was done in the name of Jesus Christ. Many of the interpretations that would later become orthodox Christian beliefs concerning baptism can be traced to apostles such as Paul, who likened baptism to being a buried with Christ in his death (Romans 6:3,4; Colossians 2:12). On the basis of this description, it was supposed by some modern theologians that the early Christians practised baptism by submersion (Matthew 3:13-17). This interpretation is debated between those Christian denominations who advocate [[immersion baptism]] exclusively and those who practice baptism by [[affusion]] or [[aspersion]] as well as by immersion.  Yet the [[Didache]], one of the earliest Christian writings on liturgical practices, mentions that baptism may occur by pouring water on the head three times using the trinitarian formula (i.e., in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit).

While some believe that [[infant baptism]] began to be widely practised at least by the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Infant Baptism''&lt;/ref&gt; the origins of the practice are controversial. Some believe that the Church in apostolic period practised infant baptism, arguing that the mention of the baptism of households in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] most definitely would have included children within the household.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishreformedfellowship.org.uk/articles/householdbaptisms.pdf Gregg Strawbridge, Ph.D.]; [http://www.apuritansmind.com/Baptism/CalvinInfantBaptism.htm#1 John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'']; [http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7067.asp Jordan Bajis]; [http://paedobaptism.com/chapell.htm Bryan Chapell]; [http://www.wordmp3.com/gs/baptism.htm#III Gregg Strawbridge (response to objections)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], [[Irenaeus]], bishop of Lyons, may have referred to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;He (Jesus) came to save all through means of Himself — all, I say, who through Him are born again to God and children, infants, and boys, and youths, and old men&quot; ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iii.xxiii.html ''Adversus Haereses'', ii, 22, 4])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul King Jewett, ''Infant Baptism and the Covenant of Grace'', (Eerdmans 1978), page 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd century evidence is clearer, with both [[Origen]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=101602347 Homilies on Leviticus]'' 8.3.11; ''Commentary on Romans'' 5.9; and ''[http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=88940787 Homily on Luke 14.5]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cyprian]] advocating the practice. [[Tertullian]] refers to the practice (and that sponsors would speak on behalf of the children), but argues against it, on the grounds that baptism should be postponed until after marriage.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The delay of baptism is preferable; principally, however, in the case of little children. For why is it necessary ... that the sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger? ... For no less cause must the unwedded also be deferred - in whom the ground of temptation is prepared, alike in such as never were wedded by means of their maturity, and in the widowed by means of their freedom - until they either marry, or else be more fully strengthened for continence&quot; (''[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-03/anf03-49.htm#P11705_3290478 On Baptism]'' 18).&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretation of the baptismal practices of the early church is important to groups such as [[Baptists]] and [[Anabaptists]], who believe that infant baptism was a later development, yet the early Christian writings mentioned above, which date from the 2nd and 3rd century clearly show that the early Christians did maintain such practice.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The ''Didache'', representing practice perhaps as early as the beginning of the second century, probably in Syria, also assumes immersion to be normal, but it allows that if sufficient water for immersion is not at hand, water may be poured three times over the head. The latter must have been a frequent arrangement, for it corresponds with most early artistic depictions of baptism, in Roman catacombs and on sarcophagi of the third century and later. The earliest identifiable Christian meeting house known to us, at Dura Europos on the Euphrates, contained a baptismal basin too shallow for immersion. Obviously local practice varied, and practicality will often have trumped whatever desire leaders may have felt to make action mime metaphor&quot; ([http://books.google.com/books?id=6UTfmw_zStsC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=%2B%22baptismos%22+jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p3woTujNJY63hAeHlcjcCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%2B%22baptismos%22%20jewish&amp;f=false Margaret Mary Mitchell, Frances Margaret Young, K. Scott Bowie, ''Cambridge History of Christianity, Vol. 1, Origins to Constantine'' (Cambridge University Press 2006 ISBN 978-0-521-81239-9), pp. 160-161).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
Christian groups and congregations were first organized loosely. In Paul's time, although certain decisions by Elders and Apostles were binding, as in the [[Council of Jerusalem]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swrb.com/newslett/actualNLs/apopresby.htm Apostolic Presbyterianism ] - by William Cunningham and Reg Barrow&lt;/ref&gt; there were no precisely delineated functions yet for [[bishops]], [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]], and [[deacons]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Church hierarchy]], however, seems to have developed by the late 1st century and early 2nd century&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; (see [[Pastoral Epistles]], ''c'' 90 - 140&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt;). These structures were certainly formalized well before the end of the Early Christian period, which concluded with the [[Edict of Milan|legalization of Christianity]] by [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 and the holding of the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325, when the title of [[Metropolitan bishop]] first appears.

In the post-Apostolic church, bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations, and a hierarchy of clergy gradually took on the form of ''[[bishops|episkopoi]]'' (overseers), ''[[presbyter]]oi'' (elders),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/presbyter presbyter]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved October 06, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[deacon|diakonoi]]'' (ministerial servants). This hierarchy emerged slowly and at different times for different locations. Clement, a 1st-century bishop of Rome, refers to the leaders of the Corinthian church in [[First Epistle of Clement|his epistle to Corinthians]] as bishops and presbyters interchangeably. The New Testament writers also use the terms &quot;overseer&quot; and &quot;elder&quot; interchangeably and as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Carrington, ''The Early Christian Church'' (2 vol. 1957) [http://www.questia.com/read/13569586?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%201) online edition vol 1]; [http://www.questia.com/read/23514152?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%202) online edition vol 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Didache]] (dated by most scholars to the early 2nd century),&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger|Metzger, Bruce]]. ''The canon of the New Testament''. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;) speaks of &quot;appointing for yourself bishops and deacons&quot;.

Disputes regarding the proper titles and roles of church leaders would later become one of the major causes of [[Schism (religion)|schism]] within the Christian church.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Such disputes include the roles of bishops and presbyters. Churches such as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] use the word &quot;priest&quot; of all the baptized, but apply it in a more specific sense (&quot;ministerial priesthood&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P31.HTM#6S Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1120]&lt;/ref&gt; to bishops and presbyters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4U.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1554]&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes, somewhat loosely, treat &quot;presbyter&quot; and &quot;priest&quot; as synonyms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4U.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1562-1568]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Γ. Μπαμπινιώτη Λεξικό για το σχολείο &amp; το γραφείο (Κέντρο Λεξικολογίας Αθήνα 2004 ISBN 960-86190-4-1)&lt;/ref&gt; applying both terms to clergy subordinate to bishops. In [[congregational churches]], the title &quot;priest&quot; is rejected, keeping only &quot;presbyter&quot; or &quot;elder&quot;.  Some congregational churches do not include a role of bishop in their organizational polity. 

Post-apostolic bishops of importance include [[Polycarp|Polycarp of Smyrna]], [[Ignatius of Antioch]] and [[Pope Clement I|Clement of Rome]] . These men reportedly knew and studied under the apostles personally and are therefore called [[Apostolic Fathers]]. Each Christian community also had [[presbyter]]s, as was the case with Jewish communities, who were also ordained and assisted the bishop; as Christianity spread, especially in rural areas, the presbyters exercised more responsibilities and took distinctive shape as priests. Lastly, [[deacon]]s also performed certain duties, such as tending to the poor and sick. In the 2nd century, an episcopal structure becomes more visible, and in that century this structure was supported by teaching on [[Apostolic Succession|apostolic succession]], where a bishop becomes the spiritual successor of the previous bishop in a line tracing back to the apostles themselves.

By the end of the early Christian period, the church within the Roman Empire had hundreds of bishops, some of them (Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, &quot;other provinces&quot;) holding some form of jurisdiction over others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.vi.viii.html Canon VI] of the [[First Council of Nicea]], which closes the period under consideration in this article, reads: &quot;Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis prevail, that the Bishop of Alexandria have jurisdiction in all these, since the like is customary for the Bishop of Rome also. Likewise in Antioch and the other provinces, let the Churches retain their privileges. And this is to be universally understood, that if any one be made bishop without the consent of the Metropolitan, the great Synod has declared that such a man ought not to be a bishop ...&quot; As can be seen, the title of &quot;[[Patriarch]]&quot;, later applied to some of these bishops, was not used by the Council: &quot;Nobody can maintain that the bishops of Antioch and Alexandria were called patriarchs then, or that the jurisdiction they had then was co-extensive with what they had afterward, when they were so called&quot; (ffoulkes, ''Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'', quoted in [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.vi.viii.html Volume XIV] of Philip Schaff's ''The Seven Ecumenical Councils'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerusalem was the first church and an important church center up to 135.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Council of Jerusalem]] and [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem]].&lt;/ref&gt; The First Council of Nicaea recognized and confirmed the tradition by which Jerusalem continued to be given &quot;special honour&quot;, but did not assign to it even metropolitan authority within its own province, still less the extraprovincial jurisdiction exercised by Rome and the other sees mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Since there prevails a custom and ancient tradition to the effect that the bishop of [[Jerusalem|Aelia]] is to be honoured, let him be granted everything consequent upon this honour, saving the dignity proper to the metropolitan&quot; ([http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/NICAEA1.HTM Canon 7]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constantinople]] came into prominence only after the early Christian period, being founded officially in 330, five years after the First Council of Nicaea, though the much smaller original city of [[Byzantium]] was an early center of Christianity largely due to its proximity to [[Early centers of Christianity#Anatolia|Anatolia]].

===Sabbath===
{{See also|Sabbath in Christianity}}

According to Bauckham, the [[Ante-Nicene Period|post-apostolic church]] contained diverse practices as regards Sabbath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bauckham&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sabbath and Sunday in the Post-Apostolic church|author=R.

===Women===
{{expand section|date=June 2011}}

The attitude of the [[Church Fathers]] towards women paralleled rules in Jewish law regarding a woman's role in worship.  Women were regarded as both &quot;God's good gift to men&quot; and &quot;weak in both mind and character&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Women in the early church |first=Elizabeth Ann |last=Clark |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1983 |page=15 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qt3X9bHti3wC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+women#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20women&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8146-5332-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The early church allowed women to participate in worship - something that was not allowed in the Synagogue (where women were restricted to the outer court).  However, early Christian teachings called upon women to remain quiet during public worship, did not allow them to teach men, &lt;ref name=&quot;1 Tim 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202&amp;version=NIV | title=1 Timothy 2 NIV | publisher=BibleGateway | accessdate=October 07, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women were called upon to submit to the authority of their husbands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ephesians 5&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5&amp;version=NIV | title=Ephesians 5 NIV | accessdate=October 07, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Early Christian beliefs were based on the [[Twelve Apostles|apostolic]] preaching (''[[kerygma]]''), considered to be preserved in [[Sacred Tradition|tradition]] and in [[New Testament]] scripture, for parts of which scholars have posited [[New Testament#Dates of composition|dates]] as late as the third century, although it was then attributed to the Apostles themselves and their contemporaries, such as Mark and Luke.

===Christology===

====Divinity of Christ====
{{Main|Christology|Divinity of Christ}}
Most Christians identified Jesus as divine from a very early period, although holding a variety of competing views as to what exactly this implied.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Hurtado, ''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'', (Eerdmans, 2005), page 650.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christian views tended to see Jesus as a unique agent of God;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Hurtado, ''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus! in Earliest Christianity'', (Eerdmans, 2005), page 204.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325 he was identified as God in the fullest sense, being 'of the same substance, essence or being'.

The 1st and 2nd-century texts that would later be canonized as the New Testament several times imply or indirectly refer to Jesus' divinity; though there is scholarly debate as to whether or not they call him God&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Raymond E. |last1=Brown |authorlink1=Raymond E. Brown |title=Does the New Testament call Jesus God? |journal=Theological Studies |volume=26 |year=1965 |pages=545–73 |url=http://www.ts.mu.edu/content/26/26.4/26.4.1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 15–20 years of the death of Jesus, Paul, who authored the largest early expositions of Christian theology, refers to Jesus as the resurrected &quot;[[Son of God]]&quot;, the savior who would [[Second Coming|return from heaven]] and save his faithful, dead and living, from the imminent [[End times|destruction of the world]]. The [[Synoptic Gospels]] describe him as the &quot;Son of God&quot;, though the phrase &quot;[[Son of Man]]&quot; (always placed in the mouth of Jesus himself) is more frequently used in the [[Gospel of Mark]]; born of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] by the agency of the [[Holy Spirit]], and who will return to [[Last judgment|judge the nations]]. The [[Gospel of John]] identifies Jesus as the human incarnation of the divine Word or &quot;Logos&quot; (see [[Jesus the Logos]]) and True Vine. It is believed that the [[Book of Revelation]] depicts Jesus as &quot;[[Alpha and Omega|the Alpha and the Omega]], the first and the last, the beginning and the end&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|22:13|ESV}}), and applies similar terms to &quot;the Lord God&quot;: &quot;'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God, 'who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty'&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|1:8|ESV}}).

The term &quot;Logos&quot; was used in Greek philosophy (see [[Heraclitus]]) and in [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jewish]] religious writing (see [[Philo Judaeus|Philo Judaeus of Alexandria]]) to mean the ultimate ordering principle of the universe. Those who rejected the identification of Jesus with the Logos, rejecting also the Gospel of John, were called [[Alogi]] (see also [[Monarchianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/alogi.php Alogi or Alogoi]&quot;, [http://earlychurch.org.uk Early Church.org.uk].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01331b.htm Alogi]&quot;, Francis P. Havey, ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]] Volume I'', 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adoptionists]], such as the Ebionites, considered him as at first an ordinary man, born to Joseph and Mary, who later became the Son of God at his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]], his [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], or his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Eschatology===

==Ecclesiology==

Rodney Stark estimates that the number of Christians grew by approximately 40% a decade during the first and second centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stark1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Rodney |last=Stark |title=The Rise of Christianity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=enTN1vi1YyIC|accessdate=28 October 2012|date=9 May 1997|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-067701-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenal growth rate forced Christian communities to evolve in order to adapt to their changes in the nature of their communities as well as their relationship with their political and socioeconomic environment. As the number of Christians grew, the Christian communities became larger, more numerous and farther apart geographically.  The passage of time also moved some Christians farther from the original teachings of the apostles giving rise to teachings that were considered heterodox and sowing controversy and divisiveness within churches and between churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haight2004.pp83-84&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haight|first=Roger D.|title=Christian Community in History Volume 1: Historical Ecclesiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EDzSaqXK-aEC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=26 October 2012|date=16 September 2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-1630-8|pages=83–84|quote=&quot;The churches were becoming ever more distant from their origins in space and time. They were growing and with growth came new or false teachings, the sources of controversy and division.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Robert Haight]]{{who|date=October 2012}} posits the development of ecclesiology in the form of &quot;Early Catholicism&quot; as one response to the problem of church unity.  Thus, the solution to division arising from heterodox teaching was the development of &quot;tighter and more standardized structures of ministry.  One of these structures is the tri-partite form of church leadership consisting of bishops, elders and deacons that Ignatius of Antioch urged churches to adopt, writing that &quot;You cannot have a church without these.&quot;  Over the course of the second century, this organizational structure became universal and continues to be used in the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches as well as in some Protestant denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haight2004.pp83-84&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haight|first=Roger D. |title=Christian Community in History Volume 1: Historical Ecclesiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EDzSaqXK-aEC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=26 October 2012|date=16 September 2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-1630-8|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its mention of bishops, there is no clear evidence in the New Testament that supports the concepts of dioceses and monepiscopacy (i.e. the rule that all the churches in a geographic area should be ruled by a single bishop).  Scholars point to evidence that Christian communities such as Rome had many bishops and that the concept of monepiscopacy was still emerging when Ignatius was urging his tri-partite structure on other churches.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Y.K. Fung as cited in {{cite book|author1=John Piper|author2=Wayne Grudem|title=Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DECfuM4_YuoC&amp;pg=PA254|accessdate=28 October 2012|date=8 August 2006|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-1918-5|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Williams posits that the &quot;origin and earliest development of episcopacy and monepiscopacy and the ecclesiastical concept of (apostolic) succession were associated with crisis situations in the early church.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Robert Lee |title=Bishop Lists: Formation of Apostolic Succession of Bishops in Ecclesiastical Crises|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LLW6qVX3DRoC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=28 October 2012|year=2005|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-194-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Orthodoxy and heterodoxy==
{{Main|Diversity in early Christian theology}}

In the orthodox main stream of the Catholic church, the categories [[orthodoxy]] and [[heresy]] were created, and &quot;orthodoxy&quot; was depicted and projected into the past as the authentic lineage of tradition. Other forms of Christianity were viewed as deviant streams of thought and therefore labeled as &quot;[[heterodox]]&quot;, or even called heretical.

Perhaps one of the most important discussions in the past century among scholars of early Christianity is to what extent it is still appropriate to speak of &quot;orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;heresy&quot;. [[Higher criticism]] drastically altered the previous perception that heresy was a very rare exception to the orthodoxy. 

Some orthodox scholars argue against the increasing focus on heterodoxy. A movement away from presuming the correctness or dominance of the orthodoxy is seen as understandable, in light of modern approaches. However, these orthodox scholars feel that instead of an even and neutral approach to historical analysis that the heterodox sects are given an assumption of superiority over the orthodox movement.&lt;ref&gt;Esler (2004). Pp 893-894.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious writing==
{{See also|List of early Christian writers|List of early Christian texts of disputed authorship}}
Early Christians wrote many religious works, some of which were later canonized as the New Testament of today.

===Defining scripture===
{{Main|Development of the Christian Biblical canon}}

Debates about scripture were underway in the mid-[[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], concurrent with a drastic increase of new scriptures, both Jewish and Christian. Debates regarding practice and belief gradually became reliant on the use of scripture other than what [[Melito]] referred to as the [[Old Testament]], as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]]. Similarly, in the 3rd century a shift away from direct revelation as a source of authority occurred, most notably against the [[Montanists]]. &quot;Scripture&quot; still had a broad meaning and usually referred to the [[Septuagint]] among Greek speakers or the [[Targums]] among [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic speakers]] or the [[Vetus Latina]] translations in [[Early centers of Christianity#Carthage|Carthage]]. Beyond the [[Torah]] (the ''Law'') and some of the earliest prophetic works (the [[Neviim|''Prophets'']]), there was not agreement on the [[Biblical canon|canon]], but this was not debated much at first. By the mid-2nd century, tensions arose with the [[split of early Christianity and Judaism]], which some theorize led eventually to the determination of a Jewish canon by the emerging [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic movement]],&lt;ref name=&quot;White 2004. Pp 446-447&quot;&gt;White (2004). Pp 446-447.&lt;/ref&gt; though, even as of today, there is no scholarly consensus as to when [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|the Jewish canon was set]]. For example some scholars argue that the Jewish canon was fixed earlier, by the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty (140-137 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies, in ''The Canon Debate'', page 50: &quot;With many other scholars, I conclude that the fixing of a canonical list was almost certainly the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem for scholars is that there is a lack of direct evidence on when Christians began accepting their own scriptures alongside the Septuagint. Well into the 2nd century Christians held onto a strong preference for [[oral tradition]] as clearly demonstrated by writers of the time, such as [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White 2004. Pp 446-447&quot;/&gt;

[[Koine Greek]] spread all over the Empire, even up the [[Rhone valley]] of [[Gaul]]; Roman satirists complained that even Rome had become a Greek city. Thus the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (the ''Septuagint'') was the dominant translation (even the [[Peshitta]] appears to be influenced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/swete/greekot/Page_112.html Swete's Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek, page 112]&lt;/ref&gt;). Later [[Jerome]] would express his preference for adhering strictly to the Hebrew text and canon, but his view held little currency even in his own day. It was not until the [[Protestant Reformation]] that substantial numbers of Christians began to reject those books of the Septuagint which are not found in the Jewish [[Masoretic Text]], referring to them as [[biblical apocrypha]]. In addition, some New Testament books were also disputed, known as the [[Antilegomena]].

===Fathers of the church===
{{Main|Church Fathers}}
Since the end of the 4th century, the title &quot;Fathers of the Church&quot; has been used to refer to a more or less clearly defined group of ecclesiastical writers who are appealed to as authorities on doctrinal matters. Orthodoxy of doctrine, holiness of life, approval by the Church and antiquity are traditionally considered conditions for classification as a Father of the Church, but modern writers sometimes include [[Tertullian]], [[Origen]] and a few others.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Fathers of the Church''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostolic Fathers====
[[Image:StClement1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|St. Clement I was an Apostolic Father.]]
{{See also|Apostolic Fathers}}

The earliest Christian writings (other than those collected in the New Testament) are a group of letters credited to the [[Apostolic Fathers]]. These include the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], the [[Shepherd of Hermas]] and the [[Epistles of Clement (disambiguation)|Epistles of Clement]], as well as the [[Didache]]. Taken as a whole, the collection is notable for its literary simplicity, religious zeal and lack of Hellenistic philosophy or rhetoric. Fathers such as [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (died 98 to 117) advocated the authority of the apostolic episcopacy (bishops).&lt;ref&gt;Ephesians 5-6, Magnesians 2, 6-7, 13, [[Letter to the Trallians|Trallians]] 2-3, [[Letter to the Smyrnaeans|Smyrnaeans]] 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of Christianity==
[[File:Spread of Christianity in Europe to AD 600 (1).png|thumb|right|float|400px| {{legend|#1F63A7|Spread of Christianity in Europe to AD&amp;nbsp;325}} {{legend|#6AB4FF|Spread of Christianity in Europe to [[Christianity in the 6th century|AD&amp;nbsp;600]]}} {{legend||*The map does not accurately reflect the conversion of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]] to Christianity in 301 AD}}]] 
{{Main|Early centers of Christianity}}

Early Christianity spread from city to city throughout the Hellenized Roman Empire and beyond into [[East Africa]] and [[South Asia]]. The [[Apostle (Christian)|Christian Apostles]], said to have [[Dispersion of the apostles|dispersed from Jerusalem]], traveled extensively and established communities in major cities and regions throughout the Empire. The original church communities were founded in northern Africa, Asia Minor, Armenia, Arabia, Greece, and other places.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vidmar19&quot;&gt;Vidmar, ''The Catholic Church Through the Ages'' (2005), pp. 19&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchcock 281&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter18&quot;/&gt; by apostles (see [[Apostolic see]]) and other Christian soldiers, merchants, and preachers.&lt;ref&gt;Franzen 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Over forty were established by the year 100,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchcock 281&quot;&gt;Hitchcock, ''Geography of Religion'' (2004), p. 281, quote: &quot;By the year 100, more than 40&amp;nbsp;Christian communities existed in cities around the Mediterranean, including two in North Africa, at Alexandria and Cyrene, and several in Italy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter18&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'' (2004), p. 18, quote: &quot;The story of how this tiny community of believers spread to many cities of the Roman Empire within less than a century is indeed a remarkable chapter in the history of humanity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; many in [[Early centers of Christianity#Anatolia|Asia Minor]], such as the [[seven churches of Asia]]. By the end of the 1st century, Christianity had spread to Greece and Italy, even [[Christianity in India|India]]. In 301 AD, the Kingdom of Armenia became the first state to declare Christianity as its official religion, following the conversion of the Royal House of the Arsacids in Armenia. Despite sometimes intense persecutions, the Christian religion continued its spread throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Whitby, et al. eds. '' Christian Persecution, Martyrdom and Orthodoxy'' (2006) [http://www.questia.com/read/115080283?title=Christian%20Persecution%2c%20Martyrdom%2c%20and%20Orthodoxy online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is no agreement on an explanation of how Christianity managed to spread so successfully prior to the [[Edict of Milan]]. For some Christians, the success was simply the natural consequence of the truth of the religion and the hand of [[Divine providence|Providence]]. However, similar explanations are claimed for the spread of, for instance, Islam and Buddhism. In ''[[The Rise of Christianity]]'', [[Rodney Stark]] argues that Christianity triumphed over [[paganism]] chiefly because it improved the lives of its adherents in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark. ''The Rise of Christianity.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor, more recently pointed out, was the way in which Christianity combined its promise of a general [[resurrection of the dead]] with the [[Resurrection#Ancient_Greek_religion|traditional Greek belief]] that true [[Eternal life (Christianity)|immortality]] depended on the survival of the body, with Christianity adding practical explanations of how this was going to actually happen at the [[End time|end of the world]].&lt;ref&gt;Dag Øistein Endsjø. ''Greek Resurrection Beliefs and the Success of Christianity.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Mosheim]] the rapid progression of Christianity was explained by two factors: translations of the New Testament and the [[Christian apologetics|Apologies]] composed in defence of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Moishem, Johann Lorenz von, ''The Ecclesiastical History of the Second and Third Centuries : Illustrated from the Writings of Tertullian,'' F. &amp; J. Rivington, London, 1845, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], in his classic ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', discusses the topic in considerable detail in his famous Chapter Fifteen, summarizing the historical causes of the early success of Christianity as follows: &quot;(1) The inflexible, and, if we may use the expression, the intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the Jewish religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which, instead of inviting, had deterred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses. (2) The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth. (3) The miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church. (4) The pure and austere morals of the Christians. (5) The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the Roman empire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=decline%20and%20fall%20of%20the%20roman%20empire Gibbon, Edward, ''History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter Fifteen.] in 6 volumes at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;
