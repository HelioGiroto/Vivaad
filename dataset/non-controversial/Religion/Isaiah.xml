==Biography==
{{religious text primary|section|date=February 2011}}
[[Image:Isaiah.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] [[icon]] of the Prophet Isaiah, 18th century ([[iconostasis]] of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] Church, [[Kizhi]] monastery, [[Karelia]], [[Russia]]).]]

The first verse of the Book of Isaiah states that he prophesied during the reigns of [[Uzziah]] (or Azariah), [[Jotham of Judah|Jotham]], [[Ahaz]], and [[Hezekiah]], the kings of [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|1:1|HE}}). Uzziah reigned fifty-two years in the middle of the 8th century BC, and Isaiah must have begun his ministry a few years before Uzziah's death, probably in the [[740s BC]].   Isaiah lived until the fourteenth year of Hezekiah (who died [[690s BC|698 BC]]), and may have been contemporary for some years with [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for as long as sixty-four years.

Isaiah's wife was called &quot;the prophetess&quot; ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|8:3|HE}}), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah ({{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|HE}}) and Huldah ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14-20|HE}}), or simply because she was the wife of &quot;the prophet&quot; ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|38:1|HE}}). The second interpretation, that it was simply an honorary title, &quot;Mrs. Prophet&quot; as it were, is likely.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, Michael D. Coogan, Oxford University Press, 2009, Page 273.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two sons, naming one Shear-Jashub, meaning &quot;A remnant shall return&quot;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|7:3|HE}} and the younger, Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, meaning, &quot;Spoil quickly, plunder speedily.&quot;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|8:3|HE}}

In early youth, Isaiah may have been moved by the invasion of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] by the [[Assyria]]n monarch [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|15:19|HE}}); and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-Pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and [[Syria]] in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by [[Rezin]] of [[Damascus]] and [[Pekah]] of Israel ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:5|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|28:5–6|HE}}). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-Pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|15:29|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|16:9|HE}}; {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|5:26|HE}}).
[[File:Isaiahwindow.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Isaiah receives his vision of the Lord's house.  A stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, SC]]
[[Image:Michelangelo, profeti, Isaiah 01.jpg|thumb|''Isaiah'', by [[Michelangelo]], (c. 1508-1512, [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Vatican City]]).]]
Soon after this [[Shalmaneser V]] determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel, [[Samaria]] was taken and destroyed ([[720s BC|722 BC]]). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah, who was encouraged to rebel &quot;against the king of Assyria&quot; ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:7|HE}}), entered into an alliance with the king of [[Egypt]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|30:2–4|HE}}). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. [[Sennacherib]] ([[709–700 BC|701 BC]]) led a powerful army into Judah. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:14–16|HE}}). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib led an army into Judah, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|36:2–22|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:8|HE}}). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:1–7|HE}}), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he &quot;spread before the LORD&quot; ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:14|HE}}).

{{quote| Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying &quot;Thus saith the lord God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
&lt;p&gt;
This is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;}}

According to the account in Kings (and its derivative account in Chronicles) the judgment of God now fell on the Assyrian army and wiped out 180,000 of its men. &quot;Like [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either southern Palestine or Egypt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sayce, Archibald Henry. ''The ancient empires of the East''. Macmillan, 1884, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful ({{bibleverse|2|Chr|32:23–29|HE}}). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are not specified in either the [[Bible]] or recorded history. There is a tradition (reported in both the [[Martyrdom of Isaiah]] and the [[Lives of the Prophets]]) that he suffered martyrdom by [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] due to pagan reaction.

==In Christianity==

[[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335–395), believed that the Prophet Esaias (Isaiah) &quot;knew more perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the Gospel.&quot; [[Jerome]] (c. 342–420) also lauds the Prophet Esias, saying, &quot;He was more of an Evangelist than a Prophet, because he described all of the Mysteries of the Church of Christ so vividly that you would assume he was not prophesying about the future, but rather was composing a history of past events.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Lives of the Holy Prophets, Holy Apostles Convent, ISBN 0-944359-12-4, page 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
Although Isaiah is not mentioned by name in the [[Qur'an]] or in the authenticated sayings of Prophet Muhammed, [[Muslim]] sources have accepted him as a [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim scholars, such as [[Ibn Kathir]] and [[Kisa'i]], reproduced Jewish traditions, transmitted through early Jewish converts to Islam, regarding '''Isaiah'''. Such Old Testament stories, which are not confirmed by the Quran or prophetic hadeeth, are referred to as Isra'iliyyah, and are not considered strong enough to be used as evidence in Islamic law.  Isaiah is mentioned as a prophet in Ibn kathir's ''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'' and the modern writers [[Muhammad Asad]] and [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'', Note. '''2173''' to '''17:4''': &quot;The Book is the revelation given to the Children of Israel.

Here it seems to refer to the burning words of Prophets like Isaiah. For example, see Isaiah, chap, 24. or Isaiah 5:20-30, or Isaiah 3:16-26.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; accepted Isaiah as a true [[Hebrew]] [[prophet]], who preached to the Israelites following the death of King [[David]].
Isaiah is well known in [[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] and [[literature]], notably for his predictions of the coming of [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Shaya'', Online Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah's narrative in [[Muslim]] [[literature]] can roughly be divided into three sections. The first part establishes Isaiah as a [[prophet]] of [[Israel]] during the reign of [[Hezekiah]]; the second part focuses on Isaiah's actions during the siege of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Sennacherib]]; and the third part is primarily focused upon Isaiah warning the people of coming doom.&lt;ref&gt;Tabari, ''History of the Prophets and Kings'', i, 638-45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim]] [[exegesis]] preserves a tradition, which parallels that of the [[Hebrew Bible]], which states that [[Hezekiah]] was the king that ruled over [[Jerusalem]] during Isaiah's time. Hezekiah obeyed and gave an ear to what Isaiah advised him but, nonetheless, this was a turbulent time for [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Isaiah bin Amoz''&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition, however, maintains that Hezekiah was a righteous man and that the turbulence increased after Hezekiah's death. After the death of the king, Isaiah told the people to not forsake [[God]] and he warned [[Israel]] that the people must cease from their persistent sin and acts of disobedience. Muslim tradition maintains that the unrighteous people of Israel were angered and sought to kill Isaiah.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; In a death which resembles that attributed to Isaiah in ''[[Lives of the Prophets]]'', Muslim exegesis recounts that Isaiah was [[martyred]] by Israelites by being sawed in half.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

== Rabbinic literature ==
{{main|Isaiah in Rabbinic Literature}}
According to the Rabbinic literature, Isaiah was a descendant of the royal house of [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] ([[Sotah]] 10b). He was the son of Amoz (''not to be confused with Prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]]''), who was the brother of [[Amaziah of Judah|King Amaziah]] of Juda. ([[Talmud]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] 15a).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=261&amp;letter=I&amp;search=isaiah#1 Isaiah] at [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
