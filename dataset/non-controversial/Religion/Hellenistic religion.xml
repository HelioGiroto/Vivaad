'''Hellenistic religion''' is any of the various systems of beliefs and practices of the people who lived under the influence of ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture during the [[Hellenistic period]] and the [[Roman Empire]] (c. 300 BCE to 300 CE). There was much continuity in Hellenistic religion: the [[Greek gods]] continued to be worshiped, and the same rites were practiced as before. 

Change came from the addition of new religions from other countries, such as including the [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian god(esse)s of [[Isis]] and [[Serapis]], and the [[Greater Syria|Syria]]n gods of [[Atargatis]] and of [[Hadad]], which provided a new outlet for people seeking fulfillment in both the present life and the [[afterlife]]. The worship of Hellenistic rulers was also a feature of this period, most notably in Egypt, where the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] adopted earlier pharaonic practice, and established themselves as [[god-kings]]. Elsewhere rulers might receive divine status without the full status of a god.

[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|Magic]] was practiced widely, and these too, were a continuation from earlier times. Throughout the Hellenistic world, people would consult [[oracle]]s, and use [[Amulet|charms]] and figurines to deter misfortune or to cast spells. Also developed in this era was the complex system of [[Hellenistic astrology|astrology]], which sought to determine a person's character and future in the movements of the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[planets]]. The systems of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], such as [[Stoicism]] and [[Epicureanism]], offered an alternative to traditional religion, even if their impact was largely limited to the educated elite.

==Classical Greek religion==
{{main|Religion in ancient Greece}}
[[File:Temple Apollo Korinth OLC.jpg|thumb|250px|Remains of the temple of Apollo at [[Corinth]].]]
Central to Greek religion in classical times were the [[Twelve Olympians|twelve Olympian deities]] headed by [[Zeus]]. Each god was honored with stone [[Greek temple|temples]] and [[Ancient Greek sculpture|statues]], and sanctuaries (sacred enclosures) were founded, which, although dedicated to a specific deity, often contained statues commemorating other gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley154&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1999|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city-states would conduct various festivals and rituals throughout the year, with particular emphasis directed towards the patron god of the city, such as [[Athena]] at [[Athens]], or [[Apollo]] at [[Corinth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley154&quot;/&gt; 

Religious practice would also involve the [[Greek hero cult|worship of heroes]], people who were regarded as semi-divine. Such heroes ranged from the mythical figures in the epics of [[Homer]] to historical people such as the founder of a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley154&quot;/&gt; At the local level, the landscape was filled with sacred spots and monuments; for example, many statues of [[Nymphs]] were found near and around [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the stylized figures of [[Hermes]] could often be found on street corners.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley154&quot;/&gt; 

[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|Magic]] was a central part of Greek religion&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux347&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamoux|Roussel|2002|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[oracle]]s would allow people to determine divine will in the rustle of leaves; the shape of flame and smoke on an altar; the flight of birds; the noises made by a spring; or in the entrails of an animal.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux330&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamoux|Roussel|2002|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also long established were the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], associated with [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux330&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux330&quot;/&gt;  People were indoctrinated into mystery religions through initiation ceremonies, which were traditionally kept secret.These religions often had a goal of personal improvement, which would also extend to the [[afterlife]].

==Hellenistic religion==
In the aftermath of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], Greek culture spread widely and came into much closer contact with the civilizations of the [[Near East]] and [[Egypt]]. The most significant changes to impact on Greek religion were the loss of independence of the Greek city-states to [[Macedon]]ian rulers; the importation of foreign deities; and the development of [[Hellenistic philosophy|new philosophical systems]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson218&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mikalson|2006|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older surveys of Hellenistic religion tended to depict the era as one of religious decline, discerning a rise in [[Religious skepticism|scepticism]], [[agnosticism]] and [[atheism]], as well as an increase in [[superstition]], [[mysticism]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley155&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1999|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is, however, no reason to suppose that there was a decline in the traditional religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley170&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1999|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is plenty of documentary evidence that the Greeks continued to worship the same gods with the same sacrifices, dedications, and festivals as in the classical period.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson220&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mikalson|2006|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New religions did appear in this period, but not to the exclusion of the local deities,&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson217&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mikalson|2006|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only a minority of Greeks were attracted to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson219&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mikalson|2006|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New religions of the period===
[[File:Isis Musei Capitolini MC744.jpg|thumb|200px|2nd century statue of [[Isis]].]]
The Egyptian religion which follows [[Isis]] was the most famous of the new religions. The religion was introduced to Greece by Egyptian priests, initially for the small Egyptian communities in the port cities of the Greek world.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson219&quot;/&gt; Although the Egyptian religion found only a small audience among the Greeks themselves, her popularity spread under the [[Roman empire]],&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley168&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1999|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote that the religion was known throughout almost the whole inhabited world.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, i. 25&lt;/ref&gt; 

Almost as famous was [[Serapis]], a Greek religion despite the Egyptian name, which was created in Egypt under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux340&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamoux|Roussel|2002|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serapis was patronized by the Greeks who had settled in Egypt. This religion involved initiation rites like the Eleusinian Mysteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley167&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1999|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] wrote of the [[Serapeum|Serapeion]] at [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] near [[Alexandria]] as being patronized by the most reputable men.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xvii.1.17&lt;/ref&gt; 

The religion of [[Atargatis]] (related to the Babylonian and Assyrian [[Ishtar]] and Phoenician [[Ba`alat Gebal]]), a fertility- and sea goddess from [[Greater Syria|Syria]], was also popular. By the 3rd century BCE her worship had spread from Syria to Egypt and Greece, and eventually reached [[Italy]] and the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley168&quot;/&gt; The religion following [[Cybele]] (or the ''Great Mother'') came from [[Phrygia]] to Greece and then to Egypt and Italy, where in 204 BCE the [[Roman Senate]] permitted her worship. She was a healing and protecting goddess, and a guardian of fertility and wild nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley168&quot;/&gt; 

Another mystery religion was focused around [[Dionysus]]. Although rare in mainland Greece, it was common on the islands and in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux331&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamoux|Roussel|2002|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members were known as [[Bacchants]], and the rites had an [[orgy|orgiastic]] character.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux331&quot;/&gt;

These newly introduced religions and gods only had a limited impact within Greece itself; the main exception was at [[Delos]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson219&quot;/&gt; which was a major port and trading center. The island was sacred as the birthplace of [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], and by the 2nd century BCE was also home to the native Greek religions that follow Zeus, Athena, Dionysus, Hermes, [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], and [[Asclepius]]. But there were also cult centers for the Egyptian Sarapis and Isis, and of the Syrian Atargatis and [[Hadad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson209&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mikalson|2006|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BCE there were additional religions that followed [[Ba'al]] and Astarte, a Jewish [[Synagogue]] and Romans who followed the original Roman religions of gods like Apollo and Neptune.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson209&quot;/&gt;

===Ruler cults===
{{see|imperial cult|hero cult}}
Another innovation in the Hellenistic period was the institution of cults dedicated to the rulers of the Hellenistic kingdoms. The first of these was established under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], whose conquests, power, and status had elevated him to a degree that required special recognition. His successors continued his worship to the point where in [[Egypt]] under [[Ptolemy I Soter]], we find Alexander being honored as a god.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley159&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Shipley|1999|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] proclaimed his late father a god, and made himself a living god.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipley159&quot;/&gt; 

By doing so, the Ptolemies were adapting earlier Egyptian ideas in [[pharaoh|pharaonic]] worship. Elsewhere, practice varied; a ruler might receive divine status without the full status of a god,&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson219&quot;/&gt; as occurred in [[Athens]] in 307 BCE, when [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] and [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]] were honored as saviors (''soteres'') for liberating the city, and, as a result, an altar was erected; an annual festival was founded; and an office of the &quot;priest of the Saviours&quot; was introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaniotis436&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chaniotis|2003|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temples dedicated to rulers were rare, but their statues were often erected in other temples, and the kings would be worshiped as &quot;temple-sharing gods.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chaniotis439&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chaniotis|2003|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrology and magic===
[[File:Eyguières.jpg|thumb|A [[curse tablet]].]]
There is ample evidence for the use of magic in this period. Oracular shrines and sanctuaries were still popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux330&quot;/&gt; There is also much evidence for the use of [[Amulet|charms]] and [[curse]]s. Symbols would be placed on the doors of houses to bring good luck or deter misfortune for the occupants within.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux347&quot;/&gt; 

Charms, often cut in precious or semi-precious stone, had protective power.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux347&quot;/&gt; Figurines, manufactured from bronze, lead, or terracotta, were pierced with pins or nails, and used to cast spells. [[Curse tablet]]s made from marble or metal (especially [[lead]]) were used for curses.&lt;ref name=&quot;chamoux347&quot;/&gt;

[[Astrology]] - the belief that stars and planets influence a person's future - arose in [[Babylonia]], where it was originally only applied to the king or nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans343&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1998|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks, in the Hellenistic era, elaborated it into the fantastically complex system of [[Hellenistic astrology]] familiar to later times.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans343&quot;/&gt; Interest in astrology grew rapidly from the 1st century BCE onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans343&quot;/&gt;

===Hellenistic philosophy===
{{main|Hellenistic philosophy}}
An alternative to traditional religion was offered by Hellenistic philosophy. The most widespread of these systems was [[Stoicism]], which taught that life should be lived according to the rational order which the Stoics believed governed the universe; human-beings had to accept their [[destiny|fate]] as according to divine will, and virtuous acts should be performed for their own intrinsic value. Its principal rival was [[Epicureanism]], which taught that the universe was subject to the random movements of atoms, and life should be lived to achieve psychological contentment and the absence of pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson220&quot;/&gt;

Other philosophers such as the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], who expressed contempt for convention and material possessions, and the [[Platonic Academy|Academics]] and [[Peripatetics]], who studied the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], also flourished. All of these philosophies, to a greater or lesser extent, sought to accommodate traditional Greek religion, but the philosophers, and those who studied under them, remained a small select group, limited largely to the educated elite.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikalson220&quot;/&gt;
