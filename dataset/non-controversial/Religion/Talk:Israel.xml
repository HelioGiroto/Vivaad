The government should say &quot;[[Parliamentary system|Parliamentary]] [[unitary state]], br [[Ethnic democracy]] for a more concise description.

[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/the-jewish-majority-is-history.premium-1.470233 This new fact] of &quot;unparalleled importance&quot; (according to Haaretz) deserves mention in the lead.

:Based on what little I can see, since there is a pay wall, your link does not support the claim that Israel is a &quot;Jewish minority state.&quot; The article claims that in the entirety of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, there are more non-Jews than Jews... but that area contains more than just the State of Israel. It includes the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Forgive me for not wanting to go around into circles on who controls what and all of that, but the current legal situation is that Israel has not annexed these areas. Within the State of Israel, the population is 70-75% Jewish, hardly a minority. What I am guessing the article is getting at is that if all of the areas that Israel &quot;controls&quot; are included, thus including the entirety of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, you have to include some 4+ million non-Jewish Palestinians, and then Jews are not a majority. --[[User:OuroborosCobra|OuroborosCobra]] ([[User talk:OuroborosCobra|talk]]) 22:55, 16 October 2012 (UTC)
::&lt;small&gt;Not to mention the 4% of Israelis (300,000), ethnically defined as &quot;others&quot;, who are Russian-descendants of Jewish origin or family who are not Jewish according to rabbinical law, but were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return. So the Jewish population could be considered an 79% instead of 75%.

::That's an opinion piece, so &quot;unparalleled importance&quot; is not according to Haaretz, but according to Akiva Eldar. I agree with OC above.

[[User:No More Mr Nice Guy|No More Mr Nice Guy]] ([[User talk:No More Mr Nice Guy|talk]]) 06:48, 17 October 2012 (UTC)
:::Thanks OC. I will ignore NMMNG's false assertion. Here is the key quote:
::::''&quot;According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (which is subordinate to the Prime Minister's Office ), of the 12 million residents living under Israeli rule, the number of Jews is just under 5.9 million (as of April 25 ). Twelve million minus 5.9 million Jews equals 6.1 million non-Jews. In other words, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, there is a pretty Jewish state as far as its laws and customs, but the reality is not so democratic. Foreign sources report that Jews had already become a minority in the area of the greater Land of Israel several years ago. From now on, it is an official statistic. There will certainly be those who argue that the 12 million includes the resident of the Gaza Strip, which Israel evacuated, and that I should have deducted 1.5 million people from the number of non-Jewish residents. But the 12 million, which does happen to include the residents of the Gaza Strip, is an official figure appearing on Ministry of Finance stationery. If this population &quot;is not considered&quot; for purposes of the demographic balance, the Finance Ministry should be so kind as to deduct it from the limit for receiving the tax breaks and from the balance of its income.&quot;''
:::Hope that clears up your questions. [[User:Oncenawhile|Oncenawhile]] ([[User talk:Oncenawhile|talk]]) 08:06, 17 October 2012 (UTC)
::::Unless this is based on some new census that has not been released to the public, this does not answer my questions at all. There simply are not 12 million people living &quot;between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea&quot; unless you include the Palestinian Territories, and not just the State of Israel. The continued use of &quot;Israeli rule&quot; also makes me suspect this. There are an estimated 8 million people living in Israel, the state. There are 2 million non-Israelis living in the West Bank. There are 1.7 million living in the Gaza Strip. The only way you approach 12 million is to add all three numbers together. --[[User:OuroborosCobra|OuroborosCobra]] ([[User talk:OuroborosCobra|talk]]) 10:06, 17 October 2012 (UTC)
:::::To quote the article: '''&quot;But the 12 million, which does happen to include the residents of the Gaza Strip, is an official figure appearing on Ministry of Finance stationery.&quot;''' So we could add a sentence such as &quot;According to Israeli Ministry of Finance figures, Jews comprise a minority of the total population living under Israeli rule&quot;.

::::::No, not OK. The article's numbers do not add up. In addition, by your own claim of their wording, they are still including the West Bank... meaning not just the State of Israel.

::::::Unless the argument is that the West Bank and Gaza are part of Israel (the subject of this article), the detail about what the demographic composition of the total area is doesn't belong here.

Onceinawhile, your suggestion is based on a misinterpretation of the article. What the article says is &quot;A Ministry of Finance memorandum on the amendment to the law notes that in 2011 the population of Israel and the Palestinian Authority exceeded the 12 million mark, which enables manufacturers who market to these consumers to enjoy a tax break.&quot; That is to say, the figure includes the Palestinian Authority (as well as Gaza), which, as the memo makes explicit, is not part of the state of Israel.

What alarms Eldar is the expansionist factions of the Israeli government, that want all the territory of the West Bank incorporated into Israel. For the time being, those forces have not taken the steps to make that expansion, so it would be wrong to include the populations of Gaza and the Occupied Territories as part of Israel. The government is now considering implementation of a report that would indeed obfuscate the legal distinction between Israel and the West Bank (the Edmond Levy report), thus de jure annexing the West Bank. However, for the time being, such a change in the article would be premature. --[[User:Ravpapa|Ravpapa]] ([[User talk:Ravpapa|talk]]) 05:08, 18 October 2012 (UTC)

== Cite_quick can avoid size/speed problems ==

The article &quot;[[Israel]]&quot; is one of several which are nearing the template include-size error, plus some exceeding the 60-second timeout to cause &quot;[[wp:Wikimedia Foundation error]]&quot; because {[[Template:Cite_news|cite_news]]} or {cite_web} is too slow/large to be used over 350-400 times per page. Another over-size article is &quot;[[Arab Spring]]&quot; or &quot;[[2011&amp;ndash;2012 Egyptian revolution]]&quot;. Currently, new [[Template:Cite_quick]] can be used to reduce the size/speed problem, to be coded in the article as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite&amp;nbsp;quick&amp;nbsp;|news|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Now, other editors have come to support progress, and we can again continue to streamline those huge articles. Next year, when the [[Lua script]] cites are installed, then the {cite quick|news} usage can be edited to remove &quot;quick|&quot; and use the new, faster Lua-based {cite_news} which seems to run about as fast and small as {cite_quick}.

If there are no other concerns, then in a few days, I can change the citations in the article to use {cite_quick} and reduce the edit-preview, or reformat, time of the entire page from 45 seconds to within 14 seconds. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 19:30, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

Meanwhile, the plan to update {cite_web} from {cite_web/smart} was derailed by another TfD which renamed {cite_web/smart} as {[[Template:Cite_web/sandbox4|cite_web/sandbox4]]}, and hence non-usable separately until &quot;tested&quot; for all 1.2 million articles using {cite_web}, as a formal upgrade systemwide. Meanwhile meanwhile, tests of {cite_quick} discovered alarming problems with invalid parameters in existing articles, where &quot;author=&quot; null would override &quot;last=xx&quot; to blank the author's name. It would be nice to update {cite_web} soon, but some/many articles depend on bugs in {cite_web}, and simulating those bugs in a new version is complex. Consequently, other users have considered {cite_quick} to be a &quot;choice&quot; as another citation style, where it does not need to mimic {cite_web} exactly, and can be used with slight differences. Whereas {cite_quick} has only 43 parameters with only billion trillions of combinations ([[factorial|43!]]=~6.0415e52), the complexity of {cite_web} has over 230 parameters, with umpteen zillion zillion combinations ([[factorial|230!]]=~7.76e444), which could not be tested fully if tests were run 1,000 per second since the dawn of time with the [[age of the universe]]. Only by using a new template within a few more articles, each time, can the results be safely tested, little by little. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 03:35, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

I don't have an issue with it.  What is really needed is the ability to create subpages where you can store the full reference info for each reference, and then simply refer to it in the article as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blah&quot;/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and it would simply grab all of the reference information from the subpage. --&lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px dashed;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Jethro B|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;Jethro&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]] [[User talk:Jethro B|&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;B&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 00:21, 28 October 2012 (UTC)
* '''Lua-based cites will be lightning-fast per second:''' I have spent weeks testing the [[Lua script]] cites planned for Spring 2013, running on test2.wiki, with Lua [http://test2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:Citation  test2:Module:Citation], and can confirm rapid formatting, such as for article &quot;[[Barack Obama]]&quot; (see: [http://test2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama  test2:Barack_Obama]). The Lua-based cites format at about 125-per-second, but perhaps could be improved to 200-per-second. At such rapid speeds, then the footnotes would be less of a problem. However, I like the idea of clicking on a small footnote which can link to a fuller note in a separate references page, as could be done with 200 basic footnotes which rarely change. For example, external footnotes could be numbered as &quot;x1&quot; or &quot;x2&quot; within the text: &quot;Israel has a mixed climate&lt;sup&gt;[[Climate of Israel#Note 1|[x1] ]][[Climate of Israel#Note 2|[x2] ]]&lt;/sup&gt; with ocean, desert,&lt;sup&gt;[[Climate of Israel#Note 3|[x3] ]]&lt;/sup&gt; and mountain regions&quot; whereas the internal footnotes would avoid the &quot;x&quot; prefix. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 03:35, 28 October 2012 (UTC)
**The first part of your passage is complete gibberish to someone like me, with the fullest respect!  While I have a background in computer programming and know HTML, XHMTL, CSS, and some JavaScript, I am not that advanced and am totally unfamiliar with this lua and test2.wiki stuff.  Sounds very technical.  Sorry!
**As for the laat part, that's a good idea too, I wasn't even referring to that. I was thinking more of having a subpage for each article, where the full coding for each reference would be found.  Then on the actual article, we'd just have a special short ref tag that we use, whose full code would be on the subpage.  The reference itself would still be in the reference section, just the amount of coding on the page itself would be eliminated.  Perhaps we should move this to a different venue? --&lt;small style=&quot;border: 1px dashed;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;'''[[User:Jethro B|&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;Jethro&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]] [[User talk:Jethro B|&lt;font color=&quot;darkred&quot;&gt;B&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&lt;/small&gt; 04:36, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

== Imam in Istanbul clearly reflects Turkish foreign policy against Israel. ==

&quot;Once Turkey grows strong enough politically and economically it will stop recognising Israel with the first chance, and once we do this Israel will be wiped off the map&quot;, Imam in Istanbul during the summer. 

Thousands of reporters and commentators have made it clear that Turkey tries to find the chance -irrespective of goverment in power- to harm Israel and become the leader of the Muslim world. Of course someone must be very ignorant to beilive Turkey is a real democracy. The suppression of minority rights and the imprisonment of Islamist goverment's opponenets are two of the various indications that Turkey is controlled by an elit, and that elit plans the harm or even more advocates the destruction of Israel. There are many years that a religious fundamentalist sentiment is fuelling in Turkey, is not something recent. And of course this is reflected by the current goverment in power also.
Turkey through its established membership in NATO steadily undermines Israel's stance in Europe and the US. Its links with European and US military is a clear indication that Turkey is more harmful than any other Israeli enemy.

Anyways when I find the artcile that writes about this event I will post it in Foreign Policy section!  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:IsrArmen|IsrArmen]] ([[User talk:IsrArmen|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/IsrArmen|contribs]]) 17:01, 6 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Imam's are not government officials in Turkey. They do not set policy. If all you can find are Imam's speeches, then your content will not make it into the article. --[[User:OuroborosCobra|OuroborosCobra]] ([[User talk:OuroborosCobra|talk]]) 17:29, 6 November 2012 (UTC)

:Exactly - our article will indicate that foreign-policy relations between Turkey and Israel are those reflected by the balance of [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], and unless these state that the opinions of a particular Imam are of any significance, we won't. And in future, please give new sections neutral headings, rather than using them as a platform for your obsession.

: What's the issue here, exactly? If 98 is suggesting that there should be a section in this article entitled &quot;Criticm of Israel&quot;, then we should be discussing what we'd write in this section, based on which sources. There are several articles that deal with aspects of Israeli policy that have drawn criticism, such as [[Criticism of the Israeli government]]. Why not use those? --[[User:Dailycare|Dailycare]] ([[User talk:Dailycare|talk]]) 20:08, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

::Exactly, these articles complain about the actions of the government, not the land. What exactly would be the criticism of the country? &quot;Dry and full of fanatics&quot;? Wouldn't that just mark it as a typical Middle Eastern country? [[User:Hcobb|Hcobb]] ([[User talk:Hcobb|talk]]) 20:55, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

:::No need for POV in the article and as for the Anon claim that there is no other country like Israel so only in her case criticism section is required -I think he would have to explain why we don't have one on Iran, Syria, Pakistan (which want to execute mentally retard 12 years old child for tearing the Koran and even that according to only one eye witness) Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, N.Korea and the list can go much longer if the one who roll his eyes up and want us to push his anti-Israeli agenda into the article insist. --[[User:Gilisa|Gilisa]] ([[User talk:Gilisa|talk]]) 07:44, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

According to this wiki law, then Encyclopaedic articles do indeed need it. Especially the sort where people are trying to Game the system of wiki as it did here
&quot;August 18, 2010). &quot;Wikipedia editing courses launched by Zionist groups&quot;. The Guardian. Retrieved February 16, 2012.&quot; So agreed, there definatly should be a criticism section displaying the sourced facts about the racism in israel and the anti-non jewish policies that is being kept. Not just as a seperate article itself ONLY. Especially the anti-non jew part should be added, the human rights record on controlling the press by violence is just another example
