'''Saturday''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Saturday.ogg|ˈ|s|æ|t|ər|d|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|t|ər|d|eɪ}}) is the [[day]] of the week following [[Friday]] and preceding [[Sunday]]. Saturday is the seventh and therefore last day of the week according to many commonly used calendars, but it is the second-to-last (sixth) day of the week according to ISO 8601 (see below). Its Latin name ''dies Saturni'' (&quot;Saturn's Day&quot;) entered into Old English as ''Saeternesdaeg''. Saturday was named no later than the 2nd century for the planet [[Saturn]], which controlled the first [[hour]] of that day according to [[Vettius Valens]].

==Origins in antiquity==
{{see also|Names of the days of the week}}
                                         
[[File:Saturn.png|200 px|framed|right|Saturday is named after the planet Saturn]]
The [[weekday heptagram]], i.e. the association of the days of the seven-day week with the seven [[classical planets]], probably dates to the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was with the adoption and widespread use of the seven-day week throughout the Hellenistic world of mixed cultures that this [[heptagram]] was created.&quot; [http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/29/2916.html Symbol 29:16]&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Roman Empire]] gradually replaced the eight day Roman [[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinal cycle]] with the seven-day week. The astrological order of the days was explained by [[Vettius Valens]] and [[Dio Cassius]] (and [[Chaucer]] gave the same explanation in his ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]''). According to these authors, it was a principle of [[astrology]] that the heavenly bodies presided, in succession, over the hours of the day. The association of the weekdays with the respective deities is thus indirect, the days are named for the planets, which were in turn named for the deities.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] Saturdays are days on which the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]) and [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] are commemorated, The day is also a general day of [[prayer for the dead]], because it was on a Saturday that Jesus is believed by some to have laid dead in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]. The [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains hymns on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Saturdays throughout the year.  At the end of services on Saturday, the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] begins with the words: &quot;May Christ our True God, through the [[intercession]]s of his most-pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and right victorious [[Martyr]]s, of our reverend and God-bearing [[Holy Fathers|Fathers]]…&quot;. For the Orthodox, Saturday—with the sole exception of [[Holy Saturday]]–is never a strict [[fast day]]. When a Saturday falls during one of the fasting seasons ([[Great Lent]], [[Nativity Fast]], [[Apostles' Fast]], [[Dormition Fast]]) the fasting rules are always lessened to an extent. The [[Great Feast]] of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]] and the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]] are normally observed as strict fast days, but if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the fast is lessened.

==Saturday Sabbath==
{{See also|Shabbat|Sabbath in seventh-day churches|First day Sabbath}}
For [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Messianic Judaism|Messianics]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s, the seventh day of the week, known as [[Shabbat]] (or [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Sabbath]] for SDA), stretches from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday and is the day of rest. [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches distinguish between Saturday (Sabbath) and the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday). While other Protestant groups, such as SDA, hold that the Lord's Day is the Sabbath and not Sunday. From Scriptures, Jesus rested in the grave on the Sabbath day, which is the day after the day of preparation. In this way, Jesus rested as God did in the beginning during the creation. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] traditionally refer to Saturday as &quot;Seventh Day&quot;, eschewing the &quot;[[paganism|pagan]]&quot; origin of the name. In [[Islamic countries]], Fridays are considered as the last day of the week and are holidays along with [[Thursday]]s; Saturday is called ''Sabt'' (cognate to [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]) and it is the first day of the week in many [[Arab World|Arabic countries]].

==Name and associations in European cultures==
In [[Scandinavia]]n countries, Saturday is called ''lördag,'' &quot;lørdag,&quot; or ''laurdag,'' the name being derived from the old word ''[[laugr]]/laug'' (hence [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name ''Laugardagur''), meaning bath, thus ''Lördag'' equates to bath-day. This is due to the [[Viking]] practice of bathing on Saturdays.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Today, Saturday is officially called ''Samstag'' in all [[German language|German]]-speaking countries, but there it has two names in modern [[Standard German]]. ''Samstag'' is always used in [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], and the German speaking part of [[Switzerland]], and generally used in southern and western [[Germany]]. It derives from [[Old High German]] ''sambaztac'', which itself derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Σάββατο'', and this Greek word derives from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''שבת'' ([[Shabbat]]). However, the current German word for Sabbath is ''Sabbat''. The second name for Saturday in German is ''Sonnabend'', which derives from Old High German ''sunnunaband'', and is closely related to the [[Old English]] word ''sunnanæfen''. It means literally &quot;Sun eve&quot;, i.e., &quot;The day before Sunday&quot;. ''Sonnabend'' is generally used in northern and eastern Germany, and was also the official name for Saturday in [[East Germany]]. 

In the [[Westphalia]]n dialects of [[West Low German|Low Saxon]], in [[East Frisian Low Saxon]] and in the [[Saterland Frisian language]], Saturday is called ''Satertag'', also akin to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''Zaterdag'', which has the same linguistic roots as the English word Saturday. The origin of the [[Old English]] word ''Satur'' is obscure but thought to refer to a particular deity named ''Sætere'' who was venerated by the pre-Christian peoples of north-western Germany, some of whom were the ancestors of the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. Sætere has been identified as either a god associated with the [[harvest]] of possible [[Slav]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;Palgrave, Francis, ''History of the Anglo-Saxons'' (1876), William Tegg &amp; Co., London p.43&lt;/ref&gt; or alternately Sætere could be another name for [[Loki]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/time/smd/smd22.htm Couzens, Reginald C., ''The Stories of the Months and Days'' (1923), ch.22]&lt;/ref&gt; a complex deity associated with both good and evil.

In West Frisian there are also two words for Saturday. In Wood Frisian it is '' saterdei'' and in Clay Frisian it is ''sneon'', derived from ''snjoen'', a combination of Old Frisian ''sunne'', meaning ''sun'' and ''joen'', meaning eve.

All [[Slavic languages]] derive their name for Saturday from the name for [[Sabbath etymology|Sabbath]]: (Czech/Slovak/Polish/Slovene: ''sobota''; Russian: ''суббота'' ''subbota'', Serbian/Ukrainian ''субота'' ''subota'').{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A similar numbering trend is also exhibited by the [[Baltic languages]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Similarly, the [[Romance languages]] follow the [[Greek language|Greek]] usage, so that their word for &quot;Saturday&quot; is also a variation on &quot;Sabbath&quot;: the [[Italian language|Italian]] is ''sabato,'' the [[French language|French]] is ''samedi,'' the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is ''sábado'' and the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is ''sâmbătă.''

The [[Celtic languages]] also name this day for Saturn: [[Irish language|Irish]] ''an Satharn'' or ''dia Sathuirn'', [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''Disathairne'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''dydd Sadwrn'', [[Breton language|Breton]] ''Sadorn'' or ''disadorn''.

==Outside Europe==
The modern [[Maori language|Maori]] name for Saturday, ''rahoroi'', literally means &quot;washing-day&quot; - a vestige of early colonized life when Māori converts would set aside time on the Saturday to wash their whites for Church on Sunday.{{cn|date=August 2012}} A common alternative Māori name for Saturday is the transliteration ''Hatarei''.

The Chinese-based [[Korean language|Korean]] word for Saturday is 토요일 (To-Yo-Il [meaning: Earth - day]) from the Chinese character [[wikt:土|土]] meaning Earth, or Ground but more significantly makes reference to 토성 (To-Sung 土星) which means Saturn.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

In [[India]], Saturday is [[Shanivar]], based on [[Shani]], the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] god manifested in the planet Saturn. In the [[Thai solar calendar]] of [[Thailand]], the day is named from the [[Pali]] word for Saturn, and the color associated with Saturday is [[purple]].{{cn|date=August 2012}}

==Position in the week==
{{see also|Gregorian calendar}}
The international standard [[ISO 8601]] sets Saturday as the sixth day of the week. The three [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) regard Saturday as the seventh [[week|day of the week]]. As a result, many refused the ISO 8601 standards and continue to use Saturday as their seventh day.

This is concordant with the European [[pagan]] tradition, which named the days of the week after the seven [[Classical planets]] (in order [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[Mars]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Jupiter]], [[Venus]], [[Saturn]]), naming the first day of the week for the Sun, perceived as most important, and moving to those perceived as lesser.

==Astrology==
{{Main|Saturn (astrology)}}
In [[astrology]], Saturday is associated with the planet Saturn and symbolized by that planet's symbol [[File:Saturn symbol.svg|22px]].

==Activities==
* Saturday is a [[weekend]] day in most countries (see [[Workweek]]).
* In [[Nepal]] Saturday is last day of the week and is the only official weekly holiday.
* Saturday is the official [[Shabbat|day of rest]] in [[Israel]], on which all government offices and most businesses, including some public transportation, are closed.
* Saturday is the usual day for elections in [[Australia]], the only day on which elections can be held in [[New Zealand]], and the preferred election day in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Louisiana]].
* [[Saturday morning]] is a notable television time block aimed at children while generally airing animated [[cartoons]].
* It is common for clubs, bars and restaurants to be open later on Saturday night than on other nights. Thus &quot;Saturday Night&quot; has come to imply the party scene, and has lent its name to the films ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', which showcased [[New York City|New York]] [[discotheque]]s, ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'', as well as many songs (see below).
* Saturday night is also a popular time slot for comedy shows on television. The most famous of these is ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a skit show that has aired on NBC nearly every week since 1975. Other notable examples include ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]''.  This practice lent its name to the film ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'', starring [[Billy Crystal]].
* In folklore, Saturday was the preferred day to hunt [[vampires]], because on that day they were restricted to their coffins. It was also believed in the [[Balkans]] that someone born on Saturday could see a vampire when it was otherwise invisible, and that such people were particularly apt to become [[vampire hunter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McClelland, Bruce A.|title=Slayers and Their Vampires: A Cultural History of Killing the Dead|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|year=2006|pages=62–79|isbn=978-0-472-06923-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dimitr&gt;{{cite web|author=Димитрова, Иваничка|year=1983|title=Българска народна митология|url=http://umotvorenia.bgrod.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=132&amp;Itemid=46|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in this context, people born on Saturday were specially designated as ''sabbatianoí'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]&lt;ref name=summers&gt;{{cite book|author=Abbott, George F.|year=1903|title=Macedonian Folklore|pages=221–222}} In {{cite book|author=Summers, Montague|origyear=1929|title=The Vampire: His Kith and Kin|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fpaCCyGuMqwC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36|year=2008|publisher=Forgotten Books|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''sâbotnichavi'' in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]];&lt;ref name=dimitr/&gt; the term has been rendered in English as &quot;[[Week-day names#Weekdays numbered from Monday|Sabbatarian]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=summers/&gt;
* The amount of criminal activities that take place on Saturday nights has led to the expression, &quot;[[Saturday night special]]&quot; a [[pejorative]] [[slang]] term used in the United States and Canada for any inexpensive handgun.
* In [[Sweden]], Saturday is usually the only day of the week when children are allowed to eat [[sweets]], ''lördagsgodis''. Lördag derives from lögardag; old word löga meaning to wash/clean.
