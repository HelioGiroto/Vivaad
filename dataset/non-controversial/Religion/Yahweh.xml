'''Yahweh''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|j|ɑː|w|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɑː|hw|eɪ}}; {{lang-he|יהוה}}), is the name of the [[national god]] of [[Israelites|Israel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

Despite the bible's story, according to which the Israelites originated from Mespotamia via slavery in Egypt, the evidence indicates that they were native to [[Canaan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gnuse, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Yahweh, however, was not a [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite god]], and modern scholars see him originating in [[Edom]], the region south of Judah.{{sfn|Gnuse|1997|p=78}}{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=}} The goddess [[Asherah]] may have been Yahweh's consort in the earliest period. Originally the main god of the [[Iron Age]] kingdoms of Israel and Judah, worship of Yahweh alone (monotheism) became entrenched in Judaism in the [[Babylonian captivity|exilic]] and [[Archaeology_of_Israel#Persian_period|Persian periods]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deuteronomy 6 2003 p.6&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4; Michael D Coogan, The Illustrated Guide to World Religions, Oxford University Press (2003) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Bible describes Yahweh as the god who [[The Exodus|delivered Israel from Egypt]] and gave the [[Ten Commandments]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Then God spoke all these words. He said, ‘I am Yahweh your God who brought you out of Egypt, where you lived as slaves. You shall have no other gods to rival me.’”,Exodus 20:1–3, New Jerusalem Bible; New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, (1982) pp. 1174–1175; The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Geoffrey W.

==Name==
{{main|Tetragrammaton}}

[[Biblical Hebrew]] was written with [[Abjad|consonants only]], meaning that the name was written יהוה ([[YHWH]]). The original pronunciation was lost many centuries ago, but the available evidence indicates that it was in all likelihood Yahweh.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=2}} 

The components of YHWH are Y, meaning roughly &quot;he&quot;, and the [[Semitic root|consonantal root]] HWH, which is connected with acts of creation. There appear to be two main lines of reasoning to explain the origin of the name. The first suggests that it is the shortened form of a sentence used in worship, &quot;he causes to be&quot; or &quot;he creates&quot;, from ''el du yahwi seba'ot'', &quot;el who creates the hosts&quot;, meaning the [[Heavenly host|heavenly army]] accompanying the god [[El (deity)|El]] as he marched out beside the earthly armies of Israel.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=2}}

The second looks for the origins of Yahweh to the southeast of Israel, in [[Edom]] and [[Midian]] or even further, in [[South Semitic languages]] like [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. HWY in Arabic is connected with falling or causing to fall, leading to an interpretation of Yahweh as a [[Weather god|storm god]] whose name means &quot;He who causes to fall&quot; (meaning rain, lightning, and his enemies) or &quot;He causes storms&quot;. This helps explain Yahweh's attributes as a storm god (he comes to rescue Israel surrounded by darkness and thick clouds, and the earth trembles, the clouds drop water, and the mountains quake at his appearance), and the way he appropriates attributes from the rival storm god [[Baʿal]].{{sfn|Van der Toorn et al|1999|p=915-916}}

==History==
===The Kenite hypothesis===
The Bible tells a story in which the [[Israelites]] escaped from Egypt, met Yahweh on a mountain-top in the wilderness, agreed to become his [[chosen people]], and conquered Canaan with his help. The archaeological evidence points to an Israelite community arising peacefully and internally in the highlands of Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;Gnuse, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

If Yahweh was not a Canaanite god, this raises the question of where he originated and how he became the national god of Israel and Judah in Iron Age II (1000-586). The first probable record of his name is in two Egyptian inscriptions from the 14th and 13th centuries, as a place-name, Yhw in the region of Edom associated with [[Shasu]] [[Bedouin]]s. According to a widely accepted theory (the &quot;Kenite hypothesis&quot;), the Edomite god YHW could have been brought north to the Canaanite hill country and the early Israelites by migratory Edomite desert tribes, of whom the [[Kenites]] were one.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Toorn et. al. (1999), pp.911-915&lt;/ref&gt;

===National god of Israel===
{{See also|National god}}
In Iron Age I the religious life of ordinary Israelites, like that of other peoples throughout the Ancient Near East, was organised around the family-based [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of the ancestors and devotion to a local god, the &quot;god of the fathers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Toorn (1996), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bible the first king, [[Saul]], was a [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeonite]], a tribe with its roots in Edom, and in order to unify the new kingdom and cement his own authority Saul promoted his own god, Yahweh, as god of the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Toorn (1996), pp.266-267&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, each extended family or clan was the &quot;people&quot; of a particular god, but now the entire Israelite community became the &quot;people of Yahweh&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Toorn (1996), p.275&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yahweh was the god of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Northern Kingdom of Israel]] by at least the early 9th century BCE, and this is confirmed by an inscription from [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] which refers to Yahweh of Samaria, probably meaning the kingdom rather than the city.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Toorn (1996), p.278&lt;/ref&gt; 

More than forty inscriptions mentioning Yahweh, Yahu or Yah have been discovered, all tending to reinforce the centrality of Yahweh to Israelite religion. The inscriptions include blessings, oaths, salutations, votive offerings, seals and prayers. No other gods or goddesses are unambiguously recorded except for contentious references to [[Asherah]], who might be a goddess and Yahweh's consort, or possibly some kind of cult object. A fragment from [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] (9th/8th centuries) mentions [[Baal]] in association with Yahweh, but in this case the word might simply mean &quot;Lord&quot; (the literal meaning of &quot;baal&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2000), pp.40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

A 10th century cult stand from [[Taanach]] (a town in Northern Israel, near [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]) shows, among other images, two winged sphinxes with an empty space between them, possibly meant to represent Yahweh between the [[cherubim]]. A horse or bull figure on the same stand, topped by a solar disk, may represent either Yahweh or Baal, and a stylised tree and female figures are testimony to the presence of goddesses (possibly [[Asherah]]) in the pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2000), pp.41-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence increasingly suggests that many Israelites worshipped Asherah as the consort of Yahweh, and various biblical passages indicate that statues of the goddess were kept in Yahweh's temples in Jerusalem, Bethel, and Samaria.{{sfn|Ackerman|2003|p=395}} Other evidence includes, for example, an 8th century combination of iconography and inscriptions discovered at [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] in the northern Sinai desert&lt;ref&gt;Ze’ev Meshel, [http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/20-4/Meshel.pdf Kuntillet ‘Ajrud: An Israelite Religious Center in Northern Sinai], ''Expedition'' '''20''' (Summer 1978), pp. 50–55&lt;/ref&gt; where a storage jar shows three anthropomorphic figures and an inscription that refers to &quot;Yahweh … and his asherah&quot;.&lt;ref name=dever/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hadley|2000|pp=122–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence includes the many female figurines unearthed in ancient Israel, supporting the view that Asherah functioned as a goddess and consort of Yahweh and was worshiped as the [[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]].&lt;ref name=dever&gt;{{harvnb|Dever|2005}} – see reviews of this book by [http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/4910_6305.pdf Patrick D. Miller], [http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/4910_5127.pdf Yairah Amit].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahwism===
Archaeologists and historical scholars use a variety of ways to organize and interpret the available iconographic and textual information. William G. Dever contrasts &quot;official religion/state religion/book religion&quot; of the elite with “folk religion” of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, Did God Have A Wife?: Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel, Eerdmans Publishing (2005) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Rainer Albertz contrasts &quot;official religion&quot; with &quot;family religion&quot;, &quot;personal piety&quot;, and &quot;internal religious pluralism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Albertz, History of Israelite Religion Vol. 1, Westminster Jonk Knox Press (1994) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Berlinerblau analyzes the evidence in terms of &quot;official religion&quot; and &quot;popular religion&quot; in ancient Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Berlinerblau, Official Religion and Popular Religion in Pre-Exilic Ancient Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick D. Miller has distinguished three broad categories of Yahwism, orthodox, heterodox, and syncretistic.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2000), pp.46–62&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Yahwism demanded the exclusive worship of Yahweh (although without denying the existence of other gods). The powers of blessing (health, wealth, continuity, fertility) and salvation (forgiveness, victory, deliverance from oppression and threat) resided fully in Yahweh, and his will was communicated via oracle and prophetic vision or audition. [[Divination]], soothsaying, and [[necromancy]] were prohibited. The individual or community could cry out to Yahweh and would receive a divine response, mediated by priestly or prophetic figures.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick D Miller, The Religion of Ancient Israel, Westminster John Knox Press (2000) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanctuaries were erected in various places and were used to express devotion to Yahweh by means of sacrifice, festival meals and celebrations, prayer, and praise. Toward the end of the seventh century (BCE) in Judah, worship of Yahweh was restricted to the temple in Jerusalem, while the major sanctuaries in the northern kingdom were at Bethel (near the southern border) and Dan (in the north). Certain times were set for the gathering of the people to celebrate the gifts of Yahweh and the deity’s acts of deliverance and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2000), pp.48–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Everything in the moral realm was understood as a part of relation to Yahweh as a manifestation of holiness. Family relationships and the welfare of the weaker members of society were protected by divine law, and purity of conduct, dress, food, etc. were regulated. Religious leadership resided in priests who were associated with sanctuaries, and also in prophets, who were bearers of divine oracles. In the political sphere the king was understood as the appointee and agent of Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick D Miller, The Religion of Ancient Israel, Westminster John Knox Press (2000) pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterodox Yahwism is described by Miller as a mixture of elements of orthodox Yahwism with particular practices that conflicted with orthodox Yahwism or were not customarily a part of it. For example, heterodox Yahwism included the presence of cult objects rejected in by orthodox expressions, such as the [[Asherah]], figurines of various sorts (females, horses and riders, animals and birds, and the calves or bulls of the Northern Kingdom. The &quot;high places&quot; as centers of worship seems to have moved from an acceptable place within Yahwism to an increasingly condemned status in official and orthodox circles. Efforts to know the future or the will of the deity could also be understood as heterodox if they went outside the boundaries of orthodox Yahwism, and even commonly accepted revelatory mechanism such as dreams could be condemned if the resulting message was perceived as false. Consulting mediums, wizards, and diviners was often employed by heterodox Yahwists.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2000), pp.52–56&lt;/ref&gt;

Syncretism covers the worship of Baal, the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, and stars), the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot; and other deities as well as practices such as child sacrifice: &quot;Other gods were invoked and serviced in time of need or blessing and provision for life when the worship of Yahweh seemed inadequate for those purposes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2000), pp.58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Israel and Judah ===

It has traditionally been believed that [[monotheism]] was part of Israel's original covenant with Yahweh on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], and the idolatry criticized by the prophets was due to Israel's backsliding.&lt;ref&gt;Yehezkel Kaufmann, &quot;The Religion of Israel, From its Beginnings to the Babylonian Exile&quot;, translated and abridged by Moshe Greenberg (University of Chicago Press, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; But during the 20th century it became increasingly recognised that the Bible's presentation raises a number of questions: Why do the Ten Commandments declare that there should be no other gods &quot;before Me&quot; (Yahweh), if there are no other gods at all? Why do the Israelites sing at the crossing of the Red Sea that &quot;there is no god like you, O Yahweh&quot;,{{Bibleref2c|Ex|15:11}} implying that other gods exist? These observations eventually overthrew the belief that Israel had always worshipped no other god but Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard E. ''Who Wrote the Bible?'' (Harper &amp; Row, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Israelite worship of Canaanite gods appears both in the Bible and the archaeological record. Respectful references to the goddess [[Asherah]] or her symbol, for example, as part of the worship of Yahweh, are found in the eighth century inscriptions from [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] and Khirbet el-Qom, and references to the Canaanite gods [[Resheph]] and [[Deber]] appear without criticism in the original Jewish text of {{Bibleref2|Habakkuk|3:5}}. While traditionally these words have been understood to be either Jewish words whose meaning has been derived from characteristics of these Canaanite deities&lt;ref&gt;G. Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren, and Heinz-Josef Fabry, eds., ''Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament''. Vol. 14. s.v. &quot;Resep.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; or references to demons,&lt;ref&gt;Berakhot 5a&lt;/ref&gt; some interpret these as evidence of Israelite recognition of these gods as part of the military retinue of Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Smith, ''The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts'' (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;host of heaven&quot; is also mentioned without criticism in {{Bibleref2|1_Kings|22:19}} and {{Bibleref2|Zephaniah|1:5}}. Though the &quot;host of heaven&quot; has traditionally been interpreted as either the stars/heavenly bodies or the host of angels/heavenly spirits depending on the context,&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Friedrich Oehler, Theology of the Old Testament, 2nd ed. trans. George E. Day (New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Publishers, 1884), 437-443.&lt;/ref&gt; some again have interpreted this term to refer to a pantheon of Israelite gods.&lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Smith, ''The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts'' (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 47-155.&lt;/ref&gt; The god El is also continually identified with Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mark S. &quot;Untold Stories: The Bible and Ugaritic Studies in the Twentieth Century&quot; (Hendrickson Publishers, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel inherited polytheism from late first-millennium Canaan, and Canaanite religion in turn had its roots in the religion of second-millennium [[Ugarit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Toorn 1999&quot;&gt;Karel van der Toorn, editor, &quot;Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible&quot; (second edition, Eerdmans, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd millennium, polytheism was expressed through the concepts of the [[Divine Council]] and the divine family, a single entity with four levels: the chief god and his wife (El and Asherah); the seventy divine children or &quot;stars of El&quot; (including Baal, Astarte, Anat, probably Resheph, as well as the sun-goddess Shapshu and the moon-god Yerak); the head helper of the divine household, Kothar wa-Hasis; and the servants of the divine household, including the messenger-gods who would later appear as the &quot;angels&quot; of the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Karl Gnuse, &quot;No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel&quot; (Sheffield Academic Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest stage Yahweh was one of the seventy children of El, each of whom was the patron deity of one of the seventy nations. This is illustrated by the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint texts of Deuteronomy 32:8–9, in which El, as the head of the divine assembly, gives each member of the divine family a nation of his own, &quot;according to the number of the divine sons&quot;: Israel is the portion of Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;Meindert Dijkstra, &quot;El the God of Israel, Israel the People of YHWH: On the Origins of Ancient Israelite Yahwism&quot; (in &quot;Only One God? Monotheism in Ancient Israel and the Veneration of the Goddess Asherah&quot;, ed. Bob Becking, Sheffield Academic Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The later [[Masoretic text]], evidently uncomfortable with the polytheism expressed by the phrase, altered it to &quot;according to the number of the children of Israel&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Meindert Djikstra, &quot;I have Blessed you by Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah: Texts with Religious Elements from the Soil Archive of Ancient Israel&quot; (in &quot;Only One God? Monotheism in Ancient Israel and the Veneration of the Goddess Asherah&quot;, ed. Bob Beckering, Sheffield Academic Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the eighth to the sixth centuries El became identified with Yahweh, Yahweh-El became the husband of the goddess Asherah, and the other gods and the divine messengers gradually became mere expressions of Yahweh's power.&lt;ref&gt;Karel van der Toorn, &quot;Goddesses in Early Israelite Religion in Ancient Goddesses: the Myths and the Evidence&quot; (editors Lucy Goodison and Christine Morris, University of Wisconsin Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Yahweh is cast in the role of the Divine King ruling over all the other deities, as in Psalm 29:2, where the &quot;sons of God&quot; are called upon to worship Yahweh; and as Ezekiel 8-10 suggests, the Temple itself became Yahweh's palace, populated by those in his retinue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toorn 1999&quot; /&gt;

It is in this period that the earliest clear monotheistic statements appear in the Bible, for example in the apparently seventh-century Deuteronomy 4:35, 39, 1 Samuel 2:2, 2 Samuel 7:22, 2 Kings 19:15, 19 (= Isaiah 37:16, 20), and Jeremiah 16:19, 20 and the sixth-century portion of Isaiah 43:10–11, 44:6, 8, 45:5–7, 14, 18, 21, and 46:9.&lt;ref&gt;Ziony Zevit, &quot;The Religions of Ancient Israel: A Synthesis of Parallactic Approaches (Continuum, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Because many of the passages involved appear in works associated with either Deuteronomy, the Deuteronomistic History (Joshua through Kings) or in Jeremiah, most recent scholarly treatments have suggested that a Deuteronomistic movement of this period developed the idea of monotheism as a response to the religious issues of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark S 2001&quot;&gt;Mark S.Smith, &quot;Untold Stories: The Bible and Ugaritic Studies in the Twentieth Century&quot; (Hendrickson Publishers, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first factor behind this development involves changes in Israel's social structure. At Ugarit, social identity was strongest at the level of the family: legal documents, for example, were often made between the sons of one family and the sons of another. Ugarit's religion, with its divine family headed by El and Asherah, mirrored this human reality.&lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Smith and Patrick D Miller, &quot;The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel&quot; (Harper &amp; Row, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true in ancient Israel through most of the monarchy – for example, the story of Achan in Joshua 8 suggests an extended family as the major social unit. However, the family lineages went through traumatic changes beginning in the eighth century due to major social stratification, followed by Assyrian incursions. In the seventh and sixth centuries, we begin to see expressions of individual identity (Deuteronomy 26:16; Jeremiah 31:29–30; Ezekiel 18). A culture with a diminished lineage system, deteriorating over a long period from the ninth or eighth century onward, less embedded in traditional family patrimonies, might be more predisposed both to hold the individual accountable for his behavior, and to see an individual deity accountable for the cosmos. In short, the rise of the individual as the basic social unit led to the rise of a single god replacing a divine family.&lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Smith, &quot;Untold Stories: The Bible and Ugaritic Studies in the Twentieth Century&quot; (Hendrickson Publishers, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major factor was the rise of the neo-Assyrian and neo-Babylonian empires. As long as Israel was, from its own perspective, part of a community of similar small nations, it made sense to see the Israelite pantheon on par with the other nations, each one with its own patron god – the picture described with Deuteronomy 32:8–9. The assumption behind this worldview was that each nation was as powerful as its patron god.&lt;ref&gt;William G. Dever, &quot;Did God Have a Wife? Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient ISrael&quot; (Eerdman's, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the neo-Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom in ca. 722 challenged this, for if the neo-Assyrian empire were so powerful, so must be its god; and conversely, if Israel could be conquered (and later Judah, c. 586), it implied that Yahweh in turn was a minor divinity. The crisis was met by separating the heavenly power and earthly kingdoms. Even though Assyria and Babylon were so powerful, the new monotheistic thinking in Israel reasoned, this did not mean that the god of Israel and Judah was weak. Assyria had not succeeded because of the power of its god [[Marduk]]; it was Yahweh who was using Assyria to punish and purify the one nation which Yahweh had chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark S 2001&quot; /&gt;

By the post-Exilic period, full monotheism had emerged: Yahweh was the sole god, not just of Israel, but of the whole world. If the nations were tools of Yahweh, then the new king who would come to redeem Israel might not be a Judean as taught in older literature (e.g. Psalm 2). Now, even a foreigner such as Cyrus the Persian could serve as the Lord's anointed (Isaiah 44:28, 45:1). One god stood behind all the world's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark S 2001&quot; /&gt;

===Modern Judaism===
{{see also|God in Judaism}}
Jews ceased to pronounce the name in the [[intertestamental period]], replacing it with the common noun [[Elohim]], “the God”, to demonstrate the universal sovereignty of Israel's deity over all others. At the same time, the divine name was increasingly regarded as too sacred to be uttered, and was replaced in spoken ritual by the word [[Adonai]] (“My Lord”), or with [[haShem]] (“the Name”) in everyday speech,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yahweh.&quot; ''Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions.'' Web: 7 Oct 2010.

===Christianity===
Almost all Bibles ([[KJV]], [[Douay-Rheims Bible|DRC]], [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]], [[English Standard Version|ESV]], [[New American Standard Bible|NASB]], [[New International Version|NIV]], [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|NJPS]], [[NRSV]], [[New American Bible|NAB]], [[NABRE]], [[Confraternity Bible|CCD]], [[New English Bible|NEB]], [[Revised English Bible|REB]], [[NKJV]], etc.), substitute the titles &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;God&quot; in [[small caps]] wherever the [[tetragrammaton]] appears in the [[Masoretic text|Hebrew]]; exceptions include the [[Jerusalem Bible]] and [[New Jerusalem Bible]], and a few uncommon translations such as the [[Emphasized Bible|Rotherham Emphasized Bible]]. The liturgical use of &quot;Yahweh&quot; in vernacular worship was banned by the Vatican in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CNS STORY: No 'Yahweh' in songs, prayers at Catholic Masses, Vatican rules | accessdate = 2009–07–29 | url = http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0804119.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] has directed that the word &quot;Lord&quot; and its equivalent in other languages be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Liturgiam authenticam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sacred Name Movement]] is a small Christian movement, active since the 1930s, which propagates the use of the name Yahweh in Bible translations and in liturgy. The Jehovah's Witnesses [[New World Translation]] consistently uses &quot;Jehovah&quot;, even inserting it into the New Testament in place of the Greek &quot;[[kurios]]&quot; (meaning &quot;Lord&quot;) in many places.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jehovah's Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal.'' Bruce M. Metzger 1953. Theology Today 10/1, pp. 65-85.&lt;/ref&gt;
