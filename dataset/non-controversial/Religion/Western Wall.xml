The '''Western Wall''', '''Wailing Wall''' or '''Kotel''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang-he-a|הַכֹּתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי|He-Kotel.ogg}}, [[transliteration|translit.]]: ''{{lang|he-Latn|HaKotel HaMa'aravi}}''; [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] pronunciation: ''Kosel''; {{lang-ar|حائط البراق}}, [[transliteration|translit.]]: ''Ḥā'iṭ Al-Burāq'', [[translation|translat.]]: The [[Buraq]] Wall) is located in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]] at the foot of the western side of the [[Temple Mount]]. It is a remnant of the ancient wall that surrounded the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple]]'s courtyard, and is arguably the most sacred site recognized by the Jewish faith outside of the Temple Mount itself. Just over half the wall, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, commonly believed to have been constructed around 19 BCE by [[Herod the Great]], but recent excavations indicate that the works were not finished during Herod's lifetime. The remaining layers were added from the 7th century onwards. The Western Wall refers not only to the exposed section facing a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, but also to the sections concealed behind structures running along the whole length of the Temple Mount, such as the [[Little Western Wall]]–a 25&amp;nbsp;ft (8&amp;nbsp;m) section in the Muslim Quarter.

It has been a site for Jewish prayer and pilgrimage for centuries; the earliest source mentioning Jewish attachment to the site dates back to the 4th century. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none were successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish community and the Muslim religious leadership, who were worried that the wall was being used to further Jewish nationalistic claims to the Temple Mount and Jerusalem. Outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace and an international commission was convened in 1930 to determine the rights and claims of Muslims and Jews in connection with the wall. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the wall came under Jordanian control and Jews were barred from the site for 19 years until Israel captured the Old City in 1967.

Early Jewish texts referred to a “western wall of the Temple”,&lt;ref name=SSR&gt;[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2–8&lt;/ref&gt; but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to today’s Western Wall or to another wall which stood within the Temple complex. The earliest clear Jewish use of the term Western Wall as referring to the wall visible today was by the 11th-century [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]]. The name “Wailing Wall”, and descriptions such as &quot;wailing place&quot; appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wailing Wall&quot; appears, for example, in J.J. Reynolds, ''Jewish Advocate for the Young'' (1859). H. Bonar, ''Days and Nights in the East'' (1866) and [[J.R. Macduff]],''Memories of Olivet'' (1868), and many later works.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This description stemmed from the Jewish practice of coming to the site to mourn and bemoan the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]. During the 1920s with the growing Arab-Jewish tensions over rights at the wall, the Arabs began referring to the wall as al-Buraq. This was based on the tradition that the wall was the place where [[Muhammad]] tethered his miraculous winged steed, [[Buraq]].

[[File:Klagemauer.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Panorama of the Western Wall with the [[Dome of the Rock]] (left) and [[al-Aqsa mosque]] (right) in the background]]
The Western Wall commonly refers to a 187 foot (57 m) exposed section of ancient wall situated on the western flank of the [[Temple Mount]]. This section faces a large plaza and is set aside for prayer. In its entirety, however, the above ground portion of the Western Wall stretches for {{Convert|1600|ft|m|0}}, most of which is hidden behind residential structures built along its length. Other revealed sections include the southern part of the Wall which measures approximately {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} and another much shorter section known as the [[Little Western Wall]] which is located close to the [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Iron Gate|Iron Gate]]. The wall functions as a [[retaining wall]], built to support the extensive renovations that [[Herod the Great]] carried out around 19 BCE. Herod expanded the small quasi-natural plateau on which the [[Solomon's temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]s stood into the wide expanse of the Temple Mount visible today.

At the Western Wall Plaza, the total height of the Wall from its foundation is estimated at {{Convert|105|ft|m|0}}, with the exposed section standing approximately {{Convert|62|ft|m|0}} high. The Wall consists of 45 stone courses, 28 of them above ground and 17 underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The next four layers were added by [[Umayyad]]s in the 7th century.

==History==
===Construction 19 BCE===
[[File:Kotel engraving 1850.jpg|thumb|Engraving, 1850]]
According to the [[Tanakh]], [[Solomon's Temple]] was built atop the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and destroyed by the [[Babylonia]]ns in 586 BCE, and the [[Second Temple]] completed and dedicated in 516 BCE.  Around 19 BCE [[Herod the Great]] began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to renovating and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, resulting in an enlarged enclosure. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death found under the massive [[Meleke]] [[Jerusalem stone|foundation stones]] in the southern section of the wall inside a [[Mikveh|ritual bath]] which predates the construction of the renovated Temple Mount complex and was filled in to support the new walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45419597/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/coin-discovery-sheds-new-light-sacred-jerusalem-site/ Coin discovery sheds new light on sacred Jerusalem site (AP)]&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that Herod did not build the entire wall and that construction was not close to being complete when he died. The finds confirms the description by historian [[Josephus Flavius]], which state that constructions were finished only during the reign of [[Agrippa II|King Agrippa II]], Herod’s great-grandson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/about_eng.asp?Modul_id=14|title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn’t Finish it|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;

===Roman Empire and rise of Christianity 100–500 CE===
In the early centuries of the [[Common Era]], after the Roman defeat of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE, Jews were banned from Jerusalem. There is some evidence that Roman emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries did permit them to visit the city to worship on the Mount of Olives and sometimes on the Temple Mount itself.&lt;ref name=UJT&gt;{{Cite book

This was because an Imperial decree from Rome barred Jews from living in Jerusalem. Just once per year they were permitted to return and bitterly grieve about the fate of their people. Comparable accounts survive, including those by the Church Father, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and by [[Jerome]] in his commentary to [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] written in 392 CE. In the 4th century, Christian sources reveal that the Jews encountered great difficulty in buying the right to pray near the Western Wall, at least on the 9th of Av.&lt;ref name=UJT/&gt; In 425 CE, the Jews of the Galilee wrote to Byzantine empress [[Aelia Eudocia]] seeking permission to pray by the ruins of the Temple.

After his victory, he sought out the ruins, but they had been hidden beneath heaps of rubbish.

===Ottoman period 1517–1917===
[[File:Wailing Wall by Gustav Bauernfeind.png|thumb|left|upright|''Wailing Wall, Jerusalem'', by Gustav Bauernfeind (19th century).]]
In 1517, the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] under [[Selim I]] conquered Jerusalem from the [[Mamluk]]s who had held it since 1250. The Ottomans had a benevolent attitude towards the Jews, having welcomed thousands of Jewish refugees who had recently been [[Alhambra Decree|expelled]] from Spain by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1492. [[Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] was so taken with Jerusalem and its plight that he ordered a magnificent fortress-wall built around the entire city, today's [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] wall.

There are various accounts of Suleiman's efforts to locate the Temple's ruins. Rabbi Eliezer Nachman Puah, (ca. 1540), relates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;”I have been told that in the day of Sultan Suleiman the site of the Temple was not known and the Sultan had every corner of Jerusalem searched for it. One day the man in charge of the work, despairing after much searching and inquiring in vain, saw a woman coming with a basket of rubbish and filth upon her head. He asked her: “What are you carrying on your head?” – And she replied:
“Rubbish.”&lt;br /&gt;
“And to where are you carrying it?”&lt;br /&gt;
“To such and such a place.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Where do you live?”&lt;br /&gt;
“In Bethlehem.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Is there no dunghill between Bethlehem and this place?”&lt;br /&gt;
“It is a tradition among us that whoever takes a little rubbish to that place performs a meritorious act.”&lt;br /&gt;
The curiosity of the officer was aroused and he commanded a great number of men to remove the rubbish from that place...and the holy site was revealed. When the Sultan learned of this, he rejoiced greatly and ordered the place to be swept and sprinkled and the Western Wall washed with rosewater...”&lt;ref name=LOP/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the second half of the 16th century, Suleiman the Magnificent gave the Jews rights to worship at the Western Wall and had his court architect [[Mimar Sinan]] build an oratory for them there.&lt;ref name=ISA&gt;{{Cite news

 | quote = It is possible that official recognition of the right of Jews to pray by the Wall was granted already in the second half of the sixteenth century by a ''firman'' (official decree) issued by Suleiman the Magnificent. This firman may have been related to the efforts of the Ottoman ruler to lure Jews to Palestine as a counterbalance to the Arab population, which had rebelled against the new rulers, who were Turkish rather than Arabs.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1625 arranged prayers at the Wall are mentioned for the first time by a scholar whose name has not been preserved. Rabbi Gedaliah of Semitizi, who went to Jerusalem in 1699, writes that scrolls of the Law were brought to the Wall on occasions of public distress and calamity.&lt;ref name=SLC/&gt;

Over the centuries, land close to the Wall became built up. Public access to the Wall was through the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a labyrinth of narrow alleyways. In May 1840 a [[firman (decree)|firman]] issued by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] forbade the Jews to pave the passageway in front of the Wall. It also cautioned them against “raising their voices and displaying their books there.” They were, however, allowed “to pay visits to it as of old.”&lt;ref name=&quot;report1930&quot;/&gt;

Rabbi Joseph Schwarz writing in the mid-19th century records:

&lt;blockquote&gt;”This wall is visited by all our brothers on every feast and festival; and the large space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as we have a very old [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall.

====September 1928 disturbances====
[[File:Kotel jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The placing of a ''[[Mechitza]]'' such as this at the wall in 1928 was the catalyst for confrontation between the Arabs, Jews and Mandate authorities]]
In 1922, a status quo agreement issued by the mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall. The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the [[Chacham Bashi]]. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, [[Edward Keith-Roach]], acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen.  In practice, a flexible [[modus vivendi]] had emerged and such screens had been put up from time to time when large numbers of people gathered to pray.

On September 24, 1928, the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]], British police resorted to forcefully removing a [[Mechitza|screen]] used to separate men and women at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs. Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. The [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld|Chief Rabbi of the ultraorthodox Jews in Jerusalem]] issued a protest letter on behalf of his community, the [[Edah HaChareidis]], and [[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Yisroel]] strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site. Various communal leaders called for a general strike. A large rally was held in the [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva]], following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed the British officer involved in the fiasco was sheltering.&lt;ref name=GoJ/&gt;

Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach described the screen as violating the [[Status quo (Holy Land sites)|Ottoman status quo]] that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the [[Supreme Muslim Council]]. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].&lt;ref name=PYIL&gt;{{Cite book

:{{Main|1929 Palestine riots}}
In the summer of 1929, the Mufti ordered an opening be made at the southern end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.&lt;ref name=VI/&gt;

On August 14, 1929, after attacks on individual Jews praying at the Wall, 6,000 Jews demonstrated in Tel Aviv, shouting “The Wall is ours.” The next day, the Jewish fast of [[Tisha B'Av]], 300 youths raised the Zionist flag and sang the Zionist anthem at the Wall.&lt;ref name=OR/&gt; The day after, on August 16, an organized mob of 2,000 Muslim Arabs descended on the Western Wall, injuring the beadle and burning prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication.

In 1930, in response to the 1929 riots, the British Government appointed a commission &quot;to determine the rights and claims of Muslims and Jews in connection with the Western or Wailing Wall&quot;. The [[League of Nations]] approved the commission on condition that the members were not British.

The Jews requested that the Commission take the following actions:
*To give recognition to the immemorial claim that the Wailing Wall is a Holy Place for the Jews, not only for the Jews in Palestine, but also for the Jews of the whole world.
*To decree that the Jews shall have the right of access to the Wall for devotion and for prayers in accordance with their ritual without interference or interruption.
*To decree that it shall be permissible to continue the Jewish services under the conditions of decency and decorum characteristic of a sacred custom that has been carried on for many centuries without infringement upon the religious rights of others.
*To decree that the drawing up of any regulations that may be necessary as to such devotions and prayers, shall be entrusted to the Rabbinate of Palestine, who shall thus re-assume full responsibility in that matter, in discharge of which responsibility they may consult the Rabbinate of the world.
*To suggest, if the Commissioners approve of the plan, to the Mandatory Power that it should make the necessary arrangements by which the properties now occupied by the Moghrabi Waqf might be vacated, the Waqf authorities accepting in lieu of them certain new buildings to be erected upon some eligible site in Jerusalem, so that the charitable purpose, for which this Waqf was given, may still be fulfilled.

The Commission noted that 'the Jews do not claim any proprietorship to the Wall or to the Pavement in front of it (concluding speech of Jewish Counsel, Minutes, page 908).'

David Yellin testifying before the commission stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;”Being judged before you today stands a nation that has been deprived of everything that is dear and sacred to it from its emergence in its own land – the graves of its patriarchs, the graves of its great kings, the graves of its holy prophets and, above all, the site of its glorious Temple. Everything has been taken from it and of all the witnesses to its sanctity, only one vestige remains – one side of a tiny portion of a wall, which, on one side, borders the place of its former Temple. In front of this bare stone wall, that nation stands under the open sky, in the heat of summer and in the rains of winter, and pours out its heart to its God in heaven.”&lt;ref name=VI/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Anglo-American Committee at the Western Wall.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] at the Western Wall, 1946]]
The Commission concluded that the wall, and the adjacent pavement and Moroccan Quarter, were solely owned by the Muslim ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|waqf]]''.  However, Jews had the right to &quot;free access to the Western Wall for the purpose of devotions at all times&quot;, subject to some stipulations that limited which objects could be brought to the Wall and forbade the blowing of the [[shofar]], which was made illegal. Muslims were forbidden to disrupt Jewish devotions by driving animals or other means.&lt;ref name=&quot;report1930&quot;/&gt; Yitzchak Orenstein, who held the position of Rabbi of the Kotel, recorded in April 1930 that “Our master, Rabbi [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld]] came to pray this morning by the ''Kosel'' and one of those present produced a small chair for the ''Rav'' to rest on for a few moments. However, no sooner had the ''Rav'' sat down did an Arab officer appear and pull the chair away from under him.”&lt;ref name=GoJ/&gt; During the 1930s, at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, young Jews persistently flouted the shofar ban each year and blew the shofar resulting in their arrest and prosecution. They were usually fined or sentenced to imprisonment for three to six months.

===Jordanian rule 1948–67===
During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] the Old City together with the Wall was [[Jordanian occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem|occupied by Jordan]]. Article VIII of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements#With Jordan|1949 Armistice Agreement]] provided for Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall. However for the following nineteen years, despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international bodies to attempt to enforce the armistice agreement, Jordan refused to abide by this clause.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories.&lt;ref name=Gilbert254&gt;Martin Gilbert, Jerusalem in the Twentieth Century (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996, p254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Israeli23&gt;{{Cite book

====&quot;Al Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd&quot; sign====
During the Jordanian occupation of the Old City, a ceramic street sign in Arabic and English was affixed to the stones of the ancient wall. Attached three metres up, it was made up of eight separate ceramic tiles and said ''Al Buraq'' in Arabic at the top with the English &quot;Al-Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd&quot; below. When Israeli soldiers arrived at the wall in June 1967, one attempted to scrawl Hebrew lettering on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Narkiss1970&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bezalel Narkiss|title=Picture history of Jewish civilization|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oWKFAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=May 19, 2011|year=1970|publisher=H.

===Israeli rule 1967–present===
[[File:Soldiers Western Wall 1967.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The iconic image of Israeli soldiers shortly after the capture of the Wall during the Six-Day War.]]

Following Israel's victory during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the Western Wall came under Israeli control. [[Yitzchak Rabin]], fifth [[Prime Minister of Israel]], described the moment Israeli soldiers reached the Wall:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was one moment in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers — under [[Mordechai Gur|Gur]]'s command — reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and never will be, another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody prepared it and nobody was prepared for it; it was as if Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping — loudly and in pain — over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the [[Kaddish]] prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of &quot;[[Hatikvah]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Forty-eight hours after capturing the wall, the military, without explicit government order, hastily proceeded to demolish the entire [[Moroccan Quarter]] which stood four metres from the Wall. The Sheikh Eid Mosque, which was built over one of Jerusalem's oldest [[madrassa|Islamic schools]], the Afdiliyeh, named after one of [[Saladin]]'s sons, was pulled down to make way for the plaza. It was one of three or four that survived from Saladin's time.&lt;ref&gt;Nir Hasson,[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/rare-photograph-reveals-ancient-jerusalem-mosque-destroyed-in-1967.premium-1.436593 'Rare photograph reveals ancient Jerusalem mosque destroyed in 1967,'] at Haaretz, 15 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;650 people consisting of 106 Arab families were ordered to leave their homes at night.

According to [[Eyal Weizman]], [[Chaim Herzog]], who later became Israel's sixth president, took much of the credit for the destruction of the neighbourhood:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we visited the Wailing Wall we found a toilet attached to it ... we decided to remove it and from this we came to the conclusion that we could evacuate the entire area in front of the Wailing Wall ... a historical opportunity that will never return ... We knew that the following Saturday, June 14, would be the Jewish festival of [[Shavuot]] and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The dusty plaza stretched from the wall to the Jewish Quarter. The section of the Wall dedicated to prayers was extended southwards to double its original length from 30 to 60 metres, while the 4 metre space facing the Wall grew to 40 metres. Thus the small pre-1967 120 square metre area in front of the wall became the vast Western Wall Plaza, covering 20,000 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The new plaza created in 1967 is used for worship and public gatherings, including [[Bar mitzvah]] celebrations and the swearing-in ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the wall on the Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of [[Tisha B'Av]], which marks the destruction of the Temple and on [[Yom Yerushalayim|Jerusalem Day]], which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.

====Robinson's Arch====
[[File:The remains of Robinson's Arch on the western side of the Temple Mount.jpg|thumb|The remains of Robinson's Arch above excavated remnants of the ancient street below.]]
{{main|Robinson's Arch}}

At the southern end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=&quot;virtual&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/Robinsons_Arch.html Jewish Virtual Library], retrieved March 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;virtual&quot;/&gt;

The need for such an area became apparent when in in 1989, after repeated attacks by [[haredim]], activists belonging to a group called [[Women Of The Wall]] petitioned to secure the right of women to pray at the wall without restrictions. Ultimately, in 2003 [[Israel's Supreme Court]] disallowed any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional [[tallit|prayer shawls]] at the plaza itself, but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson's Arch to host such events.&lt;ref name=&quot;wound&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Josh|title=Embassy Letter on Kotel Rubs Salt in the Wound|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/124477/|accessdate=July 13, 2010|newspaper=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date=February 5, 2010|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall.

In November 2010, the government approved a NIS 85m ($23m) scheme to improve access and infrastructure at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-approves-23-million-plan-to-renovate-near-western-wall-1.325927 Israel approves $23 million plan to renovate near Western Wall], ''Haartez'', (November 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Western Wall3358.JPG|thumb|right|Replica of the verse carved in the Isaiah Stone]]
The Isaiah Stone, located under Robinson's Arch, has a carved inscription in Hebrew from Isaiah 66:14: 
וראיתם ושש לבכם ועצמותיכם כדשא תפרחנה (&quot;And when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb&quot;).

====Wilson's Arch====
[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall BW 2.JPG|thumb|left|Torah Ark inside men's section of Wilson's Arch]]
{{main|Wilson's Arch (Jerusalem)}}
In 2005, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation initiated a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall [[Shmuel Rabinovitch]].  Its goal was to renovate and restore the area within [[Wilson's Arch (Jerusalem)|Wilson's Arch]], the covered area to the left of worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotel&quot;&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=3 English.thekotel.org TheKotel.org], retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaa-conservation.org.il/Projects_Item_eng.asp?id=49&amp;subject_id=10&amp;site_id=3 iaa-conservation.org], retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restoration to the men's section included a [[Torah ark]] that can house over 100 [[Torah scroll]]s, in addition to new bookshelves, a library, heating for the winter, and air conditioning for the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotel&quot;/&gt;  A new room was also built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;kotel&quot;/&gt; New construction also included a women's section,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=803&amp;CatId=2 The Kotel, note about May 25, 2006.], retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; overlooking the men's prayer area, so that women could use this separate area to &quot;take part in the services held inside under the Arch&quot; for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=628&amp;CatId=4 English.TheKotel.org], retrieved March 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2010, a [[Ner Tamid]], an oil-burning &quot;eternal light,&quot; was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson's Arch, the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;ner&quot;&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=2715&amp;CatId=4 Thekotel.org, note for July 25, 2010], retrieved March 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, requests had been made for many years that &quot;an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza, as is the custom in Jewish synagogues, to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple,&quot; especially in the closest place to those ancient flames.&lt;ref name=&quot;ner&quot;/&gt;

[[File:USNAVY Kotel Service.jpg|thumb|Asst. U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain [[Arnold Resnicoff|Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff]] leads an unusual interfaith service.]]
A number of special worship events have been held since the renovation.  They have taken advantage of the cover, temperature control,&lt;ref name=&quot;night&quot;&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=131&amp;CatId=4 The Kotel.org, note on February 3, 2006.], retrieved March 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and enhanced security.&lt;ref name=&quot;pope&quot;&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=80 TheKotel.org, Lag B'omer 2009], retrieved March 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation.  At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain [[Arnold Resnicoff|Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff]] was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the [[Priestly Blessing]], recited by Resnicoff, who is a [[Kohen]]. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem Post'', Sep 5, 1983, and ''Jerusalem Post'' International Edition, Sep 11–17, 1983, &quot;U.S. Navy Chaplain Conducts Western Wall Interfaith Litany&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/News/122901/news_pf/NorthPinellas/Lion__lamb_reside_in_.shtml ''St Petersburg Times''], retrieved March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology and ritual==
===Judaism===
[[File:Jews place of wailing, 1860.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Jews' Place of Wailing, 1844&quot;. (1860 engraving)]]
In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as the sole remnant of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]]. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]].  While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,&lt;ref&gt;[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: &quot;Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.&quot;; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: &quot;I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: “In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.”&lt;/ref&gt; This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.

Jewish tradition teaches that the Western Wall was built by [[King Solomon]] and that the wall we see today is built upon his foundations, which date from the time of the [[First Temple]].&lt;ref name=KHB&gt;Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be’aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish midrashic texts compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refer to a western wall of the Temple which “would never be destroyed.”&lt;ref name=SSR/&gt; Some scholars were of the opinion that this referred to a wall of the Temple itself which has long since vanished. Others believed that the wall still stood and was actually a surviving wall of the Temple courtyard. However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=AH/&gt; Jewish sources teach that when Roman Emperor [[Vespasian]] ordered the destruction of the Temple, he ordered Pangar, Duke of Arabia, to destroy the Western Wall. Pangar however could not destroy the wall because of God's promise that the Wall will never be destroyed. When asked by Titus why he did not destroy it, Pangar replied that it would stand as a reminder of what Titus had conquered. He was duly executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tradition that states that when water starts trickling through the stones of the Wall, it is a signal of the advent of the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall. He cites the Zohar which writes that the word ''kotel'', meaning wall, is made up of two parts: &quot;Ko&quot;, which has the numerical value of God’s name, and &quot;Tel&quot;, meaning mount, which refers to the Temple and its Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish sources, including the [[Zohar]], write that the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116&lt;/ref&gt; The Midrash quotes a 4th century scholar: “Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never moved away from the Western Wall”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2&lt;/ref&gt; 18th century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that “after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour”.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prayer at the Wall====

The sages state that anyone who prays in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], “it is as if he has prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is situated there and it is open to hear prayer”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] 35&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish Law dictates that when Jews pray the [[Amidah|Silent Prayer]], they should face [[mizrah|towards Jerusalem]], the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' 18:10. The ''[[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf hachaim]]'' ([[Orach Chaim]] 94:1:4 citing [[Radvaz]] Vol. 2; Ch. 648) rules that if a Jew was forced onto the Temple Mount and the time of prayer arrived while he’s standing between the Western Wall and the place of the Holy of Holies, &quot;he should pray facing towards the Holy of Holies even though his back will be facing the Western Wall.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as all of God’s bounty and blessing emanates from that spot.&lt;ref name=KHB/&gt; According to the [[Mishna]], of all the four walls of the Temple Mount, the Western Wall was the closest to the Holy of Holies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Middot (Talmud)|Middot]] 2:1&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore that to pray by the Wall is particularly beneficial.&lt;ref name=KHB/&gt; Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]] writes &quot;since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall, it is understandable that all Israel's prayers ascend on high there...as one of the great ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall.&quot;&lt;ref name=SLC/&gt; A well-known ''[[Segula (Kabbalah)|segula]]'' (efficacious remedy) for finding one's mate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.il/books?id=peGw2sZVN5QC&amp;pg=PA486&amp;dq=kabbalistic+segulah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uTJmT_iDEsnS0QWdgc2wCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=segulah&amp;f=false |page=486 |last=Kiel |first=Dvora |title=When the Time is Right: Manifestations of Divine Providence in everyday life |publisher=Feldheim Publishers |year=2007 |isbn= 965-7371-29-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was apparently conceived by Rabbi [[Yisroel Yaakov Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westernwallprayers.org/aboutwwp/originofthe40days.html |title=Origin of the 40 Days |year=2012 |accessdate=18 March 2012 |publisher=westernwallprayers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some, by [[Late Antiquity]] the privileged site of Jewish prayer in Jerusalem was located on the [[Mount of Olives]] and only towards the end of the [[Middle Ages]] did Jews gradually begin to congregate instead at the Western Wall for their prayers, authorized to do so by the waqf authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Laurens, ''La Question de Palestine'', Fayard, Paris, 2002 vol.2 p.157&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, most historians believe that the Western Wall became a popular prayer area only after the Ottoman conquest of Jerusalem in 1517. There are, however, recorded instances of the wall being used as a place of prayer before the Ottoman period. The [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel#Chronicle of Ahimaaz|Scroll of Ahimaaz]], a historical document written in 1050 CE, distinctly describes the Western Wall as a place of prayer for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;

This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;itinerary222&quot;/&gt; In 1334, Jewish traveller [[Isaac Chelo]] wrote: &quot;It is this Western Wall which stands before the temple of Omar ibn al Khattab, and which is called the Gate of Mercy.

Today, this wall is one of the seven wonders of the Holy City.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;travellers2004&quot;/&gt; In 1625 &quot;arranged prayers&quot; at the Wall are mentioned for the first time by a scholar whose name has not been preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;report1930&quot;/&gt; Scrolls of the Law were brought to the Wall on occasions of public distress and calamity, as testified to in a narrative written by Rabbi Gedaliah of Semitizi who went to Jerusalem in 1699.

====Mourning the Temple's Destruction====
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3432 9 av kotel.JPG|thumb|[[Tisha B'Av]] at the Western Wall, 1970s.]]
According to Jewish Law, one is obligated to grieve and rend one's garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moed Katan]] 26a; [[Orach Chaim]] 561; [[Yoreh Deah]] 340&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoel Sirkis|Bach]] (17th century) explicitly mentions the &quot;''Kotel ha-Ma'aravi''&quot; when expounding how one could encounter the ruins of the Temple before the ruins of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Bayit Chadash'' [[Orach Chaim]] 561. (He contends that the city itself is in such a state of disrepair that once a person has reached the hills surrounding Jerusalem, he can immediately view the Western Wall)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some [[Posek|scholars]] are of the view that rending one's garments is not applicable since Jerusalem is under Jewish sovereignty. Others disagree, citing that the Temple Mount itself is controlled by the Muslim ''waqf'' and the State of Israel has no power to remove the mosques which sit upon it. Furthermore, the mosques' very existence on the site of the Temple should increase one's feeling of distress. If one hasn’t seen the Wall for over 30 days, in order to avoid tearing one's shirt, the custom is to visit on the Sabbath, including Friday afternoons, or Saturday evenings if dressed in Sabbath finery, or on festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shlomo Zalman Aurbach|Minchas Shlomo]] Vol. 1, Ch. 73. See also: [http://www.rjconline.org/hib52.htm Tearing keriah for Jerusalem]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}; [http://www.ksy.org.il/AskTheRabbi.asp?QID=89 Ask the Rabbi: Kosel Keriah]&lt;/ref&gt; A person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite:

ISBN 1-58330-439-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Yoel Sirkis|Bach]] cites ''Likutim'' which instructs that &quot;when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall, which is the wall King David built, he should recite:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord&quot; – &lt;small&gt;[[Book of Lamentations]] 2:9&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Prayer notes====
{{main|Placing notes in the Western Wall}}

====Sanctity of the Wall====
There is much debate among Jewish codifiers about whether it is permitted to place one's fingers inside the cracks of the Wall. Those who warn against such action hold that the breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and therefore retains holiness. Others hold that the Wall stands outside the given measurements of the Temple area and therefore there is no concern about inserting one's fingers into the crevices.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Avrohom Bornsztain|Avnei Nezer]]'' [[Yoreh Deah]] 450&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, visitors, based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the cracks and paint their Hebrew names on the Wall. These practices stopped after rabbinic consensus determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.&lt;ref name=SLC/&gt; Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.&lt;ref name=SLC/&gt; More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.&lt;ref name=YY&gt;{{Cite book

Many contemporary ''[[poskim]]'' rule that the area in front of the Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect.&lt;ref name=KHB/&gt; As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is walk backwards away from the Wall.&lt;ref name=KHB/&gt; On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.
[[File:Wall of Solomon, c1880.jpg|thumb|upright|The faithful remove their shoes upon approaching the Wall, c1880]]

There was once an old custom of removing one's shoes upon approaching the Wall. A 17th century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that “upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes, bow and recite...”.&lt;ref name=SLC/&gt; Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote that “it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution, kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite “This is nothing other than the House of God and here is the gate of Heaven.” When within four [[cubit]]s of the Wall, one should remove their footwear.”&lt;ref name=SLC/&gt; Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased, as there is no need to remove one's shoes when standing by the Wall, because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=YY/&gt;

In the past women could be found sitting at the entrance to the Wall every Sabbath holding fragrant herbs and spices in order to enable worshipers to make additional blessings. In the hot weather they would provide cool water. The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall.&lt;ref name=SLC/&gt;

===Islam===
Until the 1920s, Muslims referred to the Wall as El-Mabka “the place of wailing&quot;. They then began calling it the Al-Buraq Wall.&lt;ref name=halkinww&gt;{{cite web

The tradition is first referred to in a manuscript by Ibn Furkah (d. 1328) stating that Buraq was tethered outside Bab al-Nab, an old name for a gate along the southwestern wall of the [[Haram al-Sharif]] at the very spot presently known as Al-Buraq. Other sources which referred to this tradition date from the 19th century and include the 1840 deliberation refusing the Jews the right to pave the area in front of the wall and the map of Jerusalem by Wilson (1865) that names the area around the Wailing Wall Hosh al-Buraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;reinventing2007&quot;/&gt; The second factor is the claim that it is [[waqf]] property and a part of the [[Temple Mount|Noble Sanctuary]].

&lt;/ref&gt; in his book &quot;The Wars over the Holy Places&quot;, suggests that Muslim attribution of holiness to the Western Wall began only in the last 100 years. He suggests this from the fact that official guides published by the Waqf in 1914, 1965, and 1990 do not attribute holiness to the wall and the entry &quot;al-Buraq&quot; in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'' does not make the connection either.&lt;ref&gt;Shragai, Nadav, Ha'aretz, January 19, 2001 based on &quot;The Wars over the Holy Places&quot; by Berkowitz, Shmuel&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Some scholars believe that when Jerusalem came under Christian rule in the 4th century, there was a purposeful &quot;transference&quot; of respect for the Temple Mount and the Western Wall in terms of sanctity to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], while the sites around the Temple Mount became a place to dump garbage for Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;catholic&quot;&gt;[http://www.uscatholic.org/church/2009/08/sensitivity-training?page=0,1 USCatholic.org], retrieved March 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the actions of many modern Christian leaders, including [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]], who visited the Wall and actually left prayer messages in its crevices, has symbolized for many Christians a restoration of respect and even veneration for this ancient religious site.&lt;ref name=&quot;catholic&quot;/&gt;

Some [[Christian Zionist]]s go further, claiming that the [[Third Temple]] must be rebuilt as part of the groundwork for the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cz&quot;&gt;[http://www.cc-vw.org/articles/temple.htm cc-vw.org], retrieved March 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A small group of extremists even advocate the destruction of the Muslim [[Dome of the Rock]] to hasten the new Temple construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;cz&quot;/&gt;

==Views==
===Jewish===
[[File:A man prays at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|A Jew praying at the Western Wall]]
Most Jews, religious and secular, consider the wall to be important to Judaism since it was originally built to hold the [[Second Temple]]. They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19 year gap.&lt;ref name=TOS&gt;[[Berel Wein|Wein, Berel]]. ''Triumph of Survival''; Section VIII – The Modern Jew 1958–1988, pg. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some [[haredi]] Jews who hold opposing views. Most notable are the adherents of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] [[hasidic]] sect who retain the views espoused by rabbi [[Joel Teitelbaum]] who would not approach the Wall.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; PA-appointed [[Mufti of Jerusalem]], Sheikh [[Ekrima Sa'id Sabri]], believes that the Wall belongs to the Muslims alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iris.org.il/quotes/quote49.htm On Jewish rights to the Western Wall in Jerusalem], [[Voice of Palestine]], June 12, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 he related that “No stone of the Al-Buraq wall has any relation to Judaism. The Jews began praying at this wall only in the nineteenth century, when they began to develop [national] aspirations.” A year later he stated:

{{Quote|“There is not a single stone in the Wailing Wall relating to Jewish History. The Jews cannot legitimately claim this wall, neither religiously nor historically. The Committee of the League of Nations recommended in 1930, to allow the Jews to pray there, in order to keep them quiet. But by no means did it acknowledge that the wall belongs to them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, Dr. Hassan Khader, founder of the Al Quds Encyclopedia, told PA television that the first connection of the Jews to the Wall is &quot;a recent one which began in the 16th century...not ancient...like the roots of the Islamic connection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 2010, an official paper published by the PA Ministry of Information denied Jewish rights to the Wall. It stated that &quot;Al-Buraq Wall is in fact the western wall of Al-Aksa Mosque&quot; and that Jews had only started using the site for worship after the 1917 Balfour Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abu Toameh. [http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=196329 Jews have no right to Western Wall, PA 'study' says], ''Jerusalem Post'', (November 22, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Yitzhak Reiter writes that &quot;the Islamization and de-Judaization of the Western Wall are a recurrent motif in publications and public statements by the heads of the Islamic Movement in Israel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiter2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Jerusalem and its role in Islamic solidarity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=20rYAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=June 10, 2011|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-60782-8|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian===
Egyptian Minister of Waqfs, Mahmoud Hamdi Zakzouk, has asserted that the Western Wall is not a Jewish holy site. Another high ranking Egyptian Muslim authority, Mufti Nasr Fradid Wassel, has decreed that the Western Wall remain an Islamic endowment forever, explaining that it is a part of the western wall of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. He added that the Wall would belong to Muslims all over the world &quot;until the end of earth&quot; and that it is religiously forbidden for Muslims to refer to Buraq Wall as the Wailing Wall.&lt;ref name=islamonlineNoClaim /&gt;

===American===
While recognizing the difficulties inherent in any ultimate peace agreement that involves the status of Jerusalem, the official position of the United States includes a recognition of the importance of the Wall to the Jewish people, and has condemned statements that seek to &quot;delegitimize&quot; the relationship between Jews and the area in general, and the Western Wall in particular. For example, in November 2010, the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration &quot;strongly condemned a Palestinian official's claim that the Western Wall in the Old City has no religious significance for Jews and is actually Muslim property.&quot; The U.S. State Department noted that the United States rejects such a claim as
&quot;factually incorrect, insensitive and highly provocative.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cleveland&quot;&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2010/11/us_condemns_palestinian_claim.html Cleveland.com], retrieved March 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
