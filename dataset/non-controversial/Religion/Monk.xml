A '''monk'''  (from {{lang-el|μοναχός}}, ''monachos'', &quot;single, solitary&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmonaxo%2Fs μοναχός], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt;) is a person who practices religious [[asceticism]], living either alone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serve the other living beings or to be an [[ascetism|ascetic]] who voluntarily chooses to leave [[mainstream]] [[society]] and live his life in [[prayer]] and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy. 

In the Greek language the term can apply to women; but in modern English it is mainly in use only for men, while [[nun]] is typically used for female monastics.

Although the term ''monachos'' (“monk”) is of Christian origin, in the English language it tends to be used analogously or loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds.  
    
The term ''monk'' is generic and in some religious or philosophical traditions it therefore may be considered interchangeable with other terms such as [[ascetic]]. However, being generic, it is not interchangeable with terms that denote particular kinds of monk, such as [[friar]], [[cenobite]], [[hermit]], [[anchorite]], [[Hesychasm|hesychast]], solitary.

[[File:07Athos St Dionysius02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dionysiou monastery|Monastery of St. Dionysius]] on [[Mount Athos]].]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodoxy]] monasticism holds a very special and important place: &quot;Angels are a light for monks, monks are a light for laymen&quot;(St. John Klimakos).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monachos.net/forum/showthread.php?5835-Monastic-life-as-angelic-image-(%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7) Monastic life as an angelic image]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orthodox Church]] measures its health by the quality of its monks and nuns. Orthodox monastics separate themselves from the [[world (theology)|world]] in order to pray unceasingly for the world. They do not, in general, have as their primary purpose the running of social services, as is common in Western Christianity, but instead are concerned with attaining [[theosis]], or union with God. However, care for the poor and needy has always been an obligation of monasticism,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} so Orthodox monasteries are not normally &quot;cloistered&quot; like some contemplative Western houses are, though the level of contact will vary from community to community. Orthodox hermits, on the other hand, have little or no contact with the outside world.
   
Orthodox monasticism does not have [[religious orders]] as are found in the West, nor do they have Rules in the same sense as the [[Rule of St. Benedict]]. Rather, Eastern monastics study and draw inspiration from the writings of the [[Desert Fathers]] as well as other [[Church Fathers]]; probably the most influential of which are the ''Greater Asketikon'' and ''Lesser Asketikon'' of St. Basil the Great and the ''[[Philokalia]]'', which was compiled by St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain and St. Makarios of Corinth. [[Hesychasm]] is of primary importance in the ascetical theology of the Orthodox Church.
   
[[File:Макарьево Свято-Троице-Макарьево-Желтоводский монастырь N56 05.402 E45 03.647.jpg|thumb|General view of [[Makaryev Monastery|Holy Trinity-Makaryev Monastery]], on the [[Volga River]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]], [[Russia]].]]

Most communities are self-supporting, and the monastic’s daily life is usually divided into three parts: (a) communal worship in the [[Katholikon|catholicon]] (the monastery's main church); (b) hard manual labour; and (c) private prayer, spiritual study, and rest when necessary. Meals are usually taken in common in a sizable dining hall known as a [[refectory|trapeza]] (refectory), at elongated [[refectory table]]s. Food is usually simple and is eaten in silence while one of the brethren reads aloud from the spiritual writings of the [[Church Fathers|Holy Fathers]]. The monastic lifestyle takes a great deal of serious commitment. Within the cenobitic community, all monks conform to a common way of living based on the traditions of that particular monastery. In struggling to attain this conformity, the monastic comes to realize his own shortcomings and is guided by his [[starets|spiritual father]] in how to deal honestly with them. Attaining this level of self-discipline is perhaps the most difficult and painful accomplishment any human being can make; but the end goal, to become like an angel on earth (an &quot;earthly angel and a heavenly man&quot;, as the church [[hymn]]s put it), is the reason monastics are held in such high esteem. For this same reason, [[Bishop#Bishops in Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches|Bishops]] are almost always chosen from the ranks of monks.
   
Eastern monasticism is found in three distinct forms: [[anchorites|anchoritic]] (a solitary living in isolation), [[cenobitic]] (a community living and worshiping together under the direct rule of an abbot or abbess), and the &quot;middle way&quot; between the two, known as the [[skete]] (a community of individuals living separately but in close proximity to one another, who come together only on Sundays and feast days, working and praying the rest of the time in solitude, but under the direction of an elder). One normally enters a cenobitic community first, and only after testing and spiritual growth would one go on to the skete or, for the most advanced, become a solitary anchorite. However, one is not necessarily expected to join a skete or become a solitary; most monastics remain in the cenobuim the whole of their lives. 
   
In general, Orthodox monastics have little or no contact with the outside world, including their own families. The purpose of the monastic life is union with God, the means is through leaving the world (i.e., the life of the passions). After tonsure, Orthodox monks and nuns are never permitted to cut their hair. The hair of the head and the beard remain uncut as a symbol of the vows they have taken, reminiscent of the [[Nazarite]]s from the [[Old Testament]]. The [[Tonsure]] of monks is the token of a consecrated life, and symbolizes the cutting off of their self-will.

===Degrees===
{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}
[[Image:megaloschema.svg|thumb|200px|left|The Lesser Schema]]

The process of becoming a monk is intentionally slow, as the [[vows]] taken are considered to entail a lifelong commitment to God, and are not to be entered into lightly. In Orthodox monasticism after completing the novitiate, there are three ranks of monasticism. There is only one [[religious habit|monastic habit]] in the Eastern Church (with certain slight regional variations), and it is the same for both monks and nuns. Each successive grade is given a portion of the habit, the full habit being worn only by those in the highest grade, known for that reason as the &quot;Great Schema&quot;, or &quot;Great Habit&quot;.
   
The various profession rites are normally performed by the Abbot, but if the abbot has not been ordained a priest, or if the monastic community is a convent, a [[hieromonk]] will perform the service. The abbot or hieromonk who performs a tonsure must be of at least the rank he is tonsuring into. In other words, only a hieromonk who has been tonsured into the Great Schema may himself tonsure a Schemamonk. A bishop, however, may tonsure into any rank, regardless of his own.
   
'''Novice''' (Slavonic: ''Poslushnik''), lit. &quot;one under obedience&quot;—Those wishing to join a monastery begin their lives as novices. After coming to the monastery and living as a guest for not less than three days, the revered abbot or abbess may bless the candidate to become a novice. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice, he or she simply receives permission to wear the clothing of a novice. In the Eastern monastic tradition, novices may or may not dress in the black [[Endorasson|inner cassock]] (Greek: ''Anterion'', ''Eisorasson''; [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''Podriasnik'') and wear the soft monastic hat (Greek: ''[[Skoufos]]'', Slavonic: ''Skufia''), depending on the tradition of the local community, and in accordance to the abbot’s directives. The inner-cassock and the skoufos are the first part of the Orthodox monastic habit. In some communities, the novice also wears the leather belt. He is also given a [[prayer rope]] and instructed in the use of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. If a novice chooses to leave during the period of the novitiate, no penalty is incurred. He may also be asked to leave at any time if his behaviour does not conform to the monastic life, or if the superior discerns that he is not called to monasticism. When the abbot or abbess deems the novice ready, he is asked if he wishes to join the monastery. Some, out of humility, will choose to remain novices all their lives. Every stage of the monastic life must be entered into voluntarily.
   
'''Rassaphore''', (Slavonic: '''Ryassophore'''), lit. &quot;Robe-bearer&quot;—If the novice continues on to become a monk, he is clothed in the first degree of monasticism at a formal service known as the [[Tonsure]]. Although there are no formal [[vows]] made at this point, the candidate is normally required to affirm his commitment to persevere in the monastic life. The abbot will then perform the tonsure, cutting a small amount of hair from four spots on the head, forming a cross. He is then given the outer cassock (Greek: ''Rasson'', ''Exorasson'', or ''Mandorrason''; Slavonic: ''Riassa'')—an outer robe with wide sleeves, something like the [[cowl]] used in the West, but without a hood—from which the name of Rassaphore is derived. He is also given a brimless hat with a veil, known as a [[klobuk]], and a leather belt is fastened around his waist. His habit is usually black, signifying that he is now dead to the world, and he receives a new name. Although the Rassaphore does not make formal vows, he is still morally obligated to continue in the monastic estate for the rest of his life. Some will remain Rassaphores permanently without going on to the higher degrees.
   
'''Stavrophore''', (Slavonic: '''Krestonosets'''), lit. &quot;Cross-bearer&quot;—The next level for Eastern monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbot feels the monk has reached an appropriate level of discipline, dedication, and humility. This degree is also known as the ''Little Schema'', and is considered to be a &quot;betrothal&quot; to the Great Schema. At this stage, the monk makes formal vows of stability, chastity, obedience and poverty. Then he is tonsured and clothed in the habit, which in addition to that worn by the Rassaphore, includes the ''paramandyas'' (Slavonic: ''paraman''), a piece of square cloth worn on the back, embroidered with the instruments of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] (see picture above), and connected by ties to a wooden cross worn over the heart. The paramandyas represents the yoke of Christ. Because of this addition he is now called ''Stavrophore'', or ''Cross-bearer''. He is also given a wooden hand cross (or &quot;profession cross&quot;), which he should keep in his [[icon corner]], and a beeswax candle, symbolic of monastic vigilance the sacrificing of himself for God. He will be buried holding the cross, and the candle will be burned at his funeral. In the Slavic practice, the Stavrophore also wears the monastic [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]]. The rasson (outer robe) worn by the Stavrophore is more ample than that worn by the Rassaphore. The abbot increases the Stavrophore monk’s prayer rule, allows a more strict personal ascetic practice, and gives the monk more responsibility.
   
'''Great Schema''' (Greek: ''Megaloschemos'', Slavonic: ''Skhimnik'')—Monks whose abbot feels they have reached a high level of spiritual excellence reach the final stage, called the [[Great Schema]]. The tonsure of a Schemamonk follows the same format as the Stavrophore, and he makes the same vows and is tonsured in the same manner. But in addition to all the garments worn by the Stavrophore, he is given the ''Analavos'' (Slavonic: ''Analav'') which is the article of monastic vesture emblematic of the Great Schema. For this reason, the analavos itself is sometimes called the &quot;Great Schema.&quot; The analavos comes down in the front and the back, somewhat like the [[scapular]] in Western monasticism, although the two garments are probably not related. It is often intricately embroidered with the instruments of the Passion and the [[Trisagion]] (the angelic hymn). The Greek form does not have a hood, the Slavic form has a hood and lappets on the shoulders, so that the garment forms a large cross covering the monk's shoulders, chest, and back. Another piece added is the ''Polystavrion'' or &quot;Many Crosses&quot;, which consists of a cord with a number of small crosses plaited into it.  The polystavrion forms a yoke around the monk and serves to hold the analavos in place, and reminds the monastic that he is bound to Christ and that his arms are no longer fit for worldly activities, but that he must labor only for the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]].  Among the Greeks, the mantle is added at this stage.  The paramandyas of the Megaloschemos is larger than that of the Stavrophore, and if he wears the klobuk, it is of a distinctive thimble shape, called a ''[[cowl|koukoulion]]'', the veil of which is usually embroidered with crosses.  In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.
   
Eastern Orthodox monks are addressed as &quot;Father&quot; even if they are not priests; but when conversing among themselves, monks will often address one another as &quot;Brother.&quot;  Novices are always referred to as &quot;Brother.&quot; Among the Greeks, old monks are often called ''Gheronda'', or &quot;Elder&quot;, out of respect for their dedication.  In the Slavic tradition, the title of Elder (Slavonic: ''[[Starets]]'') is normally reserved for those who are of an advanced spiritual life, and who serve as guides to others.
   
For the Orthodox, ''Mother'' is the correct term for nuns who have been tonsured Stavrophore or higher. Novices and Rassophores are addressed as &quot;Sister&quot;.  Nuns live identical ascetic lives to their male counterparts and are therefore also called ''monachai'' (the feminine plural of ''monachos''), and their community is likewise called a monastery.
   
Many (but not all) Orthodox [[seminary|seminaries]] are attached to monasteries, combining academic preparation for [[ordination]] with participation in the community's life of prayer, and hopefully benefiting from the example and wise counsel of the monks.  Bishops are required by the [[canon law|sacred canons]] of the Orthodox Church to be chosen from among the monastic clergy.  It should be noted that the requirement is specifically that they be monastics, not simply celibate (see [[clerical celibacy]]).  Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called [[hieromonk]]s (priest-monks); monks who have been ordained to the [[diaconate]] are called [[hierodeacon]]s (deacon-monks).  A Schemamonk who is a priest is called a Hieroschemamonk.  Most monks are not ordained; a community will normally only present as many candidates for ordination to the bishop as the liturgical needs of the community require.

==Western Christianity==

===Roman Catholicism===
[[Image:Kovelklein.JPG|thumb|100px|right|Order of Saint Benedict]]
[[Image:Czestochowa-bazylika.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The famed monastery of [[Jasna Góra]] is one of the last run by the [[Pauline Fathers]], an important order in the history of the monastic tradition.]]

Within Roman Catholicism, a monk is a member of a [[Catholic religious order|religious order]] who lives a communal life in a [[monastery]], [[abbey]], or [[priory]] under a monastic rule of life (such as the [[Rule of St. Benedict]]) and under the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. [[St. Benedict of Nursia]] is considered to be the founder of western monasticism. He authored the [[Rule of St. Benedict]], which is the foundation for the [[Order of St. Benedict]] and all of its reforms such as the [[Cistercians]] and the [[Trappists]].

The religious [[vows]] taken in the West were first developed by [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]].  These vows were three in number: obedience, conversion of life, and stability.  Obedience requires that monks are willing to obey the Catholic Church, as represented by the superior person of the monastery, which is an [[abbot]] or [[prior]].  Conversion of life means, generally, that the monk will release himself from the binds and false hopes of this earthly life and dedicate his life to working for God (i.e. be an instrument for God's work while here on Earth). Stability means they vow to stay in that single monastery for the remainder of their lives, and, upon death, will be buried &quot;on-campus&quot;.  The latter vow is currently unique to Benedictines.

The [[solemn vows]] in other religious communities were eventually established as vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity. Poverty requires that they renounce any ownership of property or assets, except for items that were allowed to them by their superior (such as a [[religious habit]], [[shoes]], a [[cloak]], etc.), and to live meekly, sharing whatever they might have with the poor.  Chastity requires that since they were willing to dedicate their lives to God, they sacrificed the love between men and women and would not marry. Also, they give up any act of sexual conduct.
   
To become a monk, one first must become a [[postulant]], during which time the man lives at the monastery to evaluate whether he is called to become a monk. As a postulant, the man is not bound by any vows, and is free to leave the [[monastery]] at any time. If the postulant and the community agree that the postulant should become a monk, the man is received as a [[novice]], at which time he is given his [[religious habit]], and begins to participate more fully in the life of the monastery. Following a period as a novice, usually six months to a year, the novice is given the option to take the [[solemn vows]], which can be renewed annually for a period of years. After a few years, the monk can make [[permanent vows]], which are binding for life.

The monastic life generally consists of prayer in the form of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (also known as the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]) and divine reading (''[[lectio divina]]'') and manual labor. Among most [[religious orders]], monks live in simple, austere rooms called cells and come together daily to celebrate the [[Conventual Mass]] and to recite the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]. In most communities, the monks take their meals together in the [[refectory]]. While there is no vow of silence, many communities have a period of silence lasting from evening until the next morning and some others restrict talking to only when it is necessary for the monks to perform their work and during weekly recreation.

[[Image:Germany München Monks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Munich]]'s city symbol celebrates its founding by [[Benedictine]] monks&amp;mdash;and the origin of its name]]

Monks who have been or will be [[Ordination#Eastern, Roman, and Anglican Christianity|ordained]] into [[Holy Orders]] as [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or [[deacons]] are referred to as ''choir monks'', as they have the obligation to recite the entire [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] daily in [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. Those monks who are not [[Ordination#Eastern, Roman, and Anglican Christianity|ordained]] into [[Holy Orders]] are referred to as [[lay brothers]]. In most monastic communities today, little distinction exists between the lay brothers and the choir monks. However, historically, the roles of the two groups of monks within the monastery differed. The work of the choir monks was considered to be prayer, chanting the seven hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] and celebrating the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] daily whereas the lay brothers provided for the material needs of the community by growing food, preparing meals, maintaining the monastery and the grounds. This distinction arose historically because generally those monks who could read [[Latin]] typically became choir monks, while those monks who were illiterate or could not read [[Latin]] became [[lay brothers]]. Since the lay brothers could not recite the Divine Office in Latin, they would instead pray easily memorizable prayers such as the [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] or the [[Hail Mary]] as many as 150 times per day. Since the [[Second Vatican Council]], the distinction between choir monks and lay brothers has been deemphasized, as the council allowed the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] to be said in the vernacular language, effectively opening participation to all of the monks.

Within western monasticism, it is important to differentiate between monks and [[friars]]. Monks generally live a contemplative life of prayer confined within a monastery while [[friars]] usually engage in an active ministry of service to the outside community. The monastic orders include all [[Benedictines]] (the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and its later reforms including the [[Cistercians]] and the [[Trappists]]) and the [[Carthusian]]s, who live according to their own [[Statutes of the Carthusian Order|Statutes]], and not according to the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] proper. Orders of [[friars]] include the [[Franciscan]]s, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], and [[Augustinians]]. Although the [[Canons Regular]], such as the [[Norbertines]], live in community, they are neither monks nor friars as they are characterized by their [[cleric|clerical state]] and not by any monastic vows.

===Anglicanism===
Monastic life in [[England]] came to an abrupt end when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] broke from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] establishing the [[Church of England]]. He initiated the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], during which all of the [[monastery|monasteries]] within [[England]] were destroyed. While many monks were executed, many fled to continental [[Europe]]an monasteries where they were able to continue their monastic life.

Shortly after the beginning of the revival of the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic Movement]] in the Church of England, there was felt to be a need for a restoration of the monastic life. In the 1840s, Anglican priest [[John Henry Newman]] established a community of men at [[Littlemore]] near [[Oxford]]. From then on, there have been (re-)established many communities of monks, [[friar]]s and other religious communities for men in the [[Anglican Communion]]. There are Anglican [[Benedictine]]s, [[Franciscan]]s, [[Cistercian]]s, and in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the USA, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], as well as other monastic orders such as the [[Society of Saint John the Evangelist]].
   
Some Anglican religious communities are contemplative, some active, but a distinguishing feature of the monastic life among Anglicans is that most practice the so-called &quot;mixed life.&quot; Anglican monks recite the Divine Office in choir daily, either the full eight services of the [[Breviary]] or the four offices found in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and celebrate the [[Eucharist]] daily. Many orders take on external works such as service to the poor, giving religious retreats, or other active ministries within their immediate communities. Like [[Roman Catholic]] monks, Anglican monks also take the monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

In the early 20th century when the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic Movement]] was at its height, the [[Anglican Communion]] had hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of religious followers. However, since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in many parts of the Anglican Communion. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery composed of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct.

There are however, still several thousand Anglican monks working today in approximately 200 communities around the world. The most surprising growth has been in the [[Melanesian]] countries of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[Melanesian Brotherhood]], founded at [[Tabalia]], [[Guadalcanal]], in 1925 by [[Ini Kopuria]], is now the largest Anglican Community in the world with over 450 brothers in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the [[Philippines]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

===Lutheranism===
[[Image:St augustine.jpg|left|thumb|160px|St. Augustine's House Lutheran [[Monastery]] in [[Oxford, Michigan]]]]
[[Loccum Abbey]] and [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] have the longest traditions as Lutheran monasteries. Since the 19th and 20th century, there has been a renewal in the monastic life among Lutheranism. There are many present-day Lutherans who practice the monastic teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icdb.org/show.php?r=osb&amp;PHPSESSID=8ed75cc0dbee7b113b0e220ce70deacd Order of Saint Benedict]. Retrieved 13-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In American Lutheran traditions, &quot;The Congregation of the Servants of Christ&quot; was established at St. Augustine's House in [[Oxford, Michigan]], in 1958 when some other men joined Father [[Arthur Kreinheder]] in observing the monastic life and offices of prayer. These men and others came and went over the years. The community has always remained small; at times the only member was Father Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829997,00.html The Lonely Lutheran Monk], [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] (March 1, 1963). Retrieved 13-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 35 years of its existence over 25 men tested their vocations to monastic life by living at the house for some time, from a few months to many years, but at Father Arthur's death in 1989 only one permanent resident remained. At the beginning of 2006, there was 2 permanent professed members and 2 long-term guests. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden ([[Östanbäck monastery]]) and in Germany ([[Priory of St. Wigbert]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staugustineshouse.org/ Staugustineshouse.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the [[Order of Lutheran Franciscans]], a religious community of friars and sisters within the tradition of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].

===Methodism===

{{Main|Methodist Diaconal Order}}

Within the Worldwide [[Methodist]] Church there exist a number of [[diaconal]] orders. Like [[Roman Catholic]] [[canon (priest)|canon]]s and [[Jesuits]], they are ordained (as [[deacons]]) but are also organised into a religious order.

In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, ''[[bhikkhu]]'' is the term for monk. Their disciplinary code is called the ''[[patimokkha]]'', which is part of the larger ''[[Vinaya]]''. They live lives of [[mendicancy]], and go on a morning almsround ([[Pali]]: ''pindapata'') every day. The local people give food for the monks to eat, though the monks are not permitted to positively ask for anything. The monks live in monasteries, and have an important function in traditional Asian society. Young boys can be ordained as [[samanera]]s. Both bhikkhus and samaneras eat only in the morning, and are not supposed to lead a luxurious life. Their rules forbid the use of money, although this rule is nowadays not kept by all monks. The monks are part of the ''[[Sangha]]'', the third of the [[Triple Gem]] of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dhamma]], Sangha.

In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the term 'Sangha' strictly speaking refers to those who have achieved certain levels of understanding. They are therefore called 'community of the excellent ones' ({{lang-bo|mchog kyi tshogs}}); however, these in turn need not be monks (i.e., hold such [[religious vows|vows]]). Several Mahayana orders accept female practitioners as monks, instead of using the normal title of &quot;nun&quot;, and they are considered equal to male ascetics in all respects.

The [[Bhikkhus]] are only allowed 4 items ''(other than their robes)'': a [[razor]], a [[Sewing needle|needle]], an alms bowl and a water strainer.

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, monkhood is part of the system of 'vows of individual liberation'; these vows are taken in order to develop one's own personal ethical discipline. The monks and nuns form the (ordinary) ''sangha''. As for the Vajrayana vows of individual liberation, there are four steps: A lay person may take the 5 vows called 'approaching virtue' (in Tibetan &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''genyen''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt; ''dge snyan''&gt;). The next step is to enter the monastic way of life (Tib. ''rabjung'') which includes wearing monk's or nun's [[robes]]. After that, one can become a 'novice' (Pali ''[[samanera]]'', Tib. ''getshül''); the last and final step is to take all vows of the 'fully ordained monk' (''gelong''). This term 'gelong' (Tib. &lt; ''dge long''&gt;, in the female form ''gelongma'') is the translation of Skt. ''bikshu'' (for women ''bikshuni'') which is the equivalent of the Pali term ''[[bhikkhuni]]''; ''[[bhikkhu]]'' is the word used in Theravada Buddhism (Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand).

[[China|Chinese]] Buddhist monks have been traditionally and stereotypically linked with the practice of the [[Chinese martial arts]] or ''Kung fu'', and monks are frequently important characters in [[martial arts film]]s.  This association is focused around the [[Shaolin Monastery]].  The Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]], traditionally credited as the founder of [[Zen]] Buddhism in China, is also claimed to have introduced [[Kalaripayattu]] (which later evolved into Kung Fu) to the country. This latter claim has however been a source of much controversy (see [[Bodhidharma, the martial arts, and the disputed India connection]]) One more feature about the Chinese Buddhist monks is that they practice the burning marks on their scalp, finger or part of the skin on their anterior side of the forearm with incense as a sign of ordination.

In [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]], it is common for boys to spend some time living as a monk in a monastery. Most stay for only a few years and then leave, but a number continue on in the ascetic life for the rest of their lives.

In [[Mongolia]] during the 1920s, there were about 110,000 monks, including children, who made up about one-third of the male population,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/mongolia/47.htm Mongolia - Buddhism]&quot;. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom were killed in the purges of [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan|Choibalsan]].

==Jainism==

One of the most intense forms of Asceticism can be found in [[Jainism]], one of the world's oldest religions. Jainism encourages fasting, yoga practices, meditation in difficult postures, and other austerities.&lt;ref&gt;Frank William Iklé et al. &quot;A History of Asia&quot;, page ?. Allyn and Bacon, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jains, one's highest goal should be attaining [[Nirvana]] or [[Moksha]] (i.e., liberation from [[samsara]], the cycle of birth and rebirth). For this, a soul has to be without attachment or self-indulgence. This can be achieved only by the monks and nuns who take five great vows: of non-violence, of truth, of non-stealing, of non-possession and of celibacy. 
[[File:Acharya5.jpg|thumb|[[Acharya Vidyasagar]], a possessionless and detached [[Digambara]] Jain monk]]
Most of the austerities and ascetic practices can be traced back to Vardhaman [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth &quot;fordmaker&quot; or [[Tirthankara]]. The [[Acaranga Sutra]], or Book of Good Conduct, is a sacred book within Jainism that discusses the ascetic code of conduct. Other texts that provide insight into conduct of ascetics include Yogashastra by Acharya [[Hemachandra]] and Niyamasara by Acharya [[Kundakunda]]. Other illustrious Jain works on ascetic conduct are ''Oghanijjutti, Pindanijjutti, Cheda Sutta, and Nisiha Suttafee.''

Press&lt;/ref&gt; can belong to one of these ranks:

* [[Acharya]]: leader of the order
* Upadhyaya: a learned monk, who both teaches and studies himself
* Muni: an ordinary monk

These three are mentioned is the three lines of the [[Namokar Mantra]]. In the [[Digambara]] tradition, a junior monk can be a:

* Ailak: they use one piece of cloth
* [[Kshullak]]: they may use two pieces of cloth

The [[Svetambar Terapanthi]] sect has a new rank of junior monks who are called samana. The nuns are called Aryikas in [[Digambar]] tradition and Sadhvi in the [[Svetambar]] tradition.

===Ascetic vows===
[[File:Mahavratas.jpg|thumb|300px|Five [[Mahavrata]]s of Jain ascetics]]
As per the Jain vows, the monks and nuns renounce all relations and possessions. Jain ascetics practice complete non-violence. ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]'' is the first and foremost vow of a Jain ascetic. They do not hurt any living being, be it an insect or a human. They carry a special broom to sweep away any insects that may cross their path. Some Jain monks wear a cloth over the mouth to prevent accidental harm to airborne germs and insects. They also do not use electricity as it involves violence. Furthermore, they do not use any devices or machines.

As they are without possession and attachment, they travel from city to city, often crossing forests and deserts, and always barefoot. Jain ascetics do not stay in a single place for more than two months to prevent themselves from becoming attached to any location. However during four months of monsoon (rainy season) known as chaturmaas, they continue to stay in a single place to avoid killing the life forms that thrive during the rains.  
Jain monks and nuns practice complete celibacy. They do not touch or share a sitting platform with a person of opposite sex.

===Dietary practices===
Jain ascetics follow a strict vegetarian diet without root vegetables. [[Shvetambara]] monks do not cook food but solicit alms from householders. [[Digambara]] monks have only a single meal a day. Neither group will beg for food, but a Jain ascetic may accept a meal from a householder, provided that the latter is pure of mind and body and offers the food of his own volition and in the prescribed manner. During such an encounter, the monk remains standing and eats only a measured amount. Fasting (i.e., abstinence from food and sometimes water) is a routine feature of Jain asceticism. Fasts last for a day or longer, up to a month. Some monks avoid (or limit) medicine and/or hospitalization out of disregard for the physical body.

===Austerities and other daily practices===
[[File:Westindischer Maler um 1400 001.jpg|thumb|White-clothed Acharya Kalaka]]
Other austerities include meditation in seated or standing posture near river banks in the cold wind, or meditation atop hills and mountains, especially at noon when the sun is at its fiercest. Such austerities are undertaken according to the physical and mental limits of the individual ascetic. Jain ascetics are (almost) completely without possessions. Some Jains (Shvetambara monks and nuns) own only unstitched white robes (an upper and lower garment) and a bowl used for eating and collecting alms. Male Digambara monks do not wear any clothes and carry nothing with them except a soft broom made of shed peacock feathers (pinchi) and eat from their hands. They sleep on the floor without blankets and sit on special wooden platforms.

Every day is spent either in study of scriptures or meditation or teaching to lay people. They stand aloof from worldly matters. Many Jain ascetics take a final vow of Santhara or Sallekhana (i.e., a peaceful and detached death where medicines, food, and water are abandoned). This is done when death is imminent or when a monk feels that he is unable to adhere to his vows on account of advanced age or terminal disease.

Quotes on ascetic practices from the Akaranga Sutra as [[Hermann Jacobi]] translated it:&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Jacobi, &quot;Sacred Books of the East&quot;, vol. 22: Gaina Sutras Part I. 1884&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm Sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|A monk or a nun wandering from village to village should look forward for four cubits, and seeing animals they should move on by walking on his toes or heels or the sides of his feet. If there be some bypath, they should choose it, and not go straight on; then they may circumspectly wander from village to village.|Third Lecture(6)}}

{{quote|I shall become a Sramana who owns no house, no property, no sons, no cattle, who eats what others give him; I shall commit no sinful action; Master, I renounce to accept anything that has not been given.' Having taken such vows, (a mendicant) should not, on entering a village or scot-free town, &amp;c., take himself, or induce others to take, or allow others to take, what has not been given.|Seventh Lecture (1)}}

==Vaishnava==
{{Main|International Society for Krishna Consciousness}}

Madhvaacharya ([[Madhvacharya]]), the [[Dwaita]] philosopher, established ''[[ashta matha]]'' (Eight Monasteries). He appointed a monk (called ''swamiji'' or ''swamigalu'' in local parlance) for each ''matha'' or monastery who has the right to worship Madhvacharya's [[murti]] of Lord [[Krishna]] by rotation. Each matha's swamiji gets a chance to worship after fourteen years. This ritual is called ''[[Paryaya]]'' and has been used also outside his [[sampradaya]], e.g. in [[Gaudiya Vaisnava]] [[Radharamana]] [[temple]] in [[Vrindavan]].

Similar in appearance to Buddhist monks, [[brahmacharya|brahmacari]] monks from the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] ([[ISKCON]]), or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] as they are popularly known, are the best known [[Vaishnava]] monks outside India. They are a common sight in many places around the world. Their appearance—simple [[saffron]] ''[[dhoti]]'', shaved head with ''[[sikha]]'', ''[[Tulasi]]'' neckbeads and ''[[tilaka]]'' markings—and social customs (''[[sadhana]]'') date back many thousands of years to the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] era with its ''[[varnasrama]]'' society. This social scheme includes both monastic and lay stages meant for various persons in various stages of life as per their characteristics (''[[guna]]'') and work (''[[karma]]'').

ISKCON started as a predominantly monastic group but nowadays the majority of members live as lay persons. Many of them, however, spent some time as monks. New persons joining ISKCON as full-time members (living in its centers) first undergo a three-month ''[[Bhakta]]'' training, which includes learning the basics of [[brahmacharya|brahmacari]] (monastic) life. After that they can decide if they prefer to continue as monks or as married ''[[Grihastha]]s''.

Brahmacari older than fifty years (as per ISKCON rule) can become ''[[sannyasi]]''. ''[[Sannyasa]]'', a life of full dedication to spiritual pursuits, is the highest stage of life in the ''varnasrama'' society. It is permanent and one cannot give it up. A Sannyasi is given the title [[Swami]]. Older grihastha with grown-up children are traditionally expected to accept ''[[vanaprastha]]'' (celibate retired) life.

The role of monastic orders in [[India]]n and now also [[Western world|Western]] society has to some extent been adapted over the years in accordance with ever-changing social structures.
