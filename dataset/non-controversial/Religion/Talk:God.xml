== Henotheism ==

There are sources that describe Hinduism and Taoism as henotheistic. Hence i thought it wuld be ok to include them. [[User:Pass a Method|&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Pass a Method&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:PassaMethod|&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot; face=&quot;papyrus&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 06:47, 20 July 2012 (UTC)
:I'm pretty sure we could also find sources describing Hinduism as monotheistic as well (depending on the school/sect/denomination).  Henotheism seems to be enough reason to include a religion in the article, though.  [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 13:27, 20 July 2012 (UTC)
::Calling Hinduism henothesitic is a pretty big generalization/oversimplification, and there are many branches of Hinduism: some polytheistic, some henotheistic, some monistic, etc. Tausism is pretty clear-cut polytheistic. Zoroastrianism is extremely small, (&lt;s&gt;&lt;20,000&lt;/s&gt;&lt;200,000 members I think) and doesn't really need a shout-out in the Lead, especially if they're not in the article body. [[Ik Onkar]] is a symbol for God, not a name for God, and doesn't really fit in the Lead either. There was nothing particularly wrong with the Bahai sentence, but I removed it as well, since it's fairly redundant with Islam. I also changed Vishnu/Krishna to Brahman, since Krishna's just an avatar of Vishnu, and Brahman is more widely regarded as a monistic deity. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:10.2pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:7pt&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 17:37, 20 July 2012 (UTC)
:::I have to agree pretty strongly with the above comment by Adjwilley. &quot;There are sources that&quot; say any number of ridiculous things about individual religions and religion in general, and we can't and shouldn't base our content on them at random. [[User:John Carter|John Carter]] ([[User talk:John Carter|talk]]) 21:10, 22 July 2012 (UTC)
::: There are several sources desscvribing Hinduism as henotheistic, i.e. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9XC9bwMMPcwC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=hinduism+henotheistic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0yEKUPPkAsOd0QWp68TvCg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=hinduism%20henotheistic&amp;f=false]. As for zoroastrianism, they have 2.6 million members (see [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html/]. As for Baha'i, thats a completely different religion to Islam.

::::Baha'i is about as distinct from Islam as 2nd or 3rd century Christianity was from Judaism.  Zoroastrianism is notable for possibly being one of the earliest monotheistic religions, and pretty much any comprehensive study on monotheism includes it.  However, I do have to agree that the change to Brahman would be more accurate, as the monist, monotheistic, pantheistic, and henotheistic sects use Brahman (but not Brahma, a different figure) to refer to the supreme being.  Vaishnaism sees Vishnu as the truest understanding of Brahman, and Krishnaism sees Krishna as the truest understanding of Vishnu (or just Brahman), but both still see Brahman as the supreme being.  Reading the bit on Taoism, that... doesn't quite cover the supreme being.  It covers the three supreme beings, and citing Journey to the West strikes me as a bit [[WP:OR]], kind of like citing Pilgrim's Progress to make swathing statements about Christian doctrine.  A scholarly source that studied a variety of Taoist ideas would be more appropriate.  Also, replacing the bit about Ik Onkar with something about [[Waheguru]] would be more accurate and appropriate.

{{od|:::::::}}
Sorry for the long silence. I was out of town yesterday and didn't get a chance to write a response here. Before I begin, I should probably say a few words regarding the accusations recently levied against me at AN/I. Contrary to what Pass a Method said, I am not opposed to mentioning various religious views in the Lead section of the article, but there were several problems with Pass a Method's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=God&amp;diff=503238734&amp;oldid=502090033 edit], which is why I reverted most of it. It was an exceptionally [[WP:BRD|Bold]] edit with little justification; I reverted it, and now it's time to discuss. Since there were a lot of issues mixed into the edit, I'm going to break it down an analyze each piece. 

;&quot;[[Vishnu]] and [[Krishna]] are among the most popular [[Hindu]] gods.&quot;
:The scope of this article is ''&quot;God&quot; in the context of monotheism and henotheism'' and there has been no consensus thus far to change that. (As the hatnotes point out, there are several other articles discussing the various aspects of the subject from many points of view.) Pass a Method made the argument that some sources describe Hinduism as henotheistic, so s/he could include various Hindu gods in the article. I argued that calling Hinduism henotheistic was a gross generalization/oversimplification, but compromised, changing the sentence to: &quot;'''In Hinduism, [[Brahman]] is often considered a [[Monism|monistic]] deity.'''&quot; Brahman is a much more appropriate example than Krishna and Vishnu, since Brahman is the &quot;one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe&quot; while Vishnu isn't quite as all-encompassing, and Krishna is just an avatar of Vishnu. PassaMethod reverted me on that, and I think it should be changed back. Ian.thomson seems to agree with me there.

;&quot;In [[Taoism]], the [[Three Pure Ones]] are considered the highest gods.&quot;
:As I pointed out, this is straight polytheism, and doesn't really belong in the article, especially in the Lead. If someone would like to change the scope of this article, they should propose the change on the talk page where it can be discussed. 

;&quot;Baha'is believe that the greatest name for god is [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|Baha]], Arabic for all-glorious.&quot;
:Granted, the paragraph this was inserted into was talking about names for God, but it was talking about specific names that people use in the place of &quot;God&quot;. For instance, Muslims call God &quot;Allah&quot; while some Christians call him &quot;Jehovah&quot; while some Jews call him &quot;Adonai&quot;. Well, Bahá'ís generally call God &quot;God&quot; though they have several honorific names like the &quot;All-Powerful&quot;, or the &quot;All-Loving&quot;. This concept of having multiple titular names for God is interesting, but not unique to Bahai's. For instance, the paragraph in the Lead already says, &quot;'''Muslims regard a [[Names of God in Islam|multitude of titular names]] for God.'''&quot; so adding the same information about Bahai's is fairly redundant. Besides, Baha'i faith is fairly small, especially compared to Islam, so if I have to decide between using Bahai or Islam as an example for something, I choose Islam. 

:As a side note, I was accused me of violating several [[WP:LEAD]] principles at AN/I. Here's a quote from WP:LEAD. ''&quot;The lead should define the topic and summarize the body of the article with appropriate weight.&quot;'' If we're summarizing the body of the article, why should we insert the above sentence in the Lead, when the body of the article doesn't say anything about Baha'i names for God?

;&quot;The [[Ik Onkar]] is the symbol of god for [[Sikhs]].&quot;
:This is pure trivia and has nothing to do with names for God. It should also be thrown out per [[WP:LEAD]].

;&quot;Zoroastrians believe in one god called [[Ahura Mazda]].&quot;
:I initially made the mistake of saying there were 20,000 Zoroastrians instead of the 200,000 that I meant. I got slammed pretty hard for that, and I deserved part of it. Apparently on Adherents.com they list it as 2.6 million (another factor of ten higher) although they acknowledge the other numbers as well: &quot;The current estimate posted on this page of millions of Zoroastrians in the world (rather than 100,000 to 150,000) is still under evaluation.&quot; [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Zoroastrianism] 
:The point is, whichever number one chooses to believe, the number of Zoroastrians is very, very small compared to other world religions, and is small even when compared to the various sects within the major religions. 
:That said, I realize that Zoroastrianism is an important topic when speaking of monotheism, and I thought twice before reverting that part. The fact that no argument had been made for inclusion (and that the edit summary used to include it was so generic that it looked like something was trying to be slipped in under the radar) was part of the reason for my revert. I would be fine with including it in the future.

I apologize for the long wall of text here, but I am trying to be thorough, since this seems to be a sensitive subject. I would ask that in responding, editors focus on article content, and not the perceived biases of other editors. I'll wait a day or so before reverting again to see if there are any objections. If there are none, I will revert, fixing the Hindu problem (Krishna--&gt;Brahman), and leaving Zoroastrianism in this time. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:10.2pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:7pt&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 20:26, 22 July 2012 (UTC)

:No problems with the length. My own suggestion, as I said elsewhere, is for me to look tomorrow at the most recent edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' edited by Lindsay Jones. With the possible exception of ''Religion Past and Present,'' a source which also has strong historic ties to a particular school of religious study, it is considered the most highly regarded academic source on religious topics in general, and its articles on major subjects tend to be closer in length to our own as well. So, in general, I think it is probably the best &quot;baseline&quot; source we can use to determine content. If the scope of that article is roughly the same as ours, or if they have an article under a different title roughly similar, I think it would be a very solid indication of what material to include, and to what weight, in our own article.

:: Regarding Hinduism, i just changed that, and added a source.

:: Regarding taoism, there are henotheist apects such as the supreme deity belief. See [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Rhy_9p9BZQC&amp;pg=PA509&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fp0MUICVC8nG0QWVroTwCg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false this] source for example

:: You called baha'i small. Well, Judaism is 14 mil compared to Baha'i at 7 mil (see [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html/]). Thats not a lot of difference. You should remove Judaism too if you're consistent. Baha'i is commonly described as a major religion [http://www.religioustolerance.org/bahai1.htm/], [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yU10kSVczyIC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OaIMUIXTB-r80QXx36CCDQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false], and is the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica_stats&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Worldwide Adherents of All Religions by Six Continental Areas, Mid-2002 |title = Encyclopædia Britannica |author= Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica |year = 2002|isbn=0-85229-555-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Denis | last = MacEoin |chapter = Baha'i Faith |editor=Hinnells, John R. |title=The New Penguin Handbook of Living Religions: Second Edition|publisher=[[Penguin books|Penguin]]|year=2000 |isbn=0-14-051480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] estimated some 7.6 million Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCE-05&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = World Religions (2005) | work = QuickLists – The World – Religions| publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_125.asp | accessdate =4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the name Baha is not among the [[Names of God in Islam|99 names of god in Islam]], so its '''not''' redundant.

:: Ik Onkar is directly relavant to a paragraph about God's names since it is the title of the Sikh God.

::*Hinduism is good now, thanks.
::*Baha'i: You still haven't responded to my objection of using Baha'i to illustrate the very same point that's being illustrated with Islam in the same paragraph. Nor have you responded to my concerns with WP:LEAD. Besides, Baha'i is an Abrahamic religion, and didn't you want to ''reduce'' the weight given to those? :-)
::*Taoism: I don't see how you can link to [[Three Pure Ones]] (the three highest Gods in the Taoist [[pantheon]]) and argue [[henotheism]]. Taoism is complicated, as it consists of a variety of related religious and philosophical traditions. Calling Taoism henotheistic is controversial at best. Besides, who is to decide which god to present in the Lead paragraph? A fair argument could be made that the [[Jade Emperor]] is the head deity. &lt;small&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 41. University of Massachusetts, 1981.&lt;/small&gt;
::*[[Ik Onkar]] is not a title of the Sikh God, but a symbol of the unity of God. It is a combination of two characters, the numeral ੧, ''Ikk'' (one) and the first letter of the word ''Onkar'' (constant). 
::*We are already agreed on Zoroastrianism. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:10.2pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:7pt&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 02:30, 23 July 2012 (UTC)

:::* I stated that in the 99 names of God in islam, the name &quot;Baha&quot; is not in there. Besides the history of the term &quot;Allah&quot; and &quot;Baha&quot; are very different so they are not illlustrated together. As for LEAD, that is simply a guideline, not a code. I was going to move the baha'i sentence to the body, but i figured a more appropriate place is the lede coz thats where the rest of Gods names are mentioned. 

:::* As for Abrahamic religions, i only wanted to reduce Abrahamic weight if other religions are also dismissed. If all monotheistic/henotheistic religions are mentioned equally i have no problem whatsoever. 

:::* Regarding Taoism, a supreme god venerated over other gods would fit the definition of henotheism. Can you find a source calling Taoism non-henotheistic? 

:::* Regarding Sikhism, Ik Onkar is the most common description of a monotheistic god among many other descriptions. That would fall under the same discourse as the paragraph i placed it. 

:::* I feel like you might possibly not understand the definition of a paragraph since you keep questioning the location of my entries. In case you dont know, a paragraph is &quot;a piece of writing usually dealing with a single theme&quot;. Therefore if i add an entry about a name of god, i should add it to a paragraph which corresponds with that. Thats exactly what i did.

::::*LEAD is a guideline, yes, but it's a pretty good one to follow. Keeping something in the Lead because you can't find a place for it in the body is a poor argument.
::::*Ok, let's take your definition of henotheism: &quot;a supreme god venerated over other gods&quot;. Are you saying that the [[Three Pure Ones]] are the &quot;supreme god&quot;? Wouldn't it be more accurate to say &quot;supreme gods&quot;?
::::*I'm glad you've backed off from saying Ik Onkar is the &quot;title of the Sikh God&quot; to saying it's the &quot;most common description of a monotheistic god&quot;. You are a step closer to being correct, but not quite there yet. Ik Onkar=&quot;one constant&quot;, or more specifically, &quot;1C&quot;=a &quot;symbol of the unity of God&quot;. &quot;1C&quot; may indeed be a description of a monotheistic god, but I definitely wouldn't say it's the &quot;most common description&quot;.
::::*I still don't understand why you want to clutter the Lead with what seems to be a random smattering of names for God. There are thousands of honorary names and titles. What made you pick stuff like &quot;Ik Onkar&quot; and &quot;Baha&quot; (&quot;All-Glorious&quot;) over stuff like &quot;Lord of Hosts&quot;, &quot;God Almighty&quot;, &quot;Everlasting God&quot;, or some of the names in Islam? Seems those would be &quot;most common&quot; :-) &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:10.2pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:7pt&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 14:47, 23 July 2012 (UTC)
:::::*(e-c) First, I '''very strongly urge''' some of the editors here to perhaps read [[WP:CIVILITY]] and [[WP:NPA]]. I would also, perhaps, think that it may well be in their best interests to also read [[WP:OR]], regarding one editor's as yet unsourced claim regarding Taoism, and it is presumptuous at best to demand of someone else evidence when that individual has not yet shown any evidence acceptable by our standards of [[WP:RS]] themselves. The fact that in one individual editor's eyes something fits a definition is not in and of itself cause for inclusion. We use evidence that meets [[WP:RS]], and one individual editor's opinions do not qualify as such. I tend to believe that perhaps, despite claims that one editor &quot;has no problem whatsoever,&quot; that perhaps one or more editors here has demonstrated perhaps very serious problems regarding conduct and POV. 
:::::*Now, having pulled out the Jones ''Encyclopedia of Religion,'' I find it in fact is less help than I would have liked. It does not have a single article regarding the subject, but rather a collection of articles. Those articles are &quot;God in the Hebrew Scriptures,&quot; &quot;God in the New Testament,&quot; &quot;God in Postbiblical Judaism,&quot; &quot;God in Postbiblical Christianity,&quot; &quot;God in Islam,&quot; and &quot;African Supreme Beings,&quot; running collectively from page 3537 through 3579. None of those articles discuss the subject of &quot;God&quot; in the broad sense however. Nor is there any clearly apparent article discussing the topic, although their article on &quot;Deity&quot; seems to come closest. ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, New Edition,'' edited by Ted Honderich, 2005, pp. 341-342, clearly limits itself from the very beginning of the article to, quoting the beginning, &quot;The three main Western religions,...&quot; The Edwards ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy,'' 1967, has no article about &quot;God&quot;. The nearest approach is &quot;Concepts of God.&quot; On the basis of all of the above, I personally tend to think that as per [[WP:NAME]] it is not unreasonable for this article to perhaps limit itself exclusively to Abrahamic faiths, as per the Honderich encyclopedia and the regularity with which individuals of that faith use the word &quot;God&quot; as a name for their supreme being. Considering they are roughly 3.3 to 3.8 billion people today, out of roughly 8 billion, that is about half the extant world population, and that can make a rather strong case for it being the best place as per WP:NAME, although it may well be possible, I don't know, that in some African faiths and other religions they also might also regularly use the word &quot;God&quot; as the informal name of their supreme being. I am myself unaware of Zoroastrians using the word in that sense, although I do not presume to know everything. [[Supreme being]] is another extant article which can deal more closely with other instances of &quot;high gods&quot; or &quot;supreme gods&quot; in other faiths, and [[Deity]] is a good place for gods of a polytheistic type, which would include henotheistic gods.

For example if you grew up in the US Bible belt and the only religion you've ever heard of is Christianity, it doesnt help a lot when he enters wikipedia to search about God and the broad scope of the article is about ..... Christianity. Another example is a Muslim. Islam only recognises [[People of the Book]], hence some Muslims will therefore only hear about Judaism, Islam and Christianity in their lifetime. Wikipedia should be a place where we bridge this narrow viewpoint some people see in their lives. I feel like you're reinforcing this narrowness.

:::::::I'm curious, Pass a Method, do have any real ''evidence'' to back up your assertion above about what English-speaking readers are interested in, or is this just more OR/POV on your part? None of what you said actually seems to address [[WP:WEIGHT]] issues either. I'm not sure if you have any acquaintance with the major reference works on religion, the ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' and ''Religion Past and Present,'' but having gone through the former of the two extensively in recent months, including all the reviews of it I could find, it also tends to use examples relating to the major religions more often, because in general those are the references the average reader will understand. After all, if I made reference to the Australian [[Rainbow Serpent]] as an example of the world being a physical form of the creator, most readers, probably even including many Australians and Polynesians, are likely to think, &quot;Huh? Wtf?&quot; and that would detract from the clarity of the text. I cannot see any reason to sacrifice clarity without purpose. Regarding your own personal feelings, you are free to have whatever opinions you want, as is everyone else.

===Dialogue===
@Pass a Method: I appreciate your willingness to answer my questions. If I understand correctly, you believe that the article needs to be revised because it primarily covers the views about ''God'' of large world religions like Christianity and Islam. The problem you see is that there are schisms within these religions, so it's hard to say that ''Christians believe such and such''. If we had the article focused on lots of smaller religions, it would be much easier to say ''Zoroastrians believe such and such''. The other problem you see with the article is that if a Christian or a Muslim decides to search online about God, they should find an article that teaches them new things about small religions like Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Baha'i, etc., widening their perspectives from the narrow perspective they had before. Is this correct? &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:10.2pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:7pt&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 22:08, 25 July 2012 (UTC)
: Not excatly. I believe that smaller major religions should get equal coverage in the lede because smaller religions are probably less understood. This does not inclde tiny religions (such as rastafarianism, scientology, mandeans etc.). However this does include religons with at least a few million members or historically influential religions/Gods. Also i think that adding weight to the Islamic and Christian God is unnecesssary because they already have numerous articles on wikipedia.

::Ok, so equal weight for all religions above a certain cutoff, say, somewhere in &quot;few millions&quot; range. If we go by the list at adherents.org, and set the cutoff at Zoroastrianism (2.6 million ''cough'') then we get 17 major world religions (16, if you exclude the one they list as Secular/Nonreligious/etc.). If you give each of the 16 religions equal weight, you'd get 6.3% of the weight for Christianity, 6.3% for Islam, 6.3% for Hinduism, and so on down the list. Is that what you intended?
::On the other hand, you mentioned the problem that the major religions like Christianity have a multitude of disagreeing sects, so it is hard to summarize their view on God. Following this reasoning, if we are going to list all the religions that have more than 3 million adherents, it would be to our advantage to give weight to the views of the different Christian/Muslim denominations that have that many adherents as well. For instance, of the 1.2 billion Catholics in the world, we have eight churches that have over 3 million members ([[Latin Church]], [[Maronite Church]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], [[Apostolic Catholic Church]], [[Philippine Independent Church]], [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]], [[Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church]]) In Protestantism, we have forty. I'll stop there, but I could go on to count the denominations in Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Oriental Orthodoxy, and Restorationalism (Mormonism, Members Church of God International, New Apostalic Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, Iglesia ni Cristo). Following your logic, it seems we should give each of these denominations an equal weight in the article as well.

::: Adjwilley, im not sure why you put some much emphasis on religion statistic numbers. They fluctuate. For instance a Zoroastrian empire once made up 40% of thee world. Today Zoroastrianism is a dying religion. Shia Islam was once the dominant form of ilam, but today they are a minority. In Britain and Scandinavia Christianity was once the dominant belief, but now these countries are leaning towards atheism/irreligion.

::::FWIW, ''Melton's Encyclopedia of American Religions'' discussed roughly 2300 religious groups in the United States as per [http://www.gale.cengage.com/servlet/ItemDetailServlet?region=9&amp;imprint=000&amp;titleCode=EARE&amp;cf=e&amp;type=4&amp;id=225993 here]. Some of the material above makes some sense, but probably not as much as some might hope. One of the factors we have to include is [[WP:WEIGHT]]. And it is a violation of [[WP:OR]] to say, basically, that &quot;I don't like that source, so we can't base our conclusions on it, we have to base our conclusions on my opinions.&quot; And, honestly, there hasn't been that serious a fluctuation in the relative adherents of religion, barring population multiplication, for some time. The fact is religious population statistics have been fairly consistent, broadly, for a few hundred years now. This is not a [[History of the concept of God]] article, although, honestly, I think that probably is a notable and valuable topic for an article. The fact that some cherry-picked sources which one person finds supports their own apparent preconceived contentions does not necessarily prove that their conclusions are either responsible or of sufficient importance to alter content in their favor. And, honestly, if, after several decades, if the statistics change enough to support changes in the article to reflect the almost glacial &quot;fluctuation&quot; Pass a Method places so much emphasis on, we could always change the content to reflect that.

:::Pass a Method, I was only using the &quot;few millions&quot; metric because you had suggested it yourself as a cutoff for smaller religions. I'm not quite understanding your point about Zoroastrianism. Are you saying that Zoroastrianism should receive greater weight than others because it was significantly larger at one point? Because that seems to go against what you were saying earlier about all religions getting equal weight regardless of size (as long as they're over a few million).

:::: @Adjwilley When i said greater i meant that in an equality context. As for giving sects within larger religions weight, that would be appropriate if they have a concept of God that is suficiently different from their mainstream sect. For example Mormonism would fit that description. Or if reliable sources sufficiently cover their distinct god-view. I repeat that my criteria for a major religion is what reliable sources describe as major religions; i.e. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/var_rel.htm], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/time/origtime.htm] [[User:Pass a Method|&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;Pass a Method&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:PassaMethod|&lt;font color=&quot;grey&quot; face=&quot;papyrus&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 09:57, 26 July 2012 (UTC)
:::::I'm not certain what you mean by an equality context, but I think I understand the general plan: Equal weight to world religions who have more than a few million members, and give weight to the larger denominations within the larger religions whose views differ significantly from the mainstream. It sounds like a lot of work to create what would be ,in my opinion, a fairly messy article.

:::::Let me try a slightly different track. I'd like to make some wild assumptions and paint a different picture, for the sake of argument. Please understand, this is not a personal attack, and I expect that I'll be wrong for at least half of it. (I hope you'll let me know where I do go wrong.)
:::::So you're a decent editor and a decent person. You have a point of view, just like anybody else, and it probably lies somewhere on the  atheism/agnosticism/deism side of the spectrum. You also have strong points of view about various social and political issues. They are perfectly valid points of view, and you feel that it they often under-represented or mis-represented on Wikipedia. You decide to fix that. You go about inserting them into various articles, trying to follow the Wikipedia rules of WP:NPOV and WP:RS. Yet you meet a large amount of resistance from other editors: usually Christians. Probably of the American Evangelical variety. You feel this is wrong so you push harder. They keep winning.
:::::You come to this article. You read it and it bugs you because so much of it seems to be coming from that pesky Judeo-Christian point of view that you've been fighting for so long. You decide to fix that by adding sections on atheism and agnosticism, and another one on the evolution/creation controversy. You get reverted, and after some discussion on the talk page you realize that the new sections are a lost cause. You don't want to come across as pushing a particular point of view so you decide on a different track: Dilute the Judeo-Christian point of view. Take up the cause of oppressed Zoroastrians, Sikhs, and Greeks, put on the mantle of NPOV, and fill the article with controversy. If you can't win, nobody should. Or everybody.
:::::The problem is, it just doesn't seem to catch on. It doesn't quite work with the scope of the article. Logic snobs like me keep poking holes in your arguments and you have to keep changing them. You have to do a bunch of extra work digging up sources, and people still refuse to see the logic of your arguments. It's a tough position to be in.

:::::: Adjwilley, i admit im not a religious person but believe it or not, i was at a place of worship last night .... praying. Yes praying. And it took me 1 hour to travel to my preferred place of worship although i admt this is not a usual habit of mine. My spirituality levels flucuate. Back on topic, i honestly think this lede is not comparable with similar articles with a controversial theme. For example [[mosque]] which is a featured article does not give more weight to the largest mosques in the world. In fact the lede does not even mention the largest mosques. Another FA [[atheism]] does not give more weight to Hinduism than Wicca despite Hinduism being much larger.

:::::::Pass a Method, I appreciate you sharing that. I'm still not quite clear on your motivations (you didn't really comment on the scenario I painted above) but that seems only fair, since I have said very little about myself and my motivation. So here's my philosophy. I believe that most articles can be noncontroversial. Even articles about subjects that are controversial don't have to be controversial themselves. The featured articles on mosques and atheism are not written in a controversial manner, even though some might view the subject matter as being controversial. Muslims/non-Muslims/Atheists/non-Atheists can read those articles and pretty much agree with everything said.
:::::::I think editors often lose sight of this as they battle each other. Everybody wants to show their point of view is the correct one, and everybody wants the article to reflect their point of view. This leads to edit wars that harm the article, &quot;controversy&quot; sections to hold the [[WP:COATRACK|Coatrack]] material, and articles that are have a &quot;tit for tat&quot; tone. You end up with a fractured article that spends most of its time covering the various disagreements, but still does a poor job of covering the subject itself, which is what it was supposed to do in the first place. (Of course, please don't take that as me saying that I want to sweep any controversy under the rug. That's certainly not the case either. Significant controversies should be covered, but in a neutral tone, and without taking sides.)
:::::::Call me boring if you like. Articles I write aren't very exciting. I don't try to sensationalize things as the News Media does. I don't focus on the negative and controversial aspects as is the norm in American politics. My articles are less likely to attract POV editors because there's really nothing they can disagree with. Same with vandalism and edit warring.

===Should Hinduism come before Christianity and Islam?===
[[User:Pass a Method]] has repeatedly made changes to the third paragraph of the Lead beginning with ''&quot;There are many [[Names of God|names for God]], and different names are attached to different cultural ideas about who God is and what attributes he possesses.&quot;'', moving the sentence ''&quot;In [[Hinduism]], [[Brahman]] is often considered a [[Monism|monistic]] deity.&quot;'' to the beginning of the paragraph so that it precedes the discussion of Christian and Muslim names for God (i.e. Jehovah, Allah). This screws up the flow of the paragraph, and also causes weight problems. There is some additional discussion above. I've reverted the change twice, but Pass a Method continues to revert me, and I'm trying to avoid an edit war.

So, the question is: Should Hinduism come before Christianity and Islam in the Lead? [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=God&amp;curid=5042765&amp;diff=504092964&amp;oldid=503967900 Here] is the edit in question. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:10.2pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:7pt&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 20:15, 25 July 2012 (UTC)

== FYI: reminder on avoiding edit warring ==

{{Nutshell|title=This section|Communication is the key to avoiding conflict: follow [[Wikipedia:Editing policy#Talking and editing]].|shortcut=WP:AVOIDEDITWAR}}

In general, communication is the key to avoiding conflict: follow [[Wikipedia:Editing policy#Talking and editing]]. Once it is clear that there is a dispute, avoid relying solely on [[Wikipedia:edit summary|edit summaries]] and discuss the matter on the article's [[WP:TALK|talk page]]. The primary venue for discussing the dispute should be the article talk page, which is where a reviewing admin will look for evidence of trying to settle the dispute. 
It may help to remember that [[Wikipedia:There is no deadline|there is no deadline]] and that editors can add [[Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup|appropriate cleanup tags]] to problematic sections under current discussion. When discussion does not produce a conclusion, bringing wider attention to a dispute can lead to compromise. Consider getting a [[Wikipedia:Third opinion|third opinion]] or starting a [[WP:RFC|request for comments]]. Neutral editors aware of the dispute will help curb egregious edits while also building consensus about the dispute. When these methods fail, seek informal and formal [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]].

Some experienced editors deliberately adopt a policy of only reverting edits covered by the [[#Exceptions to 3RR|exceptions]] listed above, or limiting themselves to a single revert; if there is further dispute they seek dialog or outside help rather than make the problem worse. They [[Wikipedia:revert only when necessary|revert only when necessary]]. This policy may be particularly appropriate for controversial topics where views are polarized and emotions run high, and as a result edit warring is more frequent. 

The bottom line: ''use common sense, and do not participate in edit wars.'' Rather than reverting repeatedly, discuss the matter with others; if a revert is necessary, another editor may conclude the same and do it (without you prompting them), which would then demonstrate [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] for the action. [[Wikipedia:Requests for page protection|Request page protection]] rather than becoming part of the dispute by reverting.

*'''Strong oppose''' There already is an article on the Abrahamic god, see [[God in Abrahamic religions]]. Why do we need a duplicate? There are also several articles closely related to the Abrahamic God, (i.e. [[Creator deity]], [[God of Abraham]], [[God the Father]], [[Omnipotence]], [[Creationism]], [[monotheism]], [[Godhead in Christianity]], [[Great Architect of the Universe]], [[Personal god]], [[Intelligent designer]], [[Nontrinitarianism]], [[Tawhid]], [[God in Christianity]], [[Throne of God]], [[trinity]], [[God in Islam]], [[God in Judaism]] etc.) Furthermore, limiting it to the Abrahamic God would omit important content such as Brahman the Hindu God, or the Zoroastrian God who is often credited as being the first monotheistic god.

*'''Oppose''' No change in scope is needed.  The article is currently a reasonably well-balanced [[Wikipedia:Systemic bias|Worldview]] of the general subject matter.  I don't see a problem with increasing the prominence of links to [[God in Abrahamic religions]] high up in the article, but changing the scope of ''this'' article would be anti-NPOV.

*'''Oppose''' Even though I sometimes use a digital copy of ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' as a reality check, similarly to how John Carter is using it here. I think that ''major'' religions should be mentioned in the lede, including Buddhism and Hinduism, because the English word and concept, &quot;God,&quot; is widely used by scholars when studying those religions. Just do a Google Scholar search for &quot;God in Hinduism&quot; and &quot;God in Buddhism&quot;. It is also used often enough by English speaking adherents of those religions, because &quot;God&quot; is a concept that has many names, in different religions and ''languages''. As a worldwide and multicultural encyclopedia, I think Wikipedia needs to reflect that. I think it's overreaching to include Zorastrianism, Baha'i, and Sikhism in the lede, but they should be mentioned in the body of the article.

===Discussion===
I have consulted several reference sources to determine how they define the concept of &quot;God&quot;. The ''Encyclopedia of Religion,'' second edition, edited by Lindsay Jones, is generally considered with ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwarts''/''Religion Past and Present'' among the best reference sources on the topic, it does not have clear historic ties to a specific religious &quot;school,&quot; such as the [[Religiongeschichteschule]] which started RGG, and it generally has fewer, longer articles, more comparable to our own. EoR does not have a specific individual article on &quot;God,&quot; but rather that name is the collective title for the group of articles &quot;God in the Hebrew Scriptures,&quot; &quot;God in the New Testament,&quot; &quot;God in Postbiblical Christianity,&quot; &quot;God in Postbiblical Judaism,&quot; &quot;God in Islam,&quot; and &quot;African Supreme Beings&quot;. Only one of those articles is not clearly about the &quot;God&quot; of the Abrahamic faiths. &quot;The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, New Edition,&quot; ed. Ted Honderich, 2005, has an article under the title &quot;God,&quot; on pp. 341-342, which clearly limits its scope from the beginning of the article to &quot;The three main Western religions,&quot; Judaism, Christianity, Islam, etc. The old and venerable ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' ed. by Edwards has no article under the title &quot;God&quot;. Based on all this, it seems to me that the other extant reference works on this subject which do have articles on &quot;God&quot; have those articles relating to the Abrahamic &quot;God&quot; and, possibly, some African faiths which might also regularly use &quot;God&quot; as a sobriquet for their supreme being. The Abrahamic faiths in particular number around 40% or more of the world population, and they all, to some form or another, refer to their god as &quot;God&quot;. That makes a good case in my eyes that it is possibly the most common usage of the word as per [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. As indicated in EoR and elsewhere, &quot;Deity&quot; and &quot;Supreme Being&quot; are apparently the most frequently used terms for monotheistic/henotheistic supreme gods of other faiths.

In what ways would what you are proposing change the article from its current state? It isn't very clear. [[User:FormerIP|Formerip]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 16:42, 25 July 2012 (UTC)
:Substantially, I guess. based on the information above (and, by the way, I did not omit any sources in the above that didn't support this contention) the text of this article would change to, basically, reflect the extant content of [[God in Abrahamic religions]], while much of the content currently in the article not related to the Abrahamic God, and potentially other gods called by the sobriquet God, would be moved elsewhere. I hadn't actually thought all the details out in advance, which is probably unfortunately rather obvious. [[Deity]], and possibly [[monotheistic god]] if such is notable, could hold most of the other extant content, along with [[deity]] and [[supreme being]]. But, yeah, basically, the first step is to change the focus of the article - the rest can be determined later, based on the reference sources and other sources which have high academic regard relating to this topic.

:In response to Pass a Method's comments about the books used, those comments are irrational in the extreme. It is nonsensical, possibly bordering on the insane, to say that one of the most reliable sources in the field of religious studies is biased. I believe that this is simply a continuation of the behavioral issues, including obfuscation, distraction, and otherwise, which have become prominent here lately, and I believe it only gives ever more evidence of both the incompetence of the presenter of the information and their own obvious POV and refusal to address any matters of substance.

*I think this article provides a fair (although too brief) description of God in [[Monotheism]]. [[Monotheistic God]] correctly redirects here. It might be a good idea to expand this article and better reflect the concept of God in other monotheistic religions, but there is nothing wrong with current version. There is dispute about the order of mentioning different religions (edit summary) [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=God&amp;diff=504154820&amp;oldid=504145466]. I think we should simply follow chronological order per sources. [[User:My very best wishes|My very best wishes]] ([[User talk:My very best wishes|talk]]) 13:06, 26 July 2012 (UTC)
:*There is a somewhat rational point, which is a bit of a surprise, honestly. However, the comment above is also, I regret to say, so poorly and vaguely worded as to be, basically, not helpful. The phrase &quot;chronological order per sources&quot; is too vague to be in any way useful, at least so far as I can see. I cannot understand whether it is referring to chronoligical order in the objective sense based on the sources, or in the chronological order of information presented in the reliable secondary or tertiary sources. Also, the word &quot;sources&quot; itself is problematic, as it does not make it clear whether it is referring to the primary sources or the secondary sources which we try to base our opinions on. However, without any clear idea what the editor above is trying to say, I cannot offer any sort of rational response, because I cannot be sure exactly what the editor above is trying to convey. 
::*In response to First Light, that is a reasonable point. Unfortunately, as I think we all know, Google isn't a particularly reliable source, and its program is pretty much by definition subject to some degree of bias of its own. Regarding how the term is used in other languages, well, I think the wikipedias of other languages are the best place for content relating to the usage in other languages, but I haven't myself seen that we often adjust our own articles based on interpretations of what the similar content in other language wikipedias would be. We are the English wikipedia, and it seems, based on the evidence I have seen, including the Jones and other reference works, that in general the existing hatnote to &quot;[[deity]]&quot; and &quot;[[supreme being]]&quot; is sufficient to accomodate that disambiguation, although I might add another link to [[polytheism]]. And I grant the word &quot;deity&quot; is itself a little ambiguous in English usage, particularly India English, but that is a separate matter.

*'''Comment''': I agree with most that the current state of the article is not bad; I think the move to narrow the scope was intended to keep the article roughly in its current state. (There's recently been a push to try and include the views of several polytheistic/henotheistic religions in the Lead. See Zeus above, for instance.) I think John Carter's reasoning makes sense, but has been misinterpreted as trying to narrow the scope of the article to include ''only'' Abrahamic religions: a position which most editors (including myself) oppose. I think the scope should be first and foremost Monotheism. A little Henotheism is fine, but let's not abuse it. Polytheism belongs in other articles like Deity. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:10.2pt&quot;&gt;~[[User:Adjwilley|Adjwilley]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times; font-size:7pt&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Adjwilley|talk]])&lt;/span&gt; 19:29, 26 July 2012 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' Adjwilley, I agree, putting Zeus in the lede was absurd. And like I said above, I think smaller religions (Zorastrianism, Baha'i, etc.) shouldn't be in the lede, per [[WP:UNDUE]]. It could simply say &quot;....and many other religions...&quot;. But I do think that all major religions should be included, such as Hinduism. 
:: In response to the comment by John Carter (hey, do you think Burroughs chose a name with the initials &quot;J.C.&quot; on purpose, and also made him a &quot;Virginian&quot;, as in 'virgin birth', and savior of a world?): I confess to being lazy and just mentioning a Google scholar search for &quot;God in Hinduism&quot; and &quot;God in Buddhism.&quot; I'll do more work here, and point out how many reliable, notable, and academic sources address &quot;God in Hinduism&quot;, at least. This is just a small sampling, but I think it clearly shows that the ''concept'' of &quot;God&quot; (singular) in Hinduism is extremely notable and [[WP:DUE]] for the lede.

::There is so much more, but I'm going to leave it at that. With all due (and sincere) respect to [[Lindsay Jones]], I think he missed the boat by excluding God from non-Abrahamic religions. [[User:First Light|First Light]] ([[User talk:First Light|talk]]) 20:34, 26 July 2012 (UTC)
:::My apologies for possibly coming across as more strident than I intended to. But I would note the EoR actually doesn't include just the Abrahamic god in that group of articles. The last article in that set is &quot;African Supreme Beings.&quot; Having read it at the time, but not since, it was on that basis, and the fact that the extant texts/stories of many African religions have been at least somewhat influenced by the West, that I indicated the scope might be those theological entities which are perhaps most frequently referred to by the sobriquet &quot;God&quot; (or some synonym) by their worshippers. So I assume that there are a few African deities called &quot;God&quot; or a rough equivalent by their followers, although, like I said, I'm just operating on memory here. I would have no reservations about a [[List of monotheistic gods]], either, with short descriptions of them. So, [[Osanobwa]], one of the gods in that article on African supreme beings, would merit inclusion, and his name, roughly, translates into something roughly similar to &quot;God&quot; in the Western usage. Henotheism has to be included here, because early Mesopotamian religions, including proto-Judaism, were henotheistic, and there are references in the Old Testament which have been taken that way, and it makes no sense to exclude some of the OT material on that God on that basis. But, except for similar cases, I really do think that the clearly monotheistic deities merit separate coverage. 
:::I might include the various Australian gods referred to as &quot;All-Fathers&quot; as well, even though they're not included in that grouping of articles, given the very close similarity of their characteristics and, given culturally-sensitive translations, names. But I do think that there is a significant difference between gods/deities who are seen by their followers as being the &quot;all-everything&quot; original and sole creators and all other religions, even [[Zoroastrianism]], which according to some of the books I've read might not even be strictly monotheistic, as there is evidently evidence of a separate, independent creation by Angra Mainyu in some of the texts. So, in a sense, I'm not so much concerned about a separate article on the &quot;God&quot; of the Abrahamics, but, like I said, those Gods who are called &quot;God&quot; or its equivalent and described as having similar attributes by their followers. That rather unique designation of a single god seems to be sufficiently different qualities and phioosophy than, say, Zeus, the son of two gods, brother of others, and father of an unknown number of others, who does not even come close to having the same characteristics. 
:::Regarding ERB, personally, I think he was maybe coming up with as plain a name as he could think of that would still be recognizable. I sure hope he wasn't thinking of any sort of &quot;savior&quot; there. Eww. If you ever see any evidence of that, though, let me know, so I can change my name.

::::Thanks for the expanded explanation, and for helping us to see the broader picture. I think we generally agree, and maybe the RfC could be rephrased to reflect that in some way, if needed. That John Carter thing was my own harebrained and sudden original research idea, but there are so many parallels that it's interesting (also he is immortal, at around 30 years old, works seeming miracles....).

:::::What would you think of changing the phrasing to something like &quot;Should the scope of this article be changed to deal primarily, if not exclusively, with the group of gods who are known to their followers/adherents to be the sole creator of the universe, and, in general, possessing most if not all of the qualities of the Judeo-Christian god, such as being the all-powerful creator of the entirety of the universe?&quot; I acknowledge that this is a bit different from what some might call strictly &quot;monotheistic&quot;, because some of these other religions have other gods, but they are apparently rather clearly gods who are in some way subordinate to the sole original creator god. But, honestly, Gabriel, Michael, and the other angels of the Abrahamic faiths would qualify as somewhat lesser &quot;gods&quot; in some other religions as well.

::::::: Pass a Method, would it be asking too much of you to actually read the comments of others before making such comments? If you could be bothered to read them, you would note that the first comment of this discussion specifically indicated that African supreme beings would probably be included, in the group of those entities who are basically thought of as &quot;God&quot; in the sense of the capitalized, all-powerful, sole creator god. If you had read them, you would note that, basically, I am simply changing the phrasing. Is it really asking too much of you to actually read and respond to the comments made, rather than making such comments as the above which both fail to AGF and also, apparently, even read the comments of others? [[User:John Carter|John Carter]] ([[User talk:John Carter|talk]]) 19:41, 27 July 2012 (UTC)
::::::::John Carter, while I think the general idea is good and well-intended, it's hard to define God by having one particular God to whom all other Gods are compared... I think to say something more like &quot;.... for example the Judeo-Christian God, Brahman in Hinduism, Allah in Islam, etc.&quot; Or just to say a supreme Creator, omnipresent, all-powerful, etc. And it may just be too tricky for ''us'' to define &quot;God&quot; with a capital &quot;G&quot; in any way, so we really should depend on Reliable Sources instead. Devotees of Krishna see him as God, for example, and there are reliable sources for that. All of which is to say that we should err on the side of inclusion. [[User:First Light|First Light]] ([[User talk:First Light|talk]]) 04:10, 28 July 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::Actually, I don't disagree with what you say above, and certainly not about Krishna, or, for all I know at this point, some Amerind gods, etc. Basically, the question I see is this. There seems to me anyway to be sufficient cause for there to exist an article on monotheistic creator gods. Honestly, strictly speaking, that might include the Krishnaists as well, and possibly the Australian All-Fathers, although I am myself not so certain about whether the impact of their concept of [[The Dreaming]] might make it reasonable for them to be primarily spun out into a separate article. But, if such an article were to exist on a monotheistic creator god, where would it be put. [[Montheistic single creator gods]], which some might consider to be a possible spinout of [[Creator deity]], for instance, seems to me a little excessive in terms of length and maybe even somewhat confusing given the unusual construction. To my eyes, personally, using the title &quot;God&quot; as the title of an article on the monotheistic creator gods who were the only parties involved in their creation seems the best, and probably most easily understood, title for that article. So, in effect, I am saying this not because I think nothing else should necessarily be named by this title, but, given the fact that every article has a title, and there exist multiple other titles which can be and have been used for other deities over time, those other terms tend to be have been used often enough that I think most of the other &quot;types&quot; of gods/deities/what have you could be included in articles with other titles which might not be the best possible titles in a theoretical sense, but which are recognizable and possibly recognized enough as relating to those thoughts to be easily understood. Except for something like the rather clunky four word title I have proposed above, I really can't think of anything comparable for this concept, and, based on what I have seen, I tend to think that a fairly strong case could be made as per NAME for it to be used as the title. [[User:John Carter|John Carter]] ([[User talk:John Carter|talk]]) 14:35, 30 July 2012 (UTC)
{{outdent}}I agree, &quot;God&quot; is the best title, and it should be used in the capital &quot;G&quot; sense of the word. I notice that some academics use lower case and upper case &quot;g&quot; in their articles to make that distinction. Where there might be some room for flexibility is the use of capital &quot;God&quot; in reliable sources that refer to Lord of the Universe, Omnipresent, etc., but perhaps not the creator. That's why I mention Krishna, but only as an example. Within the article itself, that distinction can be make, if reliable sources do that. And in the lede, I generally support the current approach, without the need to specifically mention Baha, Waheguru, etc. This article is too Big for me to really spend time on—I think it would be an Omnipresent Problem to keep everyone happy :-), considering that [[Religious war|people kill each other]] every day over the issue.

:FWIW, I specified in some sense the &quot;monotheistic single creator god&quot; because some groups, including some Gnostics, from what I can tell believe that there is/was a single ultimate creator, but that the material world we know was the creation of some [[demiurge]], and that creation by a lesser being is the reason for the flaws in the world. Granted, I don't know how significantly different that would be in terms of theological impact, not myself knowing those groups particularly well, but I do acknowledge that there is likely to be some difference.

::I think that because there are so many grey areas, that type of discussion should even be covered in the article, assuming there are reliable sources talking about it. As I alluded above, I'm already in over my head here as far as actual article content. [[User:First Light|First Light]] ([[User talk:First Light|talk]]) 03:24, 1 August 2012 (UTC)

== Atheism ==

Why does this fall under Atheism in particular, the God of abrahamic religion is not the only major deity of organised religion. [[Special:Contributions/109.76.75.73|109.76.75.73]] ([[User talk:109.76.75.73|talk]]) 06:44, 31 August 2012 (UTC)

Agree.  I feel this article is very one-sided and biased.  It speaks about the Christian concept of God as if he is real and the others are fake.  In fact, this should be an article with links to all the different Gods and discuss them in short.  This article instead gives precedence of the Christian God simply because Christians have taken the TITLE God and gave it to their deity as its NAME.  This is not the case.  The Christian God's name is YHWH, Yehovah, Yahweh, Jehovah, etc. Not God.  [[Special:Contributions/75.190.244.183|75.190.244.183]] ([[User talk:75.190.244.183|talk]]) 20:01, 7 October 2012 (UTC)
:Hi, maybe reading the article, which discusses the Jewish, Islamic, Bahai, Hindu, Neopagan, and Zoroastrian conceptions of God, instead of reading y'all's perception about Christianity into it.  [[Maimonides]] and [[Al-Ghazali]], both discussed in the article as much as St. Augustine, were not Christians.  [[Stephen Jay Gould]], an agnostic, is mentioned for his views.  There are slightly more Christian authors, simply because most of the English-language sources are statistically more likely to have been by Christians.  Still, the article does actually discuss a variety of religions if you bother to read it. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 20:19, 7 October 2012 (UTC)
