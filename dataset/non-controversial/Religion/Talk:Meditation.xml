== Meditative brain alpha wave dominance ==

I just speed read meditation, and didn't see brain wave studies.  Did I miss, or should I add? [[User:32cllou|32cllou]] ([[User talk:32cllou|talk]]) 15:24, 7 March 2012 (UTC)

Here's the study that caught my interest http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/apjcn/volume17/vol17suppl.1/167-168S8-4.pdf while working on [[Tea]].  Love meditating.[[User:32cllou|32cllou]] ([[User talk:32cllou|talk]]) 19:04, 7 March 2012 (UTC)

Please note that the current article has a section entitled &quot;Scientific studies&quot; (perhaps needing cleanup?). It links to a main article entitled  [[Research on meditation]], which has a subsection called &quot;Brain waves during meditation&quot;.  So perhaps 32cllou should devote his/her available efforts to ensuring that that section is well done. 

In terms of mentioning scientific findings within this main article on meditation, I recall that our thinking has been that there's too much scientific research, and there are too many different points of view on it, to fit it all into this main article. Only highlights are possible - and I do see that &quot;brain activation&quot; is mentioned here as one of the findings about meditation. That could be expaned a bit, I'm sure, if there are secondary sources that can give a clear sense of what the nature (i.e., major and sustained findings) of those brain activation studies have been. But most if not all of the details and citations to single studies should be relegated to the other article on [[Research on meditation]]. Ideally, that article should be made high-quality, and this article's subsection can condense its most relevant key points. -- [[User:Presearch|Presearch]] ([[User talk:Presearch|talk]]) 19:27, 7 March 2012 (UTC)

== Which meditation? ==

Hi guys,

I think that the following quote from this article is clearly POV and go into detail about why I think this after the following blockquote.

&lt;blockquote&gt;This article mainly focuses on meditation in the broad sense of a type of discipline, found in various forms in many cultures, by which the practitioner attempts to get beyond the reflexive, &quot;thinking&quot; mind&lt;ref name=oknondiscursive&gt;This does not mean that all meditation seeks to take a person beyond ''all'' thought processes, only those processes that are sometimes referred to as &quot;discursive&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; (see Shapiro, 1982/1984; Bond, Ospina, et al, 2009; Appendix B, pp. 279-282 in Ospina, Bond, et al, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes called &quot;discursive thinking&quot;&lt;ref name=shapiro82discursive&gt;An influential definition by Shapiro (1982; republished 1984, 2008) states that &quot;''meditation refers to a family of techniques which have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way and an attempt not to dwell on discursive, ruminating thought''&quot; (p. 6, italics in original); the term &quot;discursive thought&quot; has long been used in Western philosophy, and is often viewed as a synonym to logical thought ({{cite book |title=Reading neoplatonism : Non-discursive thinking in the texts of plotinus, proclus, and damascius
 |last=Rappe|first=Sara|authorlink=|year= 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn= 978-0-521-65158-5
 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=_DrXt-7UGkkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=9780521651585#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=}}).&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;logic&quot;&lt;ref name=bond09logic&gt;Bond, Ospina et al (2009) -- see fuller discussion elsewhere on this page -- report that 7 expert scholars who had studied different traditions of meditation agreed that an &quot;essential&quot; component of meditation &quot;Involves logic relaxation: not 'to intend' to analyze the possible psychophysical effects, not 'to intend' to judge the possible results, not 'to intend' to create any type of expectation regarding the process&quot; (p. 134, Table 4). In their final consideration, all 7 experts regarded this feature as an &quot;essential&quot; component of meditation; none of them regarded it as merely &quot;important but not essential&quot; (p. 234, Table 4). (This same result is presented in Table B1 in Ospina, Bond, et al, 2007, p. 281)&lt;/ref&gt;) into a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state. The terms &quot;meditative practice&quot; and &quot;meditation&quot; are mostly used here in this broad sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It would make sense for us to say that several Western scholars believe that one quality of meditation is to go beyond the reflexive, thinking mind. This claim is supported by the citations presented. If you would like you can see two of the sources cited in the paragraph [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/92/3/581/ here] and [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;id=84dLpxA-yyoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Ospina+2009&amp;ots=gDD_4v6FLY&amp;sig=QT4mgD_N1cnolrvox6KBk4iBHUI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false here]. Note that the former is the opinion of several Western scholars, and even says in the methodology section, &quot;Due to the lack of general consensus on a definition of meditation in the scientific literature...,&quot; and the latter source is also a study published by Shapiro, a scientist.

It seems obvious that the view that all the types of meditation mentioned on this page are done in order to 'go beyond the reflexive, thinking mind,' is not universally shared by all, or a majority, of people who practice or think about meditation I have provided a quote before on this talk page of the Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard stating very clearly that he believed meditation is not only about quieting the mind, and I think that in general the idea that there might be some sort of consensus amongst all the religious and secular groups mentioned on this page as to what are the qualities of meditation is hard to support. The sources cited in the paragraph from the article quoted above do support the claim that the viewpoint of several Western scholars is that the goal of meditation is to move beyond the thinking mind, but don't support the claim that this aim is expressed by all, or most, of the people who concern themselves with meditation.

The quote above is already within the Western definitions section. I suggest we simply add in the fact that 'moving beyond the reflexive mind' is a quality of meditation &lt;i&gt;in the viewpoint of several Westerners&lt;/i&gt;. Without this change the section is POV. [[User:Makeswell|makeswell]] ([[User talk:Makeswell|talk]]) 06:07, 2 June 2012 (UTC)

:So you want to reopen this issue. The last time around, your arguments were found unpersuasive, although you kept persisting in them, often erecting big walls of text. If you get little response this time, there is a very real possibility that people are reluctant to spend time on this issue again. Do ''NOT'' change the page itself unless there emerges a clear consensus on the talk page, supported by something more than your own arguments and the silence of almost everyone else. -- [[User:Presearch|Presearch]] ([[User talk:Presearch|talk]]) 17:54, 2 June 2012 (UTC)
::Yes I would like to open discussion on this topic again. The previous conversation on this topic was almost entirely between me and Health Researcher (your alter-ego Presearch?). It's true that hearing from others would help to move this conversation along. Any opinions would be appreciated and listened to.

== the lead ==

The lede has become very messy and redundant as well. Do we really intend to list examples of meditative practices in the lead? If so, perhaps we should group them by religious tradition as we do in the article, for instance, &quot;In Judaism people do _(insert type of meditation here)_____ and _(insert type of meditation here)____, in Buddhism _____ and ______, and in Islam _____ and _______.&quot; [[User:Makeswell|makeswell]] ([[User talk:Makeswell|talk]]) 13:29, 30 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
