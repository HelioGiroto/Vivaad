[[File:Hortus Deliciarum - Hell.jpg|thumb|alt=|250px|Medieval illustration of Hell in the [[Hortus deliciarum]] manuscript of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (about 1180)]]
[[File:Hell-fresco-from-Raduil.jpg|thumb|Hell - detail from a fresco in the medieval church St. Nicolas in Raduil, [[Bulgaria]]]]

In many mythological, folklore and religious traditions, '''hell''' is a place of eternal [[suffering]] and [[punishment]] in an [[afterlife]], often after [[resurrection]]. [[Religion]]s with a [[Philosophy_of_history#Cyclical_and_linear_history|linear]] [[Divinity|divine]] history often depict hells as endless.&lt;!--(for example, see [[Hell in Christian beliefs]])--&gt; Religions with a [[reincarnation|cyclic history]] often depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s.&lt;!--(for example, see Chinese [[Diyu]])--&gt; Typically these traditions locate hell under the [[Earth]]'s external surface and often include entrances to Hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include [[Heaven]], [[Purgatory]], [[Paradise]], and [[Limbo]].

Other traditions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward, merely describe hell as an abode of the dead, a neutral place located under the surface of Earth (for example, see [[sheol]] and [[Hades]]). Modern understandings of hells often depict them abstractly, as a state of loss rather than as fiery torture literally underground, but this view of the concept of a hell can, in fact, be traced back into the ancient and medieval periods as well.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} Hell is sometimes portrayed as populated with [[demon]]s who torment those dwelling there. Many are ruled by a [[List of death deities|death god]] such as [[Nergal]], [[Hades]], [[Hel (being)|Hel]], [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Enma]] or the [[Devil]].

==Etymology and Germanic mythology==
[[File:Hel (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Hel'' (1889) by [[Johannes Gehrts]].]]
[[File:Dore woodcut Divine Comedy 01.jpg|thumb|A vision of Hell from [[Dante]]’s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Illustration by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

The modern English word ''Hell'' is derived from Old English ''hel'', ''helle'' (about 725 AD to refer to a nether world of the dead) reaching into the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagan period]], and ultimately from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*halja'', meaning &quot;one who covers up or hides something&quot;.&lt;ref name=BARNHART348&gt;[[Robert Barnhart|Barnhart, Robert K.]] (1995) ''The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology'', page 348. [[Harper Collins]] ISBN 0-06-270084-7&lt;/ref&gt; The word has cognates in related [[Germanic languages]] such as [[Old Frisian]] ''helle'', ''hille'', [[Old Saxon]] ''hellja'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''helle'' (modern Dutch ''hel''), [[Old High German]] ''helle'' (Modern German ''[[Holle (goddess)|Hölle]]''), [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] &quot;helvede&quot;/''helvete'' (''hel'' + [[Old Norse]] ''vitti'', &quot;punishment&quot; whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:víti#Icelandic|víti]]'' &quot;hell&quot;), and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''halja''.&lt;ref name=BARNHART348/&gt; Subsequently, the word was used to transfer a pagan concept to Christian theology and its vocabulary&lt;ref name=BARNHART348/&gt; (however, for the Judeo-Christian origin of the concept see [[Gehenna]]).

The English word ''hell'' has been theorized as being derived from Old Norse ''[[Hel (location)|hel]]''&lt;ref name=BARNHART348/&gt; but the cognate does appear in all the other languages and has a Proto-Germanic origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hell&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Among other sources, the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled from earlier traditional sources in the 13th century, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], provide information regarding the beliefs of the [[Norse paganism|Norse pagans]], including a being named [[Hel (being)|Hel]], who is described as ruling over an underworld location of the [[Hel (location)|same name]].

==Religion, mythology, and folklore==
Hell appears in several [[mythology|mythologies]] and [[religion]]s. It is commonly inhabited by [[demon]]s and the [[soul]]s of dead people. A fable about hell which recurs in [[folklore]] across several cultures is the [[allegory of the long spoons]]. Hell is often depicted in art and literature, perhaps most famously in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.

===Punishments===
Punishment in Hell typically corresponds to [[sins]] committed during life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with [[Damnation#Religious|damned souls]] suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's [[myth of Er]] or Dante's ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.

In many religious cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is traditionally depicted as fiery and painful, inflicting guilt and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous verses in the Qu'ran and New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=January 2011}} Despite these common depictions of Hell as a place of fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold. Buddhist - and particularly Tibetan Buddhist - descriptions of hell feature an equal number of hot and cold hells. Among Christian descriptions [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' portrays the innermost (9th) circle of Hell as a frozen lake of blood and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

But cold also played a part in earlier Christian depictions of hell, beginning with the [[Apocalypse of Paul]], originally from the early third century;&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Gardiner, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/visions-of-heaven-and-hell-before-dante/oclc/18741120 ''Visions of Heaven and Hell Before Dante''] (New York, Italica Press, 1989), p. 43.

====Ancient Egypt====
[[File:Folio 108r - Hell.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lucifer]] - torturing souls as well as being tortured himself in hell ([[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]], by the [[Limbourg brothers]].]]

With the rise of the cult of [[Osiris]] during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] the &quot;democratization of religion&quot; offered to even his humblest followers the prospect of eternal life, with moral fitness becoming the dominant factor in determining a person's suitability. At death a person faced judgment by a tribunal of forty-two divine judges. If they had led a life in conformance with the precepts of the Goddess [[Maat]], who represented truth and right living, the person was welcomed into the [[Two Fields]]. If found guilty the person was thrown to a &quot;devourer&quot; and didn't share in eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;
''Religion and Magic in Ancient Egypt'', Rosalie David, p158-159, Penguin, 2002, ISBN 01402622520 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Invalid length.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person taken by the devourer is subject first to terrifying punishment and then annihilated. These depictions of punishment may have influenced medieval perceptions of the inferno in hell via early [[Christian]] and [[Copt]]ic texts.&lt;ref&gt;
''The Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology: The Oxford Guide'', &quot;Hell&quot;, p161-162, Jacobus Van Dijk, Berkley Reference, 2003, ISBN 0-425-19096-X&lt;/ref&gt;
Purification for those considered justified appears in the descriptions of &quot;Flame Island&quot;, where humans experience the triumph over evil and rebirth. For the dammed complete destruction into a state of non-being awaits. but there is no suggestion of eternal torture; the weighing of the heart in [[Egyptian Mythology]] can lead to annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Divine pardon at judgement always remained a central concern for the Ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Egyptian Religion&quot;, Jan Assman, The Encyclopedia of Christianity, p77, vol2, Wm. B Eerdmans Publishing, 1999, ISBN 90-04-11695-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern understanding of Egyptian notions of hell relies on six ancient texts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsEGY.html Hell-on-line.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

#''The Book of Two Ways'' (''Book of the Ways of Rosetau'')
# ''The Book of Amduat'' (''Book of the Hidden Room'', ''Book of That Which Is in the Underworld'')
# ''The Book of Gates''
# ''The Book of the Dead'' (''Book of Going Forth by Day'')
# ''The Book of the Earth''
# ''The Book of Caverns''

====Ancient Near East====
The cultures of [[Mesopotamia]] (including [[Sumer]]ia, the [[Akkadian Empire]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]), the [[Hittites]] and the [[Canaanites]]/[[Ugarit]]s reveal some of the earliest evidence for the notion of a Netherworld or [[Underworld]]. From among the few texts that survive from these civilizations, this evidence appears in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]],'' the “Descent of [[Inanna]] to the Netherworld,” “[[Baal]] and the Underworld,” the “Descent of [[Ishtar]]” and the “Vision of Kummâ.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsANE.html Hell-on-line.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greek====
{{Main|Tartarus}}
In classic [[Greek mythology]], below Heaven, Earth, and [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]] is [[Tartarus]], or ''Tartaros'' (Greek Τάρταρος, deep place). It is either a deep, gloomy place, a pit or abyss used as a dungeon of torment and suffering that resides within [[Greek underworld|Hades]] (the entire underworld) with Tartarus being the hellish component. In the ''Gorgias'', [[Plato]] (c. 400 BC) wrote that souls were judged after death and those who received punishment were sent to Tartarus. As a place of punishment, it can be considered a hell. The classic Hades, on the other hand, is more similar to Old Testament [[Sheol]].

====Europe====
The hells of Europe include Breton Mythology's &quot;Anaon&quot;, [[Celtic Mythology]]'s &quot;[[Uffern]]&quot;, [[Slavic mythology]]'s &quot;Peklo&quot;, the hell of Sami mythology and Finnish &quot;[[tuonela]]&quot; (&quot;manala&quot;).

====Asia====
The hells of Asia include the [[Bagobo]] “Gimokodan” and Ancient [[Indian mythology]]'s “Kalichi&quot; or &quot;[[Naraka]]&quot;.

In folklore among the [[Ainu people]], hell is below ground, and is described as an uninviting wet place reserved for sinful people.&lt;ref&gt;Ainu Folklore: Traditions and Culture of the Vanishing Aborigines of Japan - Page 150, Carl Etter - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

====Africa====
African hells include Haida Mythology's “Hetgwauge” and the hell of Swahili Mythology (kuzimu). 
[[Serer religion]] rejects the general notion of [[heaven]] and hell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thiaw&quot;&gt;{{fr}} [[Issa Laye Thiaw|Thiaw, Issa Laye]], &quot;La religiosité des [[Serer people|Seereer]], avant et pendant leur islamisation&quot;, [in] Éthiopiques, no. 54, volume 7, 2e semestre 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In Serer religion, acceptance by the ancestors who have long departed is as close to heaven. Rejection and becoming a wandering soul is as close to hell after one [[Death|passes over]]. The souls of the dead must make their way to ''Jaaniw'' (the sacred dwelling place of the soul). Only those who have lived their lives on earth in accordance with [[Serer religion#Religious law|Serer doctrines]] will be able to make this necessary journey and thus accepted by the ancestors. Those who can't make the journey become lost and wandering souls, but they do not burn in &quot;hell fire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thiaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], &quot;La civilisation sereer, vol. II: ''Pangool'', Nouvelles éditions africaines, [[Dakar]], 1990, pp 91-128, ISBN 2-7236-1055-1 (''Jaaniw'', variation: ''&quot;Jaaniiw&quot;'')&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oceania====
The Oceanic hells include Samoan Mythology's “O le nu'u-o-nonoa” and the hells of Bangka Mythology and Caroline Islands Mythology.

====Native American====
The hells of the Americas include the [[Aztec religion]]'s “Mictlan”, [[Inuit religion]]'s “Adlivun”, and the [[Yanomami]] religion's “Shobari Waka”. In [[Mayan religion]], ''[[Xibalba|Xibalbá]]'' is the dangerous [[underworld]] of nine levels ruled by the demons ''[[Vucub Caquix]]'' and ''[[Hun Came]]''. The road into and out of it is said to be steep, thorny and very forbidding. ''[[Metnal]]'' is the lowest and most horrible of the nine Hells of the underworld, ruled by ''[[Ah Puch]]''. Ritual healers would intone healing prayers banishing diseases to ''Metnal''. Much of the [[Popol Vuh]] describes the adventures of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] in their cunning struggle with the evil lords of ''Xibalbá''.

The [[Aztec]]s believed that the dead traveled to [[Mictlan]], a neutral place found far to the north. There was also a legend of a place of white flowers, which was always dark, and was home to the gods of death, particularly Mictlantecutli and his spouse Mictlantecihuatl, which means literally &quot;lords of Mictlan&quot;. The journey to Mictlan took four years, and the travelers had to overcome difficult tests, such as passing a mountain range where the mountains crashed into each other, a field where the wind carried flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome [[jaguar]]s.

===Abrahamic===

====Judaism====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
Early Judaism had no concept of Hell, though the concept of an afterlife was introduced during the Hellenic period, apparently from neighboring Hellenistic religions. It occurs for example in Book of Daniel. Daniel 12:2 proclaims &quot;And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame and everlasting contempt.&quot;
[[Judaism]] does not have a specific doctrine about the afterlife, but it does have a mystical/Orthodox tradition of describing [[Gehenna]]. Gehenna is not Hell, but originally a grave and in later times a sort of [[Purgatory]] where one is judged based on one's life's deeds, or rather, where one becomes fully aware of one's own shortcomings and negative actions during one's life. The [[Kabbalah]] explains it as a &quot;waiting room&quot; (commonly translated as an &quot;entry way&quot;) for all souls (not just the wicked). The overwhelming majority of rabbinic thought maintains that people are not in [[Gehenna]] forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be 12 months, however there has been the occasional noted exception. Some consider it a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the world to come)|Olam Habah]] (''heb.'' עולם הבא; ''lit.'' &quot;The world to come&quot;, often viewed as analogous to [[Heaven]]). This is also mentioned in the [[Kabbalah]], where the soul is described as breaking, like the flame of a candle lighting another: the part of the soul that ascends being pure and the &quot;unfinished&quot; piece being reborn.

According to Jewish teachings, hell is not entirely physical; rather, it can be compared to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of [[God]], one is said to be in [[gehinom]]. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of [[teshuva]] (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the [[Torah]].

====Christianity====
[[File:Valley of Hinom PA180090.JPG|thumb|&quot;[[Gehenna]]&quot;, [[Valley of Hinnom]], 2007]]
{{Main|Christian views on Hell}}
The Christian doctrine of hell derives from the teaching of the [[New Testament]], where hell is typically described using the Greek words ''[[Tartarus]]'' or ''[[Hades in Christianity|Hades]]'' or the Hebrew word ''[[Gehenna]]''.

These three terms have different meanings and must be recognized.
* [[Hades in Christianity|Hades]] has similarities to the Old Testament term, [[Sheol]] as &quot;the place of the dead&quot;. Thus, it is used in reference to both the righteous and the wicked, since both wind up there eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* [[Gehenna]] refers to the &quot;Valley of Hinnon&quot;, which was a garbage dump outside of Jerusalem. It was a place where people burned their garbage and thus there was always a fire burning there. Bodies of those deemed to have died in sin without hope of salvation (such as people who committed suicide) were thrown there to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;The New Schaf-Herzog Encyclopedia of religious Knowledge pg. 415&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gehenna]] is used in the New Testament as a metaphor for the final place of punishment for the wicked after the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;The New Schaf-Herzog Encyclopedia of religious Knowledge pgs. 414-415&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Tartaro'' (the verb &quot;throw to [[Tartarus]]&quot;) occurs only once in the New Testament in II Peter 2:4, where it is parallel to the use of the noun form in [[1 Enoch]] as the place of incarceration of 200 fallen angels. It mentions nothing about human souls being sent there in the afterlife.
[[File:Fra Angelico 010.jpg|thumb|210px|''The Last Judgement, Hell'', circa 1431, by [[Fra Angelico]]]]
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] defines Hell as &quot;a state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed.&quot;  One finds themselves in Hell as the result of dying in [[mortal sin]] without repenting and accepting God's merciful love, becoming eternally separated from Him by one's own free choice&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Article 1033&lt;/ref&gt; immediately after death.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Article 1035&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Roman Catholic Church]], many other Christian churches, such as the Baptists and Episcopalians, and some [[Greek Orthodox]] churches,&lt;ref&gt;See Kallistos Ware, “Dare we hope for the salvation of all?&quot; in The Inner Kingdom: Volume 1 of the Collected Works&lt;/ref&gt; Hell is taught as the final destiny of those who have not been found worthy after the [[general resurrection]] and [[last judgment]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20:11-15 Revelation 20:11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6:23 Romans 6:23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mt 25:31, 32, 46&lt;/ref&gt; where they will be eternally punished for [[sin]] and permanently separated from God.  The nature of this judgment is inconsistent with many [[Protestant]] churches teaching the saving comes from accepting Jesus Christ as their savior, while the [[Greek Orthodox]] and [[Catholic Church]]es teach that the judgment hinges on both faith and works. However, many [[Liberal Christian]]s throughout Liberal Protestant, Anglican and some Orthodox churches believe in [[Universal Reconciliation]] (see below) even though it might contradict more evangelical views in their denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/699929.stm | work=BBC| title=Hell - it's about to get hotter | date=4 April 2000 | accessdate=30 April 2012 | first1=Joe | last1=Gooden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern Christian theologians subscribe to the doctrines of [[Christian conditionalism|Conditional Immortality]]. Conditional Immortality is the belief that the soul dies with the body and does not live again until the resurrection. This is the view held by a few Christian sects such as the Living Church of God, The Church of God International, and Seventh Day Adventist Church.

[[Annihilationism]] is the belief that the soul is mortal unless granted eternal life, making it possible to be destroyed in Hell.

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] hold that the soul ceases to exist when the person dies&lt;ref name=&quot;bibleteach&quot;&gt;&quot;What Does the Bible Really Teach?&quot;, 2005, Published by Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore that Hell (Sheol or Hades) is a state of non-existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;bibleteach&quot; /&gt; In their theology, Gehenna differs from Sheol or Hades in that it holds no hope of a resurrection.&lt;ref name=&quot;bibleteach&quot; /&gt; Tatarus is held to be the metaphorical state of debasement of the fallen angels between the time of their moral fall (Genesis chapter 6) until their post-millennial destruction along with Satan (Revelation chapter 20).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Insight on the scriptures, Volume 2&quot;, 1988, Published by Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universal Reconciliation]] is the belief that all human souls (even demons and fallen angels) will be eventually reconciled with God and admitted to Heaven. This view is held by some Unitarian-Universalists.&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'', &quot;Hell&quot;, InterVarsity Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', &quot;Hell&quot;, InterVarsity Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Evangelical Alliance]] Commission on Truth and Unity Among Evangelicals, ''The Nature of Hell'', Paternoster, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]’s [[Second Coming]] [[Christian]] revelation, hell exists because evil people want it.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html Heaven and its Wonders and Hell From Things Heard and Seen(Swedenborg Foundation, 1946 #545ff.)]&lt;/ref&gt;  They, not God, introduced evil to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html The True Christian Religion Containing the Universal Theology of The New Church Foretold by the Lord in Daniel 7; 13, 14; and in Revelation 21; 1, 2] (Swedenborg Foundation, 1946, #489ff.).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Main|Jahannam}}
[[File:Burning.jpg|thumb|Prophet [[Muhammad]], along with [[Buraq]] and [[Gabriel]], visit Hell, and see &quot;[[Prostitutes|shameless women]]&quot; being eternally punished for exposing their hair to the sight of strangers. Persian, 15th century.]]
[[Muslims]] believe in ''[[jahannam]]'' (in [[Arabic Language|Arabic]]: جهنم) (which is related to the Hebrew word ''gehinnom'' and resembles the versions of Hell in [[Christianity]]). In the [[Qur'an]], the holy book of [[Islam]], there are literal descriptions of the condemned in a fiery Hell, as contrasted to the garden-like [[Paradise]] (''[[jannah]]'') enjoyed by righteous believers.

In addition, Heaven and Hell are split into many different levels depending on the actions perpetrated in life, where punishment is given depending on the level of evil done in life, and good is separated into other levels depending on how well one followed God while alive. The gate of Hell is guarded by [[Maalik]] who is the leader of the angels assigned as the guards of hell also known as ''Zabaaniyah''.

Although generally Hell is often portrayed as a hot steaming and tormenting place for sinners, there is one Hell pit which is characterized differently from the other Hell in Islamic tradition. ''Zamhareer'' is the Hell of extreme coldness, of unbearable [[blizzard]]s, ice, and snow.

The lowest pit of Hell is Hawiyah, meant for those hypocrites who claimed aloud to believe in Allah and His messenger but denounced both in their hearts. [[Hypocrisy]] is considered to be one of the most dangerous sins, along with [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

====Bahá'í Faith====
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the conventional descriptions of Hell and Heaven are considered to be symbolic representations of spiritual conditions. The [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] describe closeness to God to be heaven, and conversely, remoteness from God as hell.&lt;ref name=&quot;lafd&quot;&gt;{{cite book

====Buddhism====
{{Main|Naraka (Buddhism)}}
[[File:Ngaye (Naraka) in Burmese art.jpg|thumb|Naraka in the Burmese representation]]
In &quot;Devaduta Sutta&quot;, the 130th discourse of the [[Majjhima Nikaya]], Buddha teaches about the hell in vivid detail. Buddhism teaches that there are five (sometimes six) realms of rebirth, which can then be further subdivided into degrees of agony or pleasure. Of these realms, the hell realms, or ''Naraka'', is the lowest realm of rebirth. Of the hell realms, the worst is ''[[Avici|Avīci]]'' or &quot;endless suffering&quot;. The Buddha's disciple, [[Devadatta]], who tried to kill the Buddha on three occasions, as well as create a schism in the monastic order, is said to have been reborn in the Avici Hell.

However, like all realms of rebirth, rebirth in the Hell realms is not permanent, though suffering can persist for eons before being reborn again. In the [[Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha teaches that eventually even Devadatta will become a Pratyekabuddha himself, emphasizing the temporary nature of the Hell realms. Thus, Buddhism teaches to escape the endless migration of rebirths (both positive and negative) through the attainment of [[Nirvana]].

The [[Bodhisattva]] [[Ksitigarbha]], according to the Ksitigarbha Sutra, made a great vow as a young girl to not reach Nirvana until all beings were liberated from the Hell Realms or other unwholesome rebirths. In popular literature, Ksitigarbha travels to the Hell realms to teach and relieve beings of their suffering.

====Hinduism====
{{Main|Naraka (Hinduism)}}

[[File:Yama's Court and Hell.jpg|thumb|Yama's Court and Hell. The Blue figure is [[Yamaraja]] (The Hindu god of death) with his consort [[Yami]] and [[Chitragupta]] &lt;br /&gt; 17th century Painting from Government Museum, [[Chennai]].]]
Early Vedic religion doesn't have a concept of Hell. Ṛg-veda mentions three realms, bhūr (the [[earth]]), svar (the [[sky]]) and [[bhuvas]] or antarikṣa (the middle area, i.e. air or [[atmosphere]])). In later Hindu literature, especially the law books and Puranas, more realms are mentioned, including a realm similar to Hell, called [[naraka]] (in Devanāgarī: नरक). [[Yama]] as first born human (together with his twin sister [[Yamī]]) in virtue of precedence becomes ruler of men and a judge on their departure. Originally he resides in Heaven, but later, especially medieval traditions, mention his court in naraka.

In the law-books (smṛtis and dharma-sūtras, like the Manu-smṛti) naraka is a place of punishment for sins. It is a lower spiritual plane (called [[naraka-loka]]) where the spirit is judged, or partial fruits of [[karma]] affected in a next life. In [[Mahabharata]] there is a mention of the [[Pandavas]] and the [[Kauravas]] both going to Heaven.At first Yudhisthir goes to heaven where he sees Duryodhana enjoying in heaven, Indra tells him Duryodhana is in heaven as he did his Kshatriya duties, then he shows Yudhisthir hell where it appears his brothers are but later its revealed it was a test for Yudhisthir and his brothers and Kauravas both are in heaven and both live happily in divine abode of gods. Hells are also described in various [[Purana]]s and other scriptures. Garuda Purana gives a detailed account of Hell, its features and enlists amount of punishment for most of the crimes like a modern day penal code.

It is believed that people who commit sins go to Hell and have to go through punishments in accordance with the sins they committed. The god [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yamarāja]], who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are kept by [[Chitragupta]], who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with their balance of [[karma]]. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; but if one has generally led a pious life, one ascends to [[svarga]], a temporary realm of enjoinment similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation according to the law of karma.

====Jainism====
[[File:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|right|17th century cloth painting depicting seven levels of [[Jain cosmology|Jain]] hell and various tortures suffered in them. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over the each hell.]]
{{Main|Naraka (Jainism)}}
In [[Jain cosmology]], Naraka (translated as hell) is the name given to realm of existence having great suffering. However, a Naraka differs from the hells of [[Abrahamic religions]] as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long—measured in billions of years. A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.

The hells are situated in the seven grounds at the lower part of the universe. The seven grounds are:
# Ratna prabha
# Sharkara prabha.
# Valuka prabha.
# Panka prabha.
# Dhuma prabha.
# Tamaha prabha.
# Mahatamaha prabha.

The hellish beings are a type of souls which are residing in these various hells. They are born in hells by sudden manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =English trans. by K. K. Dixit}} pp. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The hellish beings possess ''vaikriya''  body (protean body which can transform itself and take various forms). They have a fixed life span (ranging from ten thousand to billions of years) in the respective hells where they reside. According to Jain scripture, [[Tattvarthasutra]], following are the causes for birth in hell:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250-52&lt;/ref&gt;
#Killing or causing pain with intense passion.
#Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts.
#Vowless and unrestrained life.&lt;ref&gt;refer [[Mahavrata]] for the vows and restraints in Jainism&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taoism====
Ancient [[Taoism]] had no concept of Hell, as morality was seen to be a man-made distinction and there was no concept of an immaterial soul. In its home country [[China]], where Taoism adopted tenets of other religions, popular belief endows Taoist Hell with many deities and spirits who punish sin in a variety of horrible ways. This is also considered Karma for Taoism.

====Chinese folk beliefs====
{{Main|Diyu}}
[[File:ROM-ChineseGallery-DemonSculpture.png|upright|thumb|right|A Chinese glazed earthenware sculpture of &quot;Hell's torturer,&quot; 16th century, [[Ming Dynasty]]]]
''Diyu'' ({{zh|t=地獄|s=地狱|p=Dìyù|w=Ti-yü}}; Japanese: 地獄, ''jigoku''; literally &quot;earth prison&quot;) is the realm of the dead in [[Chinese mythology]]. It is very loosely based upon the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]] combined with traditional Chinese afterlife beliefs and a variety of popular expansions and re-interpretations of these two traditions. Ruled by [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yanluo Wang]], the King of Hell, Diyu is a maze of underground levels and chambers where souls are taken to atone for their earthly sins.

Incorporating ideas from [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as well as traditional Chinese folk religion, Diyu is a kind of purgatory place which serves not only to punish but also to renew spirits ready for their next incarnation. There are many deities associated with the place, whose names and purposes are the subject of much conflicting information.

The exact number of levels in Chinese Hell - and their associated deities - differs according to the Buddhist or Taoist perception. Some speak of three to four 'Courts', other as many as ten. The ten judges are also known as the 10 Kings of [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]]. Each Court deals with a different aspect of atonement. For example, murder is punished in one Court, adultery in another. According to some Chinese legends, there are eighteen levels in Hell. Punishment also varies according to belief, but most legends speak of highly imaginative chambers where wrong-doers are sawn in half, beheaded, thrown into pits of filth or forced to climb trees adorned with sharp blades.

However, most legends agree that once a soul (usually referred to as a 'ghost') has atoned for their deeds and repented, he or she is given the Drink of Forgetfulness by [[Meng Po]] and sent back into the world to be reborn, possibly as an animal or a poor or sick person, for further punishment.

====Zoroastrianism====
{{Main|Zoroastrian eschatology}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] has historically suggested several possible fates for the wicked, including annihilation, purgation in molten metal, and eternal punishment, all of which have standing in Zoroaster's writings. [[Zoroastrian eschatology]] includes the belief that wicked souls will remain in hell until, following the arrival of three saviors at thousand-year intervals, [[Ahura Mazda]] reconciles the world, destroying evil and resurrecting tormented souls to perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ubfellowship.org/archive/readers/601_zoroastrianism.htm | title=An Introduction to Zoroastrianism | author=Meredith Sprunger | accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sacred [[Gathas]] mention a “House of the Lie″ for those “that are of an evil dominion, of evil deeds, evil words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Yasna]] 49:11, {{cite web | url=http://www.avesta.org/yasna/y47to50b.htm | title=Avesta: Yasna | accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the best-known Zoroastrian text to describe hell in detail is the [[Book of Arda Viraf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hell-on-line.org/AboutZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | title=About Zoroastrian Hell | author=Eileen Gardiner | date=10 February 2006 | accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts particular punishments for particular sins—for instance, being trampled by cattle as punishment for neglecting the needs of work animals.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 75, {{cite web | url=http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html | title=The Book of Arda Viraf | accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other descriptions can be found in the ''Book of Scriptures (Hadhokht Nask), Religious Judgments (Dadestan-i Denig)'' and the ''Book of the Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom (Mainyo-I-Khard)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | title=Zoroastrian Hell Texts| author=Eileen Gardiner | date=18 January 2009 | accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====
In [[Wicca]], there is no such thing as hell because Wiccans largely don't believe in the concept of punishment or reward.&lt;ref&gt;Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on your Own - Page 162&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wiccan views differ among different Wiccan denominations, Wiccans tend to prefer viewing their god or goddess as a gentle deity.&lt;ref&gt;Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Dante And Virgil In Hell (1850).jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Dante]] and [[Virgil]] in Hell'' (1850) by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]].]]
In his ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina commedia]]'' (&quot;Divine comedy&quot;; set in the year 1300), [[Dante|Dante Alighieri]] employed the concept of taking [[Virgil]] as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of [[Purgatory|Purgatorio]]). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to [[Limbo]] just at the edge of Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, at the center of the world, Dante finds Satan himself trapped in the frozen lake of [[Cocytus]]. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out to the other side of the world, at the base of the Mount of [[Purgatory]].

[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) opens with the [[fallen angel]]s, including their leader [[Satan]], waking up in Hell after having been defeated in the war in heaven and the action returns there at several points throughout the poem. Milton portrays Hell as the abode of the demons, and the passive prison from which they plot their revenge upon Heaven through the corruption of the human race. 19th century French poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] alluded to the concept as well in the title and themes of one of his major works, ''[[Une Saison en Enfer|A Season In Hell]]''. Rimbaud's poetry portrays his own suffering in a poetic form as well as other themes.

Many of the great epics of European literature include episodes that occur in Hell. In the Roman poet [[Virgil]]'s Latin epic, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Aeneas descends into [[Hades|Dis]] (the underworld) to visit his father's spirit. The underworld is only vaguely described, with one unexplored path leading to the punishments of Tartarus, while the other leads through Erebus and the Elysian Fields.

The idea of Hell was highly influential to writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who authored the 1944 play &quot;[[No Exit]]&quot; about the idea that &quot;Hell is other people&quot;. Although not a religious man, Sartre was fascinated by his interpretation of a Hellish state of suffering. [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Great Divorce]]'' (1945) borrows its title from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1793) and its inspiration from the [[Divine Comedy]] as the narrator is likewise guided through Hell and Heaven. Hell is portrayed here as an endless, desolate twilight city upon which night is imperceptibly sinking. The night is actually the [[Apocalypse]], and it heralds the arrival of the demons after their judgment. Before the night comes, anyone can escape Hell if they leave behind their former selves and accept Heaven's offer, and a journey to Heaven reveals that Hell is infinitely small; it is nothing more or less than what happens to a soul that turns away from God and into itself.

[[Piers Anthony]] in his series ''[[Incarnations of Immortality]]'' portrays examples of Heaven and Hell via Death, Fate, Nature, War, Time, Good-God, and Evil-Devil. [[Robert A. Heinlein]] offers a [[yin-yang]] version of Hell where there is still some good within; most evident in his book [[Job: A Comedy of Justice]].  [[Lois McMaster Bujold]] uses her five Gods 'Father, Mother, Son, Daughter and Bastard' in [[The Curse of Chalion]] with an example of Hell as formless chaos. [[Michael Moorcock]] is one of many who offer Chaos-Evil-(Hell) and Uniformity-Good-(Heaven) as equally unacceptable extremes which must be held in balance; in particular in the [[Elric]] and [[Eternal Champion]] series.  [[Fredric Brown]] wrote a number of [[fantasy]] short stories about [[Satan]]’s activities in Hell. [[Cartoonist]] [[Jimmy Hatlo]] created a series of [[cartoon]]s about life in Hell called ''The Hatlo Inferno'', which ran from 1953 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/jimmyhatlo.jpg Sample ''Hatlo Inferno'' comic:]&lt;/ref&gt;
