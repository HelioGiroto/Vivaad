[[File:Tetragrammaton scripts.svg|frame|The Tetragrammaton in [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]] (10th century BCE to 135&amp;nbsp;CE), old [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] (10th century BCE to 4th century CE) and square [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] (3rd century BCE to present) scripts.]]

The term '''tetragrammaton''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|τετραγράμματον}}'', meaning &quot;four letters&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight,2011&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2011|}}: [http://books.google.com/books?id=ox31oGXZzZQC&amp;pg=PT62&amp;lpg=PT62&amp;dq=origins+of+tetragrammaton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xep_k5Cb3y&amp;sig=lBDOe03PQLZ2V-SHcEe4j5R1xpM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BcH9T4jXGYe2qAH22syMCQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=origins%20of%20tetragrammaton&amp;f=true &quot;The Names of God&quot;], ''The Meaning of the Bible'', New York: HarperOne, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It originates from ''tetra'' &quot;four&quot; + ''gramma'' (gen. ''grammatos'') &quot;letter&quot;) {{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=tetragrammaton |title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the Hebrew [[theonym]] ({{lang-he|יהוה}}) [[Transliteration|transliterated]] to the Latin letters '''YHWH'''. It is derived from a verb that means &quot;to be&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight,2011&quot;/&gt; and is considered in Judaism to be a proper [[Names of God in Judaism|name of the God of Israel]] used in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

The most widely accepted pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) is ''[[Yahweh]]'', though ''[[Jehovah]]'' is used in many Bibles, but in few modern ones. The [[Samaritan]]s understood the pronunciation for the Tetragrammaton to be ''Iabe''. Some patristic sources give evidence to a Greek pronunciation ''Iao''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parke-Taylor,79&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Parke-Taylor|1975|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Jew]]s are forbidden to say or write the Tetragrammaton in full, when reading the Torah they use the term ''[[Adonai]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parke-Taylor,79&quot;/&gt; Christians do not have any prohibitions on vocalizing the Tetragrammaton; in most Christian translations of the Bible, &quot;{{LORD}}&quot; is used in place of the Tetragrammaton after the Hebrew ''Adonai'', and is written with small capitals (or in all caps) to distinguish it from other words translated &quot;Lord&quot;.

==Origins==

===Etymology===
The letters, properly read from right to left (in [[Biblical Hebrew]]), are:
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

| [[He (letter)|He]]
| &quot;H&quot; (or often a [[silent letter]] at the end of a word)
|}

Scholars widely propose that the name YHWH is a verb form derived from the Biblical Hebrew [[Semitic root|triconsonantal root]] היה (''h-y-h'') &quot;to be&quot;, which has הוה (''h-w-h'') as a variant form, with a third person masculine ''y-'' [[Prefixes in Hebrew|prefix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The New 1907&quot;&gt;''The New [[Brown–Driver–Briggs]]-Gesenius Hebrew and English Lexicon With an Appendix Containing the Biblical Aramaic'' by Frances Brown, with the cooperation of S.R. Driver and Charles Briggs (1907), p. 217ff (entry יהוה listed under root הוה).&lt;/ref&gt; It is connected to the passage in {{bibleref|Exodus|3:14}} in which God gives his name as אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה (''Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh''), translated most basically as &quot;[[I am that I am]]&quot; (or &quot;I Will Be What I Will Be&quot;). יהוה with the [[Niqqud|vocalization]] &quot;Yahweh&quot; could theoretically be a ''hif'il'' ([[causative]]) verb inflection of root HWH, with a meaning something like &quot;he who causes to exist&quot; or &quot;who gives life&quot; (the root idea of the word being &quot;to breathe&quot;, and hence, &quot;to live&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=52&amp;letter=N#164 |title=Names Of God |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a ''[[Qal (linguistics)|qal]]'' (basic stem) verb inflection, it could mean &quot;he who is, who exists&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New 1907&quot;/&gt;

===Occurrences===
[[File:Louvre 042010 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Mesha Stele]] bears the earliest known reference (840&amp;nbsp;BCE) to the Israelite god Yahweh.]]
The oldest known inscription of the tetragrammaton dates to 840 BC, on the [[Mesha Stele]]. It bears the earliest certain extra-biblical reference to the Israelite god ''[[Yahweh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lemaire|1994|pp=30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent discovery of a tetragrammaton inscription, was found written in Hebrew on two silver scrolls recovered from [[Jerusalem]], dating to the 6th Century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight,2011&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the tetragrammaton occurs 6,828 times,&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight,2011&quot;/&gt; as can be seen in the [[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]] and [[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;insight&quot;/&gt; According to the [[Brown-Driver-Briggs]] Lexicon, {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה}} (Qr {{lang|he|אֲדֹנָי}}) occurs 6,518 times, and {{lang|he|יֱהֹוִה}} (Qr {{lang|he|אֱלֹהִים}}) occurs 305 times in the [[Masoretic]] Text. It first appears in Hebrew in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:4.&lt;ref name=&quot;insight&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The [[Septuagint]] typically translates YHWH as ''kyrios'' or &quot;Lord&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight,2011&quot;/&gt; Most English translations use &quot;Lord&quot; which serves as a [[mnemonic device]] for YHWH, since they both have four letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight,2011&quot;/&gt;

==Pronunciation==
{{listen|filename=He-YHWH.ogg |title=YHWH|description=The pronunciation as it is vowel pointed in the [[Masoretic Text]], the vast majority of scholars do not hold the pronunciation to be correct.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The most widely accepted pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) is ''[[Yahweh]]''. [[Genebrardus]] suggested the pronunciation ''Jahve'' based on [[Theodoret]]'s assertion  that the [[Samaritan]]s used the pronunciation ''Iabe''. For the [[Jew]]s, however, it was forbidden to pronounce or even write in full, the Tetragrammaton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parke-Taylor,79&quot;/&gt;

[[A. Lukyn Williams]] proposed the pronunciations of the Tetragrammaton to be ''Yaho'' or ''Yahu'' based on [[theophoric name]]s in the Hebrew Bible that end in YHW.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parke-Taylor,79&quot;/&gt; 

The current scholarly consensus is that the vowel diacritic points attached to the written consonants YHWH in the [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] [[orthography]] of [[Biblical Hebrew]] were not intended to represent the vowels of such an authentic and historically correct pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Tiberian vocalization===

====Vowel points====
{{See also|Biblical Hebrew orthography|Hebrew diacritics|Tiberian vocalization|Niqqud}}

The original [[abjad|consonantal text]] of the Hebrew Bible was provided with vowel marks by the Masoretes to assist reading. In places where the consonants of the text to be read (the [[Qere and Ketiv|Qere]]) differed from the consonants of the written text (the [[Qere and Ketiv|Kethib]]), they wrote the Qere in the margin as a note showing what was to be read. In such a case the vowels of the Qere were written on the Kethib. For a few frequent words the marginal note was omitted: this is called [[Q're perpetuum]].

One of these frequent cases was the tetragrammaton, which according to later Jewish practices should not be pronounced, but read as &quot;{{lang|he-Latn|Adonai}}&quot; (&quot;My Lord&quot;), or, if the previous or next word already was &quot;{{lang|he-Latn|Adonai}}&quot; or &quot;{{lang|he-Latn|Adoni}}&quot;, as &quot;{{lang|he-Latn|Elohim}}&quot; (&quot;God&quot;). This combination produces {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה}} and {{lang|he|יֱהֹוִה}} respectively, [[ghost word|non-words]] that would spell &quot;yehovah&quot; and &quot;yehovih&quot; respectively.

The oldest manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, such as the [[Aleppo Codex]] and the [[Codex Leningradensis]], mostly write {{Hebrew|יְהוָה}} (yehvah), with no pointing on the first H; this could be because the ''o'' diacritic point plays no useful role in distinguishing between ''Adonai'' and ''[[Elohim]]'' (and so is redundant), or could point to the Qere being '{{unicode|Sh&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;ma}}', which is [[Aramaic]] for &quot;the Name&quot;.

====Consonantal semi-vowels ====
In ancient Hebrew, the [[Hebrew alphabet#Numerical value and pronunciation|letter {{Script/Hebrew|ו}}]], known to modern Hebrew speakers as ''vav'', [[Hebrew alphabet#Pronunciation of Ancient Hebrew|was]] a semivowel {{IPA|/w/}} (as in English, not as in German) rather than a {{IPA|/v/}}.&lt;ref&gt;(see any Hebrew grammar).&lt;/ref&gt; The letter is referred to as ''[[Waw (letter)|waw]]'' in the academic world. Because the ancient pronunciation differs from the modern pronunciation, it is common today to represent {{lang|he|יהוה}} as YHWH rather than YHVH.

In unpointed Biblical Hebrew, most vowels are not written and the rest are written only ambiguously, as the vowel letters are also used as consonants (similar to the [[Latin]] use of V to indicate both U and V). See [[Matres lectionis]] for details. For similar reasons, an appearance of the Tetragrammaton in ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] records of the 13th century BCE sheds no light on the original pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;See pages 128 and 236 of the book &quot;Who Were the Early Israelites?&quot; by archeologist William G. Dever, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., Grand Rapids, Michigan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it is, in general, difficult to deduce how a word is pronounced from its spelling only, and the Tetragrammaton is a particular example: two of its letters can serve as vowels, and two are vocalic place-holders, which are not pronounced.

This difficulty occurs somewhat also in Greek when transcribing Hebrew words, because of Greek's lack of a letter for consonant 'y' and (since loss of the [[digamma]]) of a letter for &quot;w&quot;, forcing the Hebrew consonants yod and waw to be transcribed into Greek as vowels. Also, non-initial 'h' caused difficulty for Greeks and was liable to be omitted; х ([[chi (letter)|chi]]) was pronounced as 'k' + 'h' (as in modern [[Hindi]] &quot;[[lakh]]&quot;) and could not be used to spell 'h' as in [[Modern Greek]] {{lang|el|Χάρρι}} = &quot;Harry&quot;, for example.

===Adonai===
[[File:Tetragrammaton-related-Masoretic-vowel-points.png|thumb|right|220px|The spelling of the Tetragrammaton and connected forms in the Hebrew Masoretic text of the Bible, with [[Niqqud|vowel points]] shown in red.]]

The vocalizations of {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה}} (''Yehowah'') and {{lang|he|אֲדֹנָי}} (''Adonai'') are not identical. The [[schwa]] in YHWH (the vowel under the first letter, &lt;big&gt;{{Script/Hebrew|ְ}}&lt;/big&gt;) and the [[niqqud|hataf patakh]] in 'DNY (the vowel under its first letter, &lt;big&gt;{{Script/Hebrew|ֲ}}&lt;/big&gt;), appear different. One reason suggested{{Who|date=January 2009}} is that the spelling {{lang|he|יֲהֹוָה }} (with the hataf patakh) risks that a reader might start pronouncing &quot;Yah&quot;, which is a form of the Name, thus completing the first half of the full Name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Alternatively, the vocalization can be attributed to Biblical Hebrew phonology,&lt;ref&gt;Lambdin, Thomas O.: ''Introduction to Biblical Hebrew'', London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; where the hataf patakh is grammatically identical to a schwa, always replacing every [[niqqud|schwa naḥ]] under a [[guttural|guttural letter]]. Since the first letter of {{lang|he|אֲדֹנָי}} is a guttural letter, while the first letter of {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה}} is not, the hataf patakh under the (guttural) [[aleph]] reverts to a regular schwa under the (non-guttural) [[yodh]].

The table below considers the vowel points for {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה}} (''Yehowah'') and {{lang|he|אֲדֹנָי}} (''Adonai''), respectively:

|}

Note in the table directly above that the &quot;simple shewa&quot; in ''Yehowah'' and the ''hatef patah'' in ''Adonai'' are not the same vowel. The same information is displayed in the table above and to the right where &quot;''YHWH'' intended to be pronounced as ''Adonai''&quot; and &quot;''Adonai'', with its slightly different vowel points&quot; are shown to have different vowel points.

===Jehovah===
The origins for the composite term ''[[Jehovah]]'' came from early English translators who transposed the vowels from ''Adonai'' to the Tetragrammaton, and read the word literally so that the ''Y'' in YHWH, was pronounced as a ''J'' in English, and the ''W'' as a ''V''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight,2011&quot;/&gt; Taking the spellings at face value may have been as a result of not knowing about the [[Q're perpetuum]], thus resulting in the term &quot;Jehovah&quot; and its spelling variants. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] [1913, Vol. VIII, p.&amp;nbsp;329] states: &quot;Jehovah (Yahweh), the proper name of God in the Old Testament.&quot; Had they known about the Q're perpetuum, the term &quot;Jehovah&quot; might never have come into being.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Job – Introduction, [[Anchor Bible]], volume 15, page XIV and &quot;Jehovah&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th Edition, volume 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars recognize Jehovah to be &quot;grammatically impossible&quot; ([[Jewish Encyclopedia]], Vol VII, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

===Yahweh===
[[File:YHWH.png|frame|150px|left|[[William Gesenius]]'s Hebrew punctuation (i.e., Yahweh)]]
{{main|Yahweh}}
In the early 19th century, Hebrew scholars were still critiquing &quot;Jehovah&quot; [a.k.a. Iehovah and Iehouah] because they believed that the vowel points of {{lang|he|יְהֹוָה}} did not represent (and were never intended to represent) the vowel sounds of the early authentic pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton. 

The Latin pronunciation of the letter I/J as a consonant sound was {{IPAblink|j}}, the 'y' sound of the English word 'you'. This changed in descendant languages into various stronger consonants, including, in English, the sound {{IPAblink|dʒ}}, the 'j' sound of the word 'juice'. Thus the English pronunciation of the older form ''Jehovah'' has this 'j' sound. In order to preserve the approximate original Hebrew pronunciation, however, English spelling uses an initial Y and for the third consonant uses W, a letter unknown in Latin, thus producing the form ''Yahweh''.

The Hebrew scholar [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] [1786–1842] had suggested that the Hebrew punctuation {{lang|he|יַהְוֶה}}, which is transliterated into English as &quot;[[Yahweh]]&quot;, might more accurately represent the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton than the Biblical Hebrew punctuation &quot;{{lang|he|יְהֹוָה}}&quot;, from which the English name &quot;Jehovah&quot; has been derived. His proposal to read YHWH as &quot;{{Hebrew|יַהְוֶה}}&quot; (see image to the left) was based in large part on various Greek transcriptions, such as [[iabe|ιαβε]], dating from the first centuries CE, but also on the forms of theophoric names. In his ''Hebrew Dictionary,'' Gesenius supports &quot;Yahweh&quot; (which would have been pronounced {{IPA|[jahwe]}}, with the final letter being silent) because of the Samaritan pronunciation {{lang|grc|Ιαβε}} reported by [[Theodoret]], and that the [[theophoric name]] prefixes YHW {{IPA|[jeho]}} and YH {{IPA|[jo]}} can be explained from the form &quot;Yahweh&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:A_Hebrew_and_English_Lexicon_%28Brown-Driver-Briggs%29.djvu/242&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1 ''A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament with an appendix containing the Biblical Aramaic''], written by Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver and Charles Augustus Briggs, based on the Hebrew lexicon of Wilhelm Gesenius as translated by Edward Robinson, Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1906, s. 218. &lt;/ref&gt; Today many scholars accept Gesenius's proposal to read YHWH as {{Hebrew|יַהְוֶה}}. Gesenius' proposal gradually became accepted as the best scholarly reconstructed vocalized Hebrew spelling of the Tetragrammaton.

===Leningrad Codex===
[[Gérard Gertoux]] wrote that in the Leningrad Codex the Masoretes used 7 different vowel pointings [i.e., 7 different [[Q're]]'s] for YHWH. [Note that one of these different vowel pointings is not a true variant, but was the result of the addition of an inseparable preposition to YHWH].&lt;ref&gt;refer to the table on page 144 of Gérard Gertoux's book ''The Name of God Y.EH.OW.Ah which is pronounced as it is written I_EH_OU_AH''.&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the BHS text, which is derived from the Leningrad Codex, is used to translate the Old Testament of almost all English Bibles other than the King James Bible. The Brown–Driver–Briggs Lexicon of 1905 shows only two different vowel pointings [ i.e. variants ] of YHWH are found in the Ben Chayyim Hebrew Text of 1525, which underlies the Old Testament of the King James Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-7/264290/bdbandstrong290.jpg |title=villagephotos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six Hebrew spellings of the tetragrammaton are found in the [[Leningrad Codex]] of 1008–1010, as shown below. The entries in the Close Transcription column are not intended to indicate how the name was intended to be pronounced by the Masoretes, but only how the word would be pronounced if read without ''[[Q're and Ketib|q're perpetuum]]''.

'''{{unicode|ĕ}}''' is [[hataf segol]]; '''{{unicode|ǝ}}''' is the pronounced form of plain [[shva|shewa]].

The ''o'' diacritic dot over the letter waw is often omitted because it plays no useful role in distinguishing between the two intended pronunciations Adonai and Elohim  (which both happen to have an ''o'' vowel in the same position).

===Theophoric names===
Yeho or &quot;Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hō-&quot; is the prefix form of &quot;YHWH&quot; used in Hebrew [[theophoric name]]s; the suffix form Yahū&quot; or &quot;-Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hū&quot; is just as common. This has caused two opinions:

# In former times (at least from c.1650&amp;nbsp;CE), the prefix pronunciation &quot;Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hō-&quot; was sometimes connected with the full pronunciation &quot;Yehova&quot; derived from combining the Masoretic vowel points for &quot;Adonai&quot; with the consonantal Tetragrammaton YHWH.
# Recently that, as &quot;Yahweh&quot; is likely an [[imperfective]] verb form, &quot;Yahu&quot; is its corresponding [[preterite]] or [[jussive]] short form: compare ''{{unicode|yiŝt&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;hawe&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;}}'' (imperfective), ''{{unicode|yiŝtáhû}}'' (preterit or jussive short form) = &quot;do obeisance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.fortunecity.com/yahuwthah/Resource-577/AnsonLetter.htm |title=AnsonLetter.htm |publisher=Members.fortunecity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who argue for argument 1 above are: [[George Wesley Buchanan]] in ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''; Smith's 1863 ''A Dictionary of the Bible'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-7/264290/Smithspage953Reland190pixels.JPG Smith’s 1863 ''A Dictionary of the Bible'']&lt;/ref&gt; Section # 2.1 ''The Analytical Hebrew &amp; Chaldee Lexicon'' (1848)&lt;ref&gt;The Analytical Hebrew &amp; Chaldee Lexicon'' by [[Benjamin Davidson]] ISBN 0-913573-03-5.&lt;/ref&gt; in its article {{lang|he|הוה}}.

Smith's 1863 ''A Dictionary of the Bible'' says that &quot;Yahweh&quot; is possible because shortening to &quot;Yahw&quot; would end up as &quot;Yahu&quot; or similar. The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1901–1906 in the Article:Names Of God&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=52&amp;letter=N&amp;search=Theophoric%20Names The Jewish Encyclopedia of 1901–1906 Names Of God]&lt;/ref&gt; has a very similar discussion, and also gives the form Yo ({{Script/Hebrew|יוֹ}}) contracted from Yeho ({{Script/Hebrew|יְהוֹ}}). The Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jehovhah.&quot; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th edition, New York: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 1910–11, vol. 15, 312&amp;nbsp;pp.&lt;/ref&gt; also says that &quot;Yeho-&quot; or &quot;Yo&quot; can be explained from &quot;Yahweh&quot;, and that the suffix &quot;-yah&quot; can be explained from &quot;Yahweh&quot; better than from &quot;Yehovah&quot;.

{{main | Genizah}}

{{Bibleref|Exod.|3:15|HE}} is used to support the view that the Tetragrammaton was at one time spoken in [[Ancient Israel]], the way it is written: &quot;...this is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: The {{LORD}}, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; this is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations.&quot; [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0203.htm#15 mechon-mamre.org] Retrieved 7 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;for ever&quot; is ''le'olam'', which in biblical Hebrew means &quot;always, continually&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morfix.co.il/en/%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9D |title=Morphix Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] relates that only the priests in [[Temple in Jerusalem]] pronounced the Tetragrammaton, when they recited the [[Priestly Blessing]] over the people daily.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' Maimonides, Laws of Prayer and Priestly Blessings, Chapter 14; http://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?tDate=3/28/2012&amp;rambamChapters=3&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the destruction of [[Second Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70&amp;nbsp;CE, the Tetragrammaton is no longer pronounced. Rabbinical sources indicate that there was an exception for the temple liturgy, where the name of God was only pronounced once a year, by the high priest, on the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Judaism: The Late Roman-Rabbinic Period p 779  William David Davies, Louis Finkelstein, Steven T. Katz - 2006 &quot;(BT Kidd 7ia) The historical picture described above is probably wrong because the Divine Names were a priestly ... Name was one of the climaxes of the Sacred Service: it was entrusted exclusively to the High Priest once a year on the &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the name was also pronounced in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Temple]] in the [[priest]]ly [[benediction]] (Num. vi. 27) after the regular daily sacrifice, while in the [[synagogue]]s a substitute (probably Adonai) was used.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote #4 from page 311 of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: &quot;''Siphre'', Num. f 39, 43; ''M. Sotak'', iii. 7; ''Sotah'', 38a. The tradition that the utterance of the name in the daily benedictions ceased with the death of Simeon the Just, two centuries or more before the Christian era, perhaps arose from a misunderstanding of Menahoth, 109b; in any case it cannot stand against the testimony of older and more authoritative texts.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], in the last generations before the fall of [[Jerusalem]], however, it was pronounced in a low tone so that the sounds were lost in the chant of the priests.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yoma]]'', 39b; ''[[Jerusalem Talmud|Jer.]] Yoma'',iii. 7; ''[[Nashim|Kiddushin]]'', 71a.&quot;  ([[:wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Jehovah#cite note-3|cited after]] [[EB 1911]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after the destruction of [[Solomon's Temple]], the spoken use of God's name, as it was written, had ceased even though knowledge of how it was pronounced was perpetuated in rabbinic schools.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote #1 from page 312 of the 1911 E.B. reads:&quot;R. Johannan (second half of the 3rd century), ''Kiddushin'', 71a.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It was certainly known in [[Babylonia]] in the latter part of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote #2 from page 312 of the 1911 E.B. reads:&quot;Kiddushin, ''l.c. = Pesahim'', 50a&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philo]] calls it [[ineffable]], and says that it is lawful for those only whose ears and tongues are purified by wisdom to hear and utter it in a holy place (that is, for priests in the Temple). In another passage, commenting on Lev. xxiv. 15 seq.: &quot;If any one, I do not say should [[blaspheme]] against the Lord of men and gods, but should even dare to utter his name unseasonably, let him expect the penalty of death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Footnote #3 from page 311 of the 1911 E.B. reads: &quot;See Josephus, ''Ant''. ii. 12, 4; Philo, ''Vita Mosis'', iii. II (ii. 114, ed. Cohn and Wendland); ib. iii. 27 (ii. 206). The [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] authorities more correctly interpreted Lev. xxiv. 15 seq., not of the mere utterance of the name, but of the use of the name of God in blaspheming God.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Verbal prohibitions====
The vehemence with which the utterance of the name is denounced in the [[Mishna]] suggests that use of Yahweh was unacceptable in rabbinical Judaism. &quot;He who pronounces the Name with its own letters has no part in the world to come!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Footnote #3 from page 312 of the 1911 E.B. reads: &quot;''M. Sanhedrin'', x.I; Abba Saul, end of 2nd century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the prohibition of pronouncing the Name as written that it is sometimes called the &quot;Ineffable&quot;, &quot;Unutterable&quot; or &quot;Distinctive Name&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/name.htm |title=Judaism 101 on the Name of God |publisher=jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{cite book|author=Saul Weiss and Joseph Dov Soloveitchik |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rmmRRNYXb7kC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=YKVK |page=9 |title=Insights of Rabbi Joseph B.

Rösel ''The reading and translation of the divine name in the masoretic tradition and the Greek Pentateuch'' - Journal for the Study of the Old Testament, 2007 &quot;It is in this book that we find the strictest prohibition against pronouncing the name of the Lord. The Hebrew of 24.16, which may be translated as 'And he that blasphemes/curses (3B?) the
name of the Lord (9H9J), he shall surely be put to death', in the LXX is subjected to a ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Halakha]] (Jewish Law) prescribes that whereas the Name written ''yud-hei-vav-hei'', it is only to be pronounced &quot;Adonai;&quot; and the latter name too is regarded as a holy name, and is only to be pronounced in prayer.&lt;ref name=rambamprayer14&gt;&quot;They [the Priests, when reciting the Priestly Blessing, when the Temple stood] recite [God's] name -- i.e., the name ''yod-hei-vav-hei'', as it is written. This is what is referred to as the 'explicit name' in all sources. In the country [that is, outside the Temple], it is read [using another one of God's names], א-ד-נ-י ('Adonai'), for only in the Temple is this name [of God] recited as it is written.&quot; -- ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' [[Maimonides]], Laws of Prayer and Priestly Blessings, 14:10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kiddushin'' 71a states, &quot;I am not referred to as [My name] is written. My name is written ''yod-hei-vav-hei'' and it is pronounced &quot;Adonai.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus when someone wants to refer in third person to either the written or spoken Name, the handle ''&quot;[[HaShem]]&quot;'' (&quot;the Name&quot;) is used;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley S. Seidner 1987&quot;&gt;Stanley S. Seidner,&quot;HaShem: Uses through the Ages.&quot; Unpublished paper, Rabbinical Society Seminar, Los Angeles, CA,1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, two common prayer books are titled &quot;Tehillat Hashem&quot; and &quot;Avodat Hashem.&quot;  Or, a person may tell a friend, &quot;Hashem helped me to perform a great mitzvah today.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and this handle  itself can also be used in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the common utterance and praise, &quot;Barukh Hashem&quot; (Blessed [i.e. the source of all] is Hashem), or &quot;Hashem yishmor&quot; (God protect [us])&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Masoretes]] added vowel points ([[niqqud]]) and [[cantillation]] marks to the manuscripts to indicate vowel usage and for use in the ritual chanting of readings from the [[Bible]] in [[synagogue]] [[Jewish services|services]]. To {{lang|he|יהוה}} they added the vowels for &quot;{{lang|he-Latn|[[Adonai]]}}&quot; (&quot;My Lord&quot;), the word to use when the text was read.

====Written prohibitions====
The written Tetragrammaton,&lt;ref&gt;See Deut. 12:2-4: &quot;You must destroy all the sites at which the nations you are to dispossess worshiped their gods...tear down their altars...and cut down the images of their gods, obliterating their name from that site.  Do not do the same thing to Hashem (YHWH) your God.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as six other names of God, must be treated with special sanctity. They cannot be disposed of regularly, lest they be desecrated, but are usually put in long term storage or buried in Jewish cemeteries in order to retire them from use.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Based on the Talmud (Shavuot 35a-b), Maimonides (Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah, Chapter 6), and the Shulchan Arukh (Yoreh Deah 276:9) it is prohibited to erase or obliterate the seven Hebrew names for God found in the Torah (in addition to the above, there is E-l, E-loha, Tzeva-ot, Sha-dai,...).&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, it is prohibited to write the Tetragrammaton (or these other names) unnecessarily.  In order to guard the sanctity of the Name sometimes a letter is substituted by a different letter in writing (e.g. יקוק), or the letters are separated by one or more hyphens.

Some Jews are stringent and extend the above safeguard by also not writing out other names of God in other languages, for example writing &quot;God&quot; in English as written &quot;G-d,&quot; and so forth.  However this is beyond the letter of the law.

===Samaritans===
The [[Samaritan]]s shared the scruples of the Jews about the utterance of the name. However Sanhedrin 10:1 includes the comment of [[Rabbi Mana]] &quot;for example those [[Kutim]] who take an oath&quot; would also have no share in the [[world to come]], which suggests that Mana thought some Samaritans used the name in making oaths. Though there is no evidence that this was common Samaritan practice.&lt;ref&gt;The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture: Volume 3 - Page 152 [[Peter Schäfer]], Catherine Hezser - 2002 &quot; In fact, there is no proof in any other rabbinic writing that Samaritans used to pronounce the Divine Name when they took an oath. The only evidence for Sarmaritans uttering the Tetragrammaton at that ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jerusalem Talmud|Jer.]] [[Sanhedrin]]'', x.I; R. Mana, 4th century (cited after [[EB 1911]]).&lt;/ref&gt; (Their priests have preserved a liturgical pronunciation &quot;Yahwe&quot; or &quot;Yahwa&quot; to the present day.)&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', xxv. (1906), 49-51 (cited after [[EB 1911]])&lt;/ref&gt; As with Jews, the Aramaic ''ha-Shema'' (שמא &quot;the Name&quot;) remains the everyday and liturgical usage of the name among Samaritans, akin to Hebrew &quot;the Name&quot; (Hebrew השם  &quot;HaShem&quot;).
&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanley S. Seidner 1987&quot;/&gt;

===Septuagint===
{{Main|Septuagint manuscripts#Treatment of the Tetragrammaton in Septuagint manuscripts}}

The oldest complete [[Septuagint]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] Old Testament) versions, from around the 2nd century CE, consistently use {{lang|grc|Κυριος}} (&quot;[[Lord]]&quot;), where the Hebrew has YHWH, corresponding to substituting Adonay for YHWH in reading the original; in books written in Greek in this period (e.g., Wisdom, 2 and 3 Maccabees), as in the [[New Testament]], {{lang|grc|Κυριος}} takes the place of the name of God. However, older fragments contain the name YHWH.&lt;ref&gt;The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology Volume 2, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Papyrus Rylands 458|P. Ryl. 458]] (perhaps the oldest extant [[Septuagint]] manuscript) there are blank spaces, leading some scholars to believe that the Tetragrammaton must have been written where these breaks or blank spaces are.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kahle, The Cairo Geniza (Oxford:Basil Blackwell,1959) p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sidney Jellicoe]] concluded that &quot;[[Paul E. Kahle|Kahle]] is right in holding that LXX [Septuagint] texts, written by Jews for Jews, retained the Divine Name in Hebrew Letters (palaeo-Hebrew or Aramaic) or in the Greek-letters imitative form ''ΠΙΠΙ'', and that its replacement by ''Κύριος'' was a Christian innovation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Jellicoe, ''Septuagint and Modern Study'' (Eisenbrauns, 1989, ISBN 0-931464-00-5) pp. 271, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Jellicoe draws together evidence from a great many scholars (B. J. Roberts, Baudissin, Kahle and C. H. Roberts) and various segments of the Septuagint to draw the conclusions that the absence of &quot;Adonai&quot; from the text suggests that the insertion of the term ''Kyrios'' was a later practice; in the Septuagint ''Kyrios'' is used to substitute the Name YHWH; and the Tetragrammaton appeared in the original text, but Christian copyists removed it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]] (translator of the [[Latin Vulgate]]) used the [[Hexapla]]. Both attest to the importance of the sacred Name and that some manuscripts of Septuagint contained the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew letters.&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus Grecs Bibliques, by Francoise Dunand, Cairo, 1966 pg. 47 ftn. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This is further affirmed by   The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology, which states &quot;Recently discovered texts doubt the idea that the translators of the LXX (Septuagint) have rendered the Tetragrammaton JHWH with KYRIOS. The most ancient mss (manuscripts) of the LXX today available have the Tetragrammaton written in Hebrew letters in the Greek text. This was custom preserved by the later Hebrew translator of the Old Testament in the first centuries (after Christ)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology, Vol.2, pag.512 Colin Brown 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dead Sea Scrolls===
The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and other Hebrew and Aramaic texts write (only) the tetragrammaton in [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|paleo-Hebrew script]], showing that the name was treated specially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectio.unibe.ch/05_2/troyer_names_of_god.htm names of God]&lt;/ref&gt; A Greek fragment of Leviticus (26:2-16) discovered in the Dead Sea scrolls (Qumran) has ιαω (&quot;[[Iao]]&quot;), the Greek form of the Hebrew trigrammaton YHW.&lt;ref&gt;Bezalel Porten, ''Archives from Elephantine: The life of an ancient Jewish military colony'', 1968, University of California Press, pp. 105, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[John the Lydian]] (6th century) wrote: &quot;The Roman [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varo]] [116–27&amp;nbsp;BCE] defining him [that is the Jewish god] says that he is called Iao in the Chaldean mysteries&quot;. (De Mensibus IV 53) Van Cooten mentions that Iao is one of the &quot;specifically Jewish designations for God&quot; and &quot;the Aramaic papyri from the Jews at Elephantine show that 'Iao' is an original Jewish term&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stern M., ''Greek and Latin Authors on Jews and Judaism'' (1974-84) 1:172; Schafer P., ''Judeophobia: Attitudes toward the Jews in the Ancient World'' (1997) 232; Cowley A., ''Aramaic Papyri of the 5th century'' (1923); Kraeling E.G., ''The Brooklyn Museum Aramaic Papyri: New Documents of the 5th century BCE from the Jewish Colony at Elephantine'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sufficient examination of the subject is available at Sean McDonough's ''YHWH at Patmos'' (1999), pp 116 to 122 and George van Kooten's ''The Revelation of the Name YHWH to Moses'' (2006), pp 114, 115, 126-136. It is worth mentioning a fundamental, though aged, source about the subject: Adolf Deissmann's ''[http://www.archive.org/details/biblestudiescont00deisrich Bible studies: Contributions chiefly from papyri and inscriptions to the history of the language, the literature, and the religion of Hellenistic Judaism and primitive Christianity]'' (1909), at chapter &quot;Greek transcriptions of the Tetragrammaton&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
Christians do not have any taboo on pronouncing the name, either as &quot;Yahweh&quot; or similar variations. Early Jewish Christians inherited from Jews the practice of reading &quot;Lord&quot; where the tetragrammaton appeared in the Hebrew text, or where a tetragrammaton may have been marked in a Greek text. Gentile Christians, primarily non-Hebrew speaking and using Greek texts, read &quot;Lord&quot; as it occurred in the Greek text of the [[New Testament]] and their copies of the [[Greek Old Testament]]. This practice continued into the Latin [[Vulgate]] where &quot;Lord&quot; represented &quot;Yahweh&quot; in the Latin text.  In [[Petrus Alphonsi]]'s Tetragrammaton-Trinity diagram, the name is written as &quot;Jeve.&quot;  Only at the Reformation did the [[Luther Bible]] restore &quot;Jehova&quot; in the German text of Luther's Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;A Catholic Handbook: Essentials for the 21st Century  Page 51 William C. Graham - 2010 &quot;WHY DO WE NO LONGER SAY YAHWEH? The Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments directed in ... just as the Hebrews and early Christians substituted other names for Yahweh when reading Scripture aloud.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Septuagint]] (Greek translation) and [[Vulgate]] (Latin translation) use the word &quot;Lord&quot; ({{lang|el|κύριος}}, ''kyrios'', and {{lang|la|dominus}}, respectively).

* The [[Jerusalem Bible|New Jerusalem Bible]] (1966) uses &quot;Yahweh&quot; exclusively.
* The [[Bible In Basic English]] (1949/1964) uses &quot;Yahweh&quot; eight times, including {{Bibleref2|Exod.|6:2}}.
* The [[New English Bible]] (NT 1961, OT 1970) generally uses the word &quot;{{LORD}}&quot; but uses &quot;J&lt;small&gt;EHOVAH&lt;/small&gt;&quot; several times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jehovah#Usage in English|Usage in English]]&lt;/ref&gt; For examples of both forms, see Exodus Chapter 3 and footnote to verse 15.
* The [[Amplified Bible]] (1954/1987). At {{Bibleref2|Exod.|6:3}} the AB says &quot;but by My name the Lord [Yahweh--the redemptive name of God] I did not make Myself known to them.&quot;
* [[The Living Bible]] (1971). &quot;Jehovah&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Living Bible, &quot;Jehovah&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot; per text or footnotes. e.g. Genesis 7:16; 8:21; Exodus 3:15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Young's Literal Translation]] (Version) – &quot;Jehovah&quot; since Genesis 2:4
* The [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]] (1999/2002) uses &quot;Yahweh&quot; over 50 times, including {{Bibleref2|Exod.|6:2}}.
* The [[World English Bible]] (WEB) [a Public Domain work with no copyright] uses &quot;Yahweh&quot; some 6837 times.
* The [[New Living Translation]] (1996/2004) uses &quot;Yahweh&quot; eight times{{Verify source|date=January 2010}}, including {{Bibleref2|Exod.|6:2}}. The Preface of the New Living Translation: Second Edition says that in a few cases they have used the name Yahweh (for example 3:15; 6:2–3).
* Rotherham's [[Emphasized Bible]] retains &quot;Yahweh&quot; throughout the Old Testament.
* The [[Anchor Bible]] retains &quot;Yahweh&quot; throughout the Old Testament.
* The [[King James Version]]. Rendered in seven instances as &quot;Jehovah&quot;, i.e. four times as the name of God, {{Bibleref2|Exod.|6:3}}; [[Psalm 83]]:18; Isa 12:2; 26:4, and three times where it is included in Hebrew place-names e.g. &quot;Jehovah-jireh&quot; -Gen 22:14. (See also Ex 17:15; Judges 6:24)
** Note: Elsewhere in the KJV, &quot;{{LORD}}&quot; is generally used. But in verses such as Gen 15:2; 28:13, Psalm 71:5, Amos 1:8, 9:5 etc. where this practice would result in 'Lord {{LORD}}' (Hebrew: ''Adonay YHWH'') or '{{LORD}} Lord' (''YHWH Adonay'') the KJV translates the Hebrew text as 'Lord {{GOD}}' or '{{LORD}} God'.
* The [[American Standard Version]] uses &quot;Jehovah&quot;.
* The [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]] uses Jehovah over 7,000 times in translations of both the Hebrew and Greek scriptures.

====New Testament====
{{main|Tetragrammaton in the New Testament}}
Since the Tetragrammaton does not appear in the Greek manuscripts of the [[New Testament]], virtually all translations refrain from inserting it into the English. The vast majority of New Testament translations therefore render the Greek ''kyrios'' as &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;lord&quot;, and ''theos'' as &quot;God&quot;. Nevertheless, the [[Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition]] inserts the name ''Yahweh'' in the New Testament, while the [[New World Translation]] inserts the name ''Jehovah'' in the New Testament.

The main notable exception is [[Franz Delitzsch|Delitzsch's]] translation of the New Testament into Hebrew (1877) which frequently uses the tetragrammaton, i.e. Hebrew ({{lang|he|יְהֹוָה}}), particularly in verses where the New Testament quotes or makes reference to Old Testament texts. It is however still read aloud as &quot;Adonai&quot; by most Hebrew-speaking Christians in Israel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
&lt;!--&quot;still read&quot; as of when? The previous sentence was 1877
--&gt;

==== Catholicism ====
[[File:BASILICA OF ST LOUIS KING OF FRANCE MISSOURI USA Near the Gateway Arch TETRAGRAMMATON.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Tetragrammaton on the [[Tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]] of the Roman Catholic [[Basilica of St. Louis, King of France]] in Missouri]]
In the [[Catholic Church]], the first edition of the official Vatican ''[[Nova Vulgata]] Bibliorum Sacrorum Editio, editio typica'', published in 1979, used the traditional ''Dominus'' when rendering the Tetragrammaton in the overwhelming majority of places where it appears; however, it also used the form ''Iahveh'' for rendering the Tetragrammaton in 3 known places:
* Exodus 3:15 &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dixítque íterum Deus ad Móysen: «Hæc dices fíliis Israel: Iahveh (Qui est), Deus patrum vestrórum, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac et Deus Iacob misit me ad vos; hoc nomen mihi est in ætérnum, et hoc memoriále meum in generatiónem et generatiónem.&quot; (Exodus 3:15).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exodus 15:3 &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dominus quasi vir pugnator; Iahveh nomen eius!&quot; (Exodus 15:3).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exodus 17:15.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aedificavitque Moyses altare et vocavit nomen eius Iahveh Nissi (Dominus vexillum meum)&quot; (Exodus 17:15).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second edition of the ''[[Nova Vulgata]] Bibliorum Sacrorum Editio, editio typica altera'', published in 1986, these few occurrences of the form ''Iahveh'' were replaced with ''Dominus'',&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Exodus 3:15: Dixítque íterum Deus ad Móysen: «Hæc dices fíliis Israel: Dominus, Deus patrum vestrórum, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac et Deus Iacob misit me ad vos; hoc nomen mihi est in ætérnum, et hoc memoriále meum in generatiónem et generatiónem.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Exodus 15:3: Dominus quasi vir pugnator; Dominus nomen eius!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Exodus 17:15: Aedificavitque Moyses altare et vocavit nomen eius Dominus Nissi (Dominus vexillum meum)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in keeping with the long-standing Catholic tradition of avoiding direct usage of the Ineffable Name.

On August 8, 2008, Bishop [[Arthur J. Serratelli]], chairman of the American bishops' &quot;Committee on Divine Worship&quot;, announced a new directive from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] regarding the use of the name of God in the sacred liturgy. Specifically, the word &quot;Yahweh&quot; may no longer be &quot;used or pronounced&quot; in songs and prayers during liturgical celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = CNS STORY: No 'Yahweh' in songs, prayers at Catholic Masses, Vatican rules
|accessdate = 2009–07–29
|url = http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0804119.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, for most of the Church's 2,000-year history use of the name was prohibited in public worship, out of respect for the Divine Name, according to Catholic tradition. After [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65), some songs and hymns had begun to use the Tetragrammaton, which caused the Vatican to issue a clarification that the Divine Name was not to be used. Hymnals with these hymns have since inserted the word &quot;Lord God&quot; or other two-syllable alternatives in the place of the Tetragrammaton.

===Jewish mysticism===

====Magical papyri====
The spellings of the tetragrammaton occur among the many combinations and permutations of names of powerful agents that occur in [[Jewish magical papyri]] found in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alfrink, ''La prononciation 'Jehova' du tétragramme,'' O.T.S. V (1948) 43-62.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these forms is the heptagram {{lang|grc|ιαωουηε}}.&lt;ref&gt;K. Preisendanz, ''Papyri Graecae Magicae'', Leipzig-Berlin, I, 1928 and II, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jewish magical papyri, ''Iave'' and {{lang|grc|Iαβα}} ''Yaba'' occurs frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote #9 from page 312 of the 1911 E.B. reads: &quot;See [[Deissmann]], ''Bibelstudien'', 13 sqq.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[Ethiopic]] Christian list of magical names of Jesus,{{When|date=April 2011}} purporting to have been taught by him to his disciples, ''Yawe'' is found.&lt;ref&gt;Footnote #10 from Page 312 of the 1911 E.B. reads: &quot;See Driver, ''Studia Biblica, I. 20.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th edition (New York: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 1910–11), vol. 15, pp. 312, in the article &quot;JEHOVAH&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kabbalah====
{{See also|Kabbalah|Hasidic philosophy}}
[[Kabbalistic]] tradition holds that the correct pronunciation is known to a select few people in each generation, it is not generally known what this pronunciation is. In late kabbalistic works the Tetragrammaton is sometimes referred to as the name of ''Havayah''—{{lang|he|הוי'ה}}, meaning &quot;the Name of Being/Existence.&quot;  This name also helps when one needs to refer specifically to the written Name; similarly, &quot;Shem Adonoot,&quot; meaning &quot;the Name of Lordship&quot; can be used to refer to the spoken name &quot;Adonai&quot; specifically.

As explained by [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]],&lt;ref name=ramchal31&gt;In קל&quot;ח פתחי חכמה by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato, Opening #31; English translation in book &quot;138 Openings of Wisdom&quot; by Rabbi Avraham Greenbaum, 2008, also viewable at  http://www.breslev.co.il/articles/spirituality_and_faith/kabbalah_and_mysticism/the_name_of_havayah.aspx?id=10847&amp;language=english, accessed 12 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the tetragrammaton &quot;unfolds&quot; in accordance with the intrinsic nature of its letters, &quot;in the same order in which they appear in the Name, in the mystery of ten and the mystery of four.&quot; Namely, the upper cusp of the ''Yod'' is [[Partzufim|Arich Anpin]] and the main body of ''Yod'' is and [[Partzufim|Abba]]; the first ''Hei'' is [[Partzufim|Imma]]; the ''Vav'' is [[Partzufim|Ze`ir Anpin]] and the second ''Hei'' is [[Partzufim|Nukvah]]. It unfolds in this aforementioned order and &quot;in the mystery of the four expansions&quot; that are constituted by the following various spellings of the letters:

'''ע&quot;ב/''`AV''''' : יו&quot;ד ה&quot;י וי&quot;ו ה&quot;י, so called &quot;`AV&quot;  according to its [[gematria]] value ע&quot;ב=70+2=72.

'''ס&quot;ג/''SaG''''':  יו&quot;ד ה&quot;י וא&quot;ו ה&quot;י,  gematria 63.

'''מ&quot;ה/''MaH''''': יו&quot;ד ה&quot;א וא&quot;ו ה&quot;א, gematria 45.

'''ב&quot;ן/''BaN''''':  יו&quot;ד ה&quot;ה ו&quot;ו ה&quot;ה, gematria 52.

Luzzatto summarizes, &quot;In sum, all that exists is founded on the mystery of this Name and upon the mystery of these letters of which it consists.  This means that all the different orders and laws are all drawn after and come under the order of these four letters.  This is not one particular pathway but rather the general path, which includes everything that exists in the [[Sefirot]] in all their details and which brings everything under its order.&quot;&lt;ref name=ramchal31/&gt;

Another parallel is drawn between the four letters of the Tetragrammaton and the [[Four Worlds]]: the '''&lt;big&gt;י&lt;/big&gt;''' is associated with [[Atziluth]], the first '''&lt;big&gt;ה&lt;/big&gt;''' with [[Beri'ah]], the '''&lt;big&gt;ו&lt;/big&gt;''' with [[Yetzirah]], and final '''&lt;big&gt;ה&lt;/big&gt;''' with [[Assiah]].
