== Metaphor ==
''Is it possible the idea of heaven is a metaphor for achieving true mental peace?''

It is.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/189.139.106.61|189.139.106.61]] ([[User talk:189.139.106.61|talk]]) 08:09, 22 December 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

No, it is not metaphorical.  To believers, it is as real as Akron, Ohio (maybe realer!).[[Special:Contributions/99.0.37.134|99.0.37.134]] ([[User talk:99.0.37.134|talk]]) 01:25, 20 March 2011 (UTC)

== Clearing some Catholic things up==
First off, the Bible teaches that all souls who have died after he ascended will go to Hell and wait in somekind of Limbo until he comes again.  If someone could find a quote for this, it would be a great addition.

Second, non-baptized infants, as per doctrine, go to Hell, but to a special infant level, look for more info on the Wikipedia article on Hell.
:Most Catholics nowadays claim that the fate of unbaptized infants is unknown, but &quot;left to the mercy of God to decide&quot;.  [[Traditionalist Catholics]] still believe in [[limbo]], which is technically not part of hell:  it's a spiritually neutral state, with neither the torture of hell nor the bliss of heaven.  Dante may have claimed otherwise, but his ''Divine Comedy'' is still a fictional work; the Catholic theology is colored by Dante's own studies and interpretations.  --[[User:ISNorden|Ingeborg S. Nordén]] 00:49, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

Roman Catholics claim the fate of the unbaptized infants will be heaven because Christ mentions that we should all be like children to enter His kingdom. Limbo doesn't exist.

------------------

I'm not an active contributor, but I can't help but wonder why there isn't much information as to specifically East Asian concepts of Heaven (i.e. more talk of the logistics behind the Daoist/Confucian ideals behind how heaven works, and how the creation of Neo-Daoism, Neo-Confucianism and various change in thoughts forged a different understanding about how Heaven worked to supposedly create order on Earth).

-------------------

This is obviously a major topic, and it was disappointing to see the idiotic comments someone else posted originally.

This is certainly not my area of expertise, but it is well worthy of inclusion in the Wikipedia.

----

From [[:Heaven|Heaven]], third paragraph: &quot;...those who do not meet the criteria go to a place of punishment, hell.&quot;

&quot;hell&quot; should properly be capitalized here, no?


+++++++++++++++
The idea of heaven (as viewed in a Christian POV) is far removed from what Christ Jesus taught.
He viewed Heaven, not as a place where all righteous mankind (within spiritual context) were to reside, but as the capital city of God's Kingdom.
&quot;The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool,&quot; God said. (Isaiah 66:1)

Person's who had lived a &quot;good life&quot; were not to go to Heaven, but reside on Earth.
&quot;The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.&quot; (Psalm 37:29)

&quot;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.&quot;&amp;mdash;Matthew 5:5

&quot;Evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.&quot;&amp;mdash;Psalm 37:9

&quot;The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Proverbs 2:21, 22

So, the question arises for most Christianity, &quot;If I lead a 'good life', why do I die, and what happens to me after I die?&quot;  The Bible says that sin causes death. It also states that when you die nothing remains of you.

Romans 5:12 tells us: &quot;Through one man [Adam, mankind's forefather] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned [by inheriting imperfection, that is, sinful tendencies].&quot; 
&quot;You [will] return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.&quot; (Genesis 3:19) 
Simply stated, the Bible teaches that death is the opposite of life. At Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10, we read: &quot;The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten. All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going.&quot;

&quot;Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs. His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.&quot;-Psalm 146:3, 4

&quot;The soul that is sinning-it itself will die,&quot; the Bible emphatically states. (Ezekiel 18:4, 20; Acts 3:23; Revelation 16:3)

Here we see that Earth is not a &quot;proving ground&quot; and Heaven the reward.

Yes, this page could use some work.  Why not take a scientific approach.  Who says there is a heaven?  Why do they say?  Are there witnesses?  Are there good eveidences?  What do we mean by heaven?  When we say heaven, are we atalking about the eternal world?  [[User:Hawstom|Hawstom]] 07:38, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I removed this POV interpretation that was added without attribution.  I am not sure it ieven has place in the article.
*[[Bible]] tells us that a few people including [[Apostle]]s will go to heaven to rule the people in the earth (John 14:1-3; Rev. 5:9,10; 14:1-5), and the others including [[David]] will receive the earth to live forever(Matt. 5:5; Acts 2:34; Rev. 21:3-5).  
Please advise.  [[User:Hawstom|Tom]] 16:59, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)
: I think you've made a defensible decision.  [[User:Mkmcconn|Mkmcconn]]
: I think so, too. Tom, please explain why you removed and why you are not sure.[[User:K.M.|K.M.]] 05:50, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Well, I, Tom (Hawstom), think this article is primarily about what is Heaven like, and not about who is going to end up in heaven.  And the quote above probably belongs better on the JW page. [[User:Hawstom|Tom]] 04:13, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Besides my belief that we should be moving this article away from being a discussion of who is going to heaven, I can see that K.M.'s edits are POV for two reasons.  First, they are inserted with an apparent willingness to degrade article consistency and quality (something a veteran Wikipedian should be past)   in order to get POV inserted.  Second, the POV has been inserted in a POV manner (&quot;the Bible says&quot;).  If the bad faith POV insertion had been done in a NPOV manner, it would have been hard to impugn (after all, we all have agendas that sometimes creep in).  But when done without careful NPOVization, it is subject to reversion by the first Wikipedian who comes along. [[User:Hawstom|Tom (hawstom)]] 04:34, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)

But rather than simply edit or revert the questionable edit, I think this article could benefit from some group soul searching, and this edit may be just the occasion for it.  So I propose we open the discussion on two issues:  1) How might K.M. fix his insertions?  2)  What is this article about anyway? [[User:Hawstom|Tom (hawstom)]] 04:34, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:I changed my insertion, so please be cool. [[User:K.M.|K.M.]] 05:35, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)

*Doesn't the bible clearly state that man doesn't get to heaven by works?  &quot;Therefore you are saved by grace, not of works lest any man should boast.&quot;  The section on how to get to heaven is clearly Roman Catholic, because works are sited as the primary way to get to heaven, by living a &quot;good life&quot;.

::The Bible clearly states lots of different things. That's what makes it so useful. Just because you find what you want in the Bible doesn't mean that I can't find what I want, too. [[User:Leadwind|Leadwind]] ([[User talk:Leadwind|talk]]) 01:07, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

==Heaven in Buddhism==
Just a curious question. We apply the same word 天(Ten, jap. heaven) for the Heaven in Christianity and for Buddhism. IIRC 天 are one of six world types where all souls continue to reincarnate. The Pure Land is one of them. Some [[Boddhisattva]]s are predicted &quot;coming from a certain Heaven&quot; like Miroku-Boddhisattva from Tosotsu-ten. How call people this concept in English? Heaven or another term? My knowledge on this issue are very narrow and I'm regretful I cannot contribute well. [[User:KIZU|KIZU]] 12:41, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)

The only terms that I can think of that might suffice are Heaven, Afterlife, or Eternity or Eternal World.  I might more accurately call it the Real World.  It sure is good to have you here contributing, and I hope to see some of your input and discussion.  [[User:Hawstom|Tom (hawstom)]] 05:09, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Though I don't know closely Buddhist comcepts (it's not my belief and very complicated), according to the buddhist documents ([[Sutra]]s),
*There are many world, and they exists in some way simultinously. Some are bad, some are good.
*There are six phases of the world, or simply there are six worlds, and Ten(Heaven) is one of them and the best.
Interestingly those Buddhist &quot;Heaven&quot;s are not &quot;Eternal Worlds&quot;, because there is nothing eternal according to their belief. Everyone reincarnates unless they reach to the [[Nirvana]], so even in the Heaven people must die someday and go to the other world or reincarnate there in another shape. Even if they enjoyed a life of ten thousand years, they must die and reincarnate. As for [[Pure Land]] I read some Buddhist priests said &quot;the purpose of the reborn in to the Pure Land is the return from there to here to spread the wonderfulness of the Pure Land. [[User:KIZU|KIZU]] 13:34, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Hmm.  It seems like it would be nice to have some kind of article that covers a general concept of an existence greater than this one.  Your input from Buddhism is very insightful.  I see that currently we have the following articles that deal more generally with this area, along with the definitions Wikipeida gives:
*Afterlife, something spiritual that you experience when you die
*Underworld, any place to which newly dead souls go, a term normally used (by unbelievers?) in mythology and religion studies
*Heaven, a place not of this world or of happy rest or bliss
*Hell, the place of the dead or alternatively of torment.  Good umbrella article.
Of course there are numberless other terms in other languages that have different shades of meaning for afterlife or underworld, but it would be good to mastermind the organization of all these articles under one or two umbrella articles about a real and amply referenced, but disputed and variously conceptualized, existence that is beyond this one. [[User:Hawstom|Tom (hawstom)]] 14:29, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

I would hope that the general Buddhist contribution to the understanding of afterlife would be able to be distilled into some umbrella article. [[User:Hawstom|Tom (hawstom)]] 14:29, 1 May 2004 (UTC)
:Your idea is smart, though I'm afraid I miss your point. It's good for Wikipedia to have a well-designed tree of articles. I saw in fr.wiki a guide at the end of each articles to guide. For example [[religion]] - [[Greek religion]] - and so on. Having both such a linear guide and a list of particular notions works well as far as they are well designed. Off course we engage a bunch of problematic notions, we cannot avoid disputing. For Buddhist notions I suppose it's better we call for contributions on some notepages of particular Buddhist concept such as [[Pure Land]] than we will try to make a scribble; we are laity on those subjects. BTW [[Wikipedia:WikiLove|WikiLove]] is a good term, I like it. I thank you letting me know this idea, Tom. [[User:KIZU|KIZU]] 15:59, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

I propose [[Afterlife]] to be the organizational hub of this genre of article.  The other contenders for a hub article would be [[underworld]] and [[eschatology]], but I don't think either of those terms works as well as [[Afterlife]].  I am intrigued by your description of the fr.wiki hierarchy guides.  Perhaps such could be added to these articles. [[User:Hawstom|Tom (hawstom)]] 14:32, 6 May 2004 (UTC)

In Buddhism, there are 33 planes of existence. There are 4 suffering plane, 1 human plane, 6 calestial planes, 22 rupa and arupa planes. 

The 6 celestial planes consist of:
1. Catummaharajika - lowest heavenly realm where the Guardian Deities of the Four Quarters reside.
2. Tavatimsa - a.k.a 'The Realm of Thirty-three Devas'. Sakka is the king of this realm.
3. Yama - a.k.a 'The Realm of Yama Devas'
4. Tusita - a.k.a 'The Realm of Delight'. This is the plane where Bodhisattas who have perfected the requisites to Buddhahood resides.
5. Nimmanarati - a.k.a. 'The Realm of Devas who Delight in the Created Mansions'
6. Paranimmitavasavatti - a.k.a. 'The Realm of the Devas who makes others' creation serve their own ends'.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/60.52.33.155|60.52.33.155]] ([[User talk:60.52.33.155|talk]]) 05:58, 6 January 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Afterlife Reorganization==

==Heaven in Hinduism==

The concept of heaven in Hinduism is described in a vaishnavite perspective. The views expressed in the Hinduism section is not necessarily the view of the entire Hindu religion. In fact, Vaikuntha is the abode of Lord Vishnu and Shaivaites have a similary belief about Kailasha, the abode of Shiva. The Hinduism section should be cleared up. [[User:arun.blue|Arun]] 12:45, 18 Sep 2009 (IST)

:The Hinduism section is highly inaccurate and explain certain examples of Krishna as the God and Rama an avatar. It goes on to include even Mohammed, Moses , Jesus etc as incarnations of Krishna.

I capitalised most of it.

Heaven is a place, albeit a fictional one, and therefore should be capitalised. One however, can write of heavens in general with a small h. [[User:Duncharris|Dunc_Harris]]|[[User talk:duncharris|&amp;#9786;]] 10:23, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)

==[[Calvinism]]==

This may or may not stir up discussion.

I removed the little bit that said that Calvinism was an example of how some religions thought that Predestination was the way they entered heaven. This is true... sort of. The problem is that in the sentence previous it outlines the [[Arminian]] position which states that only those who trust in the deity and in his method of salvation can enter heaven. Strangely enough this is the Calvinist position as well!

To put it in more theological terms - both Arminians and Calvinists believe that Jesus was sent by God to die for the sins of the world. Both Arminians and Calvinists believe that only those who place their trust in the death and resurrection of Christ will go to heaven. Arminians and Calvinists differ over the place of free-will and determinism in how this placing of trust occurs. [[User:One Salient Oversight|One Salient Oversight]] 01:28, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Bible: where does it say you go to heaven when you die? ==

I notice that the article refers to the Bible in the section regarding the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses. Can anyone include some references to the relevant sections of the bible to substantiate the other Christian beliefs? i.e. that one will go to heaven even if that are not one of the 144,000? --[[User:Rebroad|Rebroad]] 23:59, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)
:Ok, I'll bite.  You do have to apply a context to biblical passages - it's not a legal document that outlines each and every contingency and gives pertinent definitions.  That's part of the reason that Jesus taught His disciples - so that they could spread the important parts of His message and explain what was meant by various things He &amp; they had said.  If you're looking for specific verses, I've got a couple that are ''generally'' taken to describe heaven and what happens when you die.
*&quot;In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. . . . Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot; (John 14:2-4,6)
*Paul (who would have a pretty good idea of what Jesus was talking about) has the best-known (if not directly explicit) explanation of God's promise: &quot;Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him&quot; (I Cor.2:9)

:Now, clearly I'm no theologian, but I can find verses for a few things if I check the index on my Bible... Like I said, though, the Bible's not written to be a legal document.  It takes interpretation.  Priests and the Pope interpret for Catholics and their interpretations are all standardized, so you can check Catholic dogma if you're looking for detailed, legalese on heaven.  Protestant views are, of course, more diverse and each group has slightly different versions of interpretations, but I think most would accept the few verses I give here as being a good starting point for understanding Heaven.  --[[User:Abqwildcat|ABQCat]] 05:30, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==Heaven in Islam?==

Wow, not even a word is mentioned.--[[User:Zereshk|Zereshk]] 03:20, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Heaven in Islam needs more thorough treatment than what is provided here.

The current description of Islamic views of heaven is misleading...it is very different than the Christian/Jewish view: The Islamic texts describes life for its immortal inhabitants, one that is happy — without hurt, sorrow, fear or shame — where every wish is fulfilled. Traditions relate that inhabitants will be of the same age (33 years), and of the same stature. Their life is one of bliss including: wearing costly robes, bracelets, perfumes; partaking in exquisite banquets, served in priceless vessels by immortal youths; reclining on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones. Other foods mentioned include meats, scented wine and clear drinks bringing neither drunkenness nor rousing quarrelling. Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of their parents, wives, and children (provided they were admitted to paradise) — conversing and recalling the past. Texts also relate &quot;pure consorts&quot; (houris), created in perfection, with whom carnal joys are shared — &quot;a hundred times greater than earthly pleasure&quot;. Female inhabitants admitted to paradise will rank 70,000 times greater than houris through the merit of their good deeds.[2]

Christianity rejects the idea of physical pleasure, food, and sex in heaven and focuses on the spiritual.  This should be clarified  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.116.69.251|69.116.69.251]] ([[User talk:69.116.69.251|talk]]) 21:41, 20 February 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I removed the &quot;See also&quot; link to [[never never land]]. &quot;Never Never Land&quot; is a euphemism for death, not Heaven. It would be more appropriate to include a link to [[death]].

Heaven: Eternal salvation of the soul. For the living to understand HEAVEN, we would
have to understand the presence of the Eternal time, how God may enter space-time and
still remain Eternal. Once we enter God's (Omni-present) Kingdom, then we'll know Heaven.

== Catholic teachings on heaven ==
This article needs some reworkings as IMHO, it is not really clear on the Catholic (or protestant for that matter) teachings and beliefs on entry into heaven. As described in the limbo article and this link http://www.religioustolerance.org/limbo.htm current Catholic teachings appear to suggest that unbaptised babies can in fact enter heaven and non Christians can in fact enter heaven altho they do of course still teach that baptisim is extremely important and it is only through God as they view 'it' that one can enter heaven. The teachings are somewhat contradictary probably because they revolve around the idea that their view of God are the correct ones but they also realised in the modern era many people are simply unwilling to accept that a person who is otherwise an extremely good person will not enter heaven. So instead currently the teachings appear to revolve around the idea that they suggest it's possible but say only accepting their view of God is the surefire way.

== Philosophy ==

Just a philosophical question about Heaven. What do you do in it? Can people explain what people would do in such a paradise? Especially in the Abrahamic religions as some eastern religions have cyclical periods of heaven/earth/hell, etc. [[User:70.111.224.85|70.111.224.85]] 23:32, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

But '''all the faiths''' represented here that teach heaven is real '''agree on one thing: that whatever people will do there will be intensely pleasurable and completely fulfilling'''...whether you look at descriptions of heaven being paved with &quot;streets of gold&quot; and &quot;no more dying, crying, or pain&quot; (Revelation of John), a kind of Nirvana where people live in the presence of Truth and Love embodied (CS Lewis), or a whole &quot;70 beautiful virgins&quot; for a certain category of devout followers of Islam.

== There is no need to tell what in indulgance is ==

Under the Heaven in Catholicism, there is no need to tell what a plenary indulgance is. This is a page on Heaven, not on gaining plenary indulgances.

== There needs to be another source ==

Under the &quot;Heaven In Roman Catholicism&quot; section there needs to be another source on the Catholic teaching of heaven and purgatory since not all Catholics use the Cathechim of the Catholic Church. It would be better to have a papal bull, or a quote from the Baltimore Catechism or the St. Pius X (not the socioty but the pope)Catechism or the Trent Catechism.

:For Roman Catholicism, the CCC is authoritative. [[User:Dominick|Dominick]] [[User_talk:dominick|&lt;sup&gt;(TALK)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:31, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

No it is not. many Traditional Catholics do not use that catechism. If you take a quote from the CCC you are breaking POV rules. All Catholics must beieve the other catechisms because they were written before Vatican II, when most of the disputes came about. I, personally do think that the CCC is a valid catechism and was written by valid popes after a valid council, but not all &quot;Catholics&quot; think the way I do.

:Thats not true. Some traditionalists do not use it but some do, all find most of it authoritative. NPoV in this case is a broad Catholic view, it doesn't have to be technical. We have to explain what we are talking about in gross terms. Thinking that we exclude traditionalist Catholics by using the CCC when most all Catholics follow it, is an incorrect assumption. The few traditionalist Catholics that have separated from the Catholic Church have no different view on the gross points in this topic as most do, and do not differ on this topic where the CCC speaks on it.

== Something to think about ==


In studying these things, and as with all things, it is so important to remember something: There are no absolutes, everything is an assumption, and everything is ultimately based on faith.

No matter how much one researches, one will never find a full answer. I look at all these different explanations about Heaven and its good because there is a good awareness of the essential points of the Bible, as well as other ideas about this topic from completely different cultures. But all in all, we can prove nothing to anyone or ourselves no matter how many facts we have. Facts are supported by other facts and with each step back, the facts become more shady. In the end, we can in no way fully consider all possible variables needed to find the TRUTH. Therefore all things are rooted in faith. Those who put their faith on anything else besides God's true word--which is Christ who is the Truth--are not right with God.

It is bad if we hold on to anything or any idea as if it has some lasting, eternal value. We can not grasp God, for He grasps us. God is the only one who can do anything! He has complete power and Authority over ALL of His creation. Man is NOTHING and God is EVERYTHING.

We must realize that we know nothing and are nothing. We must become nothing to ourselves to be something by God. We must cry out to God continually with desperation for His presence in our lives. We must declare His greatness as God Almighty, creator of all things visible and invisible. The lives we live must become a continual sacrafise of praise to God who, through Christ, loves and saves us all.

== Biblicism ==

In the discussion of Protestant beliefs the article seems to be biased towards the &quot;Biblicist&quot; position.  I've done a fair amount of reading of what Protestants believe about how to obtain salvation but never encountered a &quot;Biblicist&quot; position.   Sounds like a biased addition by someone who doesn't like calvinism or arminianism to me.  e.g. both calvinists and arminianists would accept the statement that salvation is &quot;By the grace of God alone, through faith in Christ alone&quot;.  And certainly the reference to Paul and Polycarp is inappropriate...although these men would not have seen a contradiction between our will to choose to do good, and God's divine power to predestine us for heaven, the article deceitfully implies that St. Paul and Polycarp were adherents of a movement called &quot;Biblicism&quot;...kind of ridiculous considering the Bible was still being written and a century or two away from being compiled when Paul lived.


'''I've removed all reference to Biblicism,''' mainly the article didn't have a NPOV towards it, and because it stated that only Biblicists taught 'grace alone, faith alone'.  This isn't true...but it seems a pity to take away all reference to the Biblicist point of view altogether, especially since I personally believe it, though I've never described myself as &quot;Biblicist&quot;.  Any Biblicists out there who are keen on putting in a paragraph about the Biblicist position from a NPOV, please do!

== Historical Fallacies ==

&quot;Jewish converts to this concept of heaven and hell included the group known as the Pharisees. The larger, dogmatically conservative Sadducees maintained their belief in Sheol. While it was the Sadducees that represented the Jewish religious majority it was the Pharisees who best weathered Roman occupation, and their belief in Zoroaster's heaven and hell was passed on to both Christianity and Islam (in which heaven is referred to as Jannah).&quot;

Most of this information is correct, except for the fact that the Tzaddikim or Sadducees were the minority, composed mostly of the Hellenizing Aristocrats and the Roman elected Levitical Priesthood.  The common people were almost all Pharisees and hated the Sadducees with a passion because they were looked at as traitors and oppressors of the poor.

== &quot;No soul&quot; (Anatta) assertion contradictory ==

Technically, most Buddhist sects may teach that &quot;there is actually no soul to be reborn&quot;:  I may not be an expert on the topic, but I learned about Buddhism in some college courses on Eastern religion.  Still, putting the &quot;no soul&quot; remark in the middle of a paragraph about what ''happens'' to the soul sounds confusing and contradictory.  A footnote seems like the best place to mention the &quot;Anatta&quot; teaching, in my opinion.  --[[User:ISNorden|Ingeborg S. Nordén]] 15:29, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
:Hm... It's not actually contradictory, the difference between rebirth and reincarnation is that in rebirth, no soul gets reborn. Just a new thought arises somewhere else. But I guess in western theology, a soul is required to travel to heaven. That maybe why it's contradictory. I added the footnotes.

Reply to section deleted by [[User:Codex_Sinaiticus|Codex Sinaiticus]] who stated, ''(rv - this is uncited and Original Research to posit that George Orwell was writing on behalf of the atheist conception)''

I'm not sure how you can claim that is O.R. to state that atheists don't believe in heaven, or that Orwell was mocking heaven's existence with the ficticious [[Sugarcandy Mountain]]. This isn't exactly rocket science. But none-the-less I will make an effort to provide enough bracketed numbers to placate the would-be censors. [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 06:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

:The OR still seems to be stating that George Orwell was writing on behalf of the atheist conception of heaven.  None of the websites you gave claim Orwell himself was an atheist, and I have never seen this claim.  Indeed, the one site you gave that speaks about his motive in writing this, actually asserts that his intention with SugarCandy Mountain and raven Moses, was to parody JOSEF STALIN's attempts to bend the Orthodox Church to his own agenda.  So it cannot be established that Orwell was an actual atheist himself, without any source that says this; it seems like your original research. [[User:Codex Sinaiticus|ፈቃደ]] ([[User talk:Codex Sinaiticus|ውይይት]]) 14:29, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

Orwell never explicitly described his religious beliefs. The general consensus on Orwell's personal view is that he was an agnostic/atheist who held a high degree of dislike for organized religion (particularly Catholicism) as can be seen in his quote, ''&quot;One cannot really be a Catholic and grown up&quot;''. I don't want to delve into too much &quot;OR&quot; here in order to demonstrate my point, but yes... When Orwell described the return of Moses in the latter part of the novel, Orwell was implying that Stalin tolerated religion because he realized that it made the laborers happy.[http://barney.gonzaga.edu/~sbennet3/mead/lessonplans/animalfarm.htm] A common subject in Orwell's fictional works is the various means that rulers use to control the masses, of which &quot;Sugarcandy Mountain&quot; is just one example. Are you trying to say that Orwell thought the concept of heaven was a &quot;mechanism of control&quot; ''only '' when it was in the hands of Stalin? I realize that this isn't a debate forum, so I will attempt to find sources where other writers express this view. [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 15:50, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

:If that is as you say the &quot;general consensus&quot; on Orwell's beliefs, you should have no problem finding a source that Orwell was an atheist.  Please do not add the Orwell stuff in again without a source stating what you claim is the &quot;general consensus&quot;, that he was an atheist.  [[User:Codex Sinaiticus|ፈቃደ]] ([[User talk:Codex Sinaiticus|ውይይት]]) 16:03, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

In the article I don't explicitly claim that Orwell was an atheist (although some people take that view[http://www.wonderfulatheistsofcfl.org/Quotes.htm][http://www.adherents.com/adh_sf.html][http://sfatheists.com/]). I was merely giving a literary example of an author describing heaven as a mechanism of control. This isn't an article on George Orwell, so I didn't want to digress into a discussion of this particular person's personal beliefs. In Animal farm, Orwell was describing heaven as a mechanism of control, and sources for this view have already been provided. There are already more sources cited in my two-paragraph blurb than in the rest of the entire article. This beginning to get unreasonable, and is starting to seem like an attempt to eliminate a section of text that conflicts with one persons' POV. Don't start a revert war over such a trivial point. [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 16:28, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

-------------

You added the line ''&quot;This is usually analyzed as being a critique of [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] tactics, but it bears strong similarities to the atheist claims of heaven being used by religion in general as a form of control.&quot;'' Do I need to point out once again that this article is not a discussion of Orwell's religious beliefs. All that is being said in the article is that Orwell provided a literary example of heaven as a means of control. I could modify your addition to include the fact that Orwell held similar view of the Catholic Church. But, it would be silly for me to try to further explain Orwell's view in this article. Orwell's personal views here are irrelevant (and would be more properly discussed in the article on George Orwell). 

This debate is similar to one person stating, for instance, that Huxley warned of the dangerous of a drug-dependent society in &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and then somebody else coming along and deleting this line because Huxley was not a prohibitionist. Huxley does not need to be a prohibitionist in order to warn about the dangers of drugs any more than Orwell needs to be an atheist in order to question the motives of people who make promises of heavenly rewards and punishments.

Furthermore, you failed to offer any sources that state that Orwell was ''only'' deriding the &quot;promise of heaven&quot; by Stalin alone. There is no reason to think that Orwell's only complaint about heaven (and religion) was that Stalin used it for political ends. I tried to help resolve this discussion by including a quote from Emma Goldman, who was an important influence on Orwell. (She was immortalized in [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] in the male character ''Emmanuel Goldstein''). Goldman's quote clearly indicates that this complaint is '''not''' only aimed at Stalinism (She wrote that quote in 1914, before Stalin even came to power). By doing so the article now says that Emma made this statement, and Orwell provided a literary example of this view.

You are accusing me of making un-cited statements while at the same time adding un-cited statements yourself that nobody who studies Orwell would agree with. Can you understand why I might think that these complaints have less to do with a desire for accuracy than an attempt to express a particular POV? This article is not a discussion of Orwell and his beliefs, and I see no reason that it should become so. This section is already plagued with an excessive number of citations, and this desire you seem to have for a digressions into the personal beliefs of Orwell would only help to further obfuscate the subject of the article. [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 19:24, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

:The purpose of the statement you removed was to try to help better connect your synthesis involving Orwell, with atheism in some way, shape or form.  As I mentioned above, my source for stating Orwell is usually seen as talking about Stalinism was one of the cites that you yourself provided, so I didn't think you were going to call it &quot;uncited&quot;, but I can easily cite it to the same cite you gave.  And with your most recent cite above, I have now seen two secondary sources stating that Sugarcandy mountain was specifically a critique of Stalinism, &lt;s&gt;compared to zero stating that Orwell is outlining the atheist view of Heaven on behalf of atheism, which still appears to be your own [[WP:OR|novel synthesis]].&lt;/s&gt;  [[User:Codex Sinaiticus|ፈቃደ]] ([[User talk:Codex Sinaiticus|ውይይት]]) 20:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

It appears that we have hammered out an agreement on this section, but there is one more issue I'd like to raise. I just noticed that all of the sections in this article are listed alphabetically. If we keep to this convention, a belief which starts with an &quot;A&quot; should go on top. However, I personally see the &quot;In Atheism&quot; section as more of a &quot;Criticism of the Theory&quot; section, which generally goes near the bottom of an article. I'm content to leave the section where it is, but I just wanted to raise the point. [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 15:53, 13 January 2007 (UTC)


==Atheist view II==

Once again, the purpose of the section is not to create a list of people who have proclaimed themselves to be atheist. The purpose it to quote people who espouse a particular point of view. A person does not need to be full-blown atheist in order to share the atheistic view of heaven. You reasoning behind deleting this information is highly irrational. What you are doing here is similar to saying that the page on communism can only include quotes from people who have registered with the communist party. I could easily find quotes from socialist/democrats/liberals/etc who might agree with Marx on a particular point. By your logic, these should be deleted. And that is completely illogical. 

And BTW... Just for the record... About.com lists Gibbon as an Agnostic/Atheist. [http://atheism.about.com/library/glossary/general/bldef_gibbonedward.htm] But as I said, this is largely irrelevant since it is clear from the quote that Gibbon is talking about Roman religions. Gibbon did not believe in Roman mythology, and therefore takes an atheistic position towards their gods and their beliefs.

Since you seem to be so interested in maintaining the accuracy in integrity of this particular article, I will strive to aid you in this endeavor by applying the same standard to the rest of the article that you wish to apply to this one particular section. I'm sure you will agree that it is the only fair thing to do. And hopefully together we can make this the greatest article Wikipedia has ever seen. There are quite a few unsourced statments in the article that appear to be O.R. [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 18:50, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

:I don't know if you have read [[WP:SYNT]], but that is exactly what you are doing in that section, unless you can quote a source that has made the same point that you seem to be pushing; you are drawing a novel conclusion, exactly like the example on the policy page... This isn't the appropriate place to do your own research, or write an essay on how the &quot;atheist view of Heaven&quot; was specifically formulated by Gibbon and Orwell, unless there is some other published source in the world that makes this point about Gibbon and Orwell.  Also the comments in your last paragraph make it clear that the sprinkling of gratuitous fact tags throughout the article is motivated by bad faith because of your efforts to expand the atheism section being reverted, so these tags should probably mostly be removed as begging the question. [[User:Codex Sinaiticus|ፈቃደ]] ([[User talk:Codex Sinaiticus|ውይይት]]) 01:16, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

The reason I am quoting other people directly in this article is to minimize the possibility of being criticized of OR. Now it seems that you are attempting to use my use of quotations as a justification for reverts. Perhaps you should read [[Help:Reverting]]. You cannot continuously delete my edits just because you don't like them. Reverts should generally only be used to combat vandalism, not to delete things you don’t personally agree with. Such behavior can lead to unnecessary revert wars.

Your last deletion was, once again, completely unwarranted. The line in question clearly states that Gibbon was applying his criticism to a religion (paganism) that wasn't his own. The line said, '''The 18th century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] applied this view in reference to the pagan religions of antiquity when he wrote, ''&quot;The various modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman world, were all considered by the people, as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the magistrate, as equally useful&quot;''.[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/volume1/chap2.htm] ''' I'm not sure how you can view this as &quot;Synthesis&quot; since it explicitly describes which religion was the target of the criticism. I am not joining the two quotes in the article in order to reach a logical conclusion. The Emma Goldman quote was about religion in general, and the second was about “pagan” religions. The reason they are both listed is because they are both examples of people criticizing religion as a tool of the state.  Just because the two quotes are related does not mean that I am trying to blend these two together to reach a conclusion that could be considered O.R. I'm am not saying ''If A and B, therefore C''. There is no &quot;therefore C&quot; anywhere in the paragraph, so I really have to wonder how you can even try to level such a complaint. The paragraph says here is &quot;Criticism A&quot;, and here are two examples of this view, with the context of the statements clearly described.

And as for the &quot;gratuitous sprinkling&quot; of {{Fact|date=March 2008}} tags, I think you can see that all of the lines I tagged are deserving of review. I'm just surprised that you never noticed these problems before, since you seem to keep such a close watch on the content of this article. But please observe that I didn't just run through the article willy-nilly and delete everything I didn't like. I am a firm believer in citing sources, and I am a little dismayed by the fact that the small section I created has more than twice as many references than the rest of the entire article.  [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 16:10, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

:I take it you still have not read [[WP:SYNT]] yet.  If you had, you would know that the deletion is justified, because as far as we know, you are the first person in the world to string together quotes from George Orwell, Edward Gibbon (neither of whom were known to be atheists) and others in order to push a particular point of view or conclusion, as well as to develop a &quot;theology&quot; if you like for atheism.  If some published source has ever done this, please cite it.  Otherwise it is precisely what Wikipedia refers to as &quot;novel synthesis&quot;.  Again, read [[WP:SYNT]] carefully.  I am not deleting it because I &quot;do not like it&quot;, if I could do that I would delte the entire thing.  The ridiculously weak argument implying it is somehow wrong to seek eternal reward could be easily refuted by Biblical texts, that state that Satan uses this same argument.  But you have cited an actual atheist who makes the argument, so it can stay, and actually it makes atheists look ridiculous to anyone who has read the Bible to have it included.  Your general hostility toward this article subject and your sarcastic tone above are also noted, and it is my opinion that you are no neutral editor, but only here to preach your own particular viewpoints and to deliberately sow tares in existing belief-systems, but Wikipedia is not at all supposed to be for pushing your own POV and fighting wars against people who believe differently from you. Here at wikipedia, your best policy is to just stick to sourcing what can be sourced neutrally, and save all the attacks on faith and religion for some other website.[[User:Codex Sinaiticus|ፈቃደ]] ([[User talk:Codex Sinaiticus|ውይይት]]) 16:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)



I think you need to re-read [[WP:SYNT]] yourself. It is a policy against taking two unrelated statements and blending them together to reach an original conclusion that can be construed as OR. The paragraph in question does no such thing. I am merely listing a few examples of people who have accused states of using religion towards political ends. This is not OR. The purpose and intended targets of their statements are clear. They are all separate instances, and do not rely on one another to draw a conclusion. I think you need to learn what a logical argument is before you can accuse me of falsely fabricating one.

Again, I ask you to specifically state the logical conclusion you think that I am trying to &quot;synthesize&quot;. In order to synthesize and argument (as per [[WP:SYNT]]), one statement would have to rely on another, and then a logical conclusion would have to rest upon the joining of the two prior statements. No such thing is occurring here. It isn't even close. As I said, there is no &quot;therefore C&quot;. I am not saying, &quot;Goldman said 'A', Gibbon said 'B', and therefore 'C'&quot;. The point of the paragraph is that some have accused people in power of using the promise of a post-mortem reward in order to suit their own ends. I am then saying that Goldman said this about &quot;religion&quot;, and that Gibbon said something similar in reference to &quot;pagan&quot; religions. I have heard these quotes cited by prominent atheists, therefore it is not “OR” . (i.e. The Gibbon quote was cited by atheist [[Steven Weinberg]] in a BBC interview[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2260129385438753065&amp;q=Atheist+tapes])

''&quot;The ridiculously weak argument implying it is somehow wrong to seek eternal reward could be easily refuted by Biblical texts...&quot;''

I don't even know what to say to that. I would love to have a philosophical discussion with you here, but I won’t. This is not the place. Your personal views here are irrelevant. The section in question is on the ''Atheist view of heaven'', not the ''theist view of the atheist view on heaven''. I am not pushing the atheist view here any more than the other religions here can be said to be pushing their view. This article is full of various POVs, and that is how it should be. You are obviously not an atheist, so I'm not sure why you have taken it upon yourself to act as the final editor of this section. You have already reverted my edits 9 times, in addition to making several other edits of your own. This behavior is not appropriate, and might easily be viewed as an &quot;attack&quot; by the person you are harassing with reverts. You really should take a good look at [[Help:Reverting]] (specifically, the section on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Reverting#When_to_revert When to revert]). - 02:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)[[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]]

::Reverting [[WP:SYNT|Original synthesis]] again.  Your purpose on this article seems to be to provoke confrontation and contention, and so far you have been quite successful at that.  I will be more than happy to revert your contentious and confrontational edits as long as necessary until we can get some arbitration on the matter. You seem to think the purpose of Wikipedia is to push your own POV on others by any means necessary.  Half of the authors quoted in your novel synthesis on atheism were not atheists, or never claimed to be atheists or speaking on behalf of atheism, so you are clearly putting words in their mouths.

---------------------------------

The purpose of my section is to give brief summary of the modern rationalist view towards the ancient belief of the afterlife. Such a view has every right to be present as the mythological beliefs of ancient Jews, Arabs, or Polynesians. By your practice of continual reversion, you are making it clear that you don't think that this view should be present in the article. Perhaps you can explain to me how censorship of an opposing viewpoint can be considered to be in line with maintaining an NPOV. All articles which describe a potentially debatable subject should include all reasonable viewpoints in order to maintain a NPOV.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Even though you have made it clear that you do not like this section because you view it as an &quot;attack&quot; on your theist sensibilities, you still seem to be maintaining that you rationale behind the deletion is due to a violation of [[WP:SYNT]]. I have asked you to explain how you have come to rather odd conclusion, and instead your response was to revert the entire article. The accusation of [[WP:SYNT]] is completely unwarranted. [[WP:SYNT]] is not a prohibition against collecting similar viewpoints in an article, as you would seem to be claiming. It is a prohibition against stringing together various unrelated facts to develop an original conclusion that could be construed as OR. The premise that religion can be used as a method of population control is certainly not an original position. And citing a couple examples of people who held this belief towards one religion or another is not a violation of [[WP:SYNT]]. If it were, a great many Wikipedia articles would be in need of revision.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The only clear violation of policy here is that of [[Help:Reverting]], since you have now reverted my edits 10 times for rather frivolous reasons. I am not a big fan of summoning the powers of admins to resolve disputes, but if you continue reverting sections without explaining your reasons there may be little recourse left available to us. But for now I will [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith assume good faith] and attempt to explain very clearly why this section is not violation of [[WP:SYNT]].&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Take a look at the example given in the [[WP:SYNT]] article. The logical argument might be summarized as follows...&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
'''1) Smith accuses Jones of plagiarism.'''&lt;BR&gt;
'''2) Jones says that he didn't take other people idea's, only their references.'''&lt;BR&gt;
'''3) The ''Chicago Manual of Style'' does not describe &quot;references stealing&quot; as plagiarism.'''&lt;BR&gt;
'''4) ''Therefore'' jones is not guilty of plagiarism.'''&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The article describes this as OR since the Wikipedia author who wrote this was stringing together a logical argument on his own in order to reach an original conclusion. The article then goes on the say that if some ''other'' published writer had made such an argument it ''could'' be included in the article since it would no longer be OR.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
So you see, there are two things necessary for a section to be in violation of [[WP:SYNT]]:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
'''A) A logical argument.'''&lt;BR&gt;
'''B) The argument must be un-sourced OR.'''&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
'''Concerning &quot;A&quot;...''' take a look at the example argument cited above. It is a logical argument because if you were to remove any part of it would lose its logical coherence. I challenge you to demonstrate how my article falls into this category. If you would give it a try, you would see that your &quot;logical argument&quot; looks something like this...&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
1) Goldman viewed religion as an opiate of the masses.&lt;BR&gt;
2) Gibbon Stated that roman leaders used religion towards their own ends.&lt;BR&gt;
3) Orwell saw the promise of heaven as an imaginary carrot dangled in front of workers to motivate them to obedience and contentment.&lt;BR&gt;
4) The [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]] religion has an extremely silly description of heaven in order to make a point.&lt;BR&gt;
5) Therefore.... ????&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
I hope you can see that this is not a logical argument. It is a collection of similar viewpoints. I have attempted to include a variety of different viewpoints in the interest of NPOV, but this is by no means an attempt to state that they all believe the exact same thing and all possess the same monolithic view on religion. Atheist and freethinkers are notorious for avoiding such a grouping. As atheists are often heard to lament, trying to organize any sort of formal atheistic organization or theology is a bit like trying to “herd cats”.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
'''Concerning &quot;B&quot;...''' Where is the OR? Are you suggesting that I am the first person to state that religion is the ''&quot;opiate of the masses&quot;''? If you wish to attribute this novel idea to me personally, I would be very much honored. But I'm afraid that it would be wrong of me to claim all the glory for myself, since to do so would clearly be an act of '''plagiarism''' (pun intended).&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
One last note... In the comments of your latest and greatest revert you said ''&quot;Trimming for undue and disproportionate weight - atheism is an extreme minority view and does not deserve half the cites in the article&quot;''. First of all, the entire article is roughly 6,540 words long. The atheism section is 611 words long. If you break out your calculator, you will see that this is less than 10% of the article. And if your complaint is about the number of citations, do I really need to remind you that reason you gave for your first revision was a lack of citations? And in any case, if your problem is truly with the citations, you could easily remove those instead of the entire article. But I should let you know that I would resist such a change since it would leave the section vulnerable to later deletion from somebody who asserted that the section was un-sourced. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
And for the record, did you really just say that you deleted the section because it was too well sourced? Just when you think you’ve seen everything… - [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 17:44, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

---------------------------------


::I will continue to revert your edits many more times until this is mediated.  It is a clear case of [[WP:SYNT]], because nobody before you as far as we know has ever tried to synthesize Gibbon with Orwell and the others into an &quot;atheist point of view, or even state that Gibbon had anything to do with atheism.  You are taking disparate comments from many authors completely out of context and forging them together into a ''novel synthesis'' to make an argument against an afterlife, and unless you show where this approach has ever been published in a reputable source, it is original reesearch.  Secondly, it is disproportionate and undue weight to give so much attention to atheism in an article about Heaven, so I'm trimming the section.  The purpose of the article is to describe all the different religious views of Heaven, not to fill it with criticism of the article subject.  There have been many cases like this where people try to turn articles upside down with attacks on the subject, leading to filling half of them with criticisms and arguments and rebuttals and counter arguments until a subarticle is made for all the criticisms.  We may have to do that here and make a subarticle dedicated to criticism of all the other religions, because it doesn't belong on this page. Atheism may be a viewpoint, but it is not that significant in terms of numbers worldwide. [[User:Codex Sinaiticus|ፈቃደ]] ([[User talk:Codex Sinaiticus|ውይይት]]) 18:50, 23 January 2007 (UTC)



I am dismayed that you have now openly declared your intention for a revert war. IF that is your intention, there is little else to discuss. I have already described my position thoroughly in the comments above, and it apparent that you have chosen to ignore it. Even though I'm fairly sure that you are no longer reading any of this, I'll recap my points once more just to be clear:

1) You are accusing me of &quot;synthesizing&quot; various opinions on heaven to prove that it doesn't exist. I am doing no such thing. I am giving examples of people who felt that the promise of unearthly reward/punishment was used as a tool to control the actions of the living. (i.e. &quot;The opiate of the masses&quot;) Such a position does not exclude the existence of heaven. It only states that people on Earth have used this belief to serve their own ends. And this is exactly was the authors of these quotes have tried to express, each in their own way.

2) You also have seemed to indicate that you believe my purpose in the article is to state that everybody mentioned declared themselves to be atheists -- You are saying that I am combining these quotes to &quot;prove&quot; that all these people absolutely denied the existence of the afterlife. Again, I am doing no such thing (Even though the case could certainly be made, that is irrelevant to this discussion) If this really was the purpose of my article, how does it help such an argument to state that Orwell wasn't a self-declared atheist, or that Gibbon was talking specifically about &quot;pagan&quot; religions?

3) The stated purpose of the section in question is to give examples of people who have said that the common belief in an afterlife is a tool that is used as an &quot;opiate of the masses&quot; by those in power. This view is not limited to atheists (as should be obvious), and it is certainly not an original conclusion. This is the common thread to all of these quotes, and this is clearly stated in the article. The other arguments that you are accusing me of &quot;synthesizing&quot; exist only in your own head. The article itself states no such conclusions. Furthermore, inclusion of these quotes is not OR since I can provide examples of popular self-described atheist referring specifically to these quotes in their arguments. For example, here are two examples of atheists citing the Gibbon quote –
* [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2260129385438753065&amp;q=Atheist+tapes Atheism Tapes: Steven Weinberg] – Time index 22:00
* [http://video.google.com/url?vidurl=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.google.com%2Fvideoplay%3Fdocid%3D-7100434305066027154%26q%3Dhistory%2Bdisbelief&amp;docid=-7100434305066027154&amp;ev=v&amp;esrc=sr1&amp;usg=AL29H22gN7nPKEGG8yPrKR8Oe1j_Fxnjfw BBC: History of Disbelief] Time index 56:55 

Hmm… actually, it appears that the inspiration for Gibbon’s quote came from [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (a “pagan” philosopher). Would it help to resolve the issue if I quoted the Seneca version of this quote instead? It really doesn’t matter to me. The two quotes are nearly identical.

4) As I showed in my previous response, I have read [[WP:SYNT]] and have given you a very clear explanation of why it doesn't apply. Holding your breath and simply declaring by fiat that it violates this rule is not going to convince anyone, especially when I have already given a clear explanation of why it doesn't.

5) Even if we were to assume that you have a valid complain about that one paragraph, why did you delete the other two paragraphs? Additionally, as per [[Help:Reverting]], simply because you are unsatisfied with a section, that does not give you the right to continuously delete it. If you have a complaint, discuss it. The reason for this policy is to prevent revert wars, and to prevent ill-will between editors. Which brings me to #6...

6) It is apparent that you have not read [[Help:Reverting]], or you have simply chosen to ignore it. Please read the following...

---When to revert---

---Do's---
:''See also [[m:WikipediAhimsa|Wikipedia policy should follow the spirit of ahimsa]]''
* Reverting is '''a decision which should be taken seriously'''.
* Reverting is used primarily for fighting [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]], or anything very similar to the effects of [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]].
* If you are not sure whether a revert is appropriate, discuss it first rather than immediately reverting or deleting it.
* If you feel the edit is unsatisfactory, improve it rather than simply reverting or deleting it.

---Dont's---
* Do not simply revert changes that are made as part of a dispute. Be respectful to other editors, their contributions and their points of view.
* Do not revert good faith edits. In other words, try to consider the editor &quot;on the other end.&quot; If what one is attempting is a positive contribution to Wikipedia, a revert of those contributions is inappropriate unless, and only unless, you as an editor possess firm, substantive, and objective proof to the contrary. Mere disagreement is not such proof. See also [[Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith]].
* Generally there are misconceptions that problematic sections of an article or recent changes are the reasons for reverting or deletion. If they contain valid information, these texts should simply be edited and improved accordingly. '''Reverting is not a decision which should be taken lightly.'''
* There's sometimes trouble determining whether some claim is true or useful, particularly when there are few people &quot;on board&quot; who are knowledgeable about the topic. In such a case, it's a good idea to raise objections on a talk page; if one has some reason to believe that the author of what appears to be biased material will not be induced to change it, editors have sometimes taken the step of transferring the text in question to the talk page itself, thus not deleting it entirely. This action should be taken more or less as a last resort, never as a way of punishing people who have written something biased. See also [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ]]
* Do not revert changes simply because someone makes an edit you consider problematic, biased, or inaccurate. '''Improve the edit, rather than reverting it'''.

And on that note, I will now proceed to undo your 11th reversion. As we are quickly approaching the [[WP:3RR]], please do not revert again until we can resolve this dispute. I understand that you don't like the atheist viewpoint on this subject, but that doesn't give you the right to delete it.

Some comments:
*There are better sources than &quot;pie in the sky&quot; than Orwell; some of them may even use Orwell as an example. 
*WP is an encyclopedia, not a collection of opinion pieces. We do not argue for (or against) the atheist view, which is what BB 1984 is doing. 
*About.com's opinion of Gibbon is not a reliable source; they are a WP mirror, and collect all our old mistakes.

--------------------------
&lt;BR&gt;
'''1)''' Concerning Orwell... I'm not sure what the issue is. I provided a citation[http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/site/$country=us$/opinion/essays/rhodi.html] to a source that explained Orwell's use of &quot;Sugarcandy Mountain&quot; as....''&quot;Orwell showed how Moses's tales of a heaven called &quot;Sugarcandy Mountain&quot; were useful to Jones as a way of keeping the animals in order - religion gave them hopes of a better life after they died and their belief made them more willing to accept their current harsh lives.&quot;''. I suppose I could have directly plagiarized this quote, but my brief one-line comment is saying the essentially the same thing. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
I've run an Orwell-themed website for nearly 10 years. If I were so inclined, I could give a more in-depth description of what message Orwell was trying to convey by cartooning heaven in such ridiculous manner. But I don't think that such a digression belongs in this article. (Plus, the lengthiest discussion about Sugarcandy Mountain I have been able to find on the Internet exists on my ''own'' website. And obviously, I can't quote myself without being guilty of OR). &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The reason I mentioned &quot;Sugarcandy Mountain&quot; from [[Animal Farm]] in the article is because it is the best fictional example I know of which clearly describes the promise of heaven being purposefully used by those in power as an &quot;opiate of the masses&quot;. I suppose that the article doesn't absolutely need to have this reference in it, but then again, I don't see any reason why it should be specifically removed either. Plus I think it ties in well with the real-life criticism of Goldman, and the overly-fictitious satire of the Pastafarians.&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;BR&gt;
'''2)''' Many articles have a &quot;criticism of the theory&quot; section. I agree that the wiki should not be used as a soapbox to voice any one person's POV. By in an article such as this which describes a &quot;Theory&quot; about which is great disagreement, the only way to maintain a NPOV is to describe each competing viewpoint in its own separate section. This article was already sub-divided into multiple such divisions before I even arrived. But the one thing that all the sections had in common is that they all supported the validity of a belief in heaven.&lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;BR&gt;
In the &quot;Atheist&quot; section I added, I suppose that I could have quoted people who argue against the existence of heaven in order to balance the POV of the article. But atheist arguments are rarely concerned with &quot;disproving&quot; the existence of heaven (since there is really no good way to &quot;prove a negative&quot;). When atheists do discuss heaven, they generally talk about the effect of such a belief on society as a whole. I included three of common arguments in the article, which are:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
1) The &quot;opiate of the masses&quot; view.&lt;BR&gt;
2) They think that there are better reasons to be nice to your fellow man than believing that an invisible man will reward you for it.&lt;BR&gt;
3) The belief that you are immortal makes it easier for you to martyr yourself in order to please your deity.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
In the article, I never state that any of these claims are true or that their opinion is better than any other view... I am merely saying ''this person said this'' and ''this person said that'', which as far as I know is the best way to describe a POV in a neutral manner. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
'''3)''' Gibbon. I only cited the about.com article here in the talk page to show that some people might call him an agnostic. I didn’t add this to the article itself because Gibbon's status as an atheist wasn't being discussed. It is well-known that '''nobody''' who lived in the early 18th century described themselves as an atheist. The [[Blasphemy Act]] essentially made it against the law to declare one's self as an atheist, and such an overt act could be punishable by life imprisonment or death. People were still being sent to prison well after Gibbon lived, so even if he ''was'' an atheists he would have never said so. (The last person sent to prison was in 1921, and believe it or not, the law is still on the books... although it is no longer enforced). &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
It is for this reason that you will often find atheists quoting people who never publicly called themselves atheists... you really don't find many people who did so before modern times. And it is for this reason that Gibbon's status as an atheist isn't even being suggested.... he never said that he was. (And he actually professes his belief in Christianity quite often) But, whether or not Gibbon did or did not believe in the Jewish god Jehovah is irrelevant. Gibbon is not even discussing Christianity in this quote. Roman religions had some idea of an afterlife as well. One can deride Roman mythological beliefs while at the same time accepting Jewish/Christian mythology as true. Modern atheists see little difference between Roman mythology and Jewish mythology. Gibbon did not believe in the gods of Roman mythology. He is clearly an &quot;unbeliever&quot; in these gods. And it clearly ''these'' gods and their religions that Gibbon is talking about in the passage. And that point is explicitly mentioned.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
But the reason I included his quote in the article is because modern atheists quote him (as I showed in a previous comment). The reason they quote him is because they don't constrain Gibbon's criticism merely to Roman mythology as Gibbon did, but rather to ''all'' religions. The target of the argument may be changed, but the argument itself remains unchanged when atheists invoke it.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Now that I've gone through the trouble of defending my use of the quote, I'll go ahead and remove it. ^&gt;^ The pagan philosopher Seneca said pretty much the same thing in the 1st century CE. In fact, It seems that Gibbon may have actually plagiarized Seneca... who in turn may have plagiarized Lucretius...&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
''The various modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman world, were all considered by the people, as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the magistrate, as equally useful.'' - [[Edward Gibbon]] (1776)&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
''Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful.'' - [[Seneca]] (ca. 4 BC –AD 65)&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
''All religions are equally sublime to the ignorant, useful to the politician, and ridiculous to the philosopher.''
- [[Lucretius]] (94 BC - 49 BC)&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Seneca did not believe in the pagan religions of the time, and could therefore properly be called an atheist. That should alleviate any possibility of complaint. But before I make the change I first want to find a better source for these quotes to make sure that Seneca and/or Lucretius actually wrote these words. - [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 00:10, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

== Wikipedia's attack against heaven? ==

I'm personally critical of the concept of heaven &amp; hell, but there has to be some degree of dignity in how this is written. Who is responsible for this attack? Unlike the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, none of us brilliant wiki-philosophers are signing the article, so who is responsible for these interpretations of the sources? Synthesizing sources together like this to form a solid case against religion is working at the secondary level of analysis, which is inappropriate for wikipedia. The way to write a criticism about the doctrine of heaven, is to use atheist philosophers who have been explicitly writing about ''the doctrine of heaven'', and describe their line of criticism, and only cite Orwell, if they too have done so. Otherwise, this is SYNT, SYNT, SYNT and maybe even worse than SYNT. --[[User:Merzul|Merzul]] 00:35, 25 January 2007 (UTC)


It is interesting how some people here are choosing to define SYNT. I already gave a detailed explanation of why this section doesn't violate [[WP:SYNT]] above, but I'll quickly go through it once more.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The prohibition is not, as some seem to claim, against gathering quotes from various authors who have a similar opinion on a subject. If you believe this to be the case, what would you suggest as an alternative?... That all articles express the views of a ''single'' author? I think we can all see that this is certainly not was is intended by [[WP:SYNT]]. The prohibition here is against constructing original logical arguments based on separate facts – SYNT is prohibited because it is OR. But I fail to see how the topics I discussed can be construed as OR. It wouldn’t surprise me if somebody might never of heard of these criticisms before, but that fact does not make them OR. I've already stated the three main criticisms discussed in the article in my previous comment, but I'll reiterate them here again so you don't have to scroll...&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
1) Some atheists view the promise of heavenly rewards as an &quot;opiate of the masses&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;
2) Some atheists think that there are better reasons to be nice to your fellow man than believing that an invisible man will reward you for it.&lt;BR&gt;
3) Some atheists fear that people who believe they are immortal have no reservations about martyring themselves (i.e. suicide bombers) in order to please their deity.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
The primary question here is whether or not any of these are OR. I don't think there is any possible way these could be construed as such. This is what the quotes ''themselves'' say. These main points are merely a summary of the viewpoints expressed in their respective paragraphs. The quotes don’t build on one another to form any sort of logical argument. The quotes are all independent expressions of opinion on a similar theme. There are no conclusions in the article being drawn except for what the authors state themselves. No OR, no violation of [[WP:SYNT]]. It really is just that simple. - [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 02:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

::You yourself stated above that you think it all &quot;ties in well&quot; (search for the phrase 'ties in well' on this page)... So, it &quot;ties in well&quot;, but it is not &quot;synthesized&quot;?  Seems like you want it both ways... [[User:Codex Sinaiticus|ፈቃደ]] ([[User talk:Codex Sinaiticus|ውይይት]]) 02:38, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

::: What ties them in are statements like &quot;X expressed ''this view''&quot;, &quot;Y applied ''this view''&quot;, &quot;Z gave a literary example of ''this view''&quot;, &quot;W provides a ''similarly'' fictitious reward&quot; -- these are all judgments that a certain quotation (be it Orwell or the Chicago Manual of Style) is expressing a certain view. SYNT is not saying that you can only use one source per article, but it is more about working at the appropriate level of analysis. For example you can write: &quot;In an essay on Orwell's Political Messages, Rhodri Williams explains the symbolism behind the character Moses and compares the notion of heaven to his imaginary mountain ...&quot; Excuse the bad writing, but the idea is that your should work with secondary sources and attribute your literary analysis to somebody, preferably a notable literary critic. We should not write things like this directly as if Wikipedia is drawing the conclusions and making the case. --[[User:Merzul|Merzul]] 04:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

::: Addendum: the second source on Orwell states &quot;... This represents the cynical use of religion by the state to anaesthetise the minds of the masses.&quot; But this is quite different from the criticism that religion is itself the opiate of the masses. It doesn't seem like the source would agree that Orwell &quot;gave a literary example of ''this view''&quot;. Even if you don't agree with me, do you at least see why we should be working with secondary sources?  --[[User:Merzul|Merzul]] 04:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)


I understand your concerns about suggesting in an article that there is '''only''' one particular way to interpret a piece of fiction (especially in an article not specifically discussing the piece of fiction in question). Although in the case or Orwell's [[Animal Farm]], the fictional elements of the book are such a thinly veiled critique of real life that there is generally only one way to interpret what Orwell was trying to say. I've been particularly interested in Orwell and his works for many years now, and I have never seen any other interpretations of &quot;Sugarcandy Mountain&quot; put forth. But I have run into difficulties in finding sources to backup this claim. Many of the people who have written about Orwell throughout the years did so because they liked his anti-communism stance -- They are typically &quot;conservatives&quot;, while Orwell himself was a Socialist. Being mostly conservative, they generally ignore Orwell's comments about religion entirely. This is evident, for instance, if you take a look at the two [[Animal_Farm_in_popular_culture#Adaptations|film adaptions]] of ''Animal Farm'' -- In both films the role of Moses is almost entirely written out of the script, and ''Sugarcandy Mountain'' is never even mentioned once.

(Please pardon the OR here. But as an arm-chair &quot;expert&quot; on Orwell, I can't help but stress the obvious nature of the interpretation that is put forth in the article.)

However, I concede the point. I'm just wondering how I could re-word the section to remove the &quot;certainty&quot; about this interpretation of Sugarcandy Mountain as an means to ''&quot;anaesthetise the minds of the masses&quot;'', even though this is the only interpretation that is really possible. But I'll give it a shot... let me know if you think this is sufficient. - [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 10:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

: Ok, I'm glad we are starting to understand each other. Your rewrite is clearly a step in the right direction, but I wonder if it will satisfy those editors who were initially offended at this section. Unfortunately, I don't have the competence/experience to resolve this conflict, so I just encourage you to consider one general issue when working with criticism of religion. Think of this recent wave of attack on religion in 2006, isn't most of what they say rather obvious and quite well known? I think the real ''novelty'' is that they have the guts to speak up. This is why I recommend being careful and work with the other editors to avoid direct claims and interpretations, and instead try to follow what notable critics have said. So, even if it is very obvious what Orwell was talking about, we should be very careful and delicate in pointing this out on Wikipedia, since as you said, much of the critical literature has not focused on this aspect. Very often avoiding synthesis doesn't mean you have to delete or censor material, but simply that you try to work with other editors to find the appropriate language and the right level of attribution. Anyway, I hope this helps, and I wish both sides a good and peaceful debate! --[[User:Merzul|Merzul]] 14:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

== Plasma Metaphysics?==

This section appears to be spam for the published works of one author, Jay Alfred. I did a [http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac/search/web/Plasma%252BMetaphysics/1/-/1/-/-/-/1/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/1/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/417/top/-/-/1/1 metacrawler search] for the phrase &quot;Plasma Metaphysics&quot;, and the only results that were returned was plasmametaphysics.com (a site run by Alfred), or sites which redirected directly back to this site. If you take a look at the [[Special:Contributions/Plasmametaphysics|contributions]] by this user [[User:Plasmametaphysics|Plasmametaphysics]], you'll see that all he has done is promote the work of Jay Alfred. And furthermore, this whole concept of &quot;Plasma Metaphysics&quot; is pure pseudo-scientific nonsense. I suggest we axe this section and everything else this user has ever done. -- [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 16:00, 31 January 2007 (UTC)


I do agree that at this time Plasma Metaphysics is not very well-known - I will therefore stop making further contributions if it is not welcomed – although it means depriving readers of a powerful theory that recasts traditional metaphysical and religious knowledge in the context of modern physics. Plasma Metaphysics is an exciting new field which is based on sound theoretical physics, astronomical and metaphysical evidence.-- [[Plasmametaphysics]] 4 February 2007

:”Powerful theory”? I offer this from Alfred’s Website:
::''There is growing evidence that human beings possess a series of very high frequency liquid-crystal electromagnetic bodies, which are ordinarily invisible and survive the death of our physical bodies.''
:Lol. Perhaps Mr. Alfred should contact the guy who developed the [[Time Cube]]. I'm sure they'll get along. Both of these &quot;powerful theories&quot; have something in common - they lack a fair degree of [[falsifiability]]. I realize that the theory of Heaven also fails this test. But the reason Wikipedia has an article about it is because that a great many people on this planet believe they are immortal and will travel to some sort of special immortal resort after they're dead. In order for &quot;plasma metaphysics&quot; to qualify for insertion in Wikipedia articles, Mr. Alfred must first convince a sizable number of people that his &quot;theory&quot; is worthwhile. (Or, like in the case of the [[Time Cube]] or the [[FSM]], he must have many people laughing at it). In order to maintain NPOV, it really doesn't matter if he's right or wrong ... if enough people are interested in it will get a mention on Wikipedia. But Wikipedia should not be used as a platform to advertise every single nonsensical conjecture that any non-notable person might dream up. - [[User:Big Brother 1984|Big Brother 1984]] 18:25, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

If Brother had actually read what was on the website, he would have realized that his quote refers to bodies that are popularly called ‘bioplasma bodies’ and that plasma metaphysics is based on [[plasma physics]]. Are invisible plasma bodies a new idea? Even Barbara Brennan, a noted contemporary metaphysicist and former NASA engineer, has characterised the subtle bodies in metaphysical literature as bioplasma bodies. Plasma bodies are electromagnetic bodies with specific frequencies – what metaphysicists term a ‘vibratory signature’ and are composed of [[dark matter]]. They are ordinarily ''invisible'' because of limitations in our current sensory systems and measuring instruments in detecting dark matter. NASA officially announced the discovery of dark matter in August 2006, based on extremely persuasive indirect astronomical evidence. Ironically the term ‘bioplasma’ is mentioned in the Wikipedia page on the [[etheric body]] - the very page that plasma metaphysics was edited-out by Big Brother! There is however no Wikipedia page for it. Plasma metaphysics would have made an ideal Wikipedia page to explain this concept but Brother displaying his usual pseudo-expertise has called it ‘spam’. Brother obviously did not adequately research the subject before he reached his laughable conclusions. Contemporary metaphysical literature clearly points out the electromagnetic nature of both ‘bioplasma’ and ‘subtle’ bodies. Plasma was discovered to have [[liquid crystal]] properties in 1994 by Gregor Morfill and this was verified by other experimenters. Is the idea of an [[afterlife]] astounding to Brother? Then read the Wikipedia. Plasma metaphysics does not even make the claim that individual soul-bodies are immortal. (But of course, Brother, appears to be unaware of this.) Is the idea of [[subtle bodies]] new? Again read the Wikipedia. Plasma metaphysics includes a detailed contemporary study and discussion of the work of [[C.W. Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] – all referenced in Wikipedia pages, in the context of modern physics. The building blocks of plasma metaphysics are based on ideas widely suppported by a great many people and there is already significant Wikipedia content on them. All these various ideas flow naturally out of the single conceptual framework of plasma metaphysics. So how did our dear Brother come to his conclusions? – He read a few web pages and started jumping to conclusions - like an irresponsible movie critic who makes sweeping generalizations about a movie after catching a movie trailer. Can we trust Big Brother’s ability to edit? Amusingly he then goes on to expound the scientific method. Our misguided Brother should stop his Popperish-jiberrish and do some ''real'' work. He can start with theories about [[dark matter]], move on to learn something about [[supersymmetry]] theory; and then familiarize himself with [[plasma physics]]. It is only with this ''foundation knowledge'' that plasma metaphysics can be approached. All these topics are covered in the ''introductory'' section of the first book for the lay informed reader. Intensive reseach over five years generated three books covering plasma metaphysics. Recent experiments are cited on every other page. More than a 100 books and numerous recent scientific papers have been cited in the books. The books have been double-checked, triple-checked and overhauled more than thirty times. It is unbelievable that Brother has come to the conclusion that ‘Both of these &quot;powerful theories&quot; have something in common - they lack a fair degree of falsifiability’ without even so much as reading one book on the subject of plasma metaphysics! He carelessly bunches two very different theories into one based on superficial characteristics - clearly displaying his ignorance of the subject-matter. Plasma metaphysics is derived from the widely established [[Lambda-CDM model]] and [[M-theory]] – any falsification of these theories is a falsification of plasma metaphysics. (Brother, you might want to read that again before sermonising on the scientific method.) In order to convince the Wikipedia community that our Brother is not a loose cannon firing at imaginary targets and wasting everybody’s time, Big Brother should perhaps be less big headed and ‘listen’ to what other editors say. Wikipedia should not be used as a platform for every nonsensical attack he makes on contributors, while contributing hardly anything himself.--[[User:Plasmametaphysics|Plasmametaphysics]] 08:42, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
::What you are saying is complete nonsense. Just because scientists are still trying to figure out what dark matter and dark energy are doesn't mean that you can just make stuff up. You are using a lot of real physics terms here, but you seem to be confused about what these terms actually mean. Just because you throw a lot of scientific jargon onto a theory, that doesn't make the theory scientific. ''Star Trek'' is based on real science, but that doesn't make it scientific, does it? In order to be scientific, there must be some sort of testable hypothesis. So, I must ask, what is it? Where’s the beef?
::It seems that you are trying to say that people are immortal because they have &quot;souls&quot; made out of some sort of &quot;dark matter vibrations&quot;. This is complete nonsense. Dark matter does not interact with normal matter, that is why it is &quot;dark&quot;. Therefore, you're going to have a hard time explaining how these &quot;vibrations&quot; get stuck in the human brain and control its actions. (But that would be a big leap, because first you have to figure out what dark matter is, THEN show that it can &quot;vibrate&quot;, THEN show that it can take on some sort of structured form which could be construed as a &quot;soul&quot;, and THEN.... on, and on, and on...) If his theory had any merit, he would be in line for a Nobel Prize. But the theory doesn't even seem to be coherent or make any testable predictions. It's just some new-age nonsense dressed up to look like meaningful science. 
::In any case, none of this is particularly relevant to why this nonsense has been removed from the articles. The reason it has been removed is because it is not notable.

Once again Big Brother (‘Brother’) has gone off the tangent like a loose cannon. Despite the fact that my previous message clearly states: ‘Plasma metaphysics does not even make the claim that individual soul-bodies are immortal.’ Brother says ‘It seems that you are trying to say that people are immortal...’. How do you argue rationally with a person who does not even appear to have the ability to read what was written? This confirms my previous observation that Brother does not care to ‘listen’ to others or maybe he is simply downright careless. Brother's statement that ‘Dark matter does not interact with normal matter...’ is complete nonsense. Even a physics undergraduate knows that dark matter interacts with ordinary matter through the long-range gravitational force. If dark matter did not interact with ordinary matter then why are massive stars at the edge of the galaxy Andromeda moving as fast as the stars nearer the galactic nucleus – as verified by Vera Rubin and W K Ford in 1970? And why are the stars in sixty other galaxies showing the same behavior. In fact, it was precisely because of this INTERACTION, relating to the [[galaxy rotation curve]], that dark matter was taken seriously by physicists. (These examples have been cited in the book – which systematically takes the reader through the theory.) Dark matter also interacts through the [[weak nuclear force]] in interactions involving [[WIMPs]] (I’m not referring to Brother here – these are dark matter particles). In other words, two out of the four physical forces known in nature are relevant in the interactions between dark and ordinary matter. In this context, Brother’s ludicrous comment that ‘Dark matter does not interact with normal matter, that is why it is &quot;dark&quot;’ is not only outright nonsensical it is hilarious! The reason why dark matter is called ‘dark’ is because it does not radiate electromagnetic radiation within the known electromagnetic spectrum – the word ‘dark’ refers to dark matter’s ‘non-luminosity’. If Brother wants to know who’s confused about scientific terms he should take a good hard look at himself in the mirror. Even the first line of the Wikepedia page on [[dark matter]] which was linked to my previous message for Brother’s easy reference states: ‘In astrophysics and cosmology, dark matter is matter, not directly observed and of unknown composition, that does not emit or reflect enough electromagnetic radiation to be detected directly, but whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter.’ Apparently, Brother had not even read the reference given to him. Where did Brother get the phrase ‘vibrations get stuck in the human brain’. This is the stupidest attempted interpretation of plasma metaphysics that I have encountered. The term ‘dark matter vibrations’ has never been used anywhere in the books. All these terms are nonsensical terms concocted by a muddled-Brother based on preconceived and outdated ideas. It is clear that the only person who is ‘making things up’ is Brother. All this shows that Brother has only a superficial understanding of what little he has read while not being the least perturbed about insulting others who have done years of intensive research on the subject. Nobody really cares about  Brother’s pseudo-expert ‘criticisms’ except the biggest confused crackpot of all - Big Brother. His ‘criticisms’ are nothing but the incessant whinings of a lazy goof-ball who does not want to do any real work to understand the subject better.--[[User:Plasmametaphysics|Plasmametaphysics]] 05:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

I am a bit puzzled by the statement that there are Buddhist gods, a Buddhist pantheon. I have never come across these before in any reading about Buddhism. I'm pretty sure that these gods 'Sakka' and 'Brahma' are recognised by only some branches of Buddhism (if that) and not by the whole.

[[User:Agemegos|Agemegos]] 07:29, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

:You are correct. There is not one form of Buddhism, it has many forms and branches. Being a very adaptive philosophy, Buddhists often identify other gods or semi-gods to their own views. For example, in Japan the native Shinto religion coexists easily next to Buddhism and people consider themselves to both a Shintoist and a Buddhist. --[[User:Soetermans|Soetermans]] 17:29, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

==Entyomology of the word Heaven==

This article seems not to disscuss the origin of the term Heaven, and which religion's first mentioned it. There is also an over-emphasis upon Christianity (which probably reflects the authors own knowledge), which seems a shame because Heaven (or an equivalent) is in just about every religion. Also there is little discourse about what kind of existence one might have in heaven (ie about the nature of a spiritual existence).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Entyomology: Heaven comes from the Middle English Heven, which its self is derived from the Old English term Heofon (meaning sky). This term probably derives from the Old Norse word 'Himinn'. Such phrases have Indo-European roots, suggesting perhaps a Vedic or Sumarian origin. Also I would imagine that Buddhists take their opinion's about Heaven directly from the Vedas, and so it ought to be made clear that Hindu's and Buddhists have the same root; from which Egyption, Sumarian, greek and Norse belief's derived. Only in Judaic/Christian myth does Heaven signify God's spritual domain, all other faiths show heaven to be a place within the material world. Does this suggest that the Nordic term for Heaven has been wrongly associated/confused/transilliterated with the Hebrew term Shamayim?

Other descriptions: Heaven  

O.E. Heofon &quot;home of God,&quot; earlier &quot;sky,&quot; possibly from P.Gmc. *Khemina- (cf. Low Ger. Heben, O.N. Himinn, Goth. Himins, O.Fris. Himul, Du. Hemel, Ger. Himmel &quot;Heaven, sky&quot;), from PIE base *kem-/*kam- &quot;to cover&quot; (cf. chemise). Plural use in sense of &quot;sky&quot; is probably from Ptolemaic theory of space composed of many spheres, but it was also formerly used in the same sense as the singular in Biblical language, as a translation of Heb. pl. Shamayim. Heavenly &quot;beautiful, divine&quot; is from 1460, often (though not originally) with reference to the celestial &quot;music of the spheres;&quot; weakened sense of &quot;excellent, enjoyable&quot; is first recorded 1874.

:actually, why does the atheist viewpoint need its own section or even representation? it's implicit in atheism that it rejects heaven (and a plenitude of other concepts associated with religion and faith). there's an article on [[Atheism]] for the very purpose of describing what atheism is. does the atheism article include rebuttals of it by the faithful? nope. the atheism section has no place here.

== John did not go to heaven when he died? ==

I read this in Jehovah's Witnesses section:

&quot;Matt. 11:11: “Truly I say to you people, Among those born of women there has not been raised up a greater than John the Baptist; but a person that is a lesser one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is.” (So John did not go to heaven when he died.)&quot;

????

Notice: Jesus’ words here are: “Among those born of women there has not been raised up a greater than John the Baptist; but a person that is a lesser one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is.” Notice that Jesus is speaking in the present tense. He is not speaking of John the Baptist’s final position. He is speaking about current blessings. While at times the Kingdom is spoken of as future, it is also spoken of as present. (Compare Colossians 1:13 where it says God has “transferred” [past tense] Christians into the Kingdom. See also Matthew 12:28; Mark 10:15; Luke 17:20, 21.) Jesus inaugurated the Kingdom. John the Baptist had no part in that, except to introduce Jesus. So those who would be following Jesus (and thus be in the Kingdom) would be greater (more privileged) than John, who did not get involved with Jesus’ ministry. This verse says nothing about John the Baptist’s final destiny.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.92.94.64|78.92.94.64]] ([[User talk:78.92.94.64|talk]]) 11:02, 14 June 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Evolution of concepts of Heaven ==

As indicated in this article, there is no Jewish concept of Heaven. Therefore an explanation (or several if scholars disagree) needs to be provided for the emergence of the concept in the Christian, Islamic and Bahai faiths. Did it, for example, develop from Greek concepts of Heaven as the abode of the Gods - and from Plato's concept of the realm of Ideal Forms - following the Greek conquest of Israel in 320 BC?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/82.71.43.37|82.71.43.37]] ([[User talk:82.71.43.37|talk]]) 14:03, 15 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Location? ==

Given the extensive content about heaven, there is little detail about the location of heaven, and much of this article is dealing with an abstraction as if it were a real place, but without much detail about where this place actually is.  Given much in the article is about archaic notions of where heaven (we now know) isn't, it might be helpful to open up a section about the location, so that we are clear that there is no evidence that heaven is to be found anywhere. Otherwise we might be misleading readers into assuming that this place exists, which is not [[NPOV]].[[User:MishMich|Mish]] ([[User talk:MishMich|talk]]) 12:15, 26 May 2010 (UTC)

== Too Christianity-centric ==

The article probably needs clearing up. The article is too centered (and often implies that it is the only real religion) around Christianity despite this encyclopedia being secular. There is no great need for long paragraphs about heaven in each Christian denomination. All that is needed is a paragraph which gives the basic idea of the Christian heaven, much in the way that the Buddhist, Chinese and especially Hindu heavens only have basic paragraphs describing them despite the fact that you have as much, or more, denominations in these faiths. Cleaning up the article to make the Christian section a tad smaller would save space and make the article more fair and free of Christian bias.

Indeed, I personally think that the Christian section should be trimmed, and a link for Christian cosmology added instead, similar to how the other religions are not treated. As no one is challenging it, I think we should start trimming. The sections are all bad, but the Christian section is the worst due to the length of it compared to the others. It should be trimmed and then the whole article should be sourced. Infact I'll start sourcing it soon. This article is too bad.

Hi everyone, I have trimmed the section. I think it still needs to be cleaned up, but I think the length is just about right. Also I think the Hinduism section needs a lot of work.

[[User talk:Nakamura Mondo|Nakamura Mondo]], a word to the wise; as a newbie you need to go slower. So now what do you intend to do with all the hundreds of hours of other contributors material on [[Heaven (Christianity)]] which [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heaven&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=410972450&amp;oldid=410968074 you have suddenly deleted]? [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 15:28, 30 January 2011 (UTC)

As, I have stated, it needs a lot of work, however, the info left gives a brief and concise definition of the Christian concept of heaven. The slight differences between the sects is not as important and not worth whole sections. Re-add some details that you find relevant, but remember that if people want specific information, they can click the link at the stop and in the category itself.

And please do not use the ''newbie'' card, it is not very friendly. And in the end of the day, I am not that new, I just registered with this account after years of editing anonymously, and I am concern with the very pronounced Christian bias on this site. If Christianity deserves a very large section, so does Buddhism (with many more sects) and Hinduism.

This page is to give an overview of the beliefs in heaven, not an indepth look at the heaven of any specific religion. [[User:Nakamura Mondo|Nakamura Mondo]] ([[User talk:Nakamura Mondo|talk]]) 15:44, 30 January 2011 (UTC)

Of course I know how wikipedia works, I followed the rules. I deleted no information that is not contained in separate articles, even though the sources might have been different. As I kept saying, instead of insulting me, why not just get the information that is relevant and re-add parts of it here or anywhere else? I seem to be the only here who is concerned with the Christian bias, and I find the lack of concern from many here both frighten and un-encyclopedic. 

Instate of ganging up on me and criticizing my very, very valid elements, you should have just made a Christan (Heaven) article in the first place. And removing the work of about ''25-30'' (and I do not believe in that calculation, as most of the work seems to be by the same hand, and even had hallmarks, such as the unnecessarily long gaps between full stops and the next sentence) being wrong doesn't wash, because if something takes up too much space in the article, is irrelevant, unverified and un-needed, then it should be removed and either ditched completely or moved into another article.

I started to trim it because an enecyclopedia is meant to be fair, but the burden shouldn't have been left to me, which means your insults were not only unfriendly, but ran counter to the purpose of the encyclopedia. You cannot just say that I do not know the rules and that I did a ''bad thing'', when the burden of adding some elements and creation a new element is left to anyone who wants to do it, and in my first post I clearly stated that I merely trimmed it as a sort of guideline.

But now it is sorted, that is the last I'll talk about it, unless people turn this into a Christian POV again. [[User:Nakamura Mondo|Nakamura Mondo]] ([[User talk:Nakamura Mondo|talk]]) 09:34, 12 February 2011 (UTC)

== Heaven of Jesus ==

Jesus as I am aware of His teachings, Heaven to Him is fulfilling your daily cores accordingly within the realm of the Words of God in the essence of our spiritual father within us, not necessarily the physical father but the father who is with God in respect to all Creation which would be from within and from without of our self. 
&quot;Be perfect therefore, as your father in heaven is perfect.&quot; 
Heaven of Jesus is still as heaven just like what the Old Testament have laid out unto us for the final form of the Image that is with the father which is with firmament... 

In the realization of the firmament of the Old Testament, where the heaven below and the heaven above are as of the Creations are concerned, we can be aware of it to be called as Nature in respect to the state of mind we are having in due time. 

So, as for this post, we may say that this Heaven belongs to the Jesuits...  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/112.198.79.176|112.198.79.176]] ([[User talk:112.198.79.176|talk]]) 00:58, 28 June 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:I think the point is that, some months ago, by consensus, we branched the detailed descriptions of all the various viewpoints of Heaven that come under the umbrella of 'Christianity' into their own article, [[Heaven (Christianity)]].  Since we have a sub-article, we keep the information here as a minimal summary, and don't give any one sect a detailed description here, since we don't give all the other Christian denominations a detailed description of their doctrines here.  (We used to do that, before we had the subarticle -- but it made this article over-long, and took up half the page with Christianity, prompting complaints of undue bias.  That's why we made a dedicated subarticle.)
