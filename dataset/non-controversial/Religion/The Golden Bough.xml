'''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion''''' is a wide-ranging, comparative study of [[mythology]] and [[religion]], written by Scottish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[James George Frazer]] (1854–1941). It was first published in two volumes in 1890; and the third edition, published 1906–15, comprised twelve volumes. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes]]'' (1855). It offered a [[modernist]] approach to discussing religion, treating it dispassionately&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4., Magic and Religion: 'The dispassionate observer, whose studies have led him to plumb its depths, can hardly regard it otherwise than as a standing menace to civilisation.'&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Culture|cultural]] phenomenon rather than from a [[Theology|theological]] perspective. The impact of ''The Golden Bough'' on contemporary [[European literature]] was substantial.

==Subject matter==
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|left|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of the Golden Bough incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
''The Golden Bough'' attempts to define the shared elements of religious belief to scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, [[human sacrifice]], the [[dying god]], the [[scapegoat]] and many other symbols and practices which have influenced the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, Frazer, ed. &quot;The Golden Bough.&quot; London: Wordsworth, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[thesis]] is that old religions were [[fertility cult]]s that revolved around the [[worship]] of, and periodic [[sacrifice]] of, a [[sacred king]]. Specifically, that mankind progresses from [[Magic and religion|magic]] through [[religious belief]] to scientific thought.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, Frazer, ed. &quot;The Golden Bough.&quot; London: Wordsworth, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This thesis was concocted around Turner's picture of ''The Golden Bough'', a sacred grove where a certain tree grew day and night; a transfigured landscape in a dream-like vision of the little wood-land lake of [[Nemi]] -- &quot;Diana's Mirror&quot; where religious ceremonies and the &quot;fulfillment of vows&quot; of priests and kings were held.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Sir James. &quot;The Golden Bough.&quot; London: Wordsworth, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This king was the incarnation of a [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]], a [[solar deity]] who underwent a mystic [[marriage]] to a [[goddess]] of the Earth, who died at the harvest, and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend is central to almost all of the world's mythologies.

[[File:Mirror Judgement of Paris Louvre Bj1734.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Judgement of Paris|The Judgement of Paris]]'' - an Etruscan bronze-handled mirror of the fourth or third century BC that relates the often misunderstood myth as interpreted by Frazer, showing the three goddesses giving their apple or pomegranate to the new king who must kill the old king - ''Campana Collection, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Sully'']]
The germ for Frazer's thesis was the pre-Roman priest-king at the [[wiktionary:Fane|fane]] of [[Nemi]], who was murdered ritually by his successor:
:&quot;When I first put pen to paper to write ''The Golden Bough'' I had no conception of the magnitude of the voyage on which I was embarking; I thought only to explain a single rule of an ancient Italian priesthood.&quot; (''Aftermath'' p vi)

The book's title was taken from an incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', illustrated by the British artist [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]]: [[Aeneas]] and the [[Sibyl]] present the golden bough to the gatekeeper of [[Hades]] to gain admission.

==Reception==
The book scandalized the British public upon its first publication, because it included the [[Christianity|Christian]] story of [[Jesus]] in its comparative study, thus inviting an agnostic reading of the [[Lamb of God]] as a relic of a [[pagan]] religion. Frazer removed his analysis of the [[Crucifixion]] to a speculative appendix for the third edition, and it was entirely missing from the single-volume abridged edition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Its influence on the emerging discipline of [[anthropology]] was pervasive and undeniable. For example, [[Bronisław Malinowski]], stricken with [[tuberculosis]] shortly after receiving his [[doctorate]] in physics and mathematics, read Frazer's work in the original English to distract himself from his illness. &quot;No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hays, ''From Ape to Angel: An Informal History of Social Anthropology'', p. 314, cited in L. L. Langness, ''The Study of Culture'' (Corte Madera: Chandler &amp; Sharp, 1974), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite whatever controversy the work may have generated, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, ''The Golden Bough'' had a tremendous effect on the literature of the period. [[Robert Graves]] adapted Frazer's concept of the dying king who is sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet's necessary suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess in his Frazer-esque book on poetry, rituals, and myths ''[[The White Goddess]]'', which was published in 1948. [[William Butler Yeats]] makes reference to it in his poem &quot;[[Sailing to Byzantium]]&quot;. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] mentions the book in his short story &quot;[[The Call of Cthulhu]]&quot;. [[T. S. Eliot]] acknowledged indebtedness to Frazer in his first note to his poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''. [[William Carlos Williams]] references it as well in Book Two, part two, of his extended poem in five books  ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]''. [[Sigmund Freud]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Gaddis]], [[Mary Renault]], [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Roger Zelazny]], [[Naomi Mitchison]] (in her ''The Corn King and the Spring Queen''), and [[Camille Paglia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |page=114 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the authors deeply influenced by ''The Golden Bough''. Its literary impact has given it continued life, even as its direct influence in anthropology has waned.

==Critical analysis==
The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] returned time and again to ''The Golden Bough'', often enough that his commentaries have been compiled as ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'', edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967, with the English edition following in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt Phil.uni-passau.de]&lt;/ref&gt; He writes, &quot;Frazer is much more savage than most of these savages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein, Ludwig]], ''Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weston LaBarre]] made the observation that Frazer was &quot;the last of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]]&quot;, and wrote ''The Golden Bough'' &quot;as an extended footnote to a line in [[Virgil]] he felt he did not understand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Animal'' (Chicago, 1954), cited in Langness, ''The Study of Culture'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern criticism sets Frazer in the broader context of the [[history of ideas]], for example, Robert Ackerman in his ''The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists''. The [[myth and ritual school]] includes scholars [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[F. M. Cornford]], and [[Arthur Bernard Cook|A.B. Cook]], who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the nineteenth century.  This school was an important influence on a great deal of [[Modernism|Modernist literature]].
