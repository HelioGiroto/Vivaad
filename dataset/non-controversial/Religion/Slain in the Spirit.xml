&quot;'''Slain in the Spirit'''&quot; is a term used in [[charismatic Christianity]] to describe a religious behaviour in which an individual falls to the floor.&lt;ref name='NIDPCM &quot;slain&quot;'&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Stanley M, and Eduard M van der Maas|title=The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements s.v. “Slain in the Spirit”|year=2002|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=0-310-22481-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usually happens during an event they perceive as a personal encounter with the [[Holy Spirit]], often associated with the practice of [[laying on of hands]]. 

==Description==
Being slain in the Spirit is a practice where on occasions of public prayer ministry when, in following the direction of the scriptures, laying on of hands is practiced, church members or attendees may come forward to the front of the church (or in other gatherings not necessarily in a church service or building) to receive a special work of the [[Holy Spirit]] from the [[Pastor]], service leader or a team of ministers.&lt;ref name=Chaos&gt;{{cite book|last=MacArthur Jr|first=Dr John F|title=Charismatic Chaos: Signs and Wonders; Speaking in Tongues; Health, Wealth and Prosperity|year=1993|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|91}} Often a significant amount of time is spent singing and praying during the church service before this point.  Attendees are then prayed over and touched by the service leader or leaders. They perceive the Spirit of God upon them, and they fall, usually onto their backs.&lt;ref name=Sacred&gt;{{cite book|last=Csordas|first=Thomas J.|title=The Sacred Self: A Cultural Phenomenology of Charismatic Healing|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|235}} In most cases, their fall is broken by [[deacons]], catchers, ushers or orderlies behind them to prevent injury.  Beliefs associated with this phenomenon include [[divine healing]], receiving visions, being set free of demonic spirits, hearing God speak. 

As Thomas Csordas says: &quot;In Charismatic ritual life, resting in the Spirit can serve the purposes of demonstrating divine power; of exhibiting the faith of those who are &quot;open&quot; to such power; of allowing a person to be close to, &quot;touched by,&quot; or &quot;spoken to&quot; by God (sometimes via embodied imagery); of preparing a person to receive and exercise a [[spiritual gift]]; or of healing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sacred /&gt;{{rp|247}}

==History==
Being slain in the Spirit was extremely common in early American (late eighteenth-century) [[Methodism]], particularly at camp meetings and love feasts. Other names for the phenomenon are &quot;falling over&quot;, &quot;falling under the Spirit's power&quot;, &quot;falling before the Lord&quot;, &quot;slain under the power&quot; or &quot;resting in the Spirit&quot;.

==Biblical background==
Whether voluntary or involuntary, &quot;falling before the Lord&quot; as a human response to the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is seen by many [[charismatics]] as a phenomenon that is in harmony with the Scriptures.  In the [[Bible]], falling while in the [[presence of God]] was at times also accompanied by manifestations of trembling, convulsions, writhing, physical weakness or deep sleep.

Instances of voluntarily falling before the Lord to worship or pray may be found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 17:3 and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 5:14.  References to voluntarily falling as the result of feeling overwhelmed by a divine presence are found in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22:31, [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 13:20, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 1:28, Ezekiel 3:23, Ezekiel 43:3, Ezekiel 44:4, [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 8:17 and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 17:6. However, these verses seem to imply falling forward in humility, and it would seem there are no verses to imply falling upon being touched by someone.
But there is one passage in the Bible where people &quot;fall to the ground&quot; just by hearing the words &quot;I am He&quot;. That is when Judas has betrayed Jesus and the soldiers come to get Jesus. This is what it says in John 18:4-6; (4) 'Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would come upon Him, went forward and said to them &quot;Whom are you seeking?&quot; (5) They answered Him, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; Jesus said to them &quot;I am He.&quot; And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them. (6) Now when He said to them &quot;I am He,&quot; they drew back and '''fell to the ground.'''' (NKJV) But this passage is not really the same thing that Charismatic Christians practice.  And, there is much debate as to whether their &quot;fall&quot; was a response to the Holy Spirit.

Instances of involuntarily falling before the Lord as the result of feeling overwhelmed by a divine presence are found in [[1 Kings]] 8:10-11, Daniel 8:27, Daniel 10:8-11 (possibly implied), [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9:3-4 (also Acts 26:14) and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 1:17.

Both voluntary and involuntary falling before the Lord can also occur as the result of a power encounter&amp;mdash;a person feels that the power of God is overtaking the power of a [[demon]]ic force that has sought to control or oppress him or her.  References to falling in the context of power encounters are found in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 3:11, Mark 9:20 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 8:28

==Criticism==
Some Christians argue that the practice is neither described nor prescribed specifically in the Bible, and that it is, at best, a psychological phenomenon or, at worst, of [[satan]]ic  origin. &lt;ref name=Chaos /&gt;{{rp|91}} [[David Pawson]] points out&lt;ref&gt;Is the Blessing Biblical?, 1996, David Pawson, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, ISBN 0-340-66147-X&lt;/ref&gt; that the closest Biblical reference is the story of [[Ananias and Sapphira]], which has a quite different connotation.

==Sociology of religion==
Other sources of the phenomenon can be [[autosuggestion]], peer pressure, or a desire to experience what others have experienced.&lt;ref name='NIDPCM &quot;slain&quot;' /&gt; Perhaps the most obvious sociological category is the &quot;possession trance.&quot;&lt;ref name='NIDPCM &quot;slain&quot;' /&gt; A similar state that could be described as [[religious ecstasy]] may occur in the rituals and dances of other religious and cultural traditions; for example [[Kundalini]] awakening through [[shaktipat]].

==References in culture==
The 1967 film ''[[Holy Ghost People]]'' by [[Peter Adair]] documented an [[Appalachia|Appalachian]] [[Pentecostal]] church service in which several people are slain in the spirit.
