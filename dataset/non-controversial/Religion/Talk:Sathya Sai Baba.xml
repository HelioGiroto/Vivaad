== India Today Special Edition &quot;DIVINE GRACE: SATHYA SAI BABA&quot; ==

I think when we are writing for India Today which published some unfprtunate misunderstandings for Sathya Sai Baba we should also include the Special Edition published by India Today this year 2012. India Today has done various researches and contacted many world famous scientists and colected the proof of genuine miracle and divine aura and powers of sathya sai baba and then published this Special Edition which had a record breaking sale this year around Febuary.
I think wikipedia should include this also because it contains all the proofs as well for SAI BABA's Love, sacrifice, and Aura around Him.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/122.163.211.244|122.163.211.244]] ([[User talk:122.163.211.244|talk]]) 05:18, 19 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:I cannot find it on their website. What you say sound quite unlikely because how is the [[India Today]] magazine going to reconcile a positive article with the extremely serious accusations that they have levelled at SBB in their &lt;s&gt;2001&lt;/s&gt; December 2000 article &quot;A God Accused&quot;.

I would like to add that this is not an sponsored edition but India Today publishes its Special Editions quaterly and that is not given on their websites. Moreover due to its maximum sale thay have also printed its Hindi edition &quot;Eashwariya Kripa sathya SAI Baba&quot; So this is not an sponsored edition.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/144.160.226.53|144.160.226.53]] ([[User talk:144.160.226.53|talk]]) 08:47, 22 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Secondary (and also academic) coverage of the BBC documentary, Rahm trial and much more ==

I see that knowledge of Tulasi Srinivas' extensive work on SSB was missing around here. Besides his 2010 book which I've added to further reading, he also wrote a chapter in India Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic, vol. 2. Both cover the sexual healing/abuse issue in appropriate depth: [http://books.google.com/books?id=VVxlfDHGTFYC&amp;pg=PA615 p. 615 in the encyc chapter], and quite extensive in the full book, including devotee responses pp. 16-18, 229-234 and 252-293. If you want to cite the Rahm trial result (while avoiding the Daily Pioneer op-ed), it's on [http://books.google.com/books?id=1lHQSVPQgS4C&amp;pg=PA252 p. 252]. This should put to rest the wrestling over the documentary/news sources over this (BBC and Daily Pioneer) which has consumed extensive if not downright excessive space in the archives of this talk page, RSN, etc. [[User:Tijfo098|Tijfo098]] ([[User talk:Tijfo098|talk]]) 10:03, 30 August 2012 (UTC)

: This is a good source on this particular topic, I vote we include exerts from this book on this topic in this article. Though its authority in other matters (such as it's presentation and justification of oiling allegations as having occured when the organization has clarified that such slander does not occur is simply the work of Anti-Sai activists) leaves much to be desired on its overall authority. [[Special:Contributions/75.124.71.226|75.124.71.226]] ([[User talk:75.124.71.226|talk]]) 15:02, 7 September 2012 (UTC)

I should add that Tulasi's chapter on the controversies surrounding SSB was particularly well received in the [[h-net]] review [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=31068]: &quot;Among the strongest material in Winged Faith, where the ethnographic materials and theoretical interventions come together and offer an altogether unexpected analysis, is chapter 5, “Secrecy, Ambiguity, Truth, and Power.” Srinivas introduces in some detail the “scandal” of four men’s deaths in SSB’s private ashram quarters. She outlines what is known about the 1993 “June incident” and then allows her interlocutors to speak for themselves. [...]&quot;. There are numerous other academic reviews of her book: {{doi|10.1111/j.1548-1425.2012.01374_22.x}} {{doi|10.1007/s12115-011-9492-x}} (by [[Bryan S. Turner]] - praises it as an &quot;excellent study of modern religious charisma&quot;), {{doi|10.1093/jhs/his024}}, {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9655.2011.01698_28.x}}, {{doi|10.1111/j.1748-0922.2011.01543_5.x}}, etc. Her book also gets quoted extensively in [http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/viewFile/68/112 this fascinating article on 'Guru Logics'], which classifies SSB as among &quot;type 1 gurus, whose appeal is critically dependent on the miracles they are said to perform&quot;.
