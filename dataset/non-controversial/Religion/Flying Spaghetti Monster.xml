The '''Flying Spaghetti Monster''' ('''FSM''') is the [[deity]] of the '''Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster''' or '''Pastafarianism''', a [[Religious satire|satirical]] movement that promotes a light-hearted view of religion and opposes the teaching of [[intelligent design]] and [[creationism]] in public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt; Although adherents state that Pastafarianism is a genuine religion,&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/?page_id=2|title=About|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|work=The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally recognized by the media as a &lt;!-- we have a large number of reliable sources for this.

The &quot;Flying Spaghetti Monster&quot; was first described in a [[Religious satire|satirical]] [[open letter]] written by Bobby Henderson in 2005 to protest the [[Kansas evolution hearings|Kansas State Board of Education decision]] to permit teaching intelligent design as an alternative to [[evolution]] in public school science classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; In that letter, Henderson parodied the concept of intelligent design by professing belief in a supernatural [[Creator deity|creator]] that closely resembles [[Spaghetti with meatballs|spaghetti and meatballs]]. Henderson argued that his beliefs and intelligent design were equally valid, and called for Flying Spaghetti Monsterism to be allotted equal time in science classrooms alongside intelligent design and evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;openletter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Henderson, Bobby |year=2005 |title=Open Letter To Kansas School Board |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/ |publisher=Venganza.org |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070407182624/http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/ |archivedate=2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Henderson published the letter on his website, the Flying Spaghetti Monster rapidly became an [[Internet phenomenon]] and a symbol used against teaching intelligent design in public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/arts/design/29mons.html?ex=1178251200 |title=But Is There Intelligent Spaghetti Out There?|accessdate=2007-02-05|work=[[The New York Times]] Arts article|first=Sarah |last=Boxer |date=2005-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pastafarian &quot;beliefs&quot; are generally satires of creationism. They are presented both on Henderson's ''Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'' website, where he is described as &quot;prophet&quot;, and in ''[[The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]]'', written by Henderson and published by Villiard Press in 2006. The central belief is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. [[Piracy|Pirates]] are revered as the original Pastafarians (a [[portmanteau]] of [[pasta]] and [[Rastafarian]]),&lt;ref name=alarabiya&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/07/13/157427.html |title=Austrian Pastafarian dons colander as religious headgear for drivers license |first= |last= |work=english.alarabiya.net |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Henderson asserts that the steady decline in the number of pirates over the years has resulted in [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;openletter&quot;/&gt; The FSM community currently congregates at Henderson's website to share ideas and crafts devoted to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Because of its popularity and exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as a contemporary version of [[Russell's teapot]] – an argument that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon those who make [[unfalsifiable]] claims, not on those who reject them. While generally praised by the media and endorsed by members of the scientific community, the Flying Spaghetti Monster has received criticism from proponents of the creationist intelligent design philosophy. Self-described Pastafarians have engaged in religious disputes, including in [[Polk County, Florida]], where they played a role in dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.&lt;ref name=Polk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2007/dec/22/na-polk-needled-noodled-in-evolution-flap/ |title=Polk Needled, Noodled In Evolution Flap |accessdate=2007-12-23 |author=Billy Townsend |date=2007-12-22 |work= |publisher=The Tampa Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country, and eventually the world; one third time for Intelligent Design, one third time for Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence.|Bobby Henderson&lt;ref name=&quot;openletter&quot;/&gt;}}
According to Henderson, since the intelligent design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot; /&gt; Henderson explained, &quot;I don't have a problem with religion. What I have a problem with is religion posing as science. If there is a god&lt;!-- note: Original source does use non-capitalized &quot;god.&quot; I decided against using {{sic}} here because it is an arguable, albeit unlikely use (not a pronoun) that does not really affect clarity --&gt; and he's intelligent, then I would guess he has a sense of humor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;randi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/200509/091605church.html#1 |title=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster |accessdate=2007-02-05 |work=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] article September 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Escapist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_142/3048-In-His-Name-We-Pray-Ramen.5|title=In His Name We Pray, Ramen|last=Pitts|first=Russ|date=2005-09-16|work=Escapist magazine|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, having received no reply from the Kansas State Board of Education, Henderson posted the letter on his website, gaining significant public interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;openletterabout&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Discussion of the Open Letter |publisher=Henderson, Bobby |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/discussion/ |accessdate=2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/?page_id=2|title=About|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|work=The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Pastafarianism became an Internet phenomenon.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; Henderson published the responses he then received from board members.&lt;ref name=&quot;openletterrespond&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Kansas School Board Responses to the Open Letter |publisher=Henderson, Bobby |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/responses/ |year = 2005 |month = June 25 |accessdate=2006-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three board members, all of whom opposed the curriculum amendments, responded positively; a fourth board member responded with the comment &quot;It is a serious offense to mock God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A18740559#back3|title=The Flying Spaghetti Monster|date=2007-02-01|work=h2g2|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson has also published the significant amount of hate mail, including death threats, that he has received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/31/fsm-hate-mail.html|title=FSM hate mail|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|date=2006-07-31|work=BoingBoing|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/sciencetech/article/168629|title=In praise of an alternate creation theory: The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster gains infamy and faith|date=2007-01-07|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=31 December 2009 |first=Leslie |last=Scrivener}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one year of sending the open letter, Henderson received thousands of emails on the Flying Spaghetti Monster, eventually totaling over 60,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Comment&quot;/&gt; of which he has said that &quot;about 95 percent have been supportive, while the other five percent have said I am going to hell&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt; During that time, his site garnered tens of millions of hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter-discussion/|title=Comment on the Open Letter|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|date=2006-08|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As word of Henderson's challenge to the board spread, his website and cause received more attention and support. The satirical nature of Henderson's argument made the Flying Spaghetti Monster popular with [[blog]]gers as well as humor and Internet culture websites.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,371205,00.html |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2007-09-08 |quote=[FSM] has certainly caught the imagination of the online community [...] Henderson receives over 150 emails from supporters every day. |title=A Tangled Tale of a Pasta-based Prophet }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flying Spaghetti Monster was featured on websites such as [[Boing Boing]], [[Something Awful]], [[Uncyclopedia]], and [[Fark.com]]. Moreover, an International Society for Flying Spaghetti Monster Awareness and other fan sites emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ha Ha, Only Serious&quot; /&gt; As public awareness grew, the mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Flying Spaghetti Monster became a symbol for the case against intelligent design in public education.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Flying Spaghetti Monster |date=August 6, 2005 |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |url=http://www.newscientist.com/backpage.ns?id=mg18725112.800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Rothschild |title=Evolution debate creates monster |date=August 24, 2005 |work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/aug/24/evolution_debate_creates_monster/?education }}&lt;/ref&gt; The open letter was printed in many large newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Comment&quot; /&gt; and received &quot;worldwide press attention&quot; according to one journalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph2&quot; /&gt; Henderson himself was surprised by its success, stating that he &quot;wrote the letter for [his] own amusement as much as anything&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-03-26-spaghetti-monster_x.htm |title=&quot;Spaghetti Monster&quot; is noodling around with faith |accessdate=2007-02-05 |work=[[USA Today]] Science &amp; Space article |first1=Dan |last1=Vergano |date=2006-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, in response to a challenge from a reader, [[Boing Boing]] announced a $250,000 prize—later raised to $1,000,000—of &quot;Intelligently Designed currency&quot; payable to any individual who could produce [[empiricism|empirical evidence]] proving that [[Jesus]] is not the son of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name=&quot;prize&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Boing Boing's $250,000 Intelligent Design challenge |publisher = BoingBoing.net |url=http://boingboing.net/2005/08/19/boing-boings-250000.html |year = 2005 |month = August 19 |accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was modeled as a parody of a [[Kent Hovind#Hovind's $250,000 offer|similar challenge]] issued by [[Young Earth creationism|young-Earth creationist]] [[Kent Hovind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind.html#appendix1 |title=Dr. Hovind's $250,000 Offer |author=Kent Hovind |accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot; /&gt;

According to Henderson, newspaper articles on the Flying Spaghetti Monster attracted the attention of book publishers; he said that at one point, there were six publishers interested in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comment&quot; /&gt; In November 2005, Henderson received an advance from [[Villard (imprint)|Villard]] to write ''[[The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorkmag&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Wolff |title=The Case For Intelligent Design: Spaghetti as the Creator |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=November 16, 2005 |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the Kansas State Board of Education voted to allow criticisms of evolution, including language about intelligent design, as part of testing standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Kansas Education Board First to Back &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; |date=November 9, 2005 |work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/08/AR2005110801211.html |first=Peter |last=Slevin |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 13, 2007, the board voted 6–4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.

Although Henderson has stated that &quot;the only dogma allowed in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the rejection of dogma&quot;, some general &quot;beliefs&quot; are held by Pastafarians.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot; /&gt;  Henderson proposed many Pastafarian tenets in reaction to common arguments by proponents of intelligent design.&lt;ref name=gelf&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Thierman |title=Touched by his Noodly Appendage |date=September 18, 2005 |publisher=Gelf Magazine |url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/mt/archives/touched_by_his_noodly_appendage.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; These &quot;[[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] beliefs&quot; are presented by Henderson in his letter to the Kansas State Board of Education,&lt;ref name=&quot;openletter&quot; /&gt; ''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', and on Henderson's web site, where he is described as a &quot;prophet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;flashguide&quot; /&gt; They tend to satirize creationism.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;/&gt;

===Creation===
The central [[creation myth]] is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the [[universe]] &quot;after drinking heavily&quot;. According to these beliefs, the Monster's intoxication was the cause for a flawed [[Earth]]. Furthermore, according to Pastafarianism, all evidence for evolution was planted by the Flying Spaghetti Monster in an effort to test the faith of Pastafarians—parodying certain [[Biblical inerrancy|biblical literalists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GOLEM&quot; /&gt; When scientific measurements such as [[radiocarbon dating]] are taken, the Flying Spaghetti Monster &quot;is there changing the results with His Noodly Appendage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;openletter&quot;/&gt; The Pastafarian conception of [[Heaven]] includes a [[beer]] volcano and a [[stripper]] factory.&lt;ref name=&quot;flashguide&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=DuBay, Tim |year=2005|title=Guide to Pastafarianism |format=Shockwave Flash|url=http://www.venganza.org/flash/guidetopastafarianismpreloaded.swf |accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pastafarian [[Hell]] is similar, except that the beer is stale and the strippers have [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;hell&quot;&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pirates and global warming===
[[File:PiratesVsTemp(en).svg|thumb|300px|A chart, included in the open letter, illustrating the relationship between pirates and global temperature]]

According to Pastafarian &quot;beliefs&quot;, [[pirates]] are &quot;absolute divine beings&quot; and the original Pastafarians.&lt;ref name=&quot;openletter&quot; /&gt; Furthermore, Pastafarians believe that the concept of pirates as &quot;thieves and outcasts&quot; is misinformation spread by Christian theologians in the [[Middle Ages]] and by [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]]. Instead, Pastafarians believe that they were &quot;peace-loving explorers and spreaders of good will&quot; who distributed candy to small children, adding that modern pirates are in no way similar to &quot;the fun-loving buccaneers from history&quot;. In addition, Pastafarians believe that ghost pirates are responsible for all of the mysteriously lost ships and planes of the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Pastafarians celebrate [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]] on September 19.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of pirates in Pastafarianism was part of Henderson's original letter to the Kansas State Board of Education, in an effort to illustrate that [[correlation does not imply causation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Volcano&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Savino|first=John |coauthors=Marie D. Jones|title=Supervolcano: The Catastrophic Event That Changed the Course of Human History: Could Yellowstone Be Next|publisher=Career Press|year=2007|page=56|chapter=Wrath of the Gods|isbn=978-1-56414-953-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tSIa0VQn1NQC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;dq=Flying+Spaghetti+Monster#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson presented the argument that &quot;[[global warming]], earthquakes, hurricanes, and other [[natural disaster]]s are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;openletter&quot;/&gt; A chart accompanying the letter (with numbers humorously disordered on the ''x''-axis) shows that as the number of pirates decreased, global temperatures increased. This parodies the suggestion from some religious groups that the high numbers of disasters, famines, and wars in the world is due to the lack of respect and worship toward their deity. In 2008, Henderson interpreted the growing pirate activities at the [[Gulf of Aden]] as additional support, pointing out that [[Somalia]] has &quot;the highest number of pirates ''and'' the lowest [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] of any country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venganza.org/2008/04/14/somalia/ |title=Somalia&amp;nbsp;— Lots of pirates, low carbon emissions |accessdate=10 December 2008 |work= |publisher=www.venganza.org |date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holidays===

Pastafarian beliefs extend into lighthearted religious ceremony. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;/&gt; Prayers are concluded with a final declaration of affirmation, &quot;R'amen&quot;; the term is a parodic [[portmanteau]] of the [[Semitic]] term &quot;[[Amen]]&quot; and &quot;[[ramen]]&quot;, referring to the [[instant noodles]] popular among college students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = In the beginning there was the Flying Spaghetti Monster |date=September 11, 2005 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2009-12-19|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1498162/In-the-beginning-there-was-the-Flying-Spaghetti-Monster.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of [[Christmas]], [[Hanukkah]], and [[Kwanzaa]], Pastafarians celebrate a vaguely defined [[Religious holiday|holiday]] named &quot;Holiday&quot;. Holiday does not take place on &quot;a specific date so much as it is the Holiday season, itself&quot;. Because Pastafarians &quot;reject dogma and formalism&quot;, there are no specific requirements for Holiday. Pastafarians celebrate Holiday in any manner they please.&lt;ref name=&quot;holiday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/2006/12/01/happy-holiday-season-everyone/|title= Happy Holiday Season Everyone|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|date=2006-12-01|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastafarians also celebrate &quot;Pastover&quot; as a parody of [[Passover]],&lt;ref name=&quot;FSM Holidays&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=203909|title=Questions on FSM Holidays|year=2008|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pastover&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=14602|title=A question about Pastover|year=2010|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/atheologies/4876/austrian_court_oks_head-colander_in_driver%E2%80%99s_license%3A_is_pastafarianism_becoming_a_religion RD Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Ramendan&quot; as a parody of [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramendan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=357996|title=Ramendan|year=2008|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.elpais.com%2Fel-comidista%2F2011%2F07%2Fpastafarismo-religion-ateismo.html El Pais]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/117202/pastafarian-wins-the-right-to-wear-spaghetti-strainer-for-his-drivers-license-photo/ Death and Taxes magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastafarians interpret the [[Christmas controversy|increasing usage of &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;]], rather than more traditional greetings (such as &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;), as support for Pastafarianism.&lt;ref name=holiday /&gt; In December 2005, [[George W.

In December 2005 Bobby Henderson received a reported [[US$]]80,000 advance from Villard to write ''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster''. Henderson said he planned to use proceeds from the book to build a pirate ship, with which he would spread the Pastafarian religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorkmag&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katleen |last=Craig |title=Passion of the Spaghetti Monster |date=December 22, 2005 |publisher=Wired News |url=http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2005/12/69905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released on March 28, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812976564|title=The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborates on Pastafarian beliefs established in the open letter.&lt;ref name = &quot;Austin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A356663|title=The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|last=Brenner|first=Wayne|date=2006-04-14|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson employs satire to present perceived flaws with evolutionary biology and discusses history and lifestyle from a Pastafarian perspective.

''[[Scientific American]]'' described the gospel as &quot;an elaborate spoof on Intelligent Design&quot; and &quot;very funny&quot;.

===''The Loose Canon''===
In September 2005, before Henderson had received a grant to write the ''Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', a Pastafarian member of the Venganza forums known as Solipsy, announced the beginning of a project to collect texts from fellow Pastafarians to compile into the ''Loose Canon, a Holy Book of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', essentially analogous to the Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Big Announcement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=1899|title=The Big Announcement|year=2005|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was completed and made available for free download in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Site of the Loose Canon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsm-consortium.com/official-site-of-the-loose-canon/|title=Official Site of the Loose Canon|year=2010|publisher=fsm-consortium.com|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a cultural phenomenon===
The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster now consists of thousands of followers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Volcano&quot; /&gt; primarily concentrated on college campuses and in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academics&quot; /&gt; According to the [[Associated Press]], Henderson's website has become &quot;a kind of cyber-watercooler for opponents of intelligent design&quot;. On it, visitors track meetings of pirate-clad Pastafarians, sell trinkets and bumper stickers, and sample photographs that show &quot;visions&quot; of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,311925,00.html|title=Religious Scholars to Discuss 'Flying Spaghetti Monster'|date=2007-11-16|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the Swedish concept designer Niklas Jansson created an adaptation of Michelangelo's ''The Creation of Adam'', superimposing the Flying Spaghetti Monster over [[God]].

According to Justin Pope of the [[Associated Press]], {{quote|Between the lines, the point of the letter was this: there's no more scientific basis for intelligent design than there is for the idea an omniscient creature made of pasta created the universe.

Thus, the satire is possible because the Intelligent Design Movement hasn’t affiliated with a particular religion, exactly the opposite of what its other critics claim!&quot; He concluded that &quot;We are not worried that Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is going to lure away Christians...

In December 2007, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was credited with spearheading successful efforts in [[Polk County, Florida]] to dissuade the [[Polk County School Board]] from adopting new science standards on evolution. The issue was raised after five of the seven board members declared a personal belief in intelligent design. Opponents describing themselves as Pastafarians sent e-mails to members of the Polk County School Board demanding equal instruction time for the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Chambliss |title= Satirical Monsters More Competition for Darwin|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20071211/NEWS/712110392/0/FRONTPAGE |publisher=The Ledger |date=2007-12-11 |accessdate=2007-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Board member Margaret Lofton, who supported intelligent design, dismissed the e-mail as ridiculous and insulting, stating, &quot;they've made us the laughing stock of the world.&quot; Lofton later stated that she had no interest in engaging with the Pastafarians or anyone else seeking to discredit intelligent design. As the controversy developed, scientists expressed their opposition to the claims of intelligent design. Hopes for a new campus focused on applied science at the [[University of South Florida]] in northeast Lakeland were reportedly in question, but the university vice president, Marshall Goodman, expressed surprise, stating, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[intelligent design is]&lt;/nowiki&gt; not science. You can't even call it [[pseudo-science]].&quot; While unhappy with the outcome, Lofton chose not to resign over the issue. She and the other board members expressed a desire to return to the day-to-day work of running the school district.&lt;ref name=Polk/&gt;

In March 2007, Bryan Killian, a [[high school]] student in [[Buncombe County]] in [[North Carolina]], was suspended for wearing &quot;pirate regalia&quot; which he said was part of his Pastafarian faith. Killian protested the suspension, saying it violated his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] rights to [[religious freedom]] and [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770328123|title=School: Pirates are not welcome|last=Schrader|first=Jordan|date=2007-03-29|work=Citizen-Times|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;If this is what I believe in, no matter how stupid it might sound, I should be able to express myself however I want to,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Escapist&quot; /&gt; However, the school denied that Killian's faith played a role in his suspension, instead citing classroom disruption and insubordination as causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/43272-student-punished-for-spaghetti-beliefs|title=Student punished for spaghetti beliefs|date=2007-03-29|work=Metro|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2008, Pastafarians in [[Crossville, Tennessee]], were permitted to place a Flying Spaghetti Monster statue in a free speech zone on the [[Courthouse]] lawn, and proceeded to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flying Spaghetti Monster statue at Tennessee courthouse |publisher = CNET Networks, |url=http://www.news.com/8301-13772_3-9906870-52.html?tag=nefd.only|year = 2008 |month = April|accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The display gained national interest on blogs and Internet news sites and appeared in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. It was later removed from the premises, along with all other long-term statues, in an effort sparked mainly by controversy over the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crossville-chronicle.com/cnhi/crossvillechronicle/homepage/local_story_106193650.html?keyword=leadpicturestory|title=Courthouse No Longer Hosting Free Speech Displays|last=Nelson|first=Gary|date=2008-04-15|work=The Crossville Chronicle|accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2011, an [[Austria]]n atheist, Niko Alm, won the legal right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a [[Colander|pasta strainer]] on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons.&lt;ref name=alarabiya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Austrian driver allowed 'pastafarian' headgear photo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14135523|accessdate=26 July 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|last=Alm|first=N.|url=http://blog.alm.at|title=Heiliger Führerschein (transl: Holy License)|date=2011-07-12|work=Niko Alm |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2012, Pastafarian Giorgos Loizos was arrested in Greece on charges of malicious [[blasphemy]] and offense of religion for the creation of a satirical [[Facebook page]] called &quot;[[Elder Pastitsios]]&quot;, based on a well-known deceased [[Greek Orthodox]] monk, [[Elder Paisios of Mount Athos|Elder Paisios]], where his name and face were substituted with [[pastitsio]] – a local pasta and [[béchamel sauce]] dish. The case, which started as a Facebook [[Flaming (Internet)|flame]], reached the [[Greek Parliament]] and created a strong political reaction to the arrest.&lt;ref name=police&gt;{{cite web
