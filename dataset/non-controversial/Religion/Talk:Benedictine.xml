==Thoughts==
a) This article has potential ...

b) Re: the link to &quot;Benedictine Sisters&quot;. Is the article on this subject being proposed for reasons of political correctness (in which case, does Wiki really need it), or is it meant to throw light on the peculiar situation of e.g. the Tyburn nuns and the Grace and Compassion Sisters (in which case can someone please [start to] write it)?

c) &quot;Movement&quot; and &quot;groups&quot; are not the terms of choice in this context (please see: Talk &quot;Order of St Benedict&quot;).

d) As regards the dawn of a new &quot;Benedictine era&quot;. I admit to wearing blinkers. So please forgive the question: is this usage current in any relevant sources? If so, which ones, please?

:I've done a little copyediting to tighten things up.  I would like to suggest that the second and third paragraphs be moved to OSB or RB; since this article is now essentially an elaborate disambiguation page, does it really need to be so extensive?  [[User:JHCC|JHCC]] 14:12, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

Dear JHCC: So kind of you always to tidy up! Much appreciated! Yes, the article has taken a different shape, as so much material, quite rightly, has been moved elsewhere; and so it now ought to be tidied up accordingly. - Re: second para: maybe in italics? - As regards the third para: I first thought that it was a joke. It seems journalese to me, perhaps inspired by admiration for the new pope. Whilst I have previously tinkered with said para, I'd much rather not see it around anywhere when I visit next.

::e) This article had little information... &lt;small&gt;—This [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment is by [[User:71.16.95.43|71.16.95.43]] ([[User talk:71.16.95.43|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/71.16.95.43|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- [Template:Unsigned] --&gt;

==Link==
Would you consider adding my community's web site to your external links list? It is a content-rich site with several articles about Benedictine Sisters. It is: Sisters of St. Benedict/St. Mary Monastery Rock Island, IL at http://www.smmsisters.org Thanks. [[User:Seflans|Seflans]] 23:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)


==Merge==
Merge this with [[Order of Saint Benedict]]. Why are there two pages for the same order? -- [[User:Secisek|SECisek]] 20:15, 9 August 2007 (UTC)
:As a starter, I would suggest putting the bulk of this as a subsection in the article &quot;Order of St. Benedict.&quot; Have a redirect from here. Simply merge the other stuff, references, etc. for now. [[User:Student7|Student7]] 21:39, 9 August 2007 (UTC)
:While I certainly support a merge. I would strongly suggest the other way around; that the information in Order of St. Benedict article be merged to this article (Benedictine). As indicated there, the term Order, while in common use (such as in the postnominal letters OSB) is misleading in suggesting that there is a centralised organisation (when in fact there is only a loose federation between congregations, which are themselves generally loose federations between independent monastic houses). Any information about Benedictine history, the vows they take, etc., would be better included under the article title &quot;Benedictine&quot;. [[User:Robotforaday|Robotforaday]] ([[User talk:Robotforaday|talk]]) 01:51, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

*'''Strongly Oppose''' I have to oppose the merger. The term Benedictine refers not only to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]], but also to the various reforms of the order, such as the [[Cistercians]] and [[Trappists]], who also follow the [[Rule of St Benedict]]. I'd be happy to take on the project of editing [[Benedictine]] so that it reflects Benedictines as a whole and not the [[Order of Saint Benedict]], which does, and should, have its own article.
