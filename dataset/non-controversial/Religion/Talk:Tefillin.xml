== hairs sticking out of rosh ==

The hairs that stick out of the front of the tefillin are not made out of the sinews that bind the tefillin closed as this article says. It is made out of the tail hairs of a cow, which are wound around the scrolls on the inside. The hairs that stick out of the front come from the Vehaya im shamoah section parsha and stick out of the front. In Rashi tefillin order they come out of the second hole from the left if you look at it from the front and in the Rabenu Tam they stick out of the third hole from the left. This is an easy way (as mentioned in this article) to see which type of order they are.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.124.220.141|69.124.220.141]] ([[User talk:69.124.220.141|talk]]) 13:21, 22 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Bible ==

In the beginning of the article, it is said that the box contains bible verses. Can this really be? Shouldn't the verses be from the torah? I apologise if it's  a stupid question.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Elpuellodiablo|Elpuellodiablo]] ([[User talk:Elpuellodiablo|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Elpuellodiablo|contribs]]) 19:22, 21 January 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

[[Tefillin]] → [[tefilla]] — Tefillin denotes prayers...these objects should be at [[tefilla]], just like dogs are at [[dog]]. [[User:DaAnHo|DaAnHo]] ([[User talk:DaAnHo|talk]]) 15:35, 14 November 2010 (UTC)

'''Oppose''' The move request indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the two concepts. Tefilla means &quot;prayer&quot;. Tefillin are &quot;phylacteries&quot;. One word is Hebrew, the other Aramaic. Yes, they are related, but so is the word dogged, and dog days of summer, and the dog star, and doggerel, none of those are dog, are they? -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] ([[User talk:Avraham|talk]]) 16:15, 14 November 2010 (UTC)
:Ok, so this page should be part of [[tefillah]].  Dogs on wikipedia are still at [[dog]].  [[User:DaAnHo|DaAnHo]] ([[User talk:DaAnHo|talk]]) 16:33, 14 November 2010 (UTC)
:Def. not trying to be a dick!  Just trying to say that if this page's title is plural for no other reason than &quot;that's how it was created&quot;, it should be changed to the singular form. [[User:DaAnHo|DaAnHo]] ([[User talk:DaAnHo|talk]]) 16:59, 14 November 2010 (UTC)
::I don't think you were trying to be annoying 8-), rather, it seems to me that you probably do not have much experience with either, as opposed to those of us answering here who likely have experience both for multiple decades for each of us. -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] ([[User talk:Avraham|talk]]) 20:13, 14 November 2010 (UTC)
:::I understand that there are differences in language, but I don't understand why [[Tefillin]] shouldn't be at [[Whatever Its Singular Form Is In Hebrew]] with a redirect at the former and proper explanation at the latter.  Such a move would be helpful to people who search literally and enlightening to someone who searches as (it seems is) usual.  I guess what I mean is that if &quot;tefillin&quot; means &quot;worn boxes of prayers&quot;, it should be redirected to a singular title; if &quot;tefillin&quot; means &quot;a worn box of prayers&quot;, it's ok where it is.  This might be dumb, but it's all because I had a hard time finding [[Tefillin]] (an interesting concept).  In the end, I changed the disambig at [[phylactery]] to refer directly to tefillin instead of confusingly referring directly to [[tallith]].  No articles on English Wikipedia refer to [[tefilla]], but maybe one of you pros can remedy that!  [[User:DaAnHo|DaAnHo]] ([[User talk:DaAnHo|talk]]) 18:34, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
::Tefillin is plural because they always come in pairs (the hand and the head). They are phylacteries, plain and simple. A Tallis is a prayer shawl, not a phylactery, and linking phylactery to tallis is an error. Thanks for fixing it. -- [[User:Avraham|Avi]] ([[User talk:Avraham|talk]]) 19:51, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
:::I was going to say much the same thing; tefillin is plural for the same reason [[trousers]] and [[glasses]] are plural, because they almost always come in pairs. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 03:39, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
'''Oppose'''. ''Tefilla'' means &quot;prayer&quot;. ''Tefillin'' means &quot;phylacteries&quot;. They are different words in different languages, referring to different things. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:03, 14 November 2010 (UTC)

'''Oppose''' - Agree with Avi &amp; Jayjg, they are different words in different languages referring to different things. --[[User:nsaum75|&lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em; class=texhtml&quot;&gt;nsaum75&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:nsaum75|&lt;span lang=&quot;he&quot; xml:lang=&quot;he&quot; dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;¡שיחת!&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lrm;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 14 November 2010 (UTC)

'''Oppose''' These objects are mostly always referred to in the plural form. So much so, it is very common for a single tefilla to be called, albeit erroneously, a &quot;tefillin&quot;. And as far as it denoting prayer, or tefilla, that is not so clear cut. Tur derives the word from Pelilah. [[User:Chesdovi|Chesdovi]] ([[User talk:Chesdovi|talk]]) 18:10, 14 November 2010 (UTC)
