      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18227">'''Natural theology''' is a branch of [[theology]] based on [[reason]] and ordinary [[experience]]. Thus it is distinguished from ''[[revealed theology]]'' (or ''revealed religion'') which is based on [[scripture]] and [[religious experiences]] of various kinds; and also from ''[[transcendental theology]]'', theology from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning.

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116–27 BC) in his (lost) ''Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum'' established a distinction of three kinds of theology:  [[political theology|civil (political)]] (''theologia civilis''), natural (physical) (''theologia naturalis'') and [[mythical theology|mythical]] (''theologia mythica'').
The theologians of civil theology are &quot;the people&quot;, asking how the gods relate to daily life and the state ([[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]]). The theologians of natural theology are the [[philosophy|philosophers]], asking for the nature of the gods, and the theologians of mythical theology are the [[poet]]s, crafting [[mythology]]. The terminology entered [[Stoicism|Stoic]] tradition and is used by [[Augustine of Hippo]].

Natural theology, thus, is that part of the [[philosophy of religion]] dealing with describing the nature of the [[gods]], or, in [[monotheism]], arguing for or against [[attributes of God|attributes]] or [[negative theology|non-attributes]] of God, and especially the  [[existence of God]],  purely philosophically, that is, without recourse to any special or supposedly supernatural [[revelation]]. '''Physico-theology''' is the term for a theology based on the constitution of the natural world, especially derived from perceived elements of &quot;design&quot;, which gave rise to the [[argument from design]] for the existence of God, beginning with the &quot;fifth way&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Religious_Studies/Phil_of_Rel/God/five_ways2.php Thomas Aquinas' Five Ways (Part 2): Contingency, Goodness, Design]&lt;/ref&gt;of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' by [[Thomas Aquinas]] (d. 1274).

Besides [[Zarathushtra]]'s [[Gathas]], [[Plato]] gives the earliest surviving account of a &quot;natural theology&quot;, around 360 BC, in his dialogue &quot;[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]&quot; he states &quot;Now the whole Heaven, or Cosmos, ...we must first investigate concerning it that primary question which has to be investigated at the outset in every case,—namely, whether it has existed always, having no beginning of generation, or whether it has come into existence, having begun from some beginning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NA229&quot;&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180;query=section%3D%23400;layout=;loc=Tim.%2028a Plato, ''Timaeus'']&lt;/ref&gt; He continues in his ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' establishing the existence of the gods by rational argument, stating &quot;...which lead to faith in the gods? ...One is our dogma about the soul...the other is our dogma concerning the ordering of the motion of the stars&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NA230&quot;&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166;query=section%3D%231576;layout=;loc=12.966e Plato, ''Laws'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' argues for the existence of an &quot;[[unmoved mover]]&quot;, an argument taken up in medieval [[scholastics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

From the 8th century, the [[Mu'tazili|Mutazilite]] school of [[Islam]], compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islam of their day, looked for support in philosophy, and are among the first to pursue a rational [[Islamic theology]], called ''Ilm-al-[[Kalam]]'' ([[Scholasticism|scholastic theology]]). The [[teleological argument]] was presented by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Islamic philosophers]], [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]] and [[Averroes]] (founder of [[Averroism]]), while [[Avicenna]] (founder of the [[Avicennism]] school of [[Islamic philosophy]]) presented both the [[cosmological argument]] and [[ontological argument]] in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' (1027).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225–1274), wrote [[Summa Theologica]] and [[Summa Contra Gentiles]] which both present various versions of the [[Cosmological argument]] and [[Teleological argument]], respectively. The [[Ontological argument]] is also presented, but rejected in favor of proofs dealing with cause and effect alone.

[[Thomas Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln]] wrote ''Execreitationes aliquot metaphysicae de Deo'' (1637) and spoke often of natural theology during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[John Ray]] (1627–1705) also known as John Wray, was an [[English people|English]] naturalist, sometimes referred to as the father of English [[natural history]]. He published important works on [[plants]], [[animal]]s, and natural theology.

[[William Derham]] (1657–1735), was a friend and disciple of John Ray. He continued Ray's tradition of natural theology in two of his own works, The ''Physico-Theology'', published in 1713, and the ''Astro-Theology'', 1714.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} These would later help influence the work of William Paley (see below).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', the first edition published in 1798, [[Thomas Malthus]] ended with two chapters on natural theology and population. Malthus—a devout Christian—argued that [[revelation]] would &quot;damp the soaring wings of intellect&quot;, and thus never let &quot;the difficulties and doubts of parts of the scripture&quot; interfere with his work.

[[William Paley]] gave a well-known rendition of the [[teleological argument]] for God. In 1802 he published ''Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature''. In this he described the [[Watchmaker analogy]], for which he is probably best known.  Searing criticisms of arguments like Paley's are found in [[David Hume]]'s posthumous ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume|first=David|title=Dialogues concerning Natural Religion|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]] wrote the definitive book on the natural religion of [[Deism]], [[The Age of Reason]] (1794–1807). In it he uses reason to establish a belief in Nature's Designer who man calls God. He also establishes the many instances that Christianity and Judaism require us to give up our God-given reason in order to accept their claims to revelation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

American education reformer and [[abolitionist]], [[Horace Mann]] (1796–1859) taught [[political economy]], intellectual and [[moral philosophy]], and natural theology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Professor of chemistry and natural history, [[Edward Hitchcock]] also studied and wrote on natural theology. He attempted to unify and reconcile science and religion, focusing on geology.  His major work in this area was  ''The Religion of Geology and its Connected Sciences'' (1851).&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Gifford Lectures]] are lectures established by the will of [[Adam Gifford|Adam Lord Gifford]]. They were established to &quot;promote and diffuse the study of Natural Theology in the widest sense of the term—in other words, the knowledge of God.&quot; The term natural theology as used by Gifford means [[theology]] supported by [[science]] and not dependent on the [[miraculous]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.giffordlectures.org Gifford Lectures online database] accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bridgewater Treatises==
Debates over the applicability of [[teleological arguments|teleology]] to scientific questions came to a head in the nineteenth century, as [[William Paley|Paley's]] argument about design came into conflict with radical new theories on the [[transmutation of species]].  In order to support the canonical scientific views at the time, which explored the natural world within [[William Paley|Paley's]] framework of a divine designer, [[Francis Henry Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater|The Earl of Bridgewater]], a gentleman naturalist, commissioned eight '''Bridgewater Treatises''' upon his deathbed to explore &quot;the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robson, John M. (1990). &quot;The Fiat and Finger of God: The Bridgewater Treatises&quot;. In Helmstadter, Richard J.; Lightman, Bernard V. (eds.). ''Victorian Faith in Crisis: Essays on Continuity and Change in Nineteenth-Century Religious Belief''. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press. ISBN 978-0-8047-1602-4.&lt;/ref&gt; They first appeared during the years 1833 to 1840, and afterwards in Bohn's Scientific Library.  The treatises are:

#''The Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Condition of Man'', by [[Thomas Chalmers]], D. D.
#''On The Adaptation of External Nature to the Physical Condition of Man'', by [[John Kidd (chemist)|John Kidd]], M. D.
#''Astronomy and General Physics considered with reference to Natural Theology'', by [[William Whewell]], D. D.
#''The hand, its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as evincing Design'', by Sir [[Charles Bell]].
#''Animal and Vegetable Physiology considered with reference to Natural Theology'', by [[Peter Mark Roget]].
#''Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology'', by [[William Buckland]], D.D.
#''On the History, Habits and Instincts of Animals'', by [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]].
#''Chemistry, Meteorology, and the Function of Digestion, considered with reference to Natural Theology'', by [[William Prout]], M.D.

In response to the claim in Whewell's treatise that &quot;We may thus, with the greatest propriety, deny to the mechanical philosophers  and mathematicians of recent times any authority with regard to their views  of the administration of the universe&quot;, [[Charles Babbage]] published what he called ''[[Ninth Bridgewater Treatise|The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise, A Fragment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.ca/books?id=gB4HAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Charles+Babbage+Bridgewater&amp;as_brr=1 ''The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise, A Fragment''], [[Charles Babbage]]&lt;/ref&gt; As his preface states, this volume was not part of that series, but rather his own reflections on the subject. He draws on his own work on calculating engines to consider God as a divine programmer setting complex laws underlying what we think of as miracles, rather than miraculously producing new species on a Creative whim. There was also a fragmentary supplement to this, posthumously published by [[Thomas Hill (clergyman)|Thomas Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Thomas|title=Geometry and faith|year=1874|publisher=GP Putnam|coauthors=Charles Babbage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works are of unequal merit; several of them took a high rank in apologetic literature, but they attracted considerable criticism.  One notable critic of the Bridgewater Treatises was [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who wrote ''Criticism''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/eapoe/bl-eapoe-criticism.htm Criticism], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], (1850)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Knox]], an Edinburgh surgeon and leading advocate of radical [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], referred to them as the &quot;Bilgewater Treatises&quot;, to mock the &quot;ultra-teleological school&quot;. Though memorable, this phrase overemphasises the influence of teleology in the series, at the expense of the [[idealism]] of the likes of Kirby and Roget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Denis | last2 = Numbers|first2 = Ronald L.|authorlink2= Ronald L.
