A '''temple''' (from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|''[[templum]]''}}) is a structure reserved for [[religious]] or spiritual activities, such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]], or analogous [[rite]]s. A templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or [[augur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid | publisher = University of Notre Dame | date = 26 May 2009 | url = http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=Templum&amp;ending= | accessdate = 24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the same root as the word &quot;template,&quot; a plan in preparation of the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur. Templa also became associated with the dwelling places of a god or gods. Despite the specific set of meanings associated with the religion of the [[ancient Rome]], the word has now become quite widely used to describe a house of [[worship]] for any number of religions and is even used for time periods prior to the Romans.

==Oldest temple==
''[[Göbekli Tepe]]'', located in southern [[Turkey]], is the oldest-known, existing temple in the world. It was built approximately 11,000 years ago.

==Mesopotamian temples==
[[File:Ziggarat of Ur 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ziggurat of Ur]], [[Iraq]]]]
The temple of [[Mesopotamia]] derived from the cult of gods and deities in [[Mesopotamian religion]]. It spanned several civilizations; from [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian]], [[Assyria]]n, and [[Babylonian]]. The most common temple architecture of Mesopotamia is the structure of sun-baked bricks called [[Ziggurat]], having the form of a terraced [[step pyramid]] with flat upper terrace where shrine or temple stood

==Egyptian temples==
[[File:LuxorTemple1.jpg|thumb|[[Luxor temple]], [[Egypt]]]]
{{main|Egyptian temple}}
[[Ancient Egypt]]ian temples were meant as places for the [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most commonly used to describe the temple building, ''ḥwt-nṯr'', means &quot;mansion (or enclosure) of a god&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer 1984, p. 22, 44; Snape 1996, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; A god's [[Divine presence|presence]] in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through ritual. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature. They were therefore a key part of the maintenance of ''[[maat]]'', the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief.&lt;ref&gt;Dunand and Zivie-Coche 2005, pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining ''maat'' was the entire purpose of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]],&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it was the purpose of a temple as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer, Byron E., &quot;Temples, Priests, and Rituals: An Overview&quot;, in Shafer 1997, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian temples were also of economic significance to Egyptian society. The temples stored and redistributed grain and came to own large portions of the nation's arable land (some estimate as much as 33% by the [[New Kingdom]] period).&lt;ref&gt;André Dollinger. The Ancient Egyptian Economy. pp. 5 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/The-Ancient-Egyptian-Economy.pdf] Retrieved June 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman temples==
[[File:Acropilos wide view.jpg|thumb|[[Parthenon]] on [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], [[Athens]]]]
{{Main|Greek temple|Roman temple}}

Though today we call most Greek religious buildings &quot;temples,&quot; the ancient pagans would have referred to a [[temenos]], or sacred precinct. Its sacredness, often connected with a holy grove, was more important than the building itself, as it contained the open air [[altar]] on which the [[sacrifices]] were made. The building which housed the cult statue in its [[Cella|naos]] was originally a rather simple structure, but by the middle of the 6th century BCE had become increasingly elaborate. Greek temple architecture had a profound influence on ancient architectural traditions.

The rituals that located and sited the temple were performed by an [[augur]] through the observation of the flight of birds or other natural phenomenon. Roman temples usually faced east or toward the rising sun, but the specifics of the orientation are often not known today; there are also notable exceptions, such as the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] which faces north. In [[ancient Rome]] only the native deities of [[Roman mythology]] had a ''templum''; any equivalent structure for a foreign deity was called a ''fanum''.

==Pagan temples==
The Romans usually referred to a holy place of a [[pagan]] religion as ''fanum''; in some cases this referred to a sacred grove, in others to a temple. Medieval Latin writers also used the word ''templum''. In some cases it is hard to determine whether it was a building or an outdoor shrine. For temple buildings of [[Germanic paganism]], the [[Old Norse]] term ''[[Heathen hofs|hof]]'' is often used.

==Zoroastrian temples==
[[File:Zoroastrian Fire Temple in Yazd.JPG|thumb|The Yazd Atash Behram]]
{{Main|Fire temple}}
[[Zoroastrian]] temples may also be called the ''[[darb-e meh]]'' and ''[[Fire temple|Atashkadeh]]''. A fire temple in Zoroastrianism is the place of worship for Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians revere fire in any form. In the Zoroastrian religion, fire (Atar), together with clean water (Aban), are agents of ritual purity. Clean, white &quot;ash for the purification ceremonies is regarded as the basis of ritual life,&quot; which, &quot;are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple fire is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity.

==Sikh temples==
[[File:Golden temple pano.jpg|thumb|Golden temple in [[Amritsar]]]]
{{Main|Gurdwara}}

A Sikh temple or shrine is called a Gurudwara, that is, the House of God, the House of the Guru, where the Guru dwells. Its most essential element also known as Shurk is the presence of the Guru. The temples have entrance from all sides, signifying that they are open to all without any distinction whatsoever.

==Hindu temples==
[[File:New Delhi Temple.jpg|thumb|[[Akshardham (Delhi)|Akshardham Temple]], a Hindu temple in [[New Delhi]], [[India]].]]
{{Main|Hindu temple}}
These may also be called by other names, including ''mandir'' or ''mandira'', ''ambalam'', ''kavu'', ''koil'' or ''kovil'', ''déul'', ''devasthana'' and ''devalaya'', depending on the region in the Indian subcontinent and its local language.

Hindu temples are large and magnificent with a rich history. Some date as far  back as the [[Bronze Age]] and later the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. In the present day magnificent Hindu temples have been built in various countries of the world including [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Canada]].

They include the structures called [[stupa]], [[wat]] and [[pagoda]] in different regions and languages.

==Jain temples==

[[File:Jain Temple Ranakpur.jpg|thumb|[[Ranakpur Jain Temple]], [[Rajasthan]], [[India]].]]
A '''Jain temple''' is the [[place of worship]] for [[Jainism|Jains]], the followers of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence, A |last=Babb |title=Absent lord: ascetics and kings in a Jain ritual culture |page=66 |publisher=Published [[University of California Press]] |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous Jain temples are [[Shikharji]], [[Palitana Jain Temples]], [[Ranakpur Jain Temple]], [[Shravan Belgola]], [[Dilwara Temples]] and [[Lal Mandir]]. Jain temples are built with various architectural designs. Jain temples in North India are completely different from the Jain temples in South India, which in turn are quite different from Jain temples in West India. Additionally, a [[Manastambha]] (meaning column of honor) is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples.

==Jewish synagogues and temples==
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 2.JPG|thumb|right|A model of [[Herod's Temple]] adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]
In [[Judaism]], the ancient Hebrew texts refer not to temples, the word having not existed yet, but to a &quot;sanctuary&quot;, &quot;palace&quot; or &quot;hall&quot;. Each of the two ancient temples in Jerusalem was called ''[[Beit Hamikdash]]'', which translates literally as &quot;the Holy House.&quot;

The [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] is the site where the [[First Temple]] of Solomon and the [[Second Temple]] were built. At the center of the structure was the [[Holy of Holies]] where only the high priest could enter. The Temple Mount is now the site of the [[Islamic]] shrine, the [[Dome of the Rock]] (c. 690).

The Greek word ''[[synagogue]]'' came into use to describe Jewish places of worship during [[Hellenistic]] times and it, along with the Yiddish term ''[[shul]]'', and the original Hebrew term ''[[Synagogue|Bet Knesset]]'' (&quot;House of meeting&quot;) are the terms in most universal usage.

From the beginning of the nineteenth century, the word &quot;temple&quot; began to be used for Jewish houses of worship, almost exclusively by the followers of [[Reform Judaism]], first in Germany, then in other countries, especially in the United States, as in [[Temple Beth-El]]. Orthodox Judaism considers this usage inappropriate, as it does not consider synagogues a replacement for the Temple in Jerusalem (there were local places of worship contemporaneous with the existence of the Temple, e.g. the one that can be seen at [[Masada]]).
{{clear}}

==Christian temples==
[[File:Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour-8.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].]]
The word ''temple'' has traditionally been rarely used in the [[Western Christian tradition]]. The principal words typically used to distinguish houses of worship in Western Christian architecture are ''[[basilica]], [[cathedral]]'' and ''[[Church (building)|church]]''. The Catholic Church has used the word temple in reference of a place of worship on rare occasions. An example is the Roman Catholic [[Sagrada Familia]] Temple in Barcelona, Spain and the Roman Catholic [[Basilique du Sacré-Cœur]] Temple in Paris, France.

The word ''temple'', however, is used frequently in the tradition of [[Eastern Christianity]] and particularly the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], where the principal words used for houses of worship are ''temple'' and ''church''. The use of the word ''temple'' comes from the need to distinguish ''a building of the church'' vs. ''the church seen as the Body of Christ''. In the [[Russian language]] (similar to other [[Slavic languages]]) while the general-purpose word for &quot;church&quot; is ''[[Russian church architecture|tserkov]]'', the term ''khram'' (Храм), &quot;temple&quot;, is used to refer to the church building as a temple of [[God]] (''Khram Bozhy''). The words &quot;church&quot; and &quot;temple&quot;, in this case are interchangeable; however, the term &quot;church&quot; ({{lang-grc|ἐκκλησία}}) is far more common. The term ''temple'' ({{lang-grc|ναός}}) is also commonly applied to larger churches. Some famous churches which are referred to as temples include [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], or the [[Temple of Saint Sava]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. See also: [[Orthodox church (building)]] and [[catholicon]]{{disambiguation needed|date=June 2012}}.

Beginning in the late eighteenth century, following the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], some Protestant denominations in France and elsewhere began to use the word ''temple'' to distinguish these spaces from Catholic churches. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and other Protestant churches make use of a wide variety of terms to designate their worship spaces, such as church, [[tabernacle]] or temple. Additionally some [[Breakaway Catholic Churches]] such as the [[Mariavite Church]] in [[Poland]] have chosen to also designate their central church building as a temple, as in the case of the [[Temple of Mercy and Charity]] in [[Płock]]. The [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] called their Central House of Worship as Central Temple, the Largest Ecclesiastical Edifice of Iglesia ni Cristo located at INC Central Complex, Diliman, [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]].

===Temples in the Latter Day Saint movement===
{{main|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[File:Salt Lake Temple, Utah - Sept 2004-2.jpg|upright|thumb|LDS temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Dedicated 1893.]]
According to [[Latter Day Saint]]s, in 1832, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] received a [[Revelation#Latter-day Saint concept of revelation|revelation]] to [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restore]] the practice of [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple worship]], in a &quot;house of the Lord&quot;. The [[Kirtland Temple]] was the first temple of the [[Latter-day Saint movement]] and the only one completed in Smith's lifetime, although the [[Nauvoo Temple]] was partially complete at the time of [[death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|his death]]. The [[schism (religion)|schisms]] stemming from a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] have led to differing views about the role and use of temples between various groups with competing succession claims.

[[The Book of Mormon]]: Another Testament of Jesus Chirst, which Latter-day Saints believe is a companion book of scripture with the Bible, refers to temple building in the ancient Americas by a group of people called the [[Nephites]]. Though Book of Mormon authors are not explicit about the practices in these Nephite temples, they were patterned &quot;after the manner of the temple of Solomon&quot; (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng |title=The Second Book of Nephi Chapter 5 - 5:16 |publisher=Lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and served as gathering places for significant religious and political events (e.g. Mosiah 1-6; 3rd Nephi 11-26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achoiceland.com/temples |title=Temples |publisher=Achoiceland.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temples of the LDS church====
{{See also|Temple (LDS Church)|List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] is a prolific builder of &quot;[[Latter-day Saint]]&quot; or &quot;[[Mormon]]&quot; temples. {{LDS Temple status}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/temples/chronological/0,11206,1900-1,00.html|title=List of Temples}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Temple (LDS Church)|Latter-day Saint temples]] are reserved for performing and undertaking only the most holy and sacred of covenants and [[Ordinance (Mormonism)|special of ordinances]]. They are distinct from [[meeting house]]s and [[chapel]]s where [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Weekly services|weekly worship services]] are held. The temples are built and kept under strict sacredness and are not to be defiled.  Thus, strict rules apply for entrance, including Church membership and regular attendance. During the open-house period after its construction and before the temple is dedicated, the temple is open to the public for tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/temples/faq/0,11264,1904-1,00.html#3|title=Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Latter Day Saint denominations====

==Masonic temples==
[[Freemasonry]] is a [[fraternal organization]] with its origins in the eighteenth century whose membership is held together by a shared set of moral and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideals. Freemasons meet as a Lodge. Lodges meet in a [[Masonic Temple]], Masonic Center or a Masonic Hall, such as [[Freemasons' Hall, London]]. Some confusion exists as Masons usually refer to a Lodge meeting as being ''in Lodge''.

==Other religions==
[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, vue d'ensemble.jpg|thumb|Example of a mosque : the [[Mosque of Uqba]] (Great Mosque of Kairouan) is the oldest and one of the most important mosques in the Muslim West, [[Tunisia]].]]
Though the word &quot;temple&quot; is used broadly, one should use it with discretion in the context of some religions. For example, a [[masjid]] or &quot;[[mosque]]&quot; should not be considered a temple because ''masjid'' in Arabic means &quot;the place for kneeling (to God).&quot;

Convention allows the use of temple in the following cases:
*[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] temple ([[Bahá'í House of Worship|Mashriqu'l-Adhkárs]] or ‘Houses of Worship’).
*[[Mankhim]], the temple of the ethnic group the [[Rai (ethnic group)|Rai]], located at [[Aritar]], [[Sikkim]].
*[[Confucian temple]] or [[Temple of Confucius]].
*[[Shintoist]] ''[[Jinja (Shinto)|jinja]]'' are normally called ''[[shrine]]s'' in English in order to distinguish them from Buddhist temples (-tera, -dera).
*[[Taoism|Taoist]] temples and monasteries are called ''guan'' or ''[[daoguan]]'' (道观, literally &quot;place of contemplation of the Tao&quot;) in Chinese, ''guan'' being the shortened version of ''daoguan''.
*Shrines of the traditional [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese Ethnic Shenism]] are called ''[[joss house|miao]]'', or ''ancestral hall'' in English. ''Joss house'' is an obsolete American term for such kind of places of worship.
