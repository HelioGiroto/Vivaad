      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5699">'''Flirty Fishing (FFing)''' is a form of [[evangelism|evangelistic]] [[Sacred prostitution|religious prostitution]] practiced from around 1974 to 1987 by female members in the [[new religious movement]] the [[Children of God (cult)|Children of God]], now known as The Family International.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Flirty_Fishing Flirty Fishing], xFamily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='The Family' and Final Harvest |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/children_of_god/child1.htm |quote=Sure, Alexander concedes, plenty of people object that The Family's &quot;Law of Love&quot; permits sex outside marriage and that the group once condoned a practice known as &quot;flirty fishing&quot; – the use of sex to win converts. |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=June 2, 1993 |accessdate=2008-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology, definition==
The term refers to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 4:19 from the [[New Testament]], in which [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] tells two fishermen that he will make them &quot;fishers of men&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthew&quot;&gt;Matthew 4:19 (KJV, NIV, NKJV). Retrieved from http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:19;&amp;version=9;31;50;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cult leader [[David Berg]] extrapolated from this that women in his movement should be &quot;flirty fishers&quot; (also called &quot;bait&quot; or &quot;fisherwomen&quot;): the targeted men were called &quot;fish&quot;. The cult published several documents with exact instructions. Flirty Fishing was defined as using sex appeal for [[Proselytization|proselytizing]]. If [[masturbation]], [[oral sex|oral]], or [[sexual intercourse|penetrative sex]] ensued, this was termed as &quot;loving sexually&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reports&quot;&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/images/0/06/Ff-report-docs.pdf FF Reports, Questions &amp; Answers]&lt;/ref&gt; and also counted as a &quot;deep witness&quot;, meaning that the &quot;bait&quot; earned more [[brownie points]] within the group than by mere flirting. Berg noted that Flirty Fishing did not necessarily entail intercourse, but that this was by far the most efficient method of proselytizing.&lt;ref name=&quot;proselytism&quot;&gt; In a 1982 family publication, Berg stated that only one-seventh (14%) of fish were &quot;loved sexually&quot;, but he also noted that &quot;loving sexually&quot; was far and above the most effective method of witnessing in that it was 3000 times more effective than conventional forms of proselytizing.

==Impact on members==
Women who objected to being what the cult itself bluntly described as &quot;God's whores&quot; or &quot;hookers for Jesus&quot; were admonished not to &quot;let self and pride enter in&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;flirtyfishy&quot;&gt;[http://xfamily.org/index.php/True_Komix_-_Little_Flirty_Fishy True Komix #293 DO &quot;The Little Flirty Fishy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and reminded that their body did not really belong to them as according to [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 6:19–20 it had been &quot;bought&quot; (by Jesus through his crucifixion) &quot;with a price&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;corinthians&quot;&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%206:19-20;&amp;version=9; 1 Corinthians 19–20 (KJV)]&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial phase, male members no longer partook in this drive, partially because of the cult's dismissive stance towards [[homosexuality]], but also because Berg thought it did not &quot;pay off financially&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;reports&quot; /&gt; Many of the Flirty Fishers had boyfriends, were married, or had children. In Family publications, Flirty Fishers and Escort Servicers (see below) frequently reported that they found their work hard, dangerous, and exhausting.

==ESing==
The financial benefit of Flirty Fishing soon led to a further degeneration of the practice from mere flirting into &quot;loving sexually&quot; to ''Escort Servicing'' (''ESing'')&amp;mdash;described as &quot;making FFing pay&quot; by [[David Berg|Berg]]&amp;mdash;in which female cult members would work as regular [[call girl]]s for [[Escort agency|escort agencies]] or freelance, and merely &quot;witness&quot; (proselytize) to their clients when the occasion offered itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Escort_Servicing Escort Servicing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The Children of God practiced Flirty Fishing and Escort Servicing from 1974 until 1987, when it was officially abandoned, partially because of the [[AIDS]] epidemic. As the women were expected to keep exact records of their &quot;fruits&quot; (successes), a 1988 statistic showed that more than 223,000 men had been &quot;fished&quot; since 1978&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics&quot;&gt;[http://xfamily.org/images/a/a8/FF-Stats-1988-10-01.jpg FFing Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and that FFing had nevertheless continued into 1988. As the cult generally discourages birth control, the practice also resulted in numerous pregnancies, the offspring of which were termed ''Jesus babies'' by the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;jesusbabies&quot;&gt;[http://xfamily.org/index.php/Jesus_baby &quot;Jesus baby&quot; article from xfamily.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
