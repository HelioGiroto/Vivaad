      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3055">I see that this redirect page has been switching back and forth between redirecting to [[Pontifex Maximus]] and [[Pope (disambiguation)]], however there seems to have been no discussion about this on the talk page yet.  To me, it would make more sense to have this page redirect to [[Pontifex Maximus]] as the vast majority of entries on [[Pope (disambiguation)]] are not referred to as Supreme Pontiff.

:Following recent edits, Pontifex Maximus should do for now. Change it as you see fit as long as it's in compliance with the naming conventions. [[User:Troy 07|~ Troy]] ([[User talk:Troy 07|talk]]) 18:56, 26 July 2008 (UTC)

As I have already said, the only person in the world to bear this title is the Pope. [[Wikipedia:COMMON]] tells us to accept the common sense. 'Supreme Pontiff' meaning 'Pope' is not only the common sense, but also the unique possible sense. [[User:Ausonia|Ausonia]] ([[User talk:Ausonia|talk]]) 22:41, 26 July 2008 (UTC)

:Fair enough, there isn't a huge diff. between Pontifex Maximus and Pope as I see it, but there's no point for me to continue.[[User:Troy 07|~ Troy]] ([[User talk:Troy 07|talk]]) 17:51, 27 July 2008 (UTC)

::Ausonia, you should have known by now that if you didn't continue your sock puppetry, you would have accomplished more. In that case, your comments will be disregarded as per [[WP:POINT]]. The '''''very first example''''' states:
*'''If''' somebody suggests that Wikipedia should become a majority-rule democratic community...
**'''do''' point out that it is entirely possible for Wikipedians to create [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sock puppets]] and vote more than once.
**'''do not''' create seven sock puppets and have them all agree with you.

::As a result, the issue has been dealt with accordingly. Also, [[Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Benkenobi is a retardate]] confirms your actions, which in turn, are to be reverted ''again''. You have reached almost no consensus whatsoever and have ignored to discuss the issue. Thus, I'm afraid that your &quot;point&quot; has no validity. Moreover, you have been blocked from editing Wikipedia, including making page moves without discussing or linking to redirects in a fashion that is against [[WP:NM|naming conventions]].

I'm not sure I followed the entire previous conversation...however, it seems that Pontifex Maximus isn't a commonly used term any longer. Additionally, the aside from the three church leaders, other links off the disambiguation page for pope don't seem to reference supreme pontiff.  Of the three church leaders, only the bishop of rome (roman catholic) uses the title Supreme Pontiff (coptic: Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa, greek orthodox: Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa).  Because of this, this re-direct doesn't need to go to the disambiguation page, but can go directly to [[Pope]].  [[User:Teeks99|Teeks99]] ([[User talk:Teeks99|talk]]) 15:46, 7 May 2011 (UTC)</text>
