The fact that the Christ Candle in the centre of the [[Advent wreath]] is lit also indicates that [[Christmas]] has arrived.]]
'''Liturgical colours''' are those specific colours which are used for [[vestment]]s and [[Antependium|hangings]] within the context of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[liturgy]]. The symbolism of [[violet (color)|violet]], white, green, red, gold, black, [[Rose (color)|rose]] and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the [[liturgical year]] or may highlight a special occasion. 

There is a distinction between the colour of the vestments worn by the clergy and their [[choir dress]], which with a few exceptions does not change with the liturgical seasons.

==Roman Catholic Church==
===Post-1969 Rubrics===
In the [[Roman Rite]], as reformed by [[Pope Paul VI]], the following colours are used.&lt;ref name=IGMR&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/cdwlgrm.htm ''Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani''], no. 346; cf.

On more solemn days, festive, that is, more precious, sacred vestments may be used, even if not of the colour of the day. Such vestments may, for instance, be made from [[cloth of gold]]  or [[cloth of silver]]. Moreover, the Conference of Bishops may determine and propose to the Apostolic See adaptations suited to the needs and culture of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual Masses are celebrated in their proper colour, in white, or in a festive colour. Masses for Various Needs, on the other hand, are celebrated in the colour proper to the day or the season or in violet if they bear a penitential character. Votive Masses are celebrated in the colour suited to the Mass itself or even in the colour proper to the day or the season.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 347&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional and situational exceptions ====

Some particular variations:
*'''Blue''', a colour associated with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], is permitted for the feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in some dioceses in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Mexico]] and [[South America]]. In the [[Philippines]], it is authorised for all feasts of the Virgin Mary, a practise followed in some other places without official warrant. There have also been unauthorised uses of blue in place of violet for the season of Advent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canticanova.com/articles/xmas/art1c1.htm Cantica Nova Puplications], ''Advent Blues'', editorial by Gary D. Penkala, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; as a symbol of expectation and hope - the blue of a new day.
*'''White''' or '''cloth of gold''' was traditionally used for [[Misa de Gallo|the Novena]] from 16 to 24 December according to a [[Spain|Spanish]] custom abolished in that country in the 1950s, but still widely observed in the [[Philippines]]. White is also used for East Asian Masses for the dead, as white is the traditional colour of mourning in many of the region's cultures. Furthermore, if not enough vestments of the proper colour are available (particularly in [[concelebration]]s), white may always be substituted.

===Pre-1969 Rubrics===
The [[Roman Missal]] as revised by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1962, was authorised for use as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] by the 2007 [[motu proprio]] entitled ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. Pope John XXIII's revision of the Missal incorporated changes that he had made with his motu proprio ''Rubricarum instructum'' of 29 July 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962-pdf.html ''Missale Romanum'' 1962 in PDF Format]&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the differences between its rules for liturgical colours and the later rules:

[[Pope Pius X]] raised the rank of Sundays of ordinary time, so that on those that fell within octaves '''green''' was used instead of the colour of the octave, as had previously been the rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Rubricae generales Missalis: XVIII – De Coloribus Paramentorum'' in the [http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition] of the Roman Missal omitted the phrase &quot;exceptis Dominicis infra octavas occurrentibus, in quibus color octavarum servatur&quot; found in earlier editions beginning with Pope Pius V's edition of 1570 (page 21 of the facsimile published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 1998 – ISBN 88-209-2547-8).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules on liturgical colours before the time of Pope Pius X were essentially those indicated in the edition of the Roman Missal that [[Pope Pius V]] promulgated in 1570, except for the addition of feasts not included in his Missal. The scheme of colours in his Missal reflected usage that had become fixed in Rome by the twelfth century.

==Byzantine Rite==
The [[Byzantine Rite]], which is used by all the member churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of Byzantine Rite, does not have a universal system of colours, with the service-books of the Byzantine tradition only specifying &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; vestments in the service books. In the Greek tradition, [[Maroon (colour)|maroon]] or [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] are common for solemn feast days, and a wide variety of colours are used at other times, the most common of which are gold and white.

Slavic-use churches and others influenced by Western traditions have adopted a cycle of liturgical colours.  The particulars may change from place to place, but generally:

|}

The colours would be changed before [[Vespers]] on the eve of the day being commemorated.  During Great Feasts, the colour is changed before the vespers service that begins the first day of a [[forefeast]], and remains until the apodosis (final day of the [[afterfeast]]).

Under Western influence, black is often used for funerals, weekdays in Great Lent and Holy Week in the Slavic churches, as a sign of [[penance]] and mourning, but in the second half of the 20th century, the ancient white became more common, as a sign of the hope of the Resurrection.

==Russian liturgical colours==

According to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]'s ''Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia'',&lt;ref&gt;Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia, Volume 4, Moscow,1983, Translated in &quot;The Messenger&quot; of St. Andrew's Russian Orthodox Cathedral,Philadelphia, June, July–August, September, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; up to eight different liturgical colours may be used throughout the year.  Exact usage of these colours varies, but the following are the most common uses.

==Coptic and Ethiopic Rites==
The [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic]] tradition, followed also in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], uses only white vestments, with gold and silver being considered variations of white.

==Anglicanism==
[[Image:Lenten Array Edgbaston.jpg|thumb|right|Lenten Array altar frontal by [[George Pace]] at [[St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston|St Augustine's, Edgbaston]]]]
Most [[Anglican]] churches use the colours appointed in the Roman Rite, usually in its post-1969 form, with the exception of Sarum Blue replacing Violet for Advent, but some use the earlier form, with, for instance, black in place of red on [[Good Friday]]. Some churches use black at masses for the dead, but more commonly white or purple is used. For historical reasons much of the worldwide Anglican Communion takes a noticeable lead from the practice of the [[Church of England]]. Since the 1980 [[Alternative Service Book]] liturgical colours have been recommended for seasons, with more detailed advice offered as part of the [[Common Worship]] series of liturgies, including colours for all Sundays and festivals printed in the 'core volume' next to collects. The Church's published Lectionary now makes detailed suggestions for liturgical colour throughout the year, which corresponds almost exactly with the above table of Roman Rite (post-1969 usage) usage with five minor exceptions, and one more significant one: there is no reference in Anglican usage to masses of deceased popes and cardinals; no liturgical colour at all is suggested for Holy Saturday (the words &quot;hangings removed&quot; are printed); the recommendation of red for confirmation rites is extended also to ordination rites; Lenten Array (unbleached linen) continues to be listed as an alternative option to purple during Lent; the option exists for using red instead of green during the &quot;Kingdom Season&quot;, the four last Sundays of the liturgical year, culminating in [[Christ the King]], as is common is some Lutheran traditions (see below); finally, more significantly, the Church of England provision suggests white throughout the Sundays after Epiphany as a distinct &quot;Epiphany season&quot;, with ordinary time commencing the day after Candlemas. The Church of England suggested scheme of colours also indicates where gold vestments should be used in those churches which possess both gold and white as distinct colours. The use of rose-pink vestments, as in the Roman Rite table above, was mentioned as an option in early editions of Common Worship,&lt;ref&gt;The use of rose-pink vestments is suggested in the liturgical colour sequence notes of [[Common Worship]] of which an [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/commonworship/texts/rules/rulesyear.html on-line version may be found here].&lt;/ref&gt; and is a listed option in the annual published lectionary; however, later Common Worship publications have begun to refer to this practice as &quot;traditional&quot; reflecting its resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see &quot;Common Worship - Times &amp; Seasons&quot;, added to the Common Worship series in 2006, page 50, paragraph 1: &quot;rose-pink vestments are traditionally worn&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheranism==
The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], uses the same colour scheme as that of the Anglicans and their Scandinavian Lutheran counterparts, but with the use of gold only for the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday services, with Holy Week using scarlet in place of crimson &amp;ndash; congregations lacking scarlet vestments use purple from Palm Sunday through Holy Wednesday and white for Maundy Thursday.  Black, traditionally used by the Anglican Communion for Good Friday and funerals, was used by the ELCA only for Ash Wednesday, but effective with the new ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' (ELW) book, which replaces the ''[[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' (LBW), black is no longer suggested for Ash Wednesday or Good Friday &amp;ndash; purple may be used for Ash Wednesday and no colour for Good Friday.  In addition, the ELW suggests that blue, the traditional colour for Advent (with purple being the alternate), be used for the Advent season, reflecting the traditional use of blue in the Scandinavian Lutheran churches.

Both the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), along with the [[United Methodist Church]] use a similar system, but with purple being the primary colour for both Advent and Lent (with blue being the alternate colour for Advent only), and the use of gold in place of white for both Christmas and Easter (in similar practice to the Roman Catholic Church).  In the WELS, the use of red is also done during the ''Period of End Times'', a period of the Church in regards to the teachings of the Book of Revelation, culminating in the creation of the New Jerusalem (corresponding to Christ the King in the ELCA).  In all three churches, including the ELCA, red is also worn on the last Sunday of October, in celebration of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] on October 31, when [[Martin Luther]] nailed the [[95 Theses]] onto the door of Wittenberg Castle Church.

==Other Protestants==
Some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, historically especially [[Methodism|Methodists]], and today many [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] Protestants, use a colour scheme similar to those used by Anglicans and Roman Catholics, although the practice is not universally followed. Many Protestant churches do not use liturgical colours at all.  The United Methodist Church, prior to the early-1990s, used red solely for Pentecost, even including the Sundays after Pentecost Sunday, with the use of green being reserved for the season of [[Kingdomtide]], which usually lasted from late August/early September until Christ the King (the last Sunday in Kingdomtide).  Since the publication of the 1992 Book of Worship, the UMC has followed the ELCA practice of wearing red only for Pentecost and Reformation Sundays and green for the rest of the Pentecost season.

The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] has sanctioned the use of liturgical colours and promoted their use in the 1993 Book of Common Worship (although their use was also promoted in the church's annual Planning Calendars beginning in the 1980s). Advent and Lent are periods of preparation and repentance and are represented by the colour purple.  The feasts of Christmas Day and Christmastide, Epiphany Sunday, Baptism of the Lord Sunday, Transfiguration Sunday, Easter Season, Trinity Sunday, and Christ the King Sunday are represented by white.  Green is the colour for periods of Ordinary Time.  Red is for Pentecost Sunday, but may also be used for ordinations, church anniversaries, and memorial services for ordained clergy.  Red or purple is appropriate for Palm Sunday.  During Holy Week, the church may use purple or remain bare (although a few churches will use black for Good Friday).

Similarly, the [[United Church of Christ]] includes indications of which liturgical colour to use for each Sunday in its annual calendar.  The general Western pattern is followed, with either Purple or Blue recommended for Advent.
