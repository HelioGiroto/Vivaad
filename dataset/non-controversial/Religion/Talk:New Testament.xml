== Throw the article away? ==
People, I happened to come by and saw this article, which is stuffed full of weaselling and amateur opinion.  

For instance there's &quot;most scholars say...&quot; all over the place.  Who says so?  The editor, who is an amateur?!  Or is this from some reliable source?  If the latter, who, precisely, and can we have a reference containing his exact words?

Then there's &quot;traditional&quot;.  None of us received any &quot;tradition&quot;.  The views expressed are either in some book -- which? with reference -- or they are not, in which case they shouldn't be there.  It also carries a value-loading of &quot;wrong&quot; in some people's eyes.  &quot;Modern&quot; when used as a term of approval, rather than a calendar indicator opposed to some older scholarly opinion, is also POV.

The article is terribly unencyclopedic, and probably needs to be torn up and rewritten, with every sentence justified by a footnote quoting a reliable source or sources that say exactly what the text says.

I haven't troubled to read the article to see what '''opinions''' it espouses -- no doubt it does push some position.  But as an example of Wikipedia it is dreadful.  Wikipedia should express no opinion.  It should merely describe, with references.

We could start by simply deleting all the sentences that have no reference for them, all the weasel-wording.  Start with something like Metzger's Text of the NT, and write brief, non-loaded, descriptive text.  [[User:Roger Pearse|Roger Pearse]] ([[User talk:Roger Pearse|talk]]) 21:27, 28 August 2010 (UTC)

:Or we could start by throwing away POV and explaining the POV of the editors. There has been a back-and-forth between conservative and liberal interpretations. There are no POV statements. It's fairly neutral now, but the statements do need citations. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 05:20, 29 August 2010 (UTC)

:* Yes, the article is riddled with with the problems you mention, [[User talk:Roger Pearse|Roger Pearse]]. I gave up trying to make it more accurate and based upon historically verifiable information yielded by critical scholarship months ago because of strong opposition to such accuracy and regular alterations of my edits. Part of the problem has to do with the nature of Wikipedia (where anyone can edit anything they like - whether they know anything about the topic or not), the other with the peculiar idea among some here that academic historians do not employ a form of the scientific method, but are driven by either &quot;liberalism&quot; or &quot;conservatism&quot; (whatever those are supposed to mean). As long as users try to equitably balance unverifiable pontifications (even if they appear in published books) with the cogent findings of historians, this article will remain unencyclopedic. It's sad really. The topic is important, and although this is a prime example of the unreliability of the source, a lot of people will nevertheless turn to Wikipedia to learn about the New Testament or early Christian literature or history. At present, perhaps all we can do is warn people to steer clear of these articles on Wikipedia.[[Special:Contributions/134.2.246.245|134.2.246.245]] ([[User talk:134.2.246.245|talk]]) 14:53, 29 September 2010 (UTC)
:: What you call &quot;accuracy&quot; I call &quot;liberal scholarship&quot;. The problem with such &quot;scholarship&quot; is that it takes the stance that God does not exist and so Jesus was not God and miracles attributed to him were simply added to make this man appear more important. Its bias is no better than the pure faith and miracle bias of conservative scholarship. That makes it inaccurate since it approaches the text with an agenda. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 15:03, 29 September 2010 (UTC)
::* The problem &quot;Walter&quot; is that there is no such thing as &quot;liberal scholarship&quot; or &quot;conservative scholarship&quot;. There is, however, such a thing as &quot;good scholarship&quot;: namely, the efforts of individuals who believe that we can understand the world around us, and our history and ourselves by careful observation and critical assessment of the data using a tried and true method that is accessible to all people of any persuasion, anywhere and at all times. It is--by definition--not biased and its sole agenda is to gain an understanding of reality that is universally verifiable. There is also &quot;bad scholarship&quot;: i.e., mere pronouncements by ideologues who aim to apologetically undergird belief in something irrespective of any basis it may have in reality. The first sort (&quot;good scholarship&quot;) belongs in an encyclopedia, and that is presumably what Wikipedia aspires to be. I'm not sure that &quot;bad scholarship&quot; belongs anywhere, but it certainly doesn't belong here. All of this, of course, has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with whether there is a God or gods, etc.[[Special:Contributions/134.2.162.119|134.2.162.119]] ([[User talk:134.2.162.119|talk]]) 15:56, 2 October 2010 (UTC)
::: You're mistaken. There is such a thing as liberal, conservative and other types of scholarship. When one approaches the text with preconceived notions of whether you're studying scripture or myth, whether there is or isn't a God (which affects questions about the plausibility of miracles, the deity of Christ, the existence of the Holy Spirit and a myriad of other issues in the text), and the accuracy of what the text describes, it makes a difference as the outcome of scholarship. Liberal scholarship is no better than conservative scholarship, and your attempts to undermine the latter as &quot;bad&quot; is a hollow effort from a straw man. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 16:16, 2 October 2010 (UTC)
:::* Whatever perspective it may be attempting to support or undermine, ideologically driven writing is not scholarship. Which is why, to the degree that anyone attempts to do &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; scholarship, they're simply doing bad scholarship. Again, this has no place here.[[Special:Contributions/134.2.162.119|134.2.162.119]] ([[User talk:134.2.162.119|talk]]) 16:56, 2 October 2010 (UTC)

==Authorship==
I redid the section on authorship to align it with [[Authors of the Bible]] which itself condenses the information in the individual biblical books. The section before was poorly cited and full of weasel words. The section is now well cited.[[User:RomanHistorian|RomanHistorian]] ([[User talk:RomanHistorian|talk]]) 16:18, 6 October 2010 (UTC)

==Epistle to the Laodiceans==
I copied over a bit about the Epistle to the Laodiceans from the article for that work to the canon section.  It appears to have been considered canonical in several Latin, German, and English bibles.  I'm seeing this as a counterpart to the bit about Luther excluding 4 NT books from his canon.  I've avoided combining the sections for now.  I think it puts a little perspective on what Luther was doing, in as much as there had been books included in bibles in the region that were later deemed non-canonical.  It makes him look a little less radical.  [[User:Ekwos|Ekwos]] ([[User talk:Ekwos|talk]]) 19:53, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

== Authorship of Revelation  ==

Here is a segment from my term paper on Revelation's authorship - which my professor said was highly insufficient - notice however that it contains more information than this wiki-article. 

So it must be settled for this study, who wrote Revelation, the presbyter John or the Apostle John? Lioy lists: “Justin (the) Martyr (ca 150-ca 215), Irenaeus (ca 130-ca 200), Clement of Alexandria (ca 150-ca 215), Tertullian (ca 155-ca 220), Hippolytus of Rome (ca 170-ca 236), and Origen (ca 185-ca 254)” as early Church fathers who all attributed authorship to the Apostle John.4 It was only “Dionysius of Alexandria (ca 190-ca 265)” “who did not believe it was the work of an apostle” and “Eusebius of Caesaria (ca 260-ca 341)” who attributed Revelation to the presbyter John.5 Lioy concludes that “the consensus of the early church consistently favored the apostle John as the author of Revelation, and there seems to be insufficient evidence to overturn this view.”6

== Apocalypse/Revelation ==

I was about to make a quick change when it dawned on me that this is likely quite a contentious article, and therefore I'd better come here first. In several places in this article, the Book of Revelation, is referred to as the Apocalypse, or the Apocalypse of John. &quot;Revelation&quot;, or &quot;The Revelation of John&quot; is more commonly used. Would there be serious objection to using &quot;The Revelation of John, also known as the Apocalypse of John&quot;? [[User:Joefromrandb|Joefromrandb]] ([[User talk:Joefromrandb|talk]]) 10:02, 26 December 2010 (UTC)

:It should definitely be standarized throughout the article. I would prefer Book of Revelation or Revelation, with an initial mention of Apocalypse, but I don't care that strongly as long as it's made uniform. [[User:Carl.bunderson|carl bunderson]] [[User talk:Carl.bunderson|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Carl.bunderson|(contributions)]] 16:32, 26 December 2010 (UTC)

:: It is more commonly referred to as Apocalypse in Roman Catholic circles, but I would take the lead from the [[Book of Revelation]] article. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 17:37, 26 December 2010 (UTC)

::: Yes, it is more commonly referred to as the Apocalypse in Roman Catholic circles, so we should probably leave that in the article. The minority terminology can also be given parenthetically after the first occurrance.

== Written in Greek?  ==

I have searched and searched for proof that the New Testament was written in Greek and have found no evidence.  Why do the dogmatic editors here not want this information out.

==Wikilink from this article REDIRECT to new article==
For anyone with their settings &quot;watching&quot; this article, and therefore the Talk Page, they may wish to be aware of the discussion on [[Talk:canonical gospels]]. That wikilink, which is linked from this article, used to REDIRECT from this article to [[Gospel#Canonical gospels]] but now  REDIRECTs to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncanonical_gospels&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=393296170&amp;oldid=392964604 new article written over the REDIRECT by a single editor]. The new article appears to have several issues including:
* 1. [[Wikipedia:Content forking]] (which qualifies among [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Reasons_for_deletion]]) 
* 2. to be counter to two of Wikipedia's &quot;three core policies&quot;, namely (A) [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]], (B) [[Wikipedia:No original research]].
* 3. to actually be 30% duplicate of material at [[Gospel#Canonical gospels]] and 70% about the [[noncanonical gospels]]
There is discussion at [[Talk:canonical gospels]] of how to proceed and whether to restore the REDIRECT as follows:
* canonical gospels as original REDIRECT to [[Gospel#Canonical gospels]]
* [[noncanonical gospels]] REDIRECTS to [[New Testament apocrypha]]
* [[apocryphal gospels]] REDIRECTS to [[New Testament apocrypha]]

: The validity of an argument has nothing to do with who makes it.

==Language paragraph, Correcting POVfork in mainwikilink==
I have made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Testament&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=435199767&amp;oldid=435198490 this edit] as NPOV breakout of the text from &quot;Language of the New Testament&quot;. The rationale is to put the mainstream view (as per text anyway) as the main wikilink, and relegate the [[Aramaic primacy]] (which is an article that probably needs renaming) to the foot of the paragraph clearly identifying it as a minority view. 
While instinctively &quot;unfair&quot; to present academic mainstream views first in this way it is what [[WP:POVFORK]] and [[WP:WEIGHT]] and [[WP:FRINGE]] require.

Please if you will kindly look at [[Talk:Greek_primacy#Rename.3F]] you'll see I mooted this move (of the relevant material) to [[Language of the New Testament]] on 5 June, got 1 approval 6 June, then no response, and waited till 20 June for further input, got none so did it. If you were that interested in the [[Greek primacy]] page then perhaps you should have had it on your watchlist. But anyway, better late than never, do you object to the move? Do you want it moved back to [[Greek primacy]] (which is what you've done without discussing on [[Talk:Greek_primacy#Rename.3F]]). I'm sorry but the [[Greek primacy]] page did not have a note on the Talk page, &quot;do not touch this without first discussing on Talk of [[New Testament]] since it is linked there.&quot; 
::::::It's somewhat unusual for a link to wag the dog (in this case a link here to override the Talk page of the other article) but I'm fine with that as New Testament is a more important article with a wider selection of editors. So what do you want? In restoring the equal weight wikilinks that recreates the equal-weight [[WP:POVFORK]] between Greek and Aramaic. Is that what editors here want?

:Well, I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Testament&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=435413442&amp;oldid=435332353 made the change] before reading the talk page (my apologies), but it seems only natural that the Language section in this article should have more detail in an article called [[Language of the New Testament]]. Now maybe that secondary article could use some work, but it still seems the natural article title.

:::I guess that possibly resolves the issue as regards this Talk page and this New Testament article. I haven't reverted Walter's edits to &quot;[[Greek primacy]]&quot; since he and any others are very welcome to participate in the discussion at [[Talk:Greek_primacy#Rename.3F]]. The [[Greek primacy]] -&gt; [[Language of the New Testament]] move, while de-POVforking per Wikipedia policy, does present an odd situation - under normal circumstances I would have done a straight move, and deleted the (history of Hellenism) &quot;Greek primacy&quot; (the real thing, not the Wikipedia editor's invention) content, which I'm not sure is notable, other than as a footnote to articles like [[Megasthenes]] etc. That would have carried the page edit history. And I'm still of two minds, as to whether that wouldn't be better and develop &quot;Greek primacy&quot; out of the stub left by a move-redirect. But am more than happy for others to input/play around on that. The important thing is that the POVfork has gone, while (?) maybe leaving room for a properly sourced description of the Syrian church's view of the canonicity of the Peshitta (?) to develop from the &quot;Aramaic primacy&quot; POVfork - which appears to probably be in line with exceptions to Wikipedia POVfork policy.

== Epistle vs. letter to the Hebrews ==

As far as I can see, the usual term these days for Hebrews is &quot;The Letter to the Hebrews&quot;.  Certainly that is the term used un the [[New Living Translation]] 1996 and the [[Good News Translation]] 1966.

I am aware that historiclly the Englich word for an item of correspondence was &quot;Epistle&quot; and works dating from the medeival period, such as the [[KJV]] 1611 will use &quot;Epistle&quot;, however I am not aware of any work penned in the last quarter century of so which describes Hebrews as an &quot;Epistle&quot;. [[User:Philadelphia 2009|Philadelphia 2009]] ([[User talk:Philadelphia 2009|talk]]) 11:18, 29 October 2011 (UTC)
:Actually, &quot;letter&quot; or some variant thereof has probably been the standard English word for an item of correspondence (nicely put phrase, by the way) since in or around the 14th century.  Before that, there was apparently used an Anglo-Saxon word, &quot;aerandgewrit&quot; (an  &quot;errand writ&quot;, it seems).  &quot;Epistle&quot; is merely an Anglicisation of the original Greek description for these New Testament works, &quot;epistole&quot;.  So, &quot;epistle&quot; is chosen when the editor wants to affect an English which is closer to the original language, and &quot;letter&quot; is chosen when the editor wants to use a more common English.--[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]] ([[User talk:Atethnekos|talk]]) 10:43, 15 December 2011 (UTC)

==Lingua Franca==
As English are today, so Greek and Latin used (once) to be the lingua franca of many regions, the former especially in Middle East and Asia Minor and Egypt, because of the greek colonies there and the greek speaking merchants e.t.c. e.t.c.. Most (not all) of the christian texts were written in greek because the authors intended to make them available and understood by the majority. Also greek was not like latin, the language of the overlords, so were more easily accepted and spoken as lingua franca from many nations. The authors ment also  to use a common language that would  not alieanate any nation of the mediterranean  world wishing it would not &quot;spark&quot; ethnic disputes. Finally, (though Greece is now widely known for its buncrupcy and misery, being an -ex does not mean you were never important:)  greek used to be for many centuries the language of the literate in that region. The article has sources and it is sad to see this &quot;cleanup&quot; sign[[User:Greekolga|Greekolga]] ([[User talk:Greekolga|talk]]) 15:37, 28 January 2012 (UTC)

== Problem of dates for 1 Tim., 1 John, and Acts. ==

This is in response to Hashem Sfarim's request for discussion on recent edits.  The following is in support of the assertion that describing texts to which Tertullian refers in ''Against Praxeas'' without qualification (including ''1 Timothy'', ''1 John'', and the ''Acts of the Apostles'') as 'first-century' is problematic. 

''Re'' ''Acts'':
:&quot;Thus I would place the date of the publication of Acts at about AD 110, though a release anytime within the first two decades of the second century (ca. AD 100-120) would have provided sufficient time for Polycarp's knowledge of the book.&quot; Parsons, Mikeal C. ''Acts''. Baker Academic, 2008, p. 17.

:&quot;The burden of this lengthy and multi-faceted argument and the weight of evidence marshaled in its support is that Acts should be dated c. 115.&quot; Pervo, Richard I. ''Dating Acts''. Polebridge Press, 2006, p. 346.
''Re'' ''1 Tim'':
:&quot;All this evidence, indirect and inconclusive as it is when examined piece by piece,  does seem to build up a fair case for dating the Pastorals at about A.D. 105.&quot; Hanson, Anthony T. ''The Pastoral Letters Commentary''.  Cambridge University Press, 1966, p. 10.

:&quot;If Paul is considered the more immediate author, the Pastorals are to be dated between the end of his first Roman imprisonment (Acts 28:16) and his execution under Nero (A.D. 63-67); if they are regarded as only more remotely Pauline, their date may be as late as the early second century. &quot; &quot;The First Letter to Timothy&quot; in ''NABRE-Compact''. Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 1373.
''Re'' ''1 John'':
:&quot;All this suggests that 1 John was known in patristic circles in the ''first half'' of the second century.  Earlier than this we cannot go with any confidence, since the alleged echoes in ''1 Clement'' are too doubtful to be of any use.  The patristic citations provide only an ''ante quem'': the Johannines might have been newly written when cited, or much older.&quot; Edwards, Ruth B. ''The Johannine Epistles''.  [[Continuum International]], 1996, p. 54.

:&quot;How much later Polycarp is writing than the author of 1J himself is uncertain.  The consensus of opinion is that this part of the Epistle dates from ''c.'' 135 AD.  If GJ is to be dated, as most scholars now believe, at the turn of the century, the Johannine Epistles may come about mid-way between the two dates&quot;  Houlden, James L.''The Johannine Epistles''.  Continuum International, 1994, p. 40.

To be clear, I wish to say, I don't mean to establish second-century authorship for any of these texts, but only to establish that verification in reliable sources for the claim of first-century authorship for them is problematic.  --&lt;font face=&quot;georgia&quot;&gt;[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;georgia&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;([[User talk:Atethnekos|Discussion]],&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Atethnekos|Contributions]])&lt;/font&gt; 21:18, 3 March 2012 (UTC)
:We should really in all disputed issues present both views - it seems to be the cases with most religious texts that there will be at least 2 views, traditional and critical. In the case of the Bible '''Authorship and Dating''' probably needs to be the 1st subheading, and have 2 sets of sources '''traditional view''' and '''critical view''' (in the relevant article and in summary overview here). It shouldn't be an either/or, unless one view is definitely [[WP:fringe]]. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 04:42, 4 March 2012 (UTC)</text>
