      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18560">{{kān-al-Islām}}'' {{lang|ar|أركان الإسلام}}; also ''{{transl|ar|DIN|arkān ad-dīn}}'' {{lang|ar|أركان الدين}} &quot;pillars of the [[al-Din|religion]]&quot;) are five basic acts in [[Islam]], considered obligatory by believers and are the foundation of Muslim life. These are summarized in the famous [[Hadith of Gabriel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |title=Pillars of Islam |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859?_hi=17&amp;_pos=3 |title=Pillars of Islam |work=[[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]]|publisher=[[Oxford University]] |location=United Kingdom |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/empires/islam/faithpillars.html |title=Five Pillars |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |location=United Kingdom |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;U-Calgary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/I_Transp/IO5_FivePillars.html |title=The Five Pillars of Islam |publisher=[[University of Calgary]] |location=Canada |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quran]] presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They make up Muslim life, prayer, concern for the needy, self purification and the pilgrimage. 
They are:
# the [[shahada]] (Islamic creed)
# daily prayers ([[salat]])
# almsgiving ([[zakāt]])
# fasting during [[Ramadan]] ([[sawm]])
# the [[pilgrimage to Mecca]] (''hajj'') at least once in a lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSU&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |title=arkan ad-din the five pillars of religion |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |location=United States |first=Richard |last=Hooker |date=July 14, 1999|accessdate=2010-11-17 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101203124633/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2122.html |title=Religions |accessdate=2010-08-25 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |location=United States |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minority [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] and majority [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] both agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/fivepillars.shtml |title=The Five Pillars of Islam |publisher=BBC |location=United Kingdom |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859?_hi=32&amp;_pos=3 Pillars of Islam ], Oxford Islamic Studies Online&lt;/ref&gt; but the Shi'a do not refer to them by the same name (see [[Ancillaries of the Faith]], for the [[Twelver]]s, and [[Seven pillars of Ismailism]]).

==The Five Pillars of Islam==

===Shahada===

''Shahada'' is the declaration of faith, i.e. the professing that there is only one [[God in Islam|God]] ''([[Allah]])'' (monotheism) and that [[Muhammad]] is God's messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.co.uk/article/opr/t125/e1859?_hi=32&amp;_pos=3 From the article on the Pillars of Islam in Oxford Islamic Studies Online]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Kalima'' is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: '''La 'ilaa-ha 'il-lal-laa-hu mu-ham-ma-dur ra-soo-lul-laah'' &quot;I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is His Servant and Messenger.&quot; Reciting this statement is obligatory in daily prayer ''(salāh)'' as well as on other occasions; it is also a key part in a person's conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=vHG_VulBdd4C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=convert+islam+shahada&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=-Au8TdKGM4jvsgad85mABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Matthew S. Gordon and Martin Palmer, '&amp;#39;Islam'&amp;#39;, Infobase Publishing, 2009| page= 87 |publisher=Books.google.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salat: Prayer===
{{main|Salat}}
[[File:Muslim men praying in Afghanistan-2010.jpg|thumb|[[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan politicians]] and foreign diplomats praying (making salat) at the [[Embassy of the United States, Kabul|U.S. Embassy in Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].]]
''Salat'' ''(ṣalāh)'' is the Islamic prayer. ''Salat'' consists of five daily prayers according to the Sunna; the names are according to the prayer times: ''[[Fajr]]'' (morning dawn), ''[[Zuhr]]'' (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (after-sunset), and ''[[Isha'a|'Isha']]'' (late evening, night). The Fajr prayer is performed before sunrise, Zuhr is performed in the midday after the sun has surpassed its highest above you, Asar is the evening prayer before sunset, Maghrib is the evening prayer after sunset and Isha is the night prayer. All of these prayers are recited while facing the Kaaba in Mecca. Muslims must wash themselves before prayer, this washing is called [[Wudu|wudū']] (&quot;purification&quot;). The prayer is accompanied by a series of set positions including; bowing with hands on knees, standing, prostrating and sitting in a special position (not on the heels, nor on the [[buttocks]]).

===Zakāt===
{{main|Zakāt }}
''Zakat'' or [[alms]]-giving is the practice of charitable giving by Muslims based on accumulated wealth, and is obligatory for all who are able to do so. It is considered to be a personal responsibility for Muslims to ease economic hardship for others and eliminate inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgeon (2003), p.258&lt;/ref&gt; Zakat consists of spending 2.5% of one's wealth for the benefit of the poor or needy, including slaves, debtors and travelers. A Muslim may also donate more as an act of voluntary charity (''[[sadaqah]]''), rather than to achieve additional divine reward.&lt;ref&gt;Zakat, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam Online''&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are five principles that should be followed when giving the Zakat:
# The giver must declare to Allah his intention to give the Zakat.
# The Zakat must be paid on the day that it is due.
# After the Offering, the payer must not exaggerate on spending his money more than usual means.
# Payment must be in kind. This means if one is wealthy then he or she needs to pay 2.5% of their income. If a person does not have much money, then they should compensate for it in different ways, such as good deeds and good behavior toward others.
# The Zakat must be distributed in the community from which it was taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ZAKAT.HTM Zakat Alms-giving]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

===Sawm of Ramadan: Fasting===
{{main|Sawm}}
[[File:Date-seller.jpg|thumb|[[Muslim]]s traditionally break their fasts in the month of [[Ramadan]] with [[Date palm#Fruit|dates]] (like those offered by this date seller in [[Kuwait City]]), as was the recorded practice ([[Sunnah]]) of [[Muhammad]].]]
Three types of fasting (''Sawm'') are recognized by the [[Qur'an]]: Ritual fasting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|183|end=187|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; fasting as compensation for repentance (both from [[sura]] [[Al-Baqara]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|196|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ascetic fasting (from [[Al-Ahzab]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|33|35|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fasting, ''Encyclopedia of the Qur'an'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual fasting is an obligatory act during the month of [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Caesar_1&quot;&gt;Farah (1994), p.144-145&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims must abstain from food and drink from dawn to dusk during this month, and are to be especially mindful of other sins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caesar_1&quot;/&gt; Fasting is necessary for every Muslim that has reached puberty (unless he/she suffers from a medical condition which prevents him/her from doing so.)&lt;ref&gt;talhaanjum_9&lt;/ref&gt;

The fast is meant to allow Muslims to seek nearness and to look for forgiveness Allah, to express their gratitude to and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, and to remind them of the needy.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (1998), p.90,91&lt;/ref&gt; During Ramadan, Muslims are also expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam by refraining from violence, anger, envy, greed, lust, profane language, gossip and to try to get along with fellow Muslims better. In addition, all obscene and irreligious sights and sounds are to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Tabatabaei (2002), p. 211,213&lt;/ref&gt;

Fasting during Ramadan is obligatory, but is forbidden for several groups for whom it would be very dangerous and excessively problematic. These include pre-pubescent children, those with a medical condition such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Old age|elderly people]], and [[pregnancy|pregnant]] or [[breastfeeding]] women. Observing fasts is not permitted for menstruating women. Other individuals for whom it is considered acceptable not to fast are those who are ill or traveling. Missing fasts usually must be made up for soon afterward, although the exact requirements vary according to circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_21.html#HEADING20 | title=For whom fasting is mandatory | publisher=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts | accessdate=2007-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|184|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan (2006), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Islam, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hajj: Pilgrimage to Mecca===
{{main|Hajj}}

The ''Hajj'' is a [[pilgrimage]] that occurs during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] to the holy city of Mecca. Every [[able-bodied]] Muslim is obliged to make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime .&lt;ref name=&quot;Caesar_2&quot;&gt;Farah (1994), p.145-147&lt;/ref&gt; When the pilgrim is around {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} from Mecca, he/she must dress in [[Ihram clothing]], which consists of two white sheets. Both men and women are required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. After a Muslim makes the trip to Mecca, he/she is known as a [[Hajji|hajj/hajja]] (one who made the pilgrimage to Mecca).&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica_India&quot;&gt;Hoiberg (2000), p.237–238&lt;/ref&gt; The main rituals of the Hajj include walking seven times around the [[Kaaba]]termed Tawaf , touching the [[Black Stone]] termed Istilam, traveling seven times between [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Mount Safa and Mount Marwah]] termed Saee, and symbolically [[Stoning of the Devil|stoning the Devil]] in [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]] termed Ramee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica_India&quot;/&gt;

The [[pilgrim]], or the ''haji'', is honoured in the Muslim community. Islamic teachers say that the Hajj should be an expression of devotion to Allah, not a means to gain social standing. The believer should be self-aware and examine their intentions in performing the pilgrimage. This should lead to constant striving for self-improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt (2005), p.48&lt;/ref&gt; A pilgrimage made at any time other than the Hajj season is called an ''[[Umrah]]'', and while not mandatory is strongly recommended. Also, they make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Jerusalem in their alms giving feast.

==Pillars of Shia Islam==
=== Twelvers ===
{{main|Ancillaries of the Faith}}

In [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]], there are ten practices that Shia Muslims must perform, called the ''Ancillaries of the Faith'' (''furūʿ al-dīn'').

#[[Salat]]
#[[Sawm]] of [[Ramadan]]
#[[Zakat]], similar to Sunni Islam, but only applies to cattle, silver, gold, dates, raisins, wheat, and barley.
#[[Khums]]: an annual taxation of one-fifth of all gain. Khums is paid to the [[Imamah (Shi'a Twelver doctrine)|Imams]] or to poor [[sayyid]]s (descendants of [[Ahl al-bayt]]).
#[[Hajj]]
#[[Jihad]]
#[[Commanding what is just]] and
#[[Forbidding what is evil]]. Based on the [[Quranic]] concept [[commanding right and forbidding wrong]].
#[[Tawalla]]: expressing love towards Muhammad's family, [[Ahl al-Bayt]].
#[[Tabarra]]: disassociation with those who oppose God and those who caused harm to Muhammad or his family.

=== Ismailis ===
{{main|Seven pillars of Ismailism}}
Ismailis have their own pillars which are as follows:
* [[Walayah]] (lit. &quot;Guardianship&quot;) denotes love and devotion to God, the prophets, the imām and the duʻāt (&quot;missionaries&quot;).
* [[Tawhid]], &quot;Oneness of God&quot;.
* [[Salat]]: Unlike Sunni and Twelver Muslims, Nizari Ismāʻīliyya reason that it is up to the current imām to designate the style and form of prayer.
* [[Zakat]]: with the exception of the [[Druze]], all Ismāʻīlī madhāhib have practices resembling that of Sunni and Twelver Muslims with the addition of the characteristic Shīʻa [[khums]].
* [[Sawm]]: Nizari and Mustaʻlī believe in both a metaphorical and literal meaning of fasting.
* [[Hajj]]: For Ismāʻīlīs, this means visiting the imām or his representative and that this is the greatest and most spiritual of all pilgrimages. The [[Mustaali]] maintain also the practice of going to Mecca. The Druze interpret this completely metaphorically as &quot;fleeing from devils and oppressors&quot; and rarely go to Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/ismailis.htm | title = Isma'ilism | accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jihad]] or &quot;Struggle&quot;: &quot;the Greater Struggle&quot; and the &quot;The Lesser Struggle&quot;.
