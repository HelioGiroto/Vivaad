'''Charles Wesley''' (18 December 1707 &amp;ndash; 29 March 1788) was an [[England|English]] leader of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] movement, son of Anglican clergyman and poet [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel Wesley]], the younger brother of Anglican clergyman [[John Wesley]] and Anglican clergyman [[Samuel Wesley (the Younger)]], and father of musician [[Samuel Wesley]], and grandfather of musician [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]]. Despite their closeness, Charles and his brother John did not always agree on questions relating to their beliefs. In particular, Charles was strongly opposed to the idea of a breach with the [[Church of England]] into which they had been ordained. Charles Wesley is chiefly remembered for the many [[hymn]]s he wrote. He ministered for part of his life in [[New Room, Bristol|The New Room Chapel]] in Bristol. His house, located nearby, can still be visited today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newroombristol.org.uk/ The New Room Bristol – John Wesley’s Chapel in the Horsefair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical details==
Charles Wesley was the son of [[Susanna Wesley]] and [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel Wesley]]. He was born in [[Epworth, England|Epworth]], [[Lincolnshire]], England, where his father was rector. He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and formed the &quot;Oxford Methodist&quot; group among his fellow students in 1727 which his elder brother, John joined in 1729 soon becoming its leader and moulding it to his own notions. [[George Whitefield]] also joined this group. After graduating with a Masters' in classical languages and literature, Charles followed his father and brother into the church in 1735. On 14 October 1735, Charles and his brother John sailed on ''The Simmonds'' from [[Gravesend, Kent]] for [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]] in [[British America]] at the request of the governor, [[James Oglethorpe]]. Charles was appointed Secretary of Indian Affairs and while John remained in Savannah, Charles went as chaplain to the garrison and colony at near-by [[St._Simons,_Georgia#Fort_Frederica|Fort Frederica]], [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simon's Island]], arriving there Tuesday, 9 March 1736 according to his journal entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesley.nnu.edu/charles_wesley/journal/1736a.htm The Wesley Center Online: The Journal Of Charles Wesley: 9 March – 30 August 1736&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, matters did not turn out well, and he was largely rejected by the settlers. In July 1736, Charles was commissioned to England as the bearer of dispatches to the trustees of the colony. On 16 August 1736, he sailed from [[Charleston, South Carolina]], never to return to the Georgia colony again.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sip.armstrong.edu/Methodism/wesley.html {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles lived and worked in the area around [[St Marylebone Parish Church]] and so, just before his death, he sent for its rector John Harley and told him &quot;Sir, whatever the world may say of me, I have lived, and I die, a member of the [[Church of England]]. I pray you to bury me in your churchyard.&quot;  On his death, his body was carried to the church by six clergymen of the Church of England, and a memorial stone to him stands in the gardens in Marylebone High Street, close to his burial spot. One of his sons, [[Samuel Wesley|Samuel]], became organist of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmarylebone.org.uk/history02.htm St. Marylebone Parish Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==
In April 1749, he married the much younger Sarah Gwynne (1726&amp;ndash;1822), also known as Sally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheetham95_97&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Cheetham | first=J. Keith | title=On the Trail of John Wesley | publisher=Luath Press | location=Edinburgh | year=2003 | pages=95–97 | isbn=1-84282-023-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of Marmaduke Gwynne, a wealthy [[Wales|Welsh]] magistrate who had been converted to Methodism by [[Howell Harris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry141_146&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Barry | first=Joseph | editor1-last=Temperley | editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Banfield | editor2-first=Stephen | title=Music and the Wesleys | publisher=University of Illinois Press | location=Urbana | year=2010 | pages=141–146 | isbn=978-0-252-07767-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved into a house in [[Bristol]] in September 1749.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheetham95_97&quot;/&gt; Sarah accompanied the brothers on their [[Evangelism|evangelistic]] journeys throughout Britain, until at least 1753. After 1756 Charles made no more journeys to distant parts of the country, mainly just moving between Bristol and London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rack45_46&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Rack | first=Henry D. | editor1-last=Newport | editor1-first=Kenneth G.C. |editor2-last=Campbell | editor2-first=Ted A. | title=Charles Wesley: Life, Literature and Legacy | publisher=Epworth | location=Peterborough | year=2007 | pages=45–46 | isbn=978-0-7162-0607-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1771 Charles obtained another house, in London, and moved into it that year with his elder son. By 1778 the whole family had transferred from Bristol to the London house, at 1 Chesterfield Street, [[Marylebone]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry141_146&quot;/&gt; where they remained until Charles' death and on into the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forsaith161_162&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Forsaith | first=Peter S. | editor1-last=Temperley | editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Banfield | editor2-first=Stephen | title=Music and the Wesleys | publisher=University of Illinois Press | location=Urbana | year=2010 | pages=161–162 | isbn=978-0-252-07767-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charles Wesley's House|house in Bristol]] still stands and has been restored,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheetham95_97&quot;/&gt; however the London house was demolished in the mid 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forsaith161_162&quot;/&gt;

Only three of the couple's children survived infancy: [[Charles Wesley junior]] (1757&amp;ndash;1834), Sarah Wesley (1759&amp;ndash;1828), who like her mother was also known as Sally and [[Samuel Wesley]] (1766&amp;ndash;1837) &lt;ref name=&quot;Temperley_ix_xv&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Temperley | first=Nicholas | editor1-last=Temperley | editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Banfield | editor2-first=Stephen | title=Music and the Wesleys | publisher=University of Illinois Press | location=Urbana | year=2010 | pages=ix–xv | isbn=978-0-252-07767-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their other children, John, Martha Maria, Susannah, Selina and John James are all buried in Bristol having died between 1753 and 1768.{See monument in garden on north side of junction of Lewis Mead and The Haymarket, Bristol} Both Samuel and Charles junior were musical [[child prodigies]] and, like their father, became [[organist]]s and [[composer]]s. Charles junior spent most of his career as the personal organist of the English Royal family, and Samuel became one of the most accomplished musicians in the world and often called &quot;the English Mozart.&quot;  Furthermore, Samuel Wesley's son, [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]], was one of the foremost British composers of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Temperley_ix_xv&quot;/&gt;

The lyrics to many more of Charles Wesley's hymns can be found on [[Wikisource]] and &quot;Hymns and Sacred Poems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/hymnsandsacredpo00wesliala Hymns and sacred poems, by Wesley, John and Wesley, Charles, Bristol, 1743]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 150 of his hymns are in the Methodist hymn book ''[[Hymns and Psalms]]'', including &quot;[[Hark, The Herald Angels Sing|Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]], and &quot;''The Church Hymn Book''&quot; (In New York and Chicago, USA, 1872) where &quot;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&quot; is published.

Many of his hymns are translated into other languages, and form the foundation for Methodist hymnals, as the Swedish ''Metodist-Episkopal-Kyrkans Psalmbok'' printed in Stockholm in 1892.

==Doctrine in Hymns==
Wesley's conversion had a clear impact on his doctrine, especially the doctrine of the Holy Spirit.  The change in doctrine can be seen in his sermons after 1738, but is most notable in his hymns written after 1738. From Charles published work “Hymns and Prayers to the Trinity” and in Hymn number 62 he writes “The Holy Ghost in part we know, For with us He resides, Our whole of good to Him we owe, Whom by His grace he guides, He doth our virtuous thoughts inspire, The evil he averts, And every seed of good desire, He planted in our hearts.” &lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Jason E. &quot;And We The Life Of God Shall Know&quot;: Incarnation And The Trinity In Charles Wesley's Hymns.&quot; Anglican Theological Review90.2 (2008): 329. MasterFILE Complete. Web. 14 Sept. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Here in this one short verse we have several doctrinal truths taught to us.  We have the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit,  the depravity of mankind, and our personal accountability to God. This was a vital contribution not only to Methodism, but to modern theology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, Jason E. &quot;Charles Wesley And The Revival Of The Doctrine Of The Trinity: A Methodist Contribution To Modern Theology.&quot; Charles Wesley. 278-298. Peterborough: Epworth Pr, 2007. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials. Web. 1 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Wesley is still remembered for his ministry while in St. Simon's Island, Georgia, by the South Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church; in 1950, the conference opened a Christian retreat center on the island by the banks of the Frederica River, designating it [[Epworth by the Sea]] in honor of his and John's birthplace. He is commemorated in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] on 2 March with his brother John.  The Wesley brothers are also commemorated on 3 March in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]]&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Book of Common Prayer]] and Administration of the Sacraments and Other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church: Together with the Psalter of David'' (The Seabury Press, 1979) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and on 24 May in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Anglican calendar]]. Charles is commemorated on 29 March in the Calendar of Commemorations by [[Order of St. Luke|The Order of Saint Luke]]; John is commemorated on 2 March; their parents are also commemorated.&lt;ref&gt;''For All The Saints: A Calendar of Commemorations for United Methodists'' ed. by Clifton F Guthrie (Akron, Ohio: Order of St Luke Publications, 1995, ISBN 1-878009-25-7) pgs. 77-78, 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his enduring hymnody, the [[Gospel Music Association]] recognized his musical contributions to the art of gospel music in 1995 by listing his name in the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]].

Wesley wrote two of the so-called [[Great Four Anglican Hymns]].

===Tercentenary===
24 May 2007 was celebrated as the tercentenary of Wesley's birth, with many celebratory events held throughout England, even though Wesley was in fact born in December 1707. The date of 24 May is known to Methodists as &quot;Aldersgate Day&quot; and commemorates the spiritual awakening of first Charles and then John Wesley in 1738. In particular, in the Village of Epworth, North Lincolnshire, at the Wesley Memorial Methodist Church, there was a flower festival, on 26 and 28 May, with flower arrangements representing some of Wesley’s hymns, such as ''O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing,'' ''And Can It Be,'' and ''O For a Trumpet Voice''.

In November 2007, [[An Post]], the Irish Post Office, issued a 78c stamp to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Wesley's birth.
