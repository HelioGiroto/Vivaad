'''Abraham''' ([[hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang-he-a|אַבְרָהָם|He-Avraham.ogg}}, [[Modern Hebrew language|Modern]]: ''{{Unicode|Avraham}}'', [[Greek language|Greek]]: Αβραάμ (Avraam), [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]]: ''{{Unicode|ʼAḇrāhām}}'', [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]]: ''Avrohom'' or ''Avruhom'', {{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;إبراهيم&lt;/big&gt;}} ''[[Ibrahim (name)|{{Unicode|Ibrāhīm}}]]'') is one of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical patriarchs]] and a major character in the [[Myth_of_origins#Founding_myth|founding myth]] of the [[Israelites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Wolf, Johann Christoph|year=1727|title= Bibliotheca Hebraea|location=Hamburg|publisher=Impensis Christiani Liebezeit|language=Latin and Hebrew|volume= 3|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=AA9RAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA17 17]|chapter=Abraham - Entry 43 (XLIII) }}&lt;/ref&gt; His story is told in chapters 11-25 of the [[Book of Genesis]], and he plays a prominent role in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].{{sfn|Andrews|1990|p=5}}

According to the account in Genesis, at the age of 75, Abram, following what he took to be God's command, took his wife [[Sarah|Sarai]], and his household and traveled from [[Haran_(biblical_place)|Haran]] to [[Shechem]] in [[Canaan]]. Abram enters into a covenant with God, signified by the rite of circumcision. Abram is now known as Abraham (“father of many nations”), and Sarai becomes Sarah. As Abraham and Sarah are childless, Sarah suggests Abraham have a child by her handmaid, Hagar. Hagar bears Abraham his firstborn, [[Ishmael]]. Abraham and Sarah later become the parents of [[Isaac]].

In Jewish and Christian tradition, Abraham is the father of the Israelites through his son Isaac. In Islamic tradition, Abraham is considered a [[prophet of Islam]], an ancestor of [[Muhammad]], through Ishmael. Muslims regard him as an example of the perfect Muslim, and the revered reformer of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the prophet of the Baha'i Faith, affirms the highest religious station for Abraham. In the [[New Testament]] Abraham is described as a man of faith. He is regarded as the [[patron saint]] of those in the hospitality industry.

==Narrative in Genesis==
The life of Abraham is related in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|11:26–25:10|HE}} of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of Abraham's departure by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]]]]

===Abram's origins and calling===
[[Terah]], the tenth in descent from [[Noah]], fathered Abram, [[Nahor]] and [[Haran]], and Haran fathered [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]. Haran died in his native [[Ur of the Chaldees]], and Abram married Sarai, who was barren. Terah, with &lt;!-- NOT Nahor, --&gt;Abram, Sarai and Lot, then departed for Canaan, but settled in a place named Haran, where Terah died at the age of 205. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|11:27–11:32|HE}})

[[File:Tissot Abram's Counsel to Sarai.jpg|thumb|left|230px|''Abram's Counsel to Sarai'' (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]

[[Yahweh|God]] appeared to Abram and told him to depart. After settling in Haran, where his father Terah died, God then told Abram to leave his country and his father's house for a land that He would show him, promising to make of him a great nation, [[blessing|bless]] him, make his name great, bless those who blessed him, and curse those who cursed him. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:1–3|HE}}) Following God's command, at age 75, Abram took his wife [[Sarah|Sarai]], his nephew Lot, and the wealth and persons that they had acquired, and traveled to [[Shechem]] in [[Canaan]].

===Abram and Sarai===
There was a severe famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, traveled south to &lt;!-- northern --&gt;[[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. En route, Abram told his wife Sarai, to only say that she was his sister, so that the [[Egypt]]ians would not kill him. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:10–13|HE}}) When they entered Egypt, the princes of Pharaoh praised Sarai's beauty to the [[Pharaoh]], and she was taken into his palace, and Abram was given provisions: &quot;oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels&quot;. However, God afflicted the Pharaoh and his household with great plagues, ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:14–17|HE}}) and after discovering that Sarai was also Abram's wife, the Pharaoh wanted nothing to do with them. He demanded that he and his household leave immediately, along with all their goods. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|12:18–20|HE}})

===Abram and Lot separate===
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Abraham and Lot separating (State 2).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Depiction of the separation of Abraham and Lot by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]].]]
{{main|Abraham and Lot's conflict}}
When they came back to the Bethel and Hai area, Abram's and Lot's sizeable numbers of livestock occupied the same pastures (&quot;and the [[Canaan]]ite and the [[Perizzite]] dwelled then in the land.&quot;) This became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each family's cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram graciously suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand or on the right hand, that there be no conflict amongst &quot;brethren&quot;. But Lot chose to go east to the plain of [[Jordan river|Jordan]] where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward Sodom. Abram went south to [[Hebron]] and settled in the plain of [[Mamre]], where he built another altar to worship [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]]. ({{bibleref|Genesis|13:1–18|KJV}})

=== Abram and Chedorlaomer ===
{{Main|Battle of the Vale of Siddim}}
[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|175px|Meeting of Abram and Melchizedek (painting circa 1464–1467 by [[Dieric Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]])]]

During the rebellion of the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Jordan River cities]] against [[Elam]], ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:1–9|HE}}) Abram's nephew, Lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading [[Elamite]] forces. The Elamite army came to collect booty from the spoils of war, after having just defeated the King of Sodom's armies. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:8–12|HE}}) Lot and his family, at the time, were settled on the outskirts of the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Kingdom of Sodom]] which made them a visible target. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|13:12|HE}})

One person that escaped capture came and told Abram what happened. Once Abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. Abram's elite force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army, who were already worn down from the [[Battle of the Vale of Siddim|Battle of Siddim]]. When they caught up with them at [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], Abram devised a battle strategy plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram's unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King [[Chedorlaomer]] at Hobah, just north of [[Damascus]]. They freed Lot, as well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:13–16|HE}})

Upon Abram's return, Sodom's King (whom we do not know since the previous king of Sodom, [[Bera (Bible)|Bera]], had perished in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:10|HE}}) came out to meet with him in the [[King's dale|Valley of Shaveh]], the &quot;king's dale&quot;. Also, [[Melchizedek]] king of Salem ([[Jerusalem]]), a priest of [[Elyon|God Most High]], brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God. Abram then gave Melchizedek a [[tithe|tenth]] of everything. The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people. Although he released the captives, Abram refused any reward from the King of Sodom, other than the share to which his allies were entitled. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|14:17–24|HE}})

=== Abrahamic covenant ===
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 024.png|thumb|left|200px|The Vision of the Lord Directing Abram to Count the Stars (woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]] from the 1860 ''Bible in Pictures'')]]

The word of God came to Abram in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars. Abram and God made a covenant ceremony, and God told of the future bondage of Israel in Egypt. God described to Abram the land that his offspring would claim: &quot;the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.” ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2015&amp;version=NIV Genesis 15])

===Abram and Hagar===
{{see also|Hagar}}
[[File:Foster Bible Pictures 0032-1.jpg|thumb|right|''Abraham, [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar]]'', imagined here in a Bible [[illustration]] from 1897.]]

Abram and Sarai were trying to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations since it had already been 10 years of living in Canaan, and still no child had been born from Abram's seed. Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaid, [[Hagar]], for Abram to consort with so that she may have a child by her, as a wife. Abram consented and had sexual intercourse with Hagar. The result of these actions created a fiery relationship between Hagar and Sarai. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:1–6|HE}})

After a harsh encounter with Sarai, Hagar fled toward [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]]. En route, an angel of the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Lord]] appeared to Hagar at the well of a spring. He instructed her to return to Sarai for she will bear a son who “shall be a wild ass of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.” She was told to call her son: [[Ishmael]]. Hagar then referred to God as “[[El Roi|El-roi]]”, meaning that she had gone on seeing after God saw her. From that day, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. She then did as she was instructed by returning to Abram in order to have her child. Abram was eighty-six years of age when Ishmael was born. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|16:7–16|HE}})

===Abraham and Sarah===
{{Bibleverse||Genesis|17|HE}} records the inauguration of Abram into God's covenant that was initiated thirteen years ago, as was stated in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|15|HE}}. Abram is now ninety-nine when God declares Abram's new name: “Abraham, a father of many nations.” Abram then received the instructions for the inauguration rite into God's covenant because the time was approaching for him to have a son by his wife, Sarai. The initiation rite was that in order to be part of this “great nation”, whether by bloodline or inducted, every male must be [[Religious male circumcision|circumcised]] otherwise it was a breach of contract. Then God declared Sarai's new name: “[[Sarah]]” and blessed her. Immediately after Abram's encounter with his God, he had his entire household of men, including himself and Ishmael, circumcised. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:1–27|HE}})

===Abraham's three visitors===
 [[File:Tissot Abraham and the Three Angels.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Abraham and the Three Angels (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]

Not long afterward, during the heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the [[Pistacia palaestina|terebinths]] of [[Mamre]]. He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and [[Bowing (social)|bowed]] to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread of which they assented. Abraham rushed to [[Sarah]]'s tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:1–8|HE}})

One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired to Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child for her age as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.

===Abraham's plea===
{{Main|Sodom and Gomorrah|Lot (Biblical)}}
[[File:Tissot Abraham Sees Sodom in Flames.jpg|thumb|left|198px|Abraham Sees Sodom in Flames (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by James Tissot)]]

After eating, Abraham and the three visitors got up. They walked over to the peak that overlooked the ''Cities of the Plain'' to discuss the fate of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abraham's nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors leave for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to the Lord and pleaded incrementally with Him (from fifty persons to less) that 'if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city?' For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:17–33|HE}})

When the two visitors got to Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abraham's nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two “men” stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lot's home and demanded that they bring out his guests so that they may “know” them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters to the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break Lot's doors down to get to his male guests,&lt;ref&gt;({{Bibleverse||Genesis|19:1–9|HE}})&lt;/ref&gt; thus confirming the “outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah” and sealing their doom. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|19:12–13|HE}})

Early the next morning, Abraham awoke and went to the elevation that looked over the River Jordan plain, at the very spot where he stood before God, the day prior. From his vantage point, he saw what became of the cities of the plain as “dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.” ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|19:27–29|HE}}) This meant that there was not even ten righteous people in any of those cities. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:32|HE}})

===Abraham and Abimelech===
Abraham settled between [[Kadesh (South of Israel)|Kadesh]] and [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]] in the land of the [[Philistine]]s. While he was living in [[Gerar]], Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King [[Abimelech]] had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.({{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:1–7|HE}})

Early next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: &quot;And yet indeed ''she is'' my sister; she ''is'' the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Gen.|20:12|9|Genesis 20:12}}) Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah's vindication before all. Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household, since the {{LORD}} had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:8–18|HE}})

After living for some time in the land of the Philistines, [[Abimelech]] and [[Phicol]], the chief of his troops, approached Abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well. Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servant's aggressive attacks and the seizing of Abraham's well. Abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident. Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech. Further, to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof. Because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: [[Beersheba]]. After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to [[Philistia]], Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and called upon &quot;the name of the {{LORD}}, the everlasting God.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Gen.|21:22–34|9|Genesis 21:22&amp;ndash;34}})

===Birth of Isaac===
As had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis18_sml.htm#genesis_18:14 Genesis 18:14]), Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, now a hundred years old, named the child &quot;[[Isaac]]&quot; (Hewbrew yitschaq, laughter) and circumcised him when he was eight days old. ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis21_sml.htm#genesis_21:4 Genesis 21:4]) In doing so, the second son of Abraham became the first to undergo the covenant-sign of circumcision at the age God had commanded. ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis17_sml.htm#genesis_17:12 Genesis 17:12]) For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, &quot;God hath made me to laugh. Every one that heareth will laugh with me.&quot; ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis21_sml.htm#genesis_21:6 Genesis 21:6]-[http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis21_sml.htm#genesis_21:7 7])

Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion. During the celebration, however, Sarah found Ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac. ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis21_sml.htm#genesis_21:8 Genesis 21:8]-[http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis21_sml.htm#genesis_21:9 9]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibler.org/glossary/isaac.html |title=www.Bibler.org - Dictionary - Isaac |date=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abraham and Ishmael ===
Abraham was fond of his son [[Ishmael]] who had grown up to be thirteen years old when his son [[Isaac]] was born. However, with Sarah, things were never the same with Ishmael's mother [[Hagar]], back in her life. Now that Sarah had finally borne her own child, she could no longer stand the sight of either [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] or [[Ishmael]]. When the teenager was jesting around, Sarah told Abraham to send the two of them away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife's words and sought the advice of his God. The Lord told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. God reassured Abraham that &quot;in Isaac shall seed be called to thee.&quot; ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:12|HE}}) He also said that Ishmael would make a nation, &quot;because he is thy seed&quot;, too. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:9–13|HE}})

Early the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread and water and sent them away. The two wandered the wilderness of [[Beersheba]] until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst in tears. The boy then called to God and upon hearing him, an [[angel]] of God confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation. A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled [[Archery|archer]] living in the wilderness of [[Desert of Paran|Paran]]. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her native country, the land of Egypt. ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|21:14–21|HE}})

===Abraham and Isaac===
{{Main|Binding of Isaac}}
{{see also|Isaac#Binding of Isaac}}

At some point in [[Isaac]]'s youth, Abraham was commanded by God to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of [[Moriah]]. The patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that God told him of. He commanded the servants to remain while he and Isaac proceeded alone into the mount. Isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. Along the way, Isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was, to which Abraham replied &quot;God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering&quot;. Just as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he was interrupted by &quot;the angel of the {{LORD}}&quot;, and he saw behind him a [[Domestic sheep|ram]] &quot;caught in a thicket by his horns&quot;, which he sacrificed instead of his son. For his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity. After this event, Abraham went to [[Beersheba]]. ({{Bibleref2|Gen.|22:1-19|9|Genesis 22:1&amp;ndash;19}})

===Later years===
Sarah, the only woman in the Hebrew scriptures whose age is stated,&lt;ref&gt;The ages of some other women can be deduced or approximated. Eve was created the same day as Adam, so when Seth was born when Adam had lived 130 years, Eve had lived as long also, short a number of hours.&lt;/ref&gt; was 127 years old when she died. Abraham buried her in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] (also called the Cave of Machpelah), near [[Hebron]] which he had purchased, along with the adjoining field, from Ephron the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] and laid her to rest in the cave. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|23|9|Genesis 23:1&amp;ndash;20}})

After the death of Sarah, Abraham took another wife, a [[concubine]] named [[Keturah]], who bore him six sons: [[Zimran]], [[Jokshan]], [[Medan (son of Abraham)|Medan]], [[Midian (son of Abraham)|Midian]], [[Ishbak]], and [[Shuah]]. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|25:1-6|9|Genesis 25:1&amp;ndash;6}})

Abraham lived 175 years, and &quot;died in a good old age&quot;.  The Bible says he was buried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs|cave of Machpelah]]. ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|25:7-10|9|Genesis 25:7&amp;ndash;10}})

==Abraham in religious traditions==
In Islamic and Jewish traditions, Abraham is referred to as &quot;our Father&quot; (Hebrew: ''Avraham Avinu'', Arabic: ''abeena Ibraheem''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahadees.com/arabic-surah-22-78.html Qu'ran 22:78]&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Jewish and Christian tradition, Abraham is the father of the Israelites through his son [[Isaac]], whose mother was [[Sarah]]. His oldest son is [[Ishmael]], whose mother is [[Hagar]], Sarah's Egyptian handmaiden.

In Islamic tradition, Abraham is considered a [[prophet of Islam]], the ancestor of [[Muhammad]], through his son Ishmael, whose mother is [[Hagar]]   (هاجر).

Abraham's life can be read in the weekly [[Torah]] reading portions, predominantly in the [[parashot]]: [[Lech-Lecha (parsha)|Lech-Lecha]] ( '''לֶךְ-לְךָ''' ), [[Vayeira (parsha)|Vayeira]] ( '''וַיֵּרָא''' ), [[Chayei Sarah (parsha)|Chayei Sarah]] ( '''חַיֵּי שָׂרָה''' ), and [[Toledot (parsha)|Toledot]] ( '''תּוֹלְדֹת''' )

Rabbinic Judaism faced a seeming contradiction with Abraham, in that he lived before the laws of the [[Torah]] had been revealed to [[Moses]].  Therefore, Abraham would not have been knowledgeable of all of the Torah's commandments, besides the instruction of practicing circumcision. The rabbis (traditional teachers and interpreters of the Torah), however, interpreted the narratives of the Torah in Genesis to say that Abraham had in fact known and practiced the Law in its entirety, although there are different interpretations as to how exactly Abraham practiced different aspects of the law.

11th and 12th century Rabbis [[Rashi]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] agree that Abram's native homeland was [[Ur Kaśdim]], better known as ''Ur of the Chaldees'', a [[Mesopotamian]] location settled by the descendants of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, 2005&quot;&gt;Singer, Binyamin. &quot;Ramban: Bereishis &amp; Shemos&quot;, Vol. 1: ''Ramban: Classic Themes in Nachmanides' Chumash Commentary'', 2005 (ISBN 1568713428, ISBN 978-1-56871-342-7), p. 89-91&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern Jewish studies identify this location to be the same as the [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;Keene, Michael. This is Judaism, 1996, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scharfstein, Sol. Jewish History and You, 2002, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; However, this [[Persian Gulf]] city in [[Iraq]] is only a candidate among others to be the actual Ur Kaśdim, as well as the most popularly debated one since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan. ''The Flood Myth'', 1988, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Urfa]] (classical Urha &lt;Ur of Haran) in [[Turkey]], not too far from [[Haran]] also claims to the birthplace of the Patriarch. [[Urfa]] is famous for its monuments, pools and shrines associated with Patriarch Abraham.

Rabbi [[Nahmanides]], known as ''the Ramban'', was a medieval Jewish scholar of the 13th century who disagreed with Rashi and Ibn Ezra concerning Abram's birthplace. The Ramban states that because Ur Kaśdim was settled by Ham's descendants, this could not be Abram's birthplace as he was a descendant of [[Shem]]. However, everyone does agree that Abram's family under the headship of his father, [[Terah|Terach]], had all lived in Ur Kaśdim before being called to move to [[Land of Canaan|Canaan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, 2005&quot;/&gt;

The three Rabbis also agree that Terach's native homeland was Charan, the biblical place known as [[Haran]] in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|11:31,32|NIV}}, where the ''House of Terach'' was located.{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|12:1|NIV|Gen.12:1}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, 2005&quot;/&gt; Since this settlement was established by Shem's descendants, only Ramban assumed that Charan had to be Abram's birthplace. He further concluded that Terach and his three sons eventually moved from Charan to Ur Kaśdim, and then later by God's command, they headed to Canaan. Of course, they stopped back at Terach's hometown of Charan, where the father stayed there rather than going to Canaan after all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, 2005&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Abraham window.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The Abraham stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina]]

In the Christian Bible (New Testament), Abraham's significance lies in his unwavering faith. In Romans 4, Abraham's merit is associated less with obedience to the divine will than in his faith in God's ultimate grace. It is his faith that provides him the merit for God's having chosen him for the covenant in the first place, and the covenant becomes one of faith. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/cmje/issues/Abraham.pdf Firestone, Reuven, Encyclopedia of World History -Abraham]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The New Testament also sees Abraham as an obedient man of God, and Abraham's interrupted attempt to offer up Isaac is seen as the supreme act of perfect faith in God. &quot;By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, 'In Isaac your seed shall be called', concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.&quot; ({{Bibleverse||Hebrews|11:17–19|KJV}}) The imagery of a father sacrificing his son is seen as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of [[God the Father]] offering [[Son of God|his Son]] on [[Golgotha]].

The traditional view in Christianity is that the chief promise made to Abraham in ''Genesis'' 12 is that through Abraham's seed all the people of earth would be blessed. Notwithstanding this, [[John the Baptist]] specifically taught that merely being of Abraham's seed was no guarantee of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|3:1–9|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise in Genesis is considered to have been fulfilled through Abraham's seed, Jesus. 

The Roman Catholic Church calls Abraham &quot;our father in Faith&quot;, in the [[Eucharistic prayer]] of the [[Roman Canon]], recited during the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (see [[Abraham in the Catholic liturgy]]). He is also commemorated in the [[calendar of saints|calendars of saints]] of several denominations: on 20 August by the [[Maronite Church]], 28 August in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with the full [[daily office|office]] for the latter), and on 9 October by the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]]. He is also regarded as the [[patron saint]] of those in the hospitality industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holweck&quot;&gt;*[[Frederick George Holweck|Holweck, F. G.]], ''A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints''. St. Louis, MO: B. Herder Book Co. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] commemorates him as the &quot;Righteous Forefather Abraham&quot;, with two [[feast day]]s in its [[Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]]. The first time is on 9 October (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], 9 October falls on 22 October of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]), where he is commemorated together with his nephew &quot;Righteous Lot&quot;. The other is on the &quot;Sunday of the Forefathers&quot; (two Sundays before Christmas), when he is commemorated together with other [[Genealogy of Jesus|ancestors of Jesus]]. Abraham is also mentioned in the [[Divine Liturgy]] of [[Saint Basil the Great]], just before the Anaphora. Abraham and Sarah are invoked in the prayers said by the priest over a newly married couple at the [[Sacred Mysteries|Sacred Mystery]] of [[Christian views of marriage#View of the Eastern Orthodox Church|Crowning]] (i.e., the Sacrament of Marriage).

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic views on Abraham}}
[[File:Abraham sacrificicing his son, Ishmael Abraham cast into fire by Nimrod.JPG|thumb|Abraham sacrificicing his son, Ishmael Abraham cast into fire by Nimrod]]
Abraham (&quot;Ibrahim&quot;) is an important figure in the [[Quran]], mentioned in 25 chapters, briefly or in detail.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Ibrahim''&lt;/ref&gt;
Muslims regard him as a [[prophet]] and [[patriarch]], the archetype of the perfect Muslim, and the revered reformer of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mecca, Martin Lings, c. 2004&quot;&gt;''Mecca'', Martin Lings, c. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic traditions consider Abraham the father of Islam (which is also called ''millat Ibrahim'', the &quot;religion of Abraham&quot;), and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the Oneness of God. When Ibrahim (Abraham) was asked for sacrifice and took Ismael to the place when he was about to use the knife, God placed a sheep under his hand. From that day onward, every Eid (Eid Al Adha) once a year Muslims around the world slaughter a sheep to follow the path of Ibrahim that is called [[Qurban]]i sacrifice.

==Scholarly criticism==

===Origins and composition===
{{see also|Form criticism}}

Scholarship for more than two centuries have agreed that the [[Torah]], in which the Patriarchal stories are found, was drawn together from different literary sources. However, any particular identification or dating of the textual sources have been strongly debated.{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=x}}

It is widely held by modern biblical scholarship that the Patriarchs, including Abraham, are not clearly and unambiguously attested in the [[Hebrew Bible]] earlier than the [[Babylonian exile]]. This has led modern scholars to propose that the entire ''Torah'', which include the stories of Abraham, all originated from literary circles either during the Babylonian period of the late 6th century BCE, to the 5th century Persian rule,{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2009|p=38-39}} or as late as [[Hellenistic]] times.{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=x}} Under these dominions, the Patriarchal stories are seen as ''hope'' for the Jewish people when Jerusalem, the Temple, and the Davidic kingship were all but destroyed. [[YHWH]]'s dealings with their ancestors provided hope for a future in which an ancestral foundation could be built.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xx9YzJq2B9wC 2003 p.246&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Xx9YzJq2B9wC&amp;dq=Rainer+Albertz,+%22Israel+in+exile%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HtlsTK7mFpO8sAPKzYmgCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Albertz, R, &quot;Israel in exile: the history and literature of the sixth century B.C.E.&quot; (Society of Biblical Literature, 2003)] p.246&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Abraham served as a model for those who would return to [[Judea|Judah]].{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2009|p=38-39}}

There are however, modern supporters for an earlier dating. [[Robert Alter]] interjects that the [[Hebrew language]] evolved over nine centuries of biblical literary activity, from the ''First Commonwealth'' (1000 BCE to 586 BCE) to the late Persian/Hellenistic periods.{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=x}} Both Alter and [[Ronald Hendel]] argue that there is very little Hebrew in the Torah that could bear a late dating to the 6th-4th century BCE eras, due to their linguistic differences.{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=xi}}

===Setting===
{{see also|Narrative criticism}}

Abraham first appears as Abram, until he is renamed by [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:5|HE}}. Both names are [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]], and similar and even identical names have been found in texts dating from the 14th century BCE to the 7th. The text of Genesis suggests that the new name means &quot;father of multitudes&quot;, which indicates the significance Abraham had for the authors, but in fact the meaning is unknown.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=22-36}}

There is basic agreement that Abraham's connection with Haran, Shechem and Bethel is secondary and originated when he became identified as the father of Jacob and ancestor of the northern tribes; his association with Mamre and Hebron, on the other hand (in the south, in the territory of Jerusalem and Judah), suggest that this region was the original home of his religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;CkRz5pfxz0C pp.3-4&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dictionary+of+deities+and+demons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aFute0p0_x&amp;sig=ES0qi7jA4zyCXLIMs3sac2cyvOg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wSYLTavKBsnprAfZuenxCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Abraham&amp;f=false &quot;Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible&quot;, K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst (eds) (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing), pp.3–4]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Masoretic text|standard text of the Hebrew Bible]] places Abraham's birth 1,948 years after the Creation, or 1948 AM ([[Anno Mundi]], &quot;Year of the World&quot;). The two other major textual traditions have different dates, the translated Greek [[Septuagint]] putting it at 3312 AM and the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of the Torah]] at 2247 AM. All three agree that he died at the age of 175.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grisda.org/origins/07023.htm |title=G.F. Hasel, &quot;Chronogenealogies in the Biblical History of Beginnings&quot; |publisher=Grisda.org |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been over two hundred attempts to match the biblical chronology to dates in history, two of the more influential being the traditional Jewish dates (Abraham lived 1812 BCE to 1637 BCE), and those of the 17th century Archbishop [[James Ussher]] (Abraham lived 1976 BCE to 1801 BCE); but the most that can be said with some degree of certainty is that the standard Hebrew text of Genesis places Abraham in the earlier part of the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03731a.htm |title=&quot;Biblical Chronology&quot;, Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 November 1908 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historicity===
{{see also|Textual criticism}}
Since the 1970s, efforts to reconstruct a patriarchal age for Israel's past have come to an end as most historians of [[ancient Israel]] have abandoned the conclusions of earlier scholarship,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=57}} as there is nothing specific in the Genesis stories that can be definitively linked to known history in or around Canaan in the early second millennium BCE. There is no solid evidence for any date during that period, as none of the kings mentioned are known, neither the anonymous Pharaoh who enlists [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] into his services. Some scholars argue that historical inaccuracies exist, such as: the reference to Abimelech &quot;King of the [[Philistine]]s&quot;, when the Philistines had not settled in [[Palestine]] until the later end of the millennium. Abraham coming from &quot;Ur of the Chaldeans&quot;, when the Babylonians were not known as Chaldeans until a much later time. [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] identified as an [[Aramaeans|Aramean]], when Arameans did not become a known political entity before the 12th century BCE.{{sfn|McNutt|1999|p=41}}

==Abraham in the arts==

=== Paintings ===
Paintings on the life of Abraham tend to focus on only a few incidents: The sacrifice of Isaac; Meeting Melchizedek; Entertaining the three angels; Hagar in the desert; and a few others.&lt;ref name = &quot;Abeart&quot; &gt;For a very thorough online collection of links to artwork about Abraham see: [http://www.jesuswalk.com/abraham/abraham-artwork.htm Artwork Depicting Scenes from Abraham's Life] Accessed 25 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many artists have been inspired by the life of Abraham: [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528), [[Caravaggio]] (1573–1610), [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] (Dutch, 1606–1669) created at least seven works on Abraham, [[Rubens|Petrus-Paulus Rubens]] (1577–1640) did several, [[Donatello]], [[Raphael]], [[van Dyck|Philip van Dyck]] (Dutch painter, 1680–1753), [[Marc Chagall]] did at least five on Abraham, Gustave Doré (French illustrator, 1832–1883) did six, [[Claude Lorrain]] (French painter, 1600–1682), [[James Jacques Joseph Tissot]] (French painter and illustrator, 1836–1902) did over twenty works on the subject.&lt;ref name = &quot;Abeart&quot;/&gt;

The [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] depicts a set of biblical stories, including Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. These sculpted scenes are on the outside of a marble [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] [[sarcophagus]] used for the burial of [[Junius Bassus]]. He died in 359. This sarcophagus has been described as &quot;probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_early_christian_studies/v001/1.1.rutgers.html Journal of Early Christian Studies], Leonard Victor Rutgers, ''The Iconography of the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus'' (review of Malbon book), Volume 1, Number 1, Spring 1993, pp. 94–96; for Janson it is also the &quot;finest Early Christian sarcophagus&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], was rediscovered in 1597,&lt;ref&gt;or 1595, see Elsner, p. 86n.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]) in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The base is approximately 4 × 8 × 4 feet. The Old Testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of Christ's sacrifice in the [[New Testament]], in an early form of [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. Just to the right of the middle is Daniel in the lion's den and on the left is Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.

'''''Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael''''' by [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]]. The artist created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models. The human condition was central to his concerns. On several occasions, Segal turned to the Old Testament as a source for his imagery. This sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by Abraham when Sarah demanded that he expel Hagar and Ishmael. In the sculpture, the father's tenderness, Sarah's rage, and Hagar's resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions. The sculpture was donated to the Miami Art Museum after the artist's death in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiartmuseum.org/collection-selected-segalgeorge.asp Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael.

''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' (original [[Danish language|Danish]] title: ''Frygt og Bæven'') is an influential philosophical work by [[Søren Kierkegaard]], published in 1843 under the pseudonym ''Johannes de silentio'' (''John the Silent''). Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate. … Anxiety is freedom's possibility, and only such anxiety is through faith absolutely educative, because it consumes all finite ends and discovers all there deceptiveness.
