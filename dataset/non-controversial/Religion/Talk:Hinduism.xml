== The beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era (1500–500 BCE) are called the &quot;historical Vedic religion&quot;. ==

If they are called so then it is a very serious mistake. Aryans probably had not gone to the Indo-Gangetic plain or South India during this time, and the indigenous Gods and Goddesses (Shiva, Rama, Krishna, Durga, Ganesh, and Kartikeya) along with the village deities must have reigned supreme as they do now. Who remembers the temporary ascendency of the Aryan Gods and Goddesses? [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] ([[User talk:Aupmanyav|talk]]) 12:07, 28 October 2012 (UTC)

Historical Vedic Religion is what you find in the Vedas. [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] ([[User talk:Aupmanyav|talk]]) 16:28, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

I do not think Wikipedia likes wrong information on its pages. [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] ([[User talk:Aupmanyav|talk]]) 14:36, 9 November 2012 (UTC)
:What exactly is the &quot;wrong information&quot;? The section is arranged chronologically. Historical Vedic religion came before Upanishadic or Puranic streams of Hinduism. [[User:CorrectKnowledge|&lt;font style=&quot;color:white;background:#167FF7;font-family:sans-serif;&quot;&gt;'''Correct Knowledge'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:CorrectKnowledge|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#167FF7;background:white;font-family:sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;«৳alk»&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:21, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

== Initiation ==

In Indian religion what matters is initiation. Initiation in a marga of a Dharma such as some Guru initiating a disciple or anyone accepting him as a Guru in some Bhakti marga, etc.[[Special:Contributions/202.138.106.1|202.138.106.1]] ([[User talk:202.138.106.1|talk]]) 12:37, 5 November 2012 (UTC)

Shih. I do not have a guru. I have never been initiated. I do not follow bhakti marg. Actually I am an atheist and advaitist. Do I not remain a hindu? [[Special:Contributions/59.178.61.185|59.178.61.185]] ([[User talk:59.178.61.185|talk]]) 14:26, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

== The Conversion Section ==

This section was removed with the comment:
 Deliberate and hypocritical topic of &quot;Conversion&quot; added to Hinduism article. Hinduism is the last religion to believe in
 conversions. Wiki page for &quot;Christianity&quot;, &quot;Jews&quot;, &quot;Muslims&quot; dont speak about Conversions, while they waged wars for religious
 convers)
On balance I believe that it is useful '''because''' the attitude to conversion is different to other religions. I also think it contains useful information. I have therefore restored it. -- [[User:Q Chris|Q Chris]] ([[User talk:Q Chris|talk]]) 13:19, 6 November 2012 (UTC)
: Isn't the section [[WP:UNDUE]] in the article for a religion, which does not have &quot;Clear concepts of conversion, evangelization, and proselytization&quot;, and play &quot;a marginal role in practice.&quot;? Also, FA [[Islam]] does not cover it. --[[User:Redtigerxyz|&lt;font color = &quot;red&quot; &gt;Redtigerxyz&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt; [[User talk:Redtigerxyz|Talk]] &lt;/sup&gt; 14:43, 6 November 2012 (UTC)

::I'm not sure. I think its a bit like the [[Switzerland]] article explaining that it doesn't have a single head of state, it is the absence of clear concepts of conversion that make it unique. I have restored the header and &quot;see also&quot; for now. -- [[User:Q Chris|Q Chris]] ([[User talk:Q Chris|talk]]) 15:20, 6 November 2012 (UTC)

::: Empty sections are discouraged. Putting in See also. --[[User:Redtigerxyz|&lt;font color = &quot;red&quot; &gt;Redtigerxyz&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt; [[User talk:Redtigerxyz|Talk]] &lt;/sup&gt; 17:40, 6 November 2012 (UTC)

== Sanaatan Dharma should not redirect to Hinduism ==

Dear All

While searching for Sanaatan Dharma on wikipedia, the query redirects itself to Hinduism which should not be the case.

The word Hindu, as many of you would be aware, is a distortion of the word Sindhu which basically signifies a geographical region. This 
also has been the primary source of confusion why people define Hinduism as a way of life and Hindus as inhabiting a particular region.

However, the systems, beliefs etc belong to what is known as Sanaatan Dharma (which means eternal or universal law). None of the scriptures 
like Upanishads, Mahabharat etc use the word hindu. But the people who are called hindu today derive their faith and beliefs from these
sacred texts. These texts, which elaborate the Sanaatan Dharma, are the fountainhead of the way the Hindu people live.

It is indeed appropriate to disengage the two. As an example, suppose your neighbor is a foreigner whose someone whose is not easy to pronounce. Often times, you will start calling them a name which is convenient to you or that person will change their name altogether. It is very similar case here. 

Thanks and Regards

Upanishads and Mahabharata do not use the word India, but that is the name in English that we have selected for our country. It is because of common usage and is not an abuse. [[User:Aupmanyav|Aupmanyav]] ([[User talk:Aupmanyav|talk]]) 14:34, 9 November 2012 (UTC)</text>
