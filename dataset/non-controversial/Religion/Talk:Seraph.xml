==Lucifer==
Is this quote saying that Lucifer was counted among the seraphim correct ? I 
have seen an exact copy of this sentence on alot of sites, so I don't know if
it originated here or if it was copied from somewhere else. 
I believe Lucifer is an Archangel. If any reference for this is needed,
take a look at the following site :
http://www.steliart.com/angelology_fallen_archangel.html

Searching for more references shouldn't be more difficult.

-- Luisfelipe

Lucifer, as far as the Tanakh is concerened, doesn't exist. What christians call Lucifer is Helel Ben Shachar, or son of the mourning star (aka the light bringer). This is located in Isaiah 14:12 only, and concerns a worship of another God ([[Phaëton]]).

As far as christian mythology goes, Jerome's Vulgate translation of Isaiah 14:12 has made Lucifer the name of the principal fallen angel, who must lament the loss of his original glory as the morning star. This image at last defines the character of Lucifer; where the Church Fathers had maintained that lucifer was not the proper name of the Devil, and that it referred rather to the state from which he had fallen; St. Jerome transformed it into Satan's proper name.

::Lucifer is a specifically Christian concept. I understand (I don't know this) Lucifer is regarded as a Seraph in the Christian angelarchy, but Lucifer does not appear in the Jewish angelarchy as a Jewish angel (at all). This is one of a number of differences between the two religions's perspectives on angels. Judaism doesn't interpret Isaiah 14:12 as a reference to Lucifer, this interpretation is a Christian one.

== Merge this article  with [[Hierarchy of angels]] ==

Some of this material could be used to amplify a section on seraphim in the Heirarchy of Angels article.
:The linked list there links the reader here. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 21:56, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::Oppose merge. The [[Hierarchy of Angels]] article describes a specifically Christian angelarchy. But there's a Jewish angelarchy. Seraphim appear in both Judaism and Christianity, and are somewhat different in each, although with overlap. The Seraphim article mentions both Jewish and Christian (as well as New Age) perspectives.  --[[User:Shirahadasha|Shirahadasha]] 04:13, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

== It mixes new age with classical tradition ==

The phrase:

''The Seraphim are primarily concerned with vibrational manifestations which keep Divinity in perfect order. They have been described as being the angels of love, light and fire.''

''They help to carry positive energy through the orders of the angels to us in the physical realms.''

Implies new age connotations to the biblical seraphim that do not actually exist. In a specialized section pertaining to the Christian doctrine of seraphim, this is out of place.

:I agree, and the statement: &quot;Seraphim, as classically depicted, can be identified by their having six wings radiating from the angel's face at the center&quot; is just as bogus. What &quot;classical&quot; depiction is being thought of here? An album cover I imagine. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 00:13, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

*Interestingly enough, [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' offers a description of the nature of the Seraphim:

:The name &quot;Seraphim&quot; does not come from charity only, but from the excess of charity, expressed by the word '''ardor''' or '''fire'''. Hence Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii) expounds the name &quot;Seraphim&quot; according to the properties of fire, containing an excess of heat. Now in fire we may consider three things.

:First, the movement which is upwards and continuous. This signifies that they are borne inflexibly towards God.

:Secondly, the active force which is &quot;heat,&quot; which is not found in fire simply, but exists with a certain sharpness, ''as being of most penetrating action, and reaching even to the smallest things, and as it were, with superabundant fervor; whereby is signified the action of these angels, exercised powerfully upon those who are subject to them, rousing them to a like fervor, and cleansing them wholly by their heat.
''
:Thirdly we consider in fire the quality of clarity, or brightness; which signifies that these angels have in themselves an '''inextinguishable light''', and that they also ''perfectly enlighten others''. (Emphasis added)

The objectionable quote referenced &quot;angels of love, light and fire.&quot; Aquinas directly mentions (note the bold text above) the nature of Seraphim being &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;light,&quot; and he utilizes the term &quot;ardor&quot; which references intense love. (Run a quick [dictionary.com] search on ardor.)

Further, Aquinas references a penetrating action which rouses, clenses, and enlighten those subject to them; that sounds an awful lot like &quot;carry[ing] positive energy&quot; and &quot;keep[ing] Divinity in perfect order.&quot;

Aquinas, beyond being a well respected figure in Christianity, can by no means be described as &quot;new age.&quot; The ''Summa'' is certainly an acceptable reference, and I think the quote, with some revision, can successfully be integrated. [[User:Essjay|Essjay]] 08:50, May 31, 2005 (UTC)

== [[Seraphim in popular culture]] ==

I reverted a deletion of this section because I believe deletion of a section like this should be discussed first. However, as things presently stand there is some reason to support such a deletion. The section is essentially unsourced. It consists of little more than lists of characters named or called &quot;Seraph&quot; who appear in various video games, with no discussion. No evidence that Seraph is anything more than a name (Analogy: characters named &quot;Smith&quot; and &quot;Miller&quot; aren't necessarily examples of the role of millers in popular culture.) --[[User:Shirahadasha|Shirahadasha]] 19:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

:Absolutely. I was too precipitate in deleting this list of largely unlinked and irrelevant cruft. [[Seraphim in popular culture]] would make a neat package. We'll give it a header paragraph, repeat that paragraph here, with a link to [[Seraphim in popular culture]]  --and &quot;open the pod bay door Hal&quot;. Then those who want to diddle about with it may do so, and we don't have to watch. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 20:50, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

== Unsourced material ==
Hello, removed this material to this talk page pending [[WP:A|sources]]. Note that a similar list was removed in the [[Cherub]] article. Want to make sure that each entity is identified as a Seraph by some source, and that we identify the POV involved. The identity and nature of [[Bible|Biblical]] figures and angelic beings can be controversial so [[WP:A]] and [[WP:NPOV]] is especially important.

== [[Etymology]] ==
could we please get some modern, scientific and theologically neutral etymological information on the word seraph?  ive come across some claims elsewhere that it means something about fiery serpents.  im sceptical and would appreciate any illumination.  [[User:FaustX|ƒaustX]] 19:39, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

: Just wanted to say that I agree. There doesn't appear to be any other etymology listed on the Internet than that 'seraph' is from ''srp'' = ''to burn'' [[User:FreezBee|FreezBee]] 17:38, 8 November 2007 (UTC)

: The word seraphim appears with the word nachashim (serpents) in Numbers (21:6) and Deuteronomy (8:15); to describe venomous snakes. In Numbers (21:8), seraph is used alone, in place of the word nachash to describe the image of a snake that Moses creates. So, while seraphim is certainly derived from 'srp'-'to burn' it did seem to acquire an association with snakes (especially venomous snakes), and on occasion became a synonym for the same. This was possibly due to the agony (&quot;burning&quot;) of snake bites. Apart from the vision of the heavenly court, Isaiah uses the word Seraph twice (14:29 and 30:6), both times to describe a flying monster and both times in close association with words to describes snakes ('Nachash'-serpent, in 14:29, and 'Efeh'-viper, in 30:6). So, the association with serpents is not without merit, though this is probably not the origin of the word.[[User:ElijahBenedict|ElijahBenedict]] 17:57, 19 May 2009 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Definitions: 'The Seraphim srpym (fiery winged serpents) are no doubt connected with, and inseparable from, the idea &quot;of the serpent of eternity - God,&quot; as explained in Kenealy's Apocalypse. But the word cherub also meant serpent, in one sense, though its direct meaning is different; because the Cherubim and the Persian winged gruphes &quot;griffins&quot; - the guardians of the golden mountain - are the same, and their compound name shows their character, as it is formed of kr (kr) circle, and avb &quot;aub,&quot; or ob - serpent - therefore, a &quot;serpent in a circle.&quot; And this settles the phallic character of the Brazen Serpent, and justifies Hezekiah for braking it. (see II. Kings, 18,4). [....]' [Based on: T.S.D. Vol. 1, by H.P. Blavatsky (1999 edition), p. 364 (+ footnote)].

:Let me try a few. In my romanian language, the word &quot;sireap&quot; means &quot;fast or untamed&quot; horse who eats in mythology/fairytails only burning coal(carbune=coal). Also is the name of &quot;alba&quot;(white) star from the horses forehead. Another version: &quot;S&quot; could come from &quot;sase&quot;(six) while &quot;arp&quot; from &quot;aripa&quot;(wing)=6 wings. &quot;Sarba&quot; is folk dance with people joining hands and rotating. &quot;Sarpe&quot; means serpent. &quot;A sorbi&quot; means &quot;to sip&quot;(like horses are drinking water. Another similarity is &quot;corbi&quot;(ravens), birds associated usually with Odhin's/Saturn's throne in european myths. The &quot;solar&quot; Asura/Æsir is also a good connection. The Harpies could also be connected. Bigshotnews 04:18, 15 April 2011 (UTC)
:Please do not insert your comments inside other editor's comments.  Seraph is from a Semitic language, Romanian is an Indo-European language, so it's unlikely that Seraph has an Indo-European root.  [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 14:38, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

== Trisagion vs. Sanctus ==

I corrected the article to say that the hymn that Seraphim chant is the &quot;Sanctus&quot; -- it had said &quot;Trisagion,&quot; but this wasn't quite right, given that the Sanctus is the name for the hymn that quotes Ezekiel and Revelation and begins &quot;Holy, Holy, Holy,&quot; whereas the Trisagion (as per the article on it) is somewhat similar but quite distinct, beginning &quot;Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy Immortal One . . .&quot;[[Special:Contributions/113.22.49.31|113.22.49.31]] ([[User talk:113.22.49.31|talk]]) 15:39, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

=='Dragon-shaped'==
&quot;They appear also in the Christian Gnostic text On the Origin of the World, described as &quot;dragon-shaped angels&quot;.[5]&quot;

That's a bit misleading, because the concept of dragon/''draco''/δράκων in late classical antiquity, the era of that text, didn't imply the winged, limbed, fire-breathing, rather dinosaur-like creature it does in the modern mind; it simply means a (usually large) snake or serpent. 'Dragons' in classical myth may be winged, fire-breathing, etc, but not particularly more often than other important animals (horses, bulls etc.) [[Special:Contributions/165.91.166.236|165.91.166.236]] ([[User talk:165.91.166.236|talk]]) 19:24, 13 December 2010 (UTC)</text>
