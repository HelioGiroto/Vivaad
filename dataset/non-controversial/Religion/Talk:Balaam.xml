== Roman Numerals? ==

Why is this page using Roman Numerals to indicate chapters of the Bible?  Is there some sort of precedant for this? --[[User:Terrible Tim|Terrible Tim]] 00:19, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Quranic Verse [7:175-176], not taking about Balaam ==

Some Imams and scholars say it is the false prophet named Balaam mentioned in the bible [book of Numbers 22] ,but that is the scholars point of views .The Fact is there is NO ONE Hadith of (Muhammad) himself says that, Balaam  exist let alone  to recite his story, knowing the fact that the verse Start with {And recite (O Muhammad) to them the story of [him]} an order to to keep telling them a bout him.

This Man in Verse [7:175-176] is not Balaam.[[User:86.145.71.200|86.145.71.200]] 11:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

==How is this?==
''&quot;This motif is completely dissimilar to the Biblical tradition.  According to Olrik, therefore, an identity of the two is impossible despite the identical names. [§147, 149]'' How is a conclusion of Olrik (1922) dismissing this 1967 discovery? Perhaps we're simply in denial. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 19:49, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

==McCarter?==
The &quot;Balaam and Other Gods&quot; section of the article concludes, &quot;McCarter elaborates that she is to cover the sky and reduce the world to complete darkness.&quot;  What does this refer to?  Either some commentator named McCarter has been cut out of the rest of the article (and even then the sentence is written in a confusing manner), or someone thought it was funny to give the goddess a Scottish name.  If it's the former, someone please fill in the rest of the story. --MRH, April 2, 2007

==Not up to Wikipedia Standards==
In general this article is not up to wikipedia standards and should be revised.

== False prophet to which God actually gave limited prophecy. ==

I read elsewhere, I remember quite well, that Balaam was 'one of many' false prophets who the God of Israel spoke to only at night. So while &quot;the one true God&quot; still conversed with them in the same way as a true prophet, for whatever reason they were ill natured. This article seems to mention something about speaking of pagan deities and visions at night and nothing beyond, I'm sure there is a source floating around out there that speaks of it in this strange fashion that I'm giving it here; a &quot;false&quot; prophet 'ordained' (in whatever qualified capacity) by the true God.

== why is the article not under bil'am? ==

that is the spelling in hebrew.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/79.182.159.118|79.182.159.118]] ([[User talk:79.182.159.118|talk]]) 07:41, 13 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Bil'am is the transliteration of the original Hebrew, while Wikipedia is an English encyclopedia.  The [[Anglicized]] version of his name is used here, similar to to articles on [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], [[Sarah]], [[Rebecca]], [[Laban]], [[Aaron]] and [[Joshua]]. '''[[User:DRosenbach|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;DRosenbach&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:DRosenbach|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] | [[Special:Contributions/DRosenbach|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Contribs&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 22:08, 13 July 2008 (UTC)
::Then that's where you'll find it in the Hebrew Wikipedia. In English, the educated reader looking for this material will search &quot;[[Balaam]]&quot;. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] ([[User talk:Wetman|talk]]) 22:06, 13 July 2008 (UTC)

== Balaam and the Donkey: Text does not match title ==

The text in this section does not give a summary or analysis of the story of Balaam and the Donkey (as the title would imply), but rather goes at length into the various references to Balaam in the Bible and their provenance.  It seems to me that the section is therefore either (A) grossly mislabeled, or (B) ridiculously incomplete. [[User:TheCormac|TheCormac]] ([[User talk:TheCormac|talk]]) 16:49, 19 February 2011 (UTC)

== Balaam's behavior and the heresy of Peor ==

The article currently says:
:::Due to his behavior with the Midianites, the Rabbis interpret Balaam as responsible for the behavior during the heresy of Peor
Actually, I believe that this could also be the result of the text in the Torah itself - specificly [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 31:16, which specificly suggests that Balaam was responsible for this.
