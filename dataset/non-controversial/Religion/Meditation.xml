'''Meditation''' is a practice in which an individual trains the [[mind]] and/or induces a [[Consciousness#States of consciousness|mode of consciousness]] to realize some benefit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation |author=Lutz et. al |pmc=2693206 |year=2008 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pmid=18329323 |last2=Slagter |first2=HA |last3=Dunne |first3=JD |last4=Davidson |first4=RJ |pages=163–9 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.01.005 |journal=Trends in cognitive sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be argued that meditation is a goal in and of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan. &quot;11 _10-4-1 Meditation.&quot; ''Eastern Wisdom: Zen in the West &amp; Meditations.'' The Alan Watts Foundation. 2009. MP3 CD. @4:45&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''meditation'' refers to a broad variety of practices (much like the term ''sports''), which range from techniques designed to promote relaxation, contacting spiritual guides, building internal energy (chi, ki, prana, etc.), receiving psychic visions, getting closer to God, seeing past lives, taking astral journeys, and so forth, to more technical exercises targeted at developing compassion,&lt;ref&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison (2008, March 27). Compassion Meditation Changes The Brain. ScienceDaily. Retrieved November 1, 2012, from http://www.sciencedaily.com­/releases/2008/03/080326204236.htm&lt;/ref&gt; love, patience, generosity, forgiveness and more far-reaching goals such as effortlessly sustained single-pointed concentration,&lt;ref&gt;Gen. Lamrimpa (author); &quot;Calming the Mind.&quot; Snow Lion Publications. 1995. Book on Buddhist methods for developing single pointed concentration.&lt;/ref&gt; single-pointed analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Gen.Lamrimpa (author); &quot;Calming the Mind.&quot; Snow Lion Publications. 1995. Includes basic instructions for analysis of reality.&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Nirvana|indestructible sense of well-being]] while engaging in any and all of life's activities. Thus, it is essential to be specific about the type of meditation practice under investigation. 

Failure to make such distinctions would be akin to the use of the word 'sport' to refer to all sports as if they were essentially the same. For example, the overly generic description of meditation as a mere relaxation technique becomes problematic when one attends to the details of many practices. In contrast, we should think about the term &quot;Meditation&quot; as referring to several neighborhoods of New Age practices, shamanistic lucid dreaming and astral journeying, theistic-concentration meditations ([[Devekut|clinging to god]], [[Gnosis#Greek_Orthodox|Gnosis]]), contemplation, visualization, hypnotherapy, aromatherapy, chakra clearing, kundalini, breathing exercises, training of single-pointed attention, training in mindfulness, training in single-pointed analysis, vision questing, chi building exercises, and so on, developed for various ends.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;MacMillan Reference Encyclopedia of Buddhism&quot;, the article entitled, &quot;Meditation&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dozensgs&gt;There are many different types of activity commonly referred to as &quot;''meditation''&quot;, at least dozens, or perhaps many more: For descriptions of some of the more prominent approaches, both eastern and western, see Goleman's (1988) ''Meditative Mind'', ISBN 0-87477-833-6 and Shear's (2006) ''Experience of Meditation'', ISBN 978-1-55778-857-3, both listed in this article's bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation often involves an internal effort to self-regulate the mind in some way. It may be done [[Meditative postures|sitting]], or in an active way, for instance Buddhist monks involve awareness in their day-to-day activities as a form of mind-training. [[Prayer beads]] or other ritual objects are commonly used during meditation in order to keep track of or remind the practitioner about some aspect of the training. Meditation may involve generating an emotional state for the purpose of analyzing that state &amp;mdash; such as anger, hatred, etc. &amp;mdash; or cultivating particular mental response to various phenomena, such as compassion. The term &quot;meditation&quot; can refer to the state itself, as well as to practices or techniques employed to cultivate the state.&lt;ref name=feurstein06/&gt; In brief, there are dozens of specific styles of meditation practice;&lt;ref name=dozensgs/&gt; the word ''meditation'' may carry different meanings in different contexts. Meditation has been practiced since antiquity as a component of numerous religious traditions and beliefs.

==Etymology==
The English ''meditation'' is derived from the  [[Latin languages|Latin]]  ''[[:wikt:meditatio|meditatio]]'', from a verb ''[[:wikt:meditor|meditari]]'', meaning &quot;to think, contemplate, devise, ponder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''An universal etymological English dictionary'' 1773, London, by Nathan Bailey ISBN 1-00-237787-0. Note: from the 1773 edition on Google books, not earlier editions.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--why on earth would you cite a 1773 dictionary to establish a straightforward Latin loan??--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Old Testament]], ''hāgâ'' (Hebrew: הגה) means to sigh or murmur, and also, to meditate. When the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek, ''hāgâ'' became the Greek ''melete''. The Latin Bible then translated ''hāgâ''/''melete'' into ''meditatio''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 ISBN 0-8091-3660-0 page 88&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of the term ''meditatio'' as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to the 12th-century monk [[Guigo II]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oblate Life'' by Gervase Holdaway, 2008 ISBN 0-8146-3176-2 page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan word for meditation &quot;Gom&quot; means &quot;to become familiar with ones self&quot; and has the strong implication of training the mind to be familiar with states that are beneficial: concentration, compassion, correct understanding, patience, humility, perseverance, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://viewonbuddhism.org/meditation_theory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from its historical usage, the term ''meditation'' was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as ''dhyāna'' [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|in Buddhism]] and [[Dhyana in Hinduism|in Hinduism]], which comes from the [[Sanskrit]] root ''dhyai'', meaning to contemplate or meditate.&lt;ref name=feurstein06&gt;[[Georg Feuerstein|Feuerstein, Georg]]. [http://www.santosha.com/moksha/meditation1.html &quot;Yoga and Meditation (Dhyana).&quot;] Moksha Journal. Issue 1. 2006. ISSN 1051-127X, OCLC 21878732&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The verb root &quot;dhyai&quot; is listed as referring to &quot;contemplate, meditate on&quot; and &quot;dhyāna&quot; is listed as referring to &quot;meditation; religious contemplation&quot; on page 134 of {{Cite book

The history of meditation is intimately bound up with the religious context within which it was practiced.&lt;ref name=&quot;George S. Everly page 199&quot;&gt;''A clinical guide to the treatment of human stress response'' by George S. Everly, Jeffrey M. Lating 2002 ISBN 0-306-46620-1 page 199&lt;/ref&gt;
Even in prehistoric times civilizations used repetitive, rhythmic chants and offerings to appease the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, M. 1998, ''The effect of strong religious beliefs on coping with stress'' Stress Medicine.

&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have even suggested the hypothesis that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation,&lt;ref name=wallace06&gt;Buddhist scholar [[B.

Everly page 199&quot;/&gt; Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed in [[Taoist]] China and [[early Buddhism|Buddhist]] India.&lt;ref name=&quot;George S. Everly page 199&quot;/&gt; 

In the west, by 20 BCE [[Philo of Alexandria]] had written on some form of &quot;spiritual exercises&quot; involving attention (prosoche) and concentration&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, Pierre; Arnold I. Davidson (1995) ''Philosophy as a way of life'' ISBN 0-631-18033-8 pages 83-84&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 3rd century [[Plotinus]] had developed meditative techniques.

The [[Pāli Canon]], which dates to 1st century BCE considers Indian [[Buddhist]] meditation as a step towards salvation.&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China'' by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005 ISBN 0-941532-89-5 pages 15&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Buddhism was spreading in China, the [[Vimalakirti Sutra]] which dates to 100 CE included a number of passages on meditation, clearly pointing to [[Zen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Buddhism : a History: India and China'' by Heinrich DumIulin, James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter 2005 ISBN 0-941532-89-5 pages 50&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] introduced meditation to other Asian countries, and in 653 the first meditation hall was opened in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;''Zen Buddhism : a History: Japan'' by Heinrich Dumoulin, James W.

[[Western Christian]] meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western [[Christian meditation]] progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks called [[Lectio Divina]], i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a &quot;ladder&quot; were defined by the monk [[Guigo II]] in the 12th century with the Latin terms ''lectio'', ''meditatio'', ''oratio'', and ''contemplatio'' (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western [[Christian meditation]] was further developed by saints such as [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and [[Teresa of Avila]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Spirituality: A Historical Sketch'' by George Lane 2005 ISBN 0-8294-2081-9 page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S.

By the 18th century, the study of [[Buddhism in the West]] was a topic for intellectuals. The philosopher [[Schopenhauer]] discussed it,&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, Peter (April 1993) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism]. ''Philosophy East and West Volume 43, Number 2,'' pp. 255-278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Voltaire]] asked for toleration towards Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;''Enlightenment and reform in 18th-century Europe'' by Derek Edward Dawson Beales 2005 ISBN 1-86064-949-1 page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The first English translation of the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'' was published in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shakya&quot;&gt;Shakya, Tsering &quot;Review of ''Prisoners of Shangri-la'' by Donald Lopez&quot;.

Secular forms of meditation were introduced in India in the 1950s as a Westernized form of Hindu meditative techniques and arrived in the United States and Europe in the 1960s. Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement.&lt;ref&gt;''A clinical guide to the treatment of human stress response'' by George S. Everly, Jeffrey M. Lating 2002 ISBN 0-306-46620-1 page 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' by David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden, Stanton Marlan 2009 ISBN page 559&lt;/ref&gt; Both spiritual and secular forms of meditation have been subjects of scientific analyses. [[Research on meditation]] began in 1931, with scientific research increasing dramatically during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;noetic studies of meditation&quot; /&gt; Since the beginning of the '70s more than a thousand studies of meditation in English-language have been reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;noetic studies of meditation&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter= 1 |title=The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: Scientific Studies of Contemplative Experience: An Overview |first=Michael |last=Murphy |url=http://www.noetic.org/research/medbiblio/ch1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 60 years of scientific study, the exact mechanism at work in meditation remains unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;George S.

As early as 1971, [[Claudio Naranjo]] noted that &quot;The word 'meditation' has been used to designate a variety of practices that differ enough from one another so that we may find trouble in defining what ''meditation'' is.&quot;&lt;ref name=naranjo72&gt;Claudio Naranjo (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, ''On the Psychology of Meditation''.

Some of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been the need to recognize the particularities of the many various traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro to consciousness&quot; /&gt; There may be differences between the theories of one tradition of meditation as to what it means to practice meditation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunne @ Stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=John Dunne's speech |url=http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between multiple various traditions, which have grown up a great distance apart from each other, may be even starker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunne @ Stanford&quot;/&gt; The defining of what 'meditation' is has caused difficulties for modern scientists.

The table shows several definitions of meditation that have been used by influential modern reviews of research on meditation across multiple traditions. Within a specific context, more precise meanings are not uncommonly given the word &quot;meditation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--- UNCLEAR IF EXAMPLES ARE NEEDED... ERRING ON THE SIDE OF INCLUSION... ---&gt;Besides Lectio and Yoga, examples include [[Herbert Benson]]'s (1975) ''Relaxation Response'' ISBN 0-380-00676-6, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]'s (1990) ''Full Catastrophe Living'' ISBN 0-385-29897-8, and [[Eknath Easwaran]]'s (1978) ''[[Passage Meditation]]'' ISBN 978-1-58638-026-7&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 'meditation', is sometimes the translation of ''meditatio'' in Latin, which is the third of four steps of ''[[Lectio Divina]]'', an ancient form of Christian prayer. 'Meditation' may also refer to the second of the three steps of [[Yoga]] in [[Patanjali]]'s ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'', a step called ''dhyāna'' in Sanskrit.
Meditation may refer to a mental or spiritual ''state'' that may be attained by such practices,&lt;ref name=feurstein06/&gt; and may also refer to the practice of that state.

This article mainly focuses on meditation in the broad sense of a type of discipline, found in various forms in many cultures, by which the practitioner attempts to get beyond the reflexive, &quot;thinking&quot; mind&lt;ref name=oknondiscursive&gt;This does not mean that all meditation seeks to take a person beyond ''all'' thought processes, only those processes that are sometimes referred to as &quot;discursive&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; (see Shapiro, 1982/1984; Bond, Ospina, et al, 2009; Appendix B, pp. 279-282 in Ospina, Bond, et al, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes called &quot;discursive thinking&quot;&lt;ref name=shapiro82discursive&gt;An influential definition by Shapiro (1982; republished 1984, 2008) states that &quot;''meditation refers to a family of techniques which have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way and an attempt not to dwell on discursive, ruminating thought''&quot; (p. 6, italics in original); the term &quot;discursive thought&quot; has long been used in Western philosophy, and is often viewed as a synonym to logical thought ({{cite book |title=Reading neoplatonism : Non-discursive thinking in the texts of plotinus, proclus, and damascius

In their final consideration, all 7 experts regarded this feature as an &quot;essential&quot; component of meditation; none of them regarded it as merely &quot;important but not essential&quot; (p. 234, Table 4). (This same result is presented in Table B1 in Ospina, Bond, et al, 2007, p. 281)&lt;/ref&gt;) into a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state. The terms &quot;meditative practice&quot; and &quot;meditation&quot; are mostly used here in this broad sense. However, usage may vary somewhat by context &amp;mdash; readers should be aware that in quotations, or in discussions of particular traditions, more specialized meanings of &quot;meditation&quot; may sometimes be used (with meanings made clear by context whenever possible).

===Western typologies===
Ornstein noted that &quot;most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief&quot;.&lt;ref name=ornstein72&gt;Robert Ornstein (1972, originally published 1971), in: Naranjo and Orenstein, ''On the Psychology of Meditation''. New York: Viking. LCCN 76149720&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} This means that, for instance, while monks engage in meditation as a part of their everyday lives, they also engage the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings, that go along with their meditative practices. These meditative practices sometimes have similarities (often noticed by Westerners), for instance concentration on the breath is practiced in both Zen, Tibetan and Theravadan contexts, and these similarities or 'typologies' are noted here.

[[File:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bodhidharma]] practicing [[zazen]].]]
Progress on the &quot;intractable&quot; problem of defining meditation was attempted by a recent study of views common to seven experts trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (clinical or Eastern-derived&lt;!---cite review noting almost all research has examined eastern-derived or clinical practices---&gt;) forms of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;members were chosen on the basis of their publication record of research on the therapeutic use of meditation, their knowledge of and training in traditional or clinically developed meditation techniques, and their affiliation with universities and research centers.. Each member had specific expertise and training in at least one of the following meditation practices: [[kundalini yoga]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], relaxation response, [[mindfulness-based stress reduction]], and [[vipassana]] meditation&quot; (Bond, Ospina et al, 2009, p. 131); their views were combined using the &quot;The [[Delphi method|Delphi technique]]... a method of eliciting and refining group judgments to address complex problems with a high level of uncertainty&quot; (p. 131).&lt;/ref&gt; The study identified &quot;three main criteria... as essential to any meditation practice: the use of a defined technique, logic relaxation, and a self-induced state/mode. Other criteria deemed important &lt;nowiki&gt;[but not essential]&lt;/nowiki&gt; involve a state of psychophysical relaxation, the use of a self-focus skill or anchor, the presence of a state of suspension of logical thought processes, a religious/spiritual/philosophical context, or a state of mental silence&quot;.&lt;ref name=bond09/&gt;{{rp|135}} However, the study cautioned that &quot;It is plausible that meditation is best thought of as a natural category of techniques best captured by '[[family resemblance]]s'... or by the related [[Prototype (linguistics)|prototype model of concepts]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=bond09/&gt;{{rp|135}}&lt;ref&gt;The full quotation from Bond, Ospina et al (2009, p. 135) reads: &quot;It is plausible that meditation is best thought of as a natural category of techniques best captured by '[[family resemblance]]s' ([[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], 1968) or by the related [[Prototype (linguistics)|prototype model of concepts]] ([[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], 1973; [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] &amp; Mervin, 1975).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern psychological research, meditation has been defined and characterized in a variety of ways; many of these emphasize the role of [[attention]].&lt;ref name=goleman88/&gt;&lt;ref name=walsh06&gt;{{Cite journal

In the West, meditation is sometimes thought of in two broad categories: concentrative meditation and [[mindfulness]] meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, A., Slagter, H. Dunne, J. and Davidson, R. (8 March 2010). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2693206/ Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation]. &quot;The term ‘meditation’ refers to a broad variety of practices...In order to narrow the explanandum to a more tractable scope, this article uses Buddhist contemplative techniques and their clinical secular derivatives as a paradigmatic framework (see e.g., 9,10 or 7,9 for reviews including other types of techniques, such as Yoga and Transcendental Meditation). Among the wide range of practices within the Buddhist tradition, we will further narrow this review to two common styles of meditation, FA and OM (see box 1–box 2), that are often combined, whether in a single session or over the course of practitioner’s training. These styles are found with some variation in several meditation traditions, including Zen, Vipassanā and Tibetan Buddhism (e.g. 7,15,16)....The first style, FA meditation, entails voluntary focusing attention on a chosen object in a sustained fashion. The second style, OM meditation, involves non-reactively monitoring the content of experience from moment to moment, primarily as a means to recognize the nature of emotional and cognitive patterns&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These two categories are discussed in the following two paragraphs, with concentrative meditation being used interchangeably with focused attention and mindfulness meditation being used interchangeably with open monitoring,

A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called ''concentrative meditation''), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called ''mindfulness meditation''), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness.&lt;ref name=bond09/&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref&gt;The full quote from Bond, Ospina et al (2009, p. 130) reads: &quot;The differences and similarities among these techniques is often explained in the Western meditation literature in terms of the direction of mental attention (Koshikawa &amp; Ichii, 1996; Naranjo, 1971; Orenstein, 1971): A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called ''concentrative mediation''), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called ''mindfulness meditation''), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness (Orenstein, 1971).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;One style, Focused Attention (FA) meditation, entails the voluntary focusing of attention on a chosen object.

==Religious and spiritual meditation==

===Bahá'í Faith===
In the teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] meditation, along with [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayer]], is one of the primary tools for spiritual development,&lt;ref name=&quot;bahai-mediation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Prayer, Meditation, and Fasting | accessdate = 2011-07-01 | url = http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-7.html | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it mainly refers to one's reflection on the words of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith-meditation&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Meditation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 243–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[prayer]] and meditation are linked where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith-prayer&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Prayer |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith-meditation&quot;/&gt;

The [[Bahá'í teachings]] note that the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one's understanding of the words of God, and to make one's soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith-meditation&quot;/&gt; and that both prayer and meditation are needed to bring about and to maintain a spiritual communion with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |editor= Hornby, Helen (Ed.)  |year= 1983  |title= Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File  |publisher= Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India  |isbn= 81-85091-46-3 |url= http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance | page = 506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhist meditation}}

[[File:Buddha.jpg|thumb|right|Dynamic tranquility: the Buddha in [[contemplation]].]]
[[Buddhist meditation]] refers to the meditative practices associated with the religion and philosophy of Buddhism. Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]s pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] and [[Nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation &quot;includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim.&quot; Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: &quot;To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]....&quot;  A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: &quot;'''Meditation''' &amp;ndash; general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'&quot;   Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are &quot;of a more preparatory nature&quot; (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bhāvanā]]''&lt;ref&gt;The [[Pāli]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bhāvanā'' literally means &quot;development&quot; as in &quot;mental development.&quot; For the association of this term with &quot;meditation,&quot; see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20.  As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in &quot;The Greater Exhortation to Rahula&quot; (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|ānāpānassatiṃ, rāhula, bhāvanaṃ bhāvehi.}}''  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: &quot;Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bhāvana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing]].&quot; (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''jhāna''/''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:2005.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), entry for &quot;jhāna&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;]; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&amp;nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word &quot;zen&quot; from [[Sanskrit]] &quot;dhyāna.&quot;  [[Pali Text Society|PTS]] Secretary Dr. Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:
:&quot;...[T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as 'altered states of consciousness'. In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed 'meditations' ([Skt.:] ''dhyāna'' / [Pali:] ''jhāna'') or 'concentrations'  (''[[samādhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world.&quot; (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Manmatha Nath Dutt, there is hardly any difference between mainstream Hinduism's Dhyana, Dharana and Samadhi with the Buddhist Dhyana, Bhavana, Samadhi, especially as both require following the precepts (nayas and niyamas.)

Buddhist meditation techniques have become increasingly popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up for a variety of reasons. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices &amp;mdash; such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'') &amp;mdash; that are used across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Theravāda]] tradition alone, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to  the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], &quot;there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another &amp;mdash; and by whatever name &amp;mdash; are found in all the major Buddhist traditions&quot; (p. 92).  The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: &quot;The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s&quot; (p. 227).&lt;/ref&gt; Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of contemporary school-specific &quot;classics&quot; include, from the Theravada tradition, Nyanaponika (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha is said to have identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:
:* &quot;serenity&quot; or &quot;tranquillity&quot; (Pali: ''samatha'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;
:* &quot;insight&quot; (Pali: ''vipassana'') which enables one to see, explore and discern &quot;formations&quot; (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).&lt;ref&gt;These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the &quot;Four Kinds of Persons Sutta&quot; ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94).  This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269-70, 440 ''n''. 13.  See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to suppress obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]]; and, with the suppression of the hindrances, it is through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberating [[Prajna|wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267-68, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Christian meditation|Aspects of Christian meditation|Contemplative prayer|Hesychasm|Theoria}}
''[[Christian Meditation]]'' is a term for form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation for Beginners'' by Thomas Zanzig, Marilyn Kielbasa 2000, ISBN 0-88489-361-8 page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The word meditation comes from the Latin word ''meditari'', which means to concentrate. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a [[biblical]] scene involving [[Jesus]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to Christian spirituality'' by F. Antonisamy, 2000 ISBN 81-7109-429-5 pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian meditation contrasts with cosmic styles of eastern meditation as radically
as the portrayal of [[God the Father]] in the Bible contrasts with discussions of [[Krishna]] or [[Brahman]] in Indian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 ISBN 1-57383-227-8 page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike eastern meditations, most styles of Christian meditations do not rely on the repeated use of [[mantra]]s, but are intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 ISBN 1-57383-227-8 pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3'' by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 ISBN 90-04-12654-6 page 488&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Aspects of Christian meditation]]'', the [[Catholic Church]] warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and eastern styles of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm EWTN: [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] ''Letter on certain aspects of Christian meditation'' (in English), October 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, in ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'' the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that the &quot;Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/08/local/me-relignewage8/2 [[Los Angeles Times]], February 8, 2003 ''New Age Beliefs Aren't Christian, Vatican Finds'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm [[BBC]] Feb 4, 2003 Vatican sounds New Age alert]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html Vatican website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal [[prayer]], but is more structured than the multiple layers of [[contemplation]] in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''Simple Ways to Pray'' by Emilie Griffin 2005 ISBN 0-7425-5084-2 page 134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Dhyana in Hinduism|Yoga}}
[[File:Shiva Bangalore .jpg|thumb|A large statue in [[Bangalore]] depicting Lord [[Shiva]] meditating]]

There are many schools and styles of meditation within Hinduism. Yoga is generally done to prepare one for meditation, and meditation is done to realize union of one's self, one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], with the omnipresent and [[nondualism|non-dual]] [[Brahman]]. This experience is referred to as [[moksha]] by Hindus, and is similar to the concept of [[Nirvana]] in Buddhism. The earliest clear references to meditation in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] literature are in the middle [[Upanishads]] and the [[Mahabharata]], which includes the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 51. The earliest reference is actually in the Mokshadharma, which dates to the early Buddhist period.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Katha Upanishad describes yoga, including mediation. On meditation in this and other post-Buddhist Hindu literature see Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, page 199.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gavin Flood]], the earlier [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] refers to meditation when it states that &quot;having becoming calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'') within oneself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flood&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Flood | first = Gavin | year = 1996 | title = An Introduction to Hinduism| publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages=94–95 |location = Cambridge | isbn=0-521-43878-0 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Patañjali]]'s [[ashtanga]] yoga practice there are eight limbs leading to moksha. These are ethical discipline ([[yamas]]), rules ([[niyamas]]), physical postures ([[asanas]]), breath control ([[pranayama]]), withdrawal from the senses ([[pratyahara]]), one-pointedness of mind ([[dharana]]), meditation ([[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]), and finally [[samadhi]], which is often described as the union of the Self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]) with the omnipresent ([[Brahman]]), and is the ultimate aim of all Hindu yogis.

Meditation in Hinduism is not confined to any school or sect and has expanded beyond Hinduism to the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flood&quot; /&gt; 

The influential modern proponent of Hinduism who first introduced Eastern philosophy to the West in the late 19th century, [[Swami Vivekananda]], describes meditation as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Meditation has been laid stress upon by all religions. The meditative state of mind is declared by the Yogis to be the highest state in which the mind exists. When the mind is studying the external object, it gets identified with it, loses itself. To use the simile of the old Indian philosopher: the soul of man is like a piece of crystal, but it takes the colour of whatever is near it. Whatever the soul touches ... it has to take its colour. That is the difficulty. That constitutes the bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swami Vivekananda. Complete Works Vol 4 |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_4/Lectures_and_Discourses/Meditation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Islamic Mysticism===
{{Main|Sufi|Muraqaba|Sema|Dhikr#Sufi_view|}}
[[File:Dhikr singing.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dhikr]]]]

[[Muraqaba|Sufi view]] or Islamic mysticism involves [[Muraqaba|meditative]] practices. Remembrance of God in Islam, which is known by the concept [[Dhikr]] is interpreted in different meditative techniques in [[Sufism]] or Islamic mysticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prayer page 147-149&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Education' page 63&quot;/&gt; This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized in the 11th and 12th centuries. It is juxtaposed with ''fikr'' (thinking) which leads to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Sainthood and revelatory discourse'' by David Emmanuel Singh 2003 ISBN 81-7214-728-7 page 154&lt;/ref&gt; By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiritual Psychology' page 109&quot;/&gt;

Numerous [[Sufism|Sufi traditions]] place emphasis upon a meditative procedure similar in its cognitive aspect to one of the two principal approaches to be found in the [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist traditions]]: that of the [[samadhi (Buddhism)|concentration]] technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused [[introspection]]. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where [[muraqaba]] takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a [[Persian language|Persian]] term that means ''concentration''. Meditative quiescence is said to have a quality of [[healing]], and—in contemporary terminology—enhancing ''[[creativity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, Kedar Nath. ''Review:Freedom from Self, Sufism, Meditation and Psychotherapy''. Group Analysis, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 434-436, December 1989&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Tafakkur'' or ''tadabbur'' in Sufism literally means ''reflection upon the [[universe]]'': this is considered to permit access to a form of [[cognitive]] and [[emotion]]al development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God. The sensation of receiving [[Revelation|divine inspiration]] awakens and liberates both [[heart]] and [[intellect]], permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the [[infinity|infinite]]. Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one's submission to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Muraqaba|Meditation in the Sufi traditions]] is largely based on a spectrum of [[mysticism|mystical]] exercises, varying from one lineage to another. Such techniques, particularly the more audacious, can be, and often have been down the ages, a source of controversy among scholars. One broad group of [[ulema]], followers of the great [[Al-Ghazzali]], for example, have in general been open to such techniques and forms of [[prayer|devotion]].

Among the [[Sunni]] Muslims, those who strictly adhere to [[Sunnah]] or concur with [[Ibn Taymiya]] reject and generally condemn such procedures as species of [[bid'ah]] (Arabic: بدعة) or mere innovation. Their views are based on the facts that the [[Five Pillars of Islam|fundamentals of Islam]] do not involve these practices. The [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]] specifically do not mention of such practices. Although some people hold Islamic prayer or [[Salah]] synonymous to 'meditation', Salah is the Islamic way of praying to Allah which may require one to 'meditate' or concentrate in other words upon the recitation of [[Surah]]s from the Qur'an and their meanings. But this has no relationship with what is known as meditation according to different sources and other religions. The majority in Islam, the [[Sunni]] Muslims do not approve of any 'meditative practices' as Muhammad did not leave any such tradition for his followers nor did his [[Sahabah|companions]] used to practice those, according to available Hadith literature.

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jain meditation}}
[[File:Mahaveer swami.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mahavira]] in meditative posture]]
In [[Jainism]], meditation has been a core spiritual practice, one that Jains believe people have undertaken since the teaching of the [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)|Rishabha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Acharya Tulsi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Acharya Tulsi Key|title=Bhagwan Mahavira|publisher=JVB, Ladnun, India|year=1995|chapter=01.01 Traditions of shramanas|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the twenty-four Tirthankaras practiced deep meditation and attained enlightenment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jainism&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sadhvi Vishrut Vibha Key|title=Introduction to Jainism|publisher=JVB, Ladnun, India|year=2007|chapter=1 History and Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are all shown in meditative postures in the images or idols.

Jain meditation and spiritual practices system were referred to as  salvation-path. It has three important parts called the [[Ratnatraya]] &quot;Three Jewels&quot;: right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratna traya&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first= Acharya Mahapragya|title=Jain Yog|publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh|chapter=Foreword|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attaining salvation, take the soul to complete freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;blessings&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first= Acharya Tulsi|title=Sambodhi|publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh|chapter=blessings|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (Gyata-Drashta). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to ''Dharmya Dhyana'' and ''Shukla Dhyana''.

There exists a number of meditation techniques such as ''pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, savīrya-dhyāna'', etc. In ''padāstha dhyāna'' one focuses on [[Mantra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HN4U&quot;/&gt; A Mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of [[Mantra]] in Jainism. All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether [[Digambar]]a or [[Svetambara]], practice mantra. Mantra chanting is an important part of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind. [[Yogasana]] and ''Pranayama'' has been an important practice undertaken since ages. Pranayama – breathing exercises – are performed to strengthen the ten ''Pranas'' or vital energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;yoga&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Dr. Rudi Jansma, Dr. Sneh Rani Jain Key|title=Introduction To Jainism|publisher=Prakrit Bharti Academy, jaipur, India|year=2006|chapter=07 Yoga and Meditation (2)|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yogasana]] and ''Pranayama'' balances the functioning of neuro-endocrine system of body and helps in achieving good physical, mental and emotional health.&lt;ref name=&quot;yogic kriya&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Muni Kishan Lal Key|title=Preksha Dhyana: Yogic Exercises|publisher=Jain Vishva Bharati|year=2007|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=71578|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemplation is a very old and important meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In ''agnya vichāya'', one contemplates on seven facts &amp;mdash; life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of ''karmas'', and the final accomplishment of liberation. In ''apaya vichāya'', one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which  eventually develops right insight. In ''vipaka vichāya'', one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of ''karma''. In ''sansathan vichāya'', one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul.&lt;ref name=&quot;HN4U&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first=Dr. Rudi Jansma, Dr. Sneh Rani Jain Key|title=Introduction To Jainism|publisher=Prakrit Bharti Academy, jaipur, India|year=2006|chapter=07 Yoga and Meditation (2)|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=66251|accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acharya Mahapragya]] formulated [[Preksha meditation]] in the 1970s and presented a well-organised system of meditation. [[Asana]] and ''Pranayama'', meditation, contemplation, mantra and therapy are its integral parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.preksha.com/|title=Preksha Meditation|publisher=Preksha International|accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous Preksha meditation centers came into existence around the world and numerous meditations camps are being organized to impart training in it.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish meditation}}

There is evidence that Judaism has had meditative practices that go back thousands of years.&lt;ref name=Verman1 &gt;''The history and varieties of Jewish meditation'' by Mark Verman 1997 ISBN 978-1-56821-522-8 page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, L. (1976) ''Jewish Mystical Testimonies'', Jerusalem, Keter Publishing House Jerusalem Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Torah]], the patriarch [[Isaac]] is described as going &quot;לשוח&quot; (''lasuach'') in the field—a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:63).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1978) ''Meditation and the Bible'', Maine, Samuel Weiser Inc, p 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, there are indications throughout the [[Tanach]] (the Hebrew [[Bible]]) that meditation was used by the prophets.&lt;ref name=Verman45 &gt;''The history and varieties of Jewish meditation'' by Mark Verman 1997 ISBN 978-1-56821-522-8 page 45&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Old Testament]], there are two [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words for meditation: ''hāgâ'' ({{lang-he|הגה}}), which means ''to sigh'' or ''murmur'', but also ''to meditate'', and ''{{unicode|sîḥâ}}'' ({{lang-he|שיחה}}), which means ''to muse'', or ''rehearse in one's mind''.

The Jewish mystical tradition, [[Kabbalah]], is inherently a meditative field of study.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1982) ''Meditation and Kabbalah'', Maine, Samuel Weiser, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt, D.C. (1996) ''The Essential Kabbalah: The Heart of Jewish Mysticism'', San Francisco, HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Kabbalah is only taught to Jews over the age of forty in Ashkenaz, though training begins at 13 in Sephardic and Mizrahi communities. The [[Talmud]] refers to the advantage of the scholar over the prophet, as his understanding takes on intellectual, conceptual form, that deepens mental grasp, and can be communicated to others. The advantage of the prophet over the scholar is in the transcendence of their intuitive vision. The ideal illumination is achieved when the insights of mystical revelation are brought into conceptual structures. For example, [[Isaac Luria]] revealed new doctrines of Kabbalah in the 16th Century, that revolutionised and reordered its teachings into a new system.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, G. G. (1988) ''Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism'', New York, Schocken Books, pp 244-286&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not write down his teachings, which were recounted and interpreted instead by his close circle of disciples. After a mystical encounter, called in Kabbalistic tradition an &quot;elevation of the soul&quot; into the spiritual realms, Isaac Luria said that it would take 70 years to explain all that he had experienced. As Kabbalah evolved its teachings took on successively greater conceptual form and philosophical system. Nonetheless, as is implied by the name of Kabbalah, which means &quot;to receive&quot;, its exponents see that for the student to understand its teachings requires a spiritual intuitive reception that illuminates and personalises the intellectual structures.

Corresponding to the learning of Kabbalah are its traditional meditative practices, as for the Kabbalist, the ultimate purpose of its study is to understand and cleave to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1985) ''Jewish Meditation: A Practical Guide,'' New York Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic methods include the mental visualisation of the supernal realms the soul navigates through to achieve certain ends. One of the best known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the [[Merkabah]], from the root /R-K-B/ meaning &quot;chariot&quot; (of God).

In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called &quot;[[hitbodedut]]&quot; (התבודדות, alternatively transliterated as &quot;hisbodedus&quot;), and is explained in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]], [[Hasidic]], and [[Mussar Movement|Mussar]] writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslav]]. The word derives from the Hebrew word &quot;boded&quot; (בודד), meaning the state of being alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A. (1978) op cit p2&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hasidic system is the [[Habad]] method of &quot;hisbonenus&quot;, related to the [[Sephirah]] of &quot;Binah&quot;, Hebrew for understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, (1982) op cit, p13&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.

===New Age===
{{Main|New Age}}
New Age meditations are often influenced by Eastern philosophy, mysticism, Yoga, Hinduism and Buddhism, yet may contain some degree of Western influence. In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when many of the youth of the day rebelled against traditional [[Religion|belief systems]] as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899555-1,00.html Time Magazine, ''Youth: The Hippies'' Friday, Jul. 07, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;
New Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Nām Japō}}
In [[Sikhism]], the practices of [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|simran]] and [[Nām Japō]] encourage quiet meditation. This is focusing one's attention on the attributes of God. Sikhs believe that there are 10 'gates' to the body; 'gates' is another word for 'chakras' or energy centres. The top most energy level is called the tenth gate or Dasam Duaar. When one reaches this stage through continuous practice meditation becomes a habit that continues whilst walking, talking, eating, awake and even sleeping. There is a distinct taste or flavour when a meditator reaches this lofty stage of meditation, as one experiences absolute peace and tranquility inside and outside the body.

Followers of the Sikh religion also believe that love comes through meditation on the lord's name since meditation only conjures up positive emotions in oneself which are portrayed through our actions. The first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev Ji preached the equality of all humankind and stressed the importance of living a householder's life instead of wandering around jungles meditating, the latter of which being a popular practice at the time. The Guru preached that we can obtain liberation from life and death by living a totally normal family life and by spreading love amongst every human being regardless of religion.

In the Sikh religion, [[kirtan]], otherwise known as singing the hymns of God is seen as one of the most beneficial ways of aiding meditation, and it too in some ways is believed to be a meditation of one kind.

===Taoism===
{{Main|Taoism}}
[[File:Stage1.gif|thumb|upright|&quot;Gathering the Light&quot;, Taoist meditation from ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'']]
Taoism includes a number of meditative and contemplative traditions, said to have their principles described in the ''[[I Ching]]'', ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', and ''[[Daozang]]'' among other texts. The multitude of schools relating to [[Qigong]], [[Neigong]], [[Internal alchemy]], [[Tao Yin|Daoyin]] and [[Zhan zhuang]] is a large, diverse array of breath-training practices in aid of meditation with much influence on later [[Chinese Buddhism]] and with much influence on [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and the [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese]] as well as some [[Japanese martial arts]].  The Chinese martial art [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] is named after the well-known focus for Taoist and [[Neo-Confucian]] meditation, the [[Taijitu]] (T'ai Chi T'u), and is often referred to as “meditation in motion”.

&quot;The ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' essay 'Neiye' 內業 (Inward training) is the oldest received writing on the subject of the cultivation of [[qi|vapor]] and meditation techniques. The essay was probably composed at the Jixia Academy in Qi in the late fourth century B.C.&quot;&lt;ref name='Cambridge'&gt;{{Cite book| last = Harper | first = Donald | authorlink = | coauthors = Michael Loewe and Edward L.

The (c. 3rd century BCE) Daoist ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' records ''[[zuowang]]'' or &quot;sitting forgetting&quot; meditation. [[Confucius]] asked his disciple [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]] to explain what he means by &quot;sit and forget&quot;: &quot;I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mair, Victor H., tr. (1994), ''Wandering on the Way: Early Taoist Tales and Parables of Chuang Tzu'', Bantam Books, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often [[Taoist]] [[Internal martial arts]], especially [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] are thought of as moving meditation. A common phrase being, &quot;movement in stillness&quot; referring to energetic movement in passive Qigong and seated Taoist meditation; with the converse being &quot;stillness in movement&quot;, a state of mental calm and meditation in the tai chi form.

In a form of meditation using visualization, such as Chinese [[Qigong]], the practitioner concentrates on flows of energy (Qi) in the body, starting in the abdomen and then circulating through the body, until dispersed.&lt;ref name = Perez/&gt;

===Prayer beads===
Most of the ancient religions of the world have a tradition of using some type of [[prayer beads]] as tools in devotional meditation.&lt;ref name=Binz3 &gt;''Mysteries of the Rosary'' by Stephen J. Binz 2005 ISBN 1-58595-519-1 page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sach &gt;''The everything Buddhism book'' by Jacky Sach 2003 ISBN 978-1-58062-884-6 page 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see ''Beads of Faith: Pathways to Meditation and Spirituality Using Rosaries, Prayer Beads, and Sacred Words'' by Gray Henry, Susannah Marriott 2008 ISBN 1-887752-95-1&lt;/ref&gt; Most prayer beads and Christian [[Rosary based prayers|rosaries]] consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread.&lt;ref name=Binz3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sach /&gt; The [[Rosary|Roman Catholic rosary]] is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. Each set of ten is separated by another bead. The Hindu [[japa mala]] has 108 beads, as well as those used in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhist prayer beads]].&lt;ref name=Vishnu &gt;''Meditation and Mantras'' by Vishnu Devananda 1999 ISBN 81-208-1615-3 pages 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; Each bead is counted once as a person recites a [[mantra]] until the person has gone all the way around the mala, which is counted as 100, with an extra 8 there to compensate for missed beads.&lt;ref name=Vishnu /&gt; The Muslim [[Misbaha|mishbaha]] has 99 beads. Specific meditations of each religion may be different.

==Secular meditation in the West==
[[File:Early Morning Meditation.jpg|thumb|A collective meditation in [[Sri Lanka]]]]
As stated by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], a U.S. government entity within the National Institutes of Health that advocates various forms of [[Alternative Medicine]], &quot;Meditation may be practiced for many reasons, such as to increase calmness and physical relaxation, to improve psychological balance, to cope with illness, or to enhance overall health and well-being.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm |title=Meditation: An Introduction |publisher= [[NCCAM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Benson]] of [[Harvard Medical School]] conducted a series of clinical tests on meditators from various disciplines, including the [[Transcendental Meditation technique]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In 1975, Benson published a book titled ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'' where he outlined his own version of meditation for relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Relaxation Response |publisher=[[William Morrow Paperbacks]], Exp Upd edition (February 8, 2000)|url=http://www.amazon.com/Relaxation-Response-M-D-Herbert-Benson/dp/0380815958/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1280405037&amp;sr=8-1 |author=Herbert Benson, Miriam Z.

===Mindfulness===
{{Main|Mindfulness (psychology)}}
Over the past 20 years, [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness-based programs]] have become increasingly important to Westerners and in the Western medical and psychological community as a means of helping people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the last 20 years, mindfulness has become the focus of considerable attention for a large community of clinicians and, to a lesser extent, empirical psychology.&quot; - [http://brainimaging.waisman.wisc.edu/~perlman/0903-EmoPaper/BishopMindfulnessDefinition2004.pdf Mindfulness: A Proposed Operation Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]], who founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program]] in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.'&lt;ref name=kz1998&gt;{{cite journal

[[Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation]] was developed by American physician [[Edmund Jacobson]] in the early 1920s. In this practice one tenses and then relaxes muscle groups in a sequential pattern whilst concentrating on how they feel. The method has been seen to help people with many conditions especially extreme anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Progressive muscle relaxation]] from where these two references were taken showing that this method reduces extreme anxiety, 1) {{Cite book

==Modern cross-cultural dissemination==
&lt;!--- In progress: This section is being constructed -- 5 July 2010 ---&gt;
Methods of meditation have been cross-culturally disseminated at various times throughout history, such as Buddhism going to East Asia, and [[History of Sufism|Sufi practices]] going to many Islamic societies. Of special relevance to the modern world is the dissemination of meditative practices since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide. Most prominent has been the transmission of numerous Asian-derived practices to the West. In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has also been revived,&lt;ref name=reininger98&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[World Parliament of Religions]], held in Chicago in 1893, was the landmark event that increased Western awareness of meditation. This was the first time that Western audiences on American soil received Asian spiritual teachings from Asians themselves. Thereafter, [[Swami Vivekananda]]... [founded] various [[Vedanta]] ashrams... [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] lectured at Harvard on Theravada Buddhist meditation in 1904; [[Abdul Baha]] ... [toured] the US teaching the principles of Bahai, and [[Soyen Shaku]] toured in 1907 teaching Zen...&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|4}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began. Observers have suggested many types of explanations for this interest in Eastern meditation and revived Western contemplation. [[Thomas Keating]], a founder of [[Contemplative Outreach]], wrote that &quot;the rush to the East is a symptom of what is lacking in the West. There is a deep spiritual hunger that is not being satisfied in the West.&quot;&lt;ref name=keating97&gt;{{Cite book

Another suggested contributing factor is the rise of communist political power in Asia, which, &quot;set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West,&quot;&lt;ref name=taylor99/&gt;{{rp|7}} oftentimes as refugees.&lt;ref name=taylorinflux&gt;Taylor (1999, p. 7) stated that &quot;the increased Soviet influence in India, the Cultural Revolution in China, the Communist Chinese takeover of Tibet and Mongolia, and the increased political influence of Chinese Communism in Korea and Southeast Asia were key forces that collectively set the stage for an influx of Asian spiritual teachers to the West. An entirely new generation of them appeared on the American scene and they found a willing audience of devotees within the American counter-culture. [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami]], [[Swami Satchidananda|Swami Satchitananda]], [[Prem Rawat|Guru Maharaji]], [[Kirpal Singh|Kerpal Singh]], [[Nyanaponika Thera|Nayanaponika Thera]], [[Swami Rama]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Chogyam Trungpa]], [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], [[Muktananda|Swami Muktananda]], [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Sri Bagwan Rujneesh]], [[Vilayat Inayat Khan|Pir Viliyat Kahn]], and the [[Karmapa]] were but a few of the names that found followers in the United States... [and] the most well known and influential... today remains [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western context==
[[File:Meditating in Madison Square Park.jpg|thumb|right|Meditating in [[Madison Square Park]], [[New York City]]]]
In the late 19th century, [[Theosophy|Theosophists]] adopted the word &quot;meditation&quot; to refer to various spiritual practices drawn from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and other [[Indian religions]]. Thus the English word &quot;meditation&quot; does not exclusively translate to any single term or concept, and can be used to translate words such as the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[dhāraṇā]]'', ''dhyana'', ''[[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]]'' and ''[[bhavana]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Meditation may be for a religious purpose, but even before being brought to the West it was used in secular contexts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Beginning with the Theosophists meditation has been employed in the West by a number of religious and spiritual movements, such as [[Yoga]], [[New Age]] and the [[New Thought]]  movement.

Meditation techniques have also been used by Western theories of counseling and psychotherapy. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses. Jacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive relaxation procedure. These techniques are used in conjunction with other behavioral techniques. Originally used with [[systematic desensitization]], relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, hypnosis and biofeedback-induced relaxation are a few of the techniques used with relaxation training. One of the eight essential phases of [[EMDR]] (developed by Francine Shapiro), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation.  Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Corey   | first = G.  | title = Theory and practice of counseling and psychotherapy (6th ed.).   | publisher =Wadsworth Publishing Co.   | month =March | year =2000  | location =Belmont, CA   | pages =550  | isbn =0-534-34823-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of [[psychology]] and [[physiology]], meditation can induce an [[altered state of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Deane Shapiro &quot;Towards an empirical understanding of meditation as an altered state of consciousness&quot; in ''Meditation, classic and contemporary perspectives'' by Deane H. Shapiro, Roger N. Walsh 1984 ISBN 0-202-25136-5 page 13&lt;/ref&gt; Such altered states of consciousness may correspond to altered neuro-physiologic states.&lt;ref&gt;''New developments in consciousness research'' by Vincent W.

==Meditation, religion, and drugs==
{{Main|Entheogens|Religion and drugs}}
Many traditions in which meditation is practiced, such as [[Transcendental Meditation]],&lt;ref&gt;Denise Denniston and Peter McWilliams, The TM Book: How to Enjoy the Rest of Your Life, pp. 179-180, Three Rivers Press, ISBN 0-8431-0520-8&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/theprecepts/a/preceptsintro.htm |title=The Buddhist Precepts.

The fifth of the five precepts of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]], the ethical code in the [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist]] traditions, states that adherents must not ingest, &quot;intoxicating drinks and drugs causing heedlessness.&quot;

On the other hand, the ingestion of psychoactives has been a central feature in the rituals of many religions, in order to produce [[altered states of consciousness]]. In several traditional [[shamanistic]] ceremonies, drugs are used as agents of ritual. In the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] is believed to be a gift from [[Jah]] and a [[Religious and spiritual use of cannabis|sacred herb]] to be used regularly, while alcohol is considered to debase man. [[Bob Marley]] meditated daily on his long hammock in a corridor-like room with wooden floor and shutters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Native Americans use [[peyote]], as part of religious ceremony, continuing today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nativeamericanchurch.com/law.html |title=PUBLIC LAW 103-344 [H.R. 4230]; October 6, 1994 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the [[soma]] drink has a long history of use alongside prayer and sacrifice, and is mentioned in the [[Vedas]].

During the 1960s, both eastern meditation traditions and psychedelics, such as [[LSD]], became popular in America, and it was suggested that LSD use and meditation were both means to the same spiritual/existential end.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Zen Life&quot; a documentary film about the life of D.T. Suzuki&lt;/ref&gt; Many practictioners of eastern traditions rejected this idea, including many who had tried LSD themselves. In ''The Master Game'', [[Robert S de Ropp]] writes that the &quot;door to full consciousness&quot; can be glimpsed with the aid of substances, but to &quot;pass beyond the door&quot; requires yoga and meditation. Other authors, such as [[Rick Strassman]], believe that the relationship between religious experiences reached by way of meditation and through the use of psychedelic drugs deserves further exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Strassman, ''DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences'', 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, ISBN 0-89281-927-8&lt;/ref&gt; Also see [[Psychedelic psychotherapy]].

==Physical postures==
{{Main|Meditative postures}}
{{Hatnote|For bodily positions applied during yoga, see [[Asana]].}}
Various postures are taken up in meditation. Sitting, supine, and standing postures are used. Popular in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism are the [[Lotus position|full-lotus]], half-lotus, [[Sitting#Cross-legged|Burmese]], and [[kneeling]] positions. Meditation is sometimes done while walking, known as [[kinhin]], or while doing a simple task mindfully, known as [[Samu (Zen)|samu]].

==Scientific studies==
{{Main|Research on meditation}}

Meditation has been linked to a variety of health benefits. A study of college students by Oman et al. (2008) found that meditation may produce physiological benefits by changing neurological processes. This finding was supported by an expert panel at the National Institutes of Health. The practice of meditation has also been linked with various favourable outcomes that include: “effective functioning, including academic performance, concentration, perceptual sensitivity, reaction time, memory, self control, empathy, and self esteem.”(Oman ''et al.'', 2008, pg. 570) In their evaluation of the effects of two meditation-based programs they were able to conclude that meditating had stress reducing effects and cogitation, and also increased forgiveness. (Oman ''et al.'', 2008)

In a cross-sectional survey research design study lead by Li Chuan Chu (2009), Chu demonstrated that benefits to the psychological state of the participants in the study arose from practicing meditation. Meditation enhances overall psychological health and preserves a positive attitude towards stress. (Chu, 2009)

Mindfulness Meditation has now entered the health care domain because of evidence suggesting a positive correlation between the practice and emotional and physical health. Examples of such benefits include: reduction in stress, anxiety, depression, headaches, pain, elevated blood pressure, etc. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts found that those who meditated approximately half an hour per day during an eight week period reported that at the end of the period, they were better able to act in a state of awareness and observation. Respondents also said they felt non-judgmental. (Harvard’s Women’s Health Watch, 2011)

&quot;Meditation as Medicine&quot; (American Academy of Neurology) &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Meditation as Medicine&quot;, Amy Paturel M.S., M.P.H, online at http://journals.lww.com/neurologynow/Fulltext/2012/08040/Meditation_as_Medicine.9.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; cites scientific evidence from various studies which claim that meditation can increase attention span, sharpen focus, improve memory, and dull the perception of pain. The article lists as common types of meditation: Attention Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation, [[Passage Meditation]] and Benevolent Meditation.

Over 1,000 publications on meditation have appeared to date.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Many of the early studies lack a theoretically unified perspective, often resulting in poor methodological quality,&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, Dunne and Davidson, &quot;Meditation and the Neuroscience of Consciousness: An Introduction&quot; in The Cambridge handbook of consciousness by Philip David Zelazo, Morris Moscovitch, Evan Thompson, 2007 ISBN 0-521-85743-0 pages 498-499&lt;/ref&gt; as discussed above in the section [[#Definitions and scope|Definition and scope]].

In June, 2007 the United States [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] published an independent, peer-reviewed, meta-analysis of the state of research on meditation and health outcomes.&lt;ref name=ospinaetal2007&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, ''et al.'' |title=Meditation practices for health: state of the research |journal=Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep) |volume= |issue=155 |pages=1–263 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17764203 |doi= |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/meditation/medit.pdf| format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report reviewed 813 studies in five broad categories of meditation: [[mantra]] meditation, [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness meditation]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] and [[Qigong]]. The result was mixed. The report concluded that &quot;firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. However, the results analyzed from methodologically stronger research include findings sufficiently favorable to emphasize the value of further research in this field.&quot;&lt;ref name=ospinaetal2007/&gt;{{rp|210}} More rigor in future studies was called for.&lt;ref name=ospinaetal2007/&gt;{{rp|v}}

More recent research suggests that meditation may increase attention spans. A recent [[randomized]] study published in ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'' reported that practicing meditation led to doing better on a task related to sustained attention.&lt;ref name=maclean10&gt;{{cite journal |author=Katherine A.

A 2007 study by the U.S. government found that nearly 9.4% of U.S. adults (over 20 million) had practiced meditation within the past 12 months, up from 7.6% (more than 15 million people) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm#research|title=NCAAM, Meditation: An Introduction &quot;Uses of Meditation for Health in the United States |publisher=nccam.nih.gov}} A 2007 national Government survey that asked about CAM use in a sample of 23,393 U.S. adults found that 9.4 percent of respondents (representing more than 20 million people) had used meditation in the past 12 months—compared with 7.6 percent of respondents (representing more than 15 million people) in a similar survey conducted in 2002. The 2007 survey also asked about CAM use in a sample of 9,417 children; 1 percent (representing 725,000 children) had used meditation in the past 12 months.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meditation and intelligence'''

Recent investigations of mediation have linked it to increased intelligence through physical growth of the brain. Researchers at Harvard, Yale, and MIT conducted brain scans that reveal an increased thickness in the parts of the brain that deal with attention and sensory input processing. Using [[magnetic resonance imaging]], they visualized variations in the thickness of the cerebral cortex of experienced [[Vipassanā|Buddhist Insight meditation]] practitioners. The data show that regular practice of meditation is associated with increased thickness in a subset of cortical regions related to somatosensory, auditory, visual and interoceptive processing. Further, regular meditation practice may slow age-related thinning of the frontal cortex, leading to longer lasting executive functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Cranson, Robert W., et al. &quot;Transcendental Meditation and improved performance on intelligence-related measures: a longitudinal study.&quot; Personality and Individual Differences 12.10 (1991): 1105-1116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study investigated the effects of [[Transcendental Meditation]] on [[Cattell Culture Fair III|Cattell’s Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT)]] and Hick’s reaction time, which are both correlated with general intelligence. In the study 100 men and women who meditated showed significant improvement on the tests compared to the control group of non-meditators, which showed no improvement. The results indicated that participation in meditation results in improvements to intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;MICHAEL, C. DILLBECK, et al. &quot;LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION AND TM-SIDHI PROGRAM ON COGNITIVEABILITY AND COGNITIVE STYLE.&quot; Perceptual and Motor Skills 62.3 (1986): 731-738.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Keith Wallace, David Johnson, and Paul Mills investigated the relationship between the paired H-reflex and the academic success of students practicing Transcendental Meditation. The paired H-reflex correlated significantly with GPA, but not with sat scores or any of three IQ measurements. The results suggest that meditation may be a useful indicator of academic achievement by &quot;improving awareness and wakefullness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, R. Keith, et al. &quot;Academic achievement and the paired Hoffman reflex in students practicing meditation.&quot; International Journal of Neuroscience 24.3-4 (1984): 261-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-discipline, a trait linked to the practice of meditation has also been linked to increases in IQ scores. In a behavioral delay-of-gratification task with 8th graders, self-discipline accounted for more than twice as much variance as IQ in final grades, high school selection, school attendance, hours spent doing homework, hours spent watching television and the hour of the day students began their homework. The effect of self-discipline on final grades stayed even when controlling for grades, achievement-test scores, and measured IQ.&lt;ref&gt;Duckworth, Angela L., and Martin EP Seligman. &quot;Self-discipline outdoes IQ in predicting academic performance of adolescents.&quot; Psychological Science 16.12 (2005): 939-944.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
{{Main|Meditation in popular culture}}

Various forms of meditation have been described in popular culture sources.  In particular, [[science fiction]] stories such as [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Artemis Fowl (series)|Artemis Fowl]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Maskman]]'', ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by [[James Hilton]], and ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' have featured characters who practice one form of meditation or another.  Meditation also appears as overt themes in novels such as [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' and [[Herman Hesse]]'s ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]''.
