There are two very different senses in which the term '''Cosmology''' is used. [[Physical cosmology]] is the scholarly and academic study that seeks to understand the origin, [[Chronology of the universe|evolution]], structure, and [[ultimate fate of the universe]] at large, as well as the natural laws that keep it in order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9988-instant-expert-cosmology.html&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter of this field is studied using [[Scholarly method|scholarly methodology]], including the [[scientific method]] and [[reason]]. It is studied by [[scientist]]s, such as [[Astronomy|astronomers]], and [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]]; and academic [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]], and [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophers of space and time]]. Modern cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which attempts to bring together [[observational astronomy]] and [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[religious cosmology]] (or mythological cosmology) is study in the [[humanities]], of the [[History|historical]], [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and theories about [[eschatology]] (i.e. the end of the world), including such theories, as for instance [[apocalypticism]].

Although the word ''cosmology'' is recent (first used in 1730 in [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s ''Cosmologia Generalis''), the study of the universe has a long history involving [[science]], [[philosophy]], [[esotericism]] and [[religion]]. Related studies include [[cosmogony]], which focuses on the origin of the Universe, and [[cosmography]], which maps the features of the Universe. Cosmology is also connected to [[astronomy]]. However, they are contrasted in that while the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole, the latter deals with individual [[celestial object]]s.

==Disciplines==
In recent times, [[physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. What is known as [[physical cosmology]] shaped through both mathematics and observation the analysis of the whole universe. It is generally understood to begin with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]] - an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged ~{{val|13.7|0.2|e=9}} (roughly 13.5–13.9 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]) years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = First Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations| author1 = Spergel| author2 = Verde| author3 = Peiris| author4 = Komatsu| author5 = Nolta| author6 = Bennett| author7 = Halpern| author8 = Hinshaw| author9 = Jarosik| year = 2003| doi = 10.1086/377226| journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series| volume = 148| pages = 175–194 | arxiv = astro-ph/0302209|bibcode = 2003ApJS..148..175S }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Physical cosmologists propose that the history of the universe has been governed entirely by [[physical laws]]. Between the domains of [[religion and science]] stands the [[philosophy|philosophical]] perspective of [[cosmology (metaphysics)|metaphysical cosmology]]. This ancient field of study seeks to draw [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] conclusions about the nature of the universe, man, a supernatural creator, and/or their relationships based on the extension of some set of presumed facts borrowed from spiritual experience and/or observation.

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of man in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by the observation made by [[Marcus Aurelius]] of a man's place in that relationship: &quot;He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmology is often an important aspect of the [[creation myth]]s of [[religion]]s that seek to explain the [[existence]] and nature of [[reality]]. In some cases, views about the origin ([[cosmogony]]) and final condition ([[eschatology]]) of the universe play a central role in shaping a framework of [[religious cosmology]] for understanding humanity's role in the universe.

A more contemporary distinction between religion and philosophy, [[esoteric cosmology]] is distinguished from religion in its less tradition-bound construction and reliance on modern &quot;intellectual understanding&quot; rather than [[faith]], and from [[philosophy]] in its emphasis on [[spirituality]] as a formative concept.

|  Jain cosmology considers the loka, or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity,the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to Jainism, is narrow at the top, broad at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.

==Physical cosmology==
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}

Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on its very largest scales. In its earliest form it was what is now known as [[celestial mechanics]], the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. The Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. In particular, the [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the accepted theory to explain the motion of the heavens until [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] proposed a [[heliocentric]] system in the 16th century. This is known as one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

With [[Isaac Newton]] and the 1687 publication of ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', the problem of the motion of the heavens was finally solved. Newton provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and his [[law of universal gravitation]] allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]] that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper &quot;Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity,&quot; (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]] and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore the astronomical consequences of the theory, which enhanced the growing ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Prior to this (and for some time afterwards), physicists assumed that the Universe was static and unchanging.

In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax.  Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] star system only ; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right – island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of [[Great Debate (astronomy)|the Great Debate]] at the meeting of the (US) National Academy of Sciences in Washington on 26 April 1920. The resolution of this debate came with the detection of novae in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way and has galaxies of their own.

Subsequent modeling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]] introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[big bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[Redshift|red shift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative physical cosmologies]].

Recent observations made by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and [[WMAP]] satellites observing this background radiation have effectively, in many scientists' eyes, transformed cosmology from a highly speculative science into a predictive science, as these observations matched predictions made by a theory called [[Cosmic inflation]], which is a modification of the standard [[big bang]] model. This has led many to refer to modern times as the &quot;Golden age of cosmology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious and mythological cosmology==
{{Seealso|Religious cosmology}}

Religious and mythological cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion. The ancient Greeks did not draw a distinction between this use and their model for the cosmos. However, in modern use it addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of science. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods (e.g. [[dialectic]]s). Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:

* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])
* Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [[epistemology]])
