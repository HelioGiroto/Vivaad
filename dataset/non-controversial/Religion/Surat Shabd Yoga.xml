      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12409">'''Surat Shabd Yoga''' or '''Surat Shabda Yoga''' is a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual practice]] that is followed in the [[Sant Mat]] and many other related spiritual traditions. Surat means &quot;[[attention]],&quot; or &quot;face,&quot; which is the outward expression of the [[soul]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/mt/righteousness.htm Singh, Kirpal.  Morning Talks, chapter 25, page 1, (&quot;Righteousness - Detachment - Self-restraint.&quot;) ISBN-0-942735-16-1, Ruhani Satsang, (7th ed., 2003)]: &quot;The whole thing depends upon your attention, or surat as it is called, which is the outward expression of your soul.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[shabd]]'' means &quot;word&quot; and ''[[yoga]]'' means &quot;union.&quot; The term &quot;word&quot; means the “Sound Current,” the “Audible Life Stream” or the “Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being,” that is, the dynamic force of creative energy that was sent out, as sound vibration, from the Supreme Being into the abyss of space at the dawn of the [[universe]]'s manifestation, and that is being sent forth, through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, K., ''Naam or Word''. Blaine, WA: Ruhani Satsang Books. ISBN 0-942735-94-3, 1999; [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/naam_shabd1.htm BOOK TWO: SHABD, The Sound Principle].&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology of &quot;Surat Shabda Yoga&quot; presents its purpose: the &quot;Union of the Soul with the Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being.&quot; Other expressions for Surat Shabda Yoga include Sehaj Yoga (an easy path leading to Sehaj or equipoise) The Path of Light and Sound, The Path of the Sants, The Journey of Soul, and The Yoga of the Sound Current.

__TOC__

==Basic principles==

Sehaj word states as Guru of love, Guru of Trust, Guru of War, Guru of Time, Guru of Power. The stated purpose of Surat Shabda Yoga is to realize the individual's ''True Self'' (Self-Realization), ''True Essence'' (Spirit-Realization) and ''True Divinity'' (God-Realization) while living in the [[human]] physical body.  This ''Journey of Soul'' involves reuniting in stages with what is called the ''Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being'', the [[Shabd]].  Attaining self-realization and above also results in ''[[jiva]]n'' ''[[moksha|moksha/mukti]]'', liberation/release from [[samsara]], the cycle of [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] while in the physical body. [[Initiation rite|Initiation]] by an ''Outer Living'' [[Satguru]] (Sat - true, [[Guru]] - teacher) is required, and involves reactivating the Shabd and stationing the Inner Shabda Master (the Radiant Form of the Master) at the [[Mind's eye|third eye]] (tisra til) [[chakra]].  The spiritual exercises ([[sadhana]]s) include [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|simran]] (repetition, particularly silent repetition of a [[mantra]] given at initiation), dhyan (concentration, viewing, or contemplation, particularly on the Inner Master), and [[bhajan]] (listening to the inner sounds of the Shabda or the Shabda Master).

Surat Shabd Yoga [[Esoteric cosmology|cosmology]] depicts the whole of creation (the [[macrocosm]]) as being [[Emanationism|emanated]] and arranged in a spiritually differentiated hierarchy, often referred to as anda ([[World egg|eggs]]), regions, or [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]].  Typically, eight spiritual levels are described above the physical plane, although names and subdivisions within these levels will vary to some extent by movement and Master.  In this arrangement, Self-Realization is attained in the third heaven level, Daswan Dwar, Spirit-Realization is attained in the fourth heaven level, Bhanwar Gupha, and God-Realization is attained in the fifth heaven level, Sach Kand (Sat Lok).  (One version of the creation from a Surat Shabda Yoga perspective is depicted at the [[Sant Ajaib Singh]] Ji Memorial Site &lt;ref&gt;Sant Ajaib Singh Ji Memorial Site, 1995;  [http://www.santji.allegre.ca/planes-640.jpg “The Grand Scheme of All Creation”].&lt;/ref&gt;). All planes below the purely spiritual regions are subject to cycles of [[creation myth|creation]] and dissolution (pralya) or great dissolution (maha pralya). 

This cosmology presents the constitution of the initiate (the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]) as an exact replica of the macrocosm.  Consequently, the microcosm consists of a number of [[Subtle body|bodies]], each one suited to interact with its corresponding plane or region in the macrocosm.  These bodies developed over the [[yuga]]s through [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]] ([[Emanationism|emanating]] from higher planes to lower planes) and [[spiritual evolution|evolution]] (returning from lower planes to higher planes), including by karma and reincarnation in various [[altered state of consciousness|states]] of [[consciousness]].  The Path of Light and Sound involves the initiate traveling the microcosm [[dharma|dharmicly]] in consciousness ([[soul]]) with the guidance and protection of the Outer Living Master in the physical world and the Inner Shabd Master in the higher worlds until the regions of pure spirituality are reached and God-Realization is attained.

==Movements and masters==
{{main|Sant Mat|Contemporary Sant Mat movement|Radha Soami}}

Adherents believe Surat Shabda Yoga has been expressed through the movements of many different masters. However, because a basic principle of Surat Shabd Yoga's tradition is the requirement for an outer Living Master to initiate followers onto the Path, those movements whose historical Satgurus have died and their successors do not purport themselves to be Surat Shabd Yoga Satgurus, usually are not considered currently to be Surat Shabd Yoga movements, either by their own leaders or by movements with current Living Masters. 

The [[Radhasoami]] movement of Surat Shabda Yoga was established by [[Shiv Dayal Singh]] (1818–1878) in 1861 and named &quot;Radhasoami Satsang&quot; circa 1866. Soamiji Maharaj, as he was known, presided over the [[satsang]] meetings for seventeen years at Panni Gali and Soami Bagh in [[Agra]], India, until he died on June 15, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/linux/radhasoami/sm/gallery_1.htm Soamiji Maharaj gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;  Accounts of his guru and successors vary, although he did give verbal instructions on his last day as to how his followers should be cared for.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Shiv Dayal. (1934). ''Sar Bachan: An abstract of the teachings of Soami Ji Maharaj, the founder of the Radha Soami system of philosophy and spiritual science: The yoga of the Sound Current''. Translated from Hindi to English by Seva Singh with Julian Johnson. (9th ed.) Beas, India: Radha Soami Satsang Beas.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Radha Soami Satsang Beas, his guru was Tulsi Sahib of Hathras. According to Soami Bagh and Dayal Bagh successors, Tulsi Sahib &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/9563/chapter2.html%23part7&amp;date=2009-10-25+05:40:21  Tulsi Sahib and His Teachings]&lt;/ref&gt; was a contemporary guru of the same teachings, but being a natural born Satguru, Shiv Dayal Singh himself had no guru.  

After his death, six immediate successors carried on Shiv Dayal Singh’s teachings, including Huzur Maharaj Rai Salig Ram of Peepal Mandi, Agra, and Babaji Maharaj [[Jaimal Singh]] of [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas|Dera Baba Jaimal Singh]] the present day headquarters of (RSSB), [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]].   More information on living masters related to Shiv Dayal Singh's lineage can be found in the [[Contemporary Sant Mat movement]] article.

[[Sant Kirpal Singh]], a [[contemporary Sant Mat movement|contemporary Sant Mat]] [[guru]], stated that &quot;Naam&quot; (&quot;Word&quot;) has been described in many traditions through the use of several different terms. In his teachings,&lt;ref&gt;Singh, K. (1999). ''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/contents.htm Naam or Word]''. Blaine, WA: Ruhani Satsang Books. ISBN 0-942735-94-3&lt;/ref&gt; the following expressions are interpreted as being identical to &quot;Naam&quot;:
:*&quot;Naad&quot;, &quot;Akash Bani&quot;, and &quot;Sruti&quot; in the ''[[Vedas]]''
:*&quot;Nada&quot; and &quot;Udgit&quot; in the ''[[Upanishad]]s''
:*&quot;[[Logos]]&quot; and &quot;Word&quot; in the ''[[New Testament]]''
:*&quot;[[Tao]]&quot; by [[Lao Zi]]
:*&quot;[[Musica universalis|Music of the Spheres]]&quot; by [[Pythagoras]]
:*&quot;Sraosha&quot; by [[Zoroastrianism|Zoraster]]
:*&quot;Kalma&quot; and &quot;Kalam-i-Qadim&quot; in the ''[[Qur'an]]''
:*&quot;[[Naam]]&quot;, &quot;Akhand Kirtan&quot; and &quot;Sacha ('True') Shabd&quot; by [[Guru Granth Sahib]]

The more recently promulgated [[Quan Yin Method]] of meditation espoused via the spiritual teachings of [[Supreme Master Ching Hai]] has notable similarities to Surat Shabd Yoga. 

[[Eckankar]], an American movement, has many links to Surat Shabd Yoga, including terminology, although its American founder [[Paul Twitchell]] disassociated himself from his former teacher Kirpal Singh. 

The [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]], also founded in America in 1971 by [[John-Roger]] and now with students in 32 countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msia.org/msia.qry?ID=21 “Religious Requirements and Practices of Certain Selected Groups: A Handbook for Chaplains”, US Army, January 18 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; also teaches a similar form of active meditation, called ''spiritual exercises'', using the Sound Current and ancient Sanskrit tones in order to traverse and return back to the higher realms of Spirit and into God.&lt;ref name=&quot;seekingthelight&quot;&gt;[[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], ''Seeking the Light: Uncovering the Truth About the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness and its Founder John-Roger'' (Los Angeles: Mandeville, 1998), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://masterpath.org MasterPath] is another contemporary American movement of Surat Shabda Yoga. Gary Olsen, the current Living Master (of this branch), contends that several historical figures are [[satguru|Sat Gurus]] of Surat Shabda Yoga as representatives for the eternal Inner Shabda Master. A few of these Living Masters of their times include [[Lao Zi|Lao Tsu]], [[Jesus]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates]], [[Kabir]], the [[Sufi]] Masters and mystic poets [[Hafez]] and [[Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], the [[The Sikh Gurus|Ten Sikh Gurus]] beginning with [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]], Tulsi Sahib, and the Radhasoami/Radha Soami and offshoot Masters, including [[Shiv Dayal Singh]], [[Baba Sawan Singh]], [[Baba Faqir Chand]] and [[Sant Kirpal Singh]].  

The ten Sikh Satgurus discuss the inner sound and inner light a lot in their scriptures. The first Sikh Satguru was [[Guru Nanak]], but his master (guru) was [[Waheguru]]. The above masters teach these 2 techniques. There is a master that teaches 4 techniques that include these 2 of inner light and inner music. He teaches inner light (sight), inner music (hearing), primordial vibration (sense of touch) and nectar (taste and smell).

These correspond to the 5 senses and this is how you turn them inward to experience what is inside of you. See [[Vishnu]] with his 4 arms and they correspond to these. One hand is holding a circle (chakra) of light. Another is holding a  conch shell for the inner sound (hold it to your ear and you hear something). Another hand is holding a lotus flower to refer to nectar and the 4th hand is holding a metal club (mace) for the inner vibration. If you hit something with it, it vibrates like a tuning fork. Some people refer to this inner energy as the soul.

===Variations in movements===

Although all movements of Surat Shabd Yoga will have common elements related to the basic principles, notable variations also exist.  For example, before he left his physical body, the tenth [[Sikh]] Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]], nominated the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (a sacred text) as the next and perpetual Guru of the Sikhs.  Other movements continue to require a Living Master to initiate students into the Shabda.  Movements also will vary in the names used to describe the Absolute Supreme Being ([[God]]), including Anami Purush (nameless power) and Radha Soami (lord of the soul); the [[List of deities|presiding deities]] and divisions of the [[macrocosm]]; the number of outer [[Initiation rite|initiations]]; the words given as [[mantra]]s; and the initiation [[vow]]s or the prerequisites that must be agreed to before being accepted as an initiate.
