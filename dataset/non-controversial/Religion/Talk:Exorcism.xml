== &quot;Scientific&quot; view? ==

the 'scientific view' section should be renamed 'psychiatric view'. i expected it to be about scientific experiments or theories, instead it's mainly about the DSM-IV.

== &quot;Modern-day&quot; Roman Catholic View of Exorcisms ==

I changed (and reverted) the Roman Catholic section to note that the Rite of Exorcism was renewed in January of 2000, as the previous versions impressed that the practice of exorcism is outdated in the Church.  Quite the contrary - though advances in the sciences have aided in the differentiation between demonic possession and mental illness, as Roman Catholics are aware, it indeed remains a recognized and accepted practice of the Church.  For a better flow in the article, I also moved the historical information regarding the position of exorcist.

Also, the Second Vatican Council should be capitalized; it is a title, such as the Council of Trent.

== On the Nature of the Jinn ==

The Following paragraph in the section.. &quot;On the nature of the Jinn&quot;, needs a citation from a reliable Islamic source:

A Jinn might also do it for revenge. Jinn are said to be quick to anger, especially when they believe themselves to have been harmed on purpose (since Jinn are usually invisible to humans, a person can accidentally injure a Jinni not knowing that one is there).
--[[User:Haroon_nizar|Haroon Nizar]]--

This section should be removed and any appropriate material moved to the Jinn entry.

== in Islam ==

The Hanbali sect is the main Sunni sect that believes in Jinn being capable of possessing humans and exorcism. Otherwise, the 3 other sunni sects don't believe in that.

I removed the section on removing Jinn by vising graves and wearing amulets. It is a controversial topic, not adopted by orthodox Islam and has no references attached

== A cross reference is needed ==

Since the page mentions the movie of The Exorcist, the page of

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hughes

should be cross referenced in my view.

To my knowledge, all the cases of the angry ghosts or devils attacking the worldly human beings are the direct consequece of the inproper human's action incurred to them in the past.

In the case of Edward Hughes encountered in 1949, which I noticed is 4 years after the World War II and I'm 90% sure that the devil is the victim or collective angry consciousness related to the World War II if one closely watches the movie and pay attention to what is scarred on the boy's chest.  Again, karma will never stop manifesting what has happened and will happen to the world.  As long as human being has ego views on enemies, war will never end.

== Phrase? ==

This phase does not sound good at all

&quot;the Holy Water especially is comparable to acid to the demon.&quot;

== Examples ==

The New Zealand case of a &quot;Makutu lifting&quot; should not be included.  This was a family suffering from a combination of poor education, low intelligence, mental illness and superstitution. There was no proper basis for any suspicion of demonic possession.  What they called a makutu lifting was simply torture.  Please remove this &quot;example of an exorcism&quot;.

== More Sources Needed ==

It would be good to include the use of exorcism from other cultures and religions (besides those already mentioned). Various animist/pagan/shamanic cultures practice exorcism as well.
Exorcism is found in Korean shamanism for instance. Exorcism is also found in Thai animism and folk Buddhism. Various native cultures in North America believe in it as well. Among West Coast native peoples ( Tsimshian,Tlingit et. I think Inuit used them as well) they have &quot;Spirit Catcher&quot;(made from bone) to recover lost souls but to also exorcise bad spirits.
There is also certain folk beliefs in Chinese culture about ghost possession and how the person can be exorcised by slipping red chopsticks between the fingers and squeezing them together.
Then of course theres numerous cultures in Africa that should be looked into regarding exorcism.
My studies on anthropology is limited and my books are all in boxes right now.

If anyone has more info please contribute. It would be great.
