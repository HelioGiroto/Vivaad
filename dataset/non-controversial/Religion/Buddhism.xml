[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|[[Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)|Standing Buddha]].  One of the earliest known representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], 1st-2nd century CE, [[Gandhara]] (modern eastern [[Afghanistan]]).]]
{{Buddhism}}

'''Buddhism''' is a [[religion]] indigenous to the [[Indian subcontinent]] that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs, and practices largely based on teachings attributed to [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], who is commonly known as the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] (meaning &quot;the awakened one&quot; in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]]). The Buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] some time between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Buddhism&quot;. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 26, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognized by Buddhists as an [[Bodhi|awakened]] or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end suffering ([[dukkha]]) through eliminating ignorance ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]) by way of understanding and seeing dependent origination ([[pratītyasamutpāda]]) and eliminating craving ([[taṇhā]]), and thus attain the highest happiness, nirvāņa ([[nirvana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), ''Foundations'', pp. 27-28, pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major branches of Buddhism are recognized: [[Theravada]] (&quot;The School of the Elders&quot;) and [[Mahayana]] (&quot;The Great Vehicle&quot;). Theravada has a widespread following in [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] and [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]]. Mahayana is found throughout [[Buddhism in East Asia|East Asia]] and includes the traditions of [[Pure Land]], [[Zen]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Shingon]], and [[Tiantai]] ([[Tendai]]). In some classifications, [[Vajrayana]]—practiced mainly in [[Tibet]] and [[Mongolia]], and adjacent parts of [[Buddhism in China|China]] and [[Buddhism in Russia|Russia]]—is recognized as a third branch, while others classify it as a part of Mahayana. There are other categorisations of these three Vehicles or [[Yana (Buddhism)|Yana]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Nine_yanas |title=Nine Yana categorisation |publisher=Rigpawiki.org |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Buddhism remains most popular within Asia, both branches are now found throughout the world. Estimates of Buddhists worldwide vary significantly depending on the way Buddhist adherence is defined. Lower estimates are between 350–500 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Buddhism Major Religions Ranked by Size]; U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report 2004. http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/ Accessed 20 September 2008; Garfinkel, Perry. &quot;Buddha Rising&quot;, National Geographic Dec. 2005: 88–109; [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#People CIA - The World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez, p. 239&quot;&gt;Lopez, ''Story of Buddhism''. p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez, Buddhism. p. 248&quot;&gt;Lopez, ''Buddhism''. p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]] vary on the exact nature of the path to [[Nirvana|liberation]], the importance and [[Buddhist texts|canonicity of various teachings and scriptures]], and especially their respective practices.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson et al., ''Buddhist Religions'', page xx; ''Philosophy East and West'', vol 54, ps 269f; Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, 1st ed., 1989, pp. 275f (2nd ed., 2008, p. 266)&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most important teachings are [[dependent origination]] and [[no-self]]. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the [[Three Jewels]]: the Buddha, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (the teachings), and the [[Sangha]] (the community). Taking &quot;[[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the triple gem&quot; has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qjbBKG06To0C&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q= |title=Light of Wisdom|publisher=Rangjung Yeshe Publications |year=2004|accessdate=2010-08-25|isbn=978-962-7341-37-6|author=Padmasambhava, Jamgon Kongtrul, Erik Pema Kunsang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other practices may include following [[sīla|ethical precepts]]; [[Dana (Buddhism)|support of the monastic community]]; [[Nekkhamma|renouncing]] conventional living and becoming a [[Buddhist monasticism|monastic]]; the development of [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] and practice of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; [[Buddhist devotion|devotional]] practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and [[bodhisattva]]s.

This narrative draws on the ''[[Nidanakatha|Nidānakathā]]'' biography of the [[Theravāda]] sect in Sri Lanka, which is ascribed to [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]] in the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald. ''Becoming the Buddha.'' 2004. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier biographies such as the ''[[Buddhacarita]]'', the [[Lokottaravada|Lokottaravādin]] ''[[Mahāvastu]]'', and the [[Mahāyāna]] / [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] ''[[Lalitavistara Sutra|Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'', give different accounts. Scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most accept that he lived, taught and founded a monastic order, but do not consistently accept all of the details contained in his biographies.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' Vol. 1, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lopez | title= Buddhism in Practice| publisher=Princeton University Press| year= 1995 |page=16 |isbn=0-691-04442-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bodhitree.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.65|The Vajrashila, where Gautama sat under a tree and became enlightened, [[Mahabodhi Temple|Bodh Gaya]], [[India]], 2011]]
According to author Michael Carrithers, while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account, &quot;the outline of the life must be true: birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, Michael. &quot;The Buddha&quot;, in the Oxford University paperback ''Founders of Faith'', 1986, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In writing her biography of Buddha, [[Karen Armstrong]] noted, &quot;It is obviously difficult, therefore, to write a biography of the Buddha that meets modern criteria, because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound... [but] we can be reasonably confident Siddhatta Gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Armstrong |first=Karen |authorlink=Karen Armstrong |title=Buddha |date=September 28, 2004 |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |isbn=0-14-303436-7 |page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=October 2012}} 

The evidence of the early texts suggests that [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]] was born in a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and culturally, of the northeastern Indian subcontinent in the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theravada Buddhism 1988, page 49&quot;&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; It was either a small [[republic]], in which case his father was an elected chieftain, or an [[oligarchy]], in which case his father was an oligarch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theravada Buddhism 1988, page 49&quot;/&gt;

According to the Theravada [[Tripitaka]] [[Buddhist texts|scriptures]]{{Which|date=November 2010}} (from Pali, meaning &quot;three baskets&quot;), Gautama was born in [[Lumbini]] in modern-day [[Nepal]], around the year 563 BCE, and raised in [[Kapilavastu]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666 Lumbini is the birthplace of the Lord Buddha], Gethin ''Foundations'', p. 19, which states that in the mid-3rd century BCE the Emperor [[Ashoka]] determined that Lumbini was Gautama's birthplace and thus installed a pillar there with the inscription: &quot;... this is where the Buddha, sage of the Śākyas (''Śākyamuni''), was born.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Gethin ''Foundations'', p. 14, states: &quot;The earliest Buddhist sources state that the future Buddha was born Siddhārtha Gautama (Pali Siddhattha Gotama), the son of a local chieftain—a ''rājan''—in Kapilavastu (Pali Kapilavatthu) what is now the Indian–Nepalese border.&quot; However, Professor Gombrich (''Theravāda Buddhism'', p. 1) and the old but specialized study by Edward Thomas, ''The Life of the Buddha'', ascribe the name Siattha/fitta to later sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this narrative, shortly after the birth of young prince Gautama, an [[Astrology|astrologer]] visited the young prince's father—King [[Śuddhodana]]—and prophesied that Siddhartha would either become a great king or renounce the material world to become a holy man, depending on whether he saw what life was like outside the palace walls.

Śuddhodana was determined to see his son become a king, so he prevented him from leaving the palace grounds. But at age 29, despite his father's efforts, Gautama ventured beyond the palace several times. In a series of encounters—known in Buddhist literature as the [[four sights]]—he learned of the suffering of ordinary people, encountering an old man, a sick man, a corpse and, finally, an [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Sadhu|holy man]], apparently content and at peace with the world. These experiences prompted Gautama to abandon royal life and take up a spiritual quest.

[[File:Monastery around Dhamek stupa, Sarnath.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dhamek Stupa]] in [[Sarnath]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], built by King [[Ashoka]], where Buddha gave his first sermon]]
Gautama first went to study with famous religious teachers of the day, and mastered the meditative attainments they taught. But he found that they did not provide a permanent end to suffering, so he continued his quest. He next attempted an extreme asceticism, which was a religious pursuit common among the [[Shramana]]s, a religious culture distinct from the Vedic one. Gautama underwent prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain. He almost starved himself to death in the process. He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit, and had not put an end to suffering. So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach. He devoted himself to [[anapanasati]] meditation, through which he discovered what Buddhists call the [[Middle Way]] (Skt. ''madhyamā-pratipad''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Kohn| first =Michael| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen| publisher =Shambhala| year =1991| location =| page =143| url =| doi = | isbn = 0-87773-520-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;): a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/arty/his-life/middle.htm |title=The Middle Way of the Buddha |publisher=Buddhamind.info |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/cbp2_f4.htm |title=Buddhism - The Middle Path |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gautama was now determined to complete his spiritual quest. At the age of 35, he famously sat in [[meditation]] under a [[sacred fig]] tree — known as the [[Bodhi tree]] — in the town of [[Bodh Gaya]], India, and vowed not to rise before achieving [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. After many days, he finally destroyed the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetters]] of his mind, thereby [[Nirvana (concept)|liberating himself]] from the [[Saṃsāra|cycle of suffering and rebirth]], and arose as a [[Buddhahood#Samyaksambuddha|fully enlightened being]] (Skt. ''{{IAST|samyaksaṃbuddha}}''). Soon thereafter, he attracted a band of followers and instituted a [[Sangha|monastic order]]. Now, as the Buddha, he spent the rest of his life teaching the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|path of awakening]] he had discovered, traveling throughout the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent,&lt;ref&gt;Keown, ''Dictionary of Buddhism'', p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, ''Concise'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and died at the age of 80 (483 BCE) in [[Kushinagar]], India. The south branch of the original fig tree available only in [[Anuradhapura]] [[Sri Lanka]] is known as [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]].

{{Main|Buddhist terms and concepts}}
As writing was uncommon in India at the time Gautama lived, the constructs of his life and teachings were passed on orally until they were written down, probably during the first century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=October 2012}} 

The English word &quot;Buddhism&quot; is relatively new. It was first used in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1801 (spelled &quot;Boudhism&quot;) and its spelling changed to the present one in 1816, in a comment published in the ''Asiatic Journal'' (&quot;The name and peculiarities of Buddhism have a good deal fixed my attention&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Waterhouse, David|title=The origins of Himalayan studies: Brian Houghton Hodgson in Nepal and Darjeeling, 1820-1858|year=2005|page=53|publisher=Routledge via Amazon Look Inside|isbn=0-415-31215-9|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415312159/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life and the world===
[[File:Bhavachakra.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Traditional [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Thangka]] depicting the [[Bhavacakra|Wheel of Life]] with its six realms]]

====Saṃsāra====
{{Main|Saṃsāra (Buddhism)}}
Samsara is &quot;the cycle of birth and death&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Huston &amp; Novak, Philip, Buddhism: A Concise Introduction,HarperCollins 2003, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;
Sentient beings crave pleasure and are averse to pain from birth to death. In being controlled by these attitudes, they perpetuate the cycle of conditioned existence and suffering (saṃsāra), and produce the causes and conditions of the next rebirth after death. Each rebirth repeats this process in an involuntary cycle, which Buddhists strive to end by eradicating these causes and conditions, applying the methods laid out by the Buddha and subsequent Buddhists.

====Karma====
{{Main|Karma in Buddhism}}
[[Karma]] (from [[Sanskrit]]: &quot;action, work&quot;) [[Karma in Buddhism|in Buddhism]] is the force that drives [[saṃsāra]]—the cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being. Good, skillful deeds ([[Pāli]]: &quot;kusala&quot;) and bad, unskillful (Pāli: &quot;akusala&quot;) actions produce &quot;seeds&quot; in the mind that [[Vipāka|come to fruition]] either in this life or in a subsequent [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Buddhist Ethics:'' [http://www.buddhistethics.org/13/zse1-kasulis.pdf &quot;Zen as a Social Ethics of Responsiveness&quot;] ([[PDF]]), T. P. Kasulis, Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of unwholesome actions and the cultivation of positive actions is called [[śīla]] (from Sanskrit: &quot;ethical conduct&quot;). 

In Buddhism, karma specifically refers to those actions (of body, speech, and mind) that spring from mental intent (&quot;[[cetana]]&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction to Buddhism'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; and bring about a consequence or fruit, (''[[phala]]'') or result (''[[vipāka]]'').

In Theravada Buddhism there can be no divine salvation or forgiveness for one's karma, since it is a purely impersonal process that is a part of the makeup of the universe. In Mahayana Buddhism, the texts of certain [[Mahayana sutra]]s (such as the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', the ''[[Angulimaliya Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Nirvana Sutra]]'') claim that reciting or merely hearing their texts can expunge great swathes of negative karma. Some forms of Buddhism (for example, [[Vajrayana]]) regard the recitation of [[mantra]]s as a means for cutting off previous negative karma.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Richard K. Payne (ed.), ''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia'', Wisdom Publications, Boston, 2006, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] teacher [[Genshin]] taught that [[Amida Buddha]] has the power to destroy the karma that would otherwise bind one in saṃsāra.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez, p. 239&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez, Buddhism. p. 248&quot;/&gt;

====Rebirth====
[[File:Kushinara1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A very large hill behind two palm trees and a boulevard, people walking are about one fifth the hill's height| Gautama's cremation site, Ramabhar Stupa in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]]]
{{Main|Rebirth (Buddhism)}}
Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of [[Sentience|sentient]] life, each running from conception&lt;ref&gt;Keown, ''Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; to death. Buddhism rejects the concepts of a permanent [[self]] or an unchanging, eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], as it is called in [[Hinduism]] and [[Christianity]]. According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self independent from the rest of the universe (the doctrine of [[anatta]]). Rebirth in subsequent existences must be understood as the continuation of a dynamic, ever-changing process of &quot;dependent arising&quot; (&quot;[[pratītyasamutpāda]]&quot;) determined by the laws of cause and effect (karma) rather than that of one being, [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigrating]] or [[Incarnation|incarnating]] from one existence to the next.

Each rebirth takes place within one of five realms according to Theravadins, or [[Six Realms|six]] according to other schools.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction to Buddhism'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (Volume Two), p. 711&lt;/ref&gt; These are further subdivided into 31 planes of existence:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/allexistence.pdf ''The 31 Planes of Existence''] ([[PDF]]), Ven. Suvanno Mahathera&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka beings]]: those who live in one of many Narakas (Hells);
# [[Preta]]: sometimes sharing some space with humans, but invisible to most people; an important variety is the [[hungry ghost]];&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction to Buddhism'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Animals in Buddhism|Animals]]: sharing space with humans, but considered another type of life;
# [[Human beings in Buddhism|Human beings]]: one of the realms of rebirth in which attaining Nirvana is possible;
# [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asuras]]: variously translated as lowly deities, demons, titans, antigods; not recognized by Theravāda (Mahavihara) tradition as a separate realm;&lt;ref&gt;André Bareau, ''Les Sectes bouddhiques du Petit Véhicule'', École Française d'Extrême-Orient, Saigon, 1955, pp. 212–223: the top of p. 212 says: &quot;Here are the theses of the Theravadins of the Mahavihara&quot;; then begins a numbered list of doctrines over the following pages, including on p. 223: &quot;There are only five destinies ... the kalakanjika asuras have the same colour, same nourishment, same foods, same lifespan as the petas, with whom ... they marry. As for the Vepacittiparisa, they have the same colour, same nourishment, same foods, same lifespan as the gods, with whom they marry.&quot;(Translated from the French)&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] including [[Brahma (Buddhism)|Brahmas]]: variously translated as gods, deities, spirits, angels, or left untranslated.

Rebirths in some of the higher heavens, known as the [[Buddhist cosmology#Pure Abodes|Śuddhāvāsa Worlds]] (Pure Abodes), can be attained by only skilled Buddhist practitioners known as [[anāgāmi]]s (non-returners). Rebirths in the [[Buddhist cosmology#Formless Realm (Ārūpyadhātu)|arupa-dhatu]] (formless realms) can be attained by only those who can meditate on the [[arūpajhāna]]s, the highest object of meditation.

According to East Asian and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], there is an [[Bardo|intermediate state]] ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] &quot;Bardo&quot;) between one life and the next. The orthodox Theravada position rejects this; however there are passages in the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'' of the [[Pali Canon]] (the collection of texts on which the Theravada tradition is based), that seem to lend support to the idea that the Buddha taught of an intermediate stage between one life and the next.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. Vol. 1, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Connected Discourses of the Buddha. A Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Translator. Wisdom Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suffering's causes and solution===

====The Four Noble Truths====
{{Main|Four Noble Truths}}
The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought. These four truths explain the nature of ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction), its causes, and how it can be overcome. They can be summarized as follows:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=fnt1|See the article [[Four Noble Truths]] for further details and citations. In particular, the section &quot;[[Four_Noble_Truths#Summary|Summary]]&quot; within that article provides a footnote showing a sampling of summaries from a number of Reliable Secondary Sources.}}
# The truth of ''dukkha'' (suffering, anxiety, dissatisfaction)
# The truth of the origin of ''dukkha''
# The truth of the cessation of ''dukkha''
# The truth of the path leading to the cessation of ''dukkha''

The first truth explains the nature of ''[[dukkha]]''. ''Dukkha'' is commonly translated as “suffering”, “anxiety”, “dissatisfaction”,  “unease”, etc., and it is said to have the following three aspects: 
* the obvious suffering of physical and mental illness, growing old, and dying;
* the anxiety or stress of trying to hold onto things that are constantly changing; and
* a subtle dissatisfaction pervading all forms of life, due to the fact that all forms of life are impermanent and constantly changing.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|See the article [[Dukkha]] for further details and citations.}}

The second truth is that the ''[[samudaya|origin]]'' of ''dukkha'' can be known. Within the context of the four noble truths, the origin of ''dukkha'' is commonly explained as craving (Pali: ''[[tanha]]'') conditioned by ignorance (Pali: ''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|avijja]]''). On a deeper level, the root cause of ''dukkha'' is identified as ignorance (Pali: ''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|avijja]]'') of the true nature of things. The third noble truth is that the complete ''[[nirodha|cessation]]'' of ''dukkha'' is possible, and the fourth noble truth identifies a ''[[Noble Eightfold Path|path]]'' to this cessation.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=fnt1}}

====Noble Eightfold Path====
{{Main|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist Paths to liberation}}
[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|The ''[[Dharmachakra]]'' represents the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].]]
The [[Noble Eightfold Path]]—the fourth of the Buddha's [[Four Noble Truths|Noble Truths]]—consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions, that when developed together, lead to the cessation of [[dukkha]].{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|p=87-88}} These eight factors are: Right View (or Right Understanding), Right Intention (or Right Thought), Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. 

[[Ajahn Sucitto]] describes the path as &quot;a mandala of interconnected factors that support and moderate each other.&quot;{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|p=87-88}} The eight factors of the path are ''not'' to be understood as stages, in which each stage is completed before moving on to the next. Rather, they are understood as eight significant dimensions of one's behaviour—mental, spoken, and bodily—that operate in dependence on one another; taken together, they define a complete ''path'', or way of living.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=82}}

The eight factors of the path are commonly presented within three divisions (or higher trainings) as shown below:

====Middle Way====
{{Main|Middle Way}}
An important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the [[Middle Way]] (or Middle Path), which is said to have been discovered by Gautama Buddha prior to his enlightenment. The Middle Way has several definitions:
# The practice of non-extremism: a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification;
# The middle ground between certain [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[View (Buddhism)|views]] (for example, that things ultimately either do or do not exist);&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, ''Shambhala'', pp. 131, 143&lt;/ref&gt;
# An explanation of [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]] (perfect enlightenment), a state wherein it becomes clear that all dualities apparent in the world are delusory (see [[Seongcheol]]);
# Another term for [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]], the ultimate nature of all phenomena (in the [[Mahayana]] branch), a lack of inherent existence, which avoids the extremes of permanence and nihilism or inherent existence and nothingness.

===Nature of existence===
[[File:Debating Monks.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bhikku|Monks]] debating at [[Sera Monastery]], [[Tibet]]]]
Buddhist scholars have produced a remarkable quantity of intellectual theories, philosophies and world view concepts (see, for example, [[Abhidharma]], [[Buddhist philosophy]] and [[Reality in Buddhism]]). Some schools of Buddhism discourage doctrinal study, and some regard it as essential practice.

In the earliest Buddhist teachings, shared to some extent by all extant schools, the concept of liberation (Nirvana)—the goal of the Buddhist path—is closely related to the correct understanding of how the mind causes stress. In awakening to the true nature of clinging, one develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and is liberated from suffering (dukkha) and the cycle of incessant rebirths (saṃsāra). To this end, the Buddha recommended viewing things as characterized by the [[three marks of existence]].

====Three Marks of Existence====
{{Main|Three marks of existence}}
The Three Marks of Existence are impermanence, suffering, and not-self.

Impermanence (Pāli: ''[[anicca]]'') expresses the Buddhist notion that all [[sankhara|compounded or conditioned phenomena]] (all things and experiences) are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent. Everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts, and its existence is dependent on external conditions. Everything is in constant flux, and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing. Things are constantly coming into being, and ceasing to be. Since nothing lasts, there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. According to the doctrine of impermanence, life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra), and in any experience of loss. The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent, attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering (dukkha).

Suffering (Pāli: दुक्ख ''dukkha''; Sanskrit दुःख ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}'') is also a central concept in Buddhism. The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including [[suffering]], [[pain]], unsatisfactoriness, sorrow, affliction, [[anxiety]], dissatisfaction, discomfort, [[anguish]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], misery, and [[frustration]]. Although the term is often translated as &quot;suffering&quot;, its philosophical meaning is more analogous to &quot;disquietude&quot; as in the condition of being disturbed. As such, &quot;suffering&quot; is too narrow a translation with &quot;negative emotional connotations&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Po, [http://www.4ui.com/eart/172eart1.htm &quot;Is Buddhism a Pessimistic Way of Life?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is [[pessimism|pessimistic]], but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but realistic. In English-language Buddhist literature translated from Pāli, &quot;dukkha&quot; is often left untranslated, so as to encompass its full range of meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;rahula&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rahula | first = Walpola | authorlink = Walpola Rahula | title = What the Buddha Taught | publisher = [[Grove Press]] | year = 1959 | isbn = 0-8021-3031-3 | chapter= Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;prebish&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Prebish | first = Charles | title = Historical Dictionary of Buddhism | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8108-2698-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;keown&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Keown | first = Damien | title = Dictionary of Buddhism | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-19-860560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not-self (Pāli: ''[[anatta]]''; Sanskrit: ''anātman'') is the third mark of existence. Upon careful examination, one finds that no phenomenon is really &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;; these concepts are in fact constructed by the mind. In the ''[[Nikayas]]'' anatta is not meant as a metaphysical assertion, but as an approach for gaining release from suffering. In fact, the Buddha rejected both of the metaphysical assertions &quot;I have a [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]]&quot; and &quot;I have no Self&quot; as [[ontology|ontological]] [[View (Buddhism)|views]] that bind one to suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/notself.html ''The Not-Self Strategy''], See Point 3{{spaced ndash}}The Canon quote Thanissaro Bhikkhu draws attention to is the ''[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html#ayoniso Sabbasava Sutta].''&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if the self was identical with the body, the Buddha [[Fourteen unanswerable questions|refused to answer]]. By analyzing the constantly changing physical and mental constituents ([[skandha]]s) of a person or object, the practitioner comes to the conclusion that neither the respective parts nor the person as a whole comprise a self.

====Dependent arising====
{{Main|Pratītyasamutpāda}}
The doctrine of pratītyasamutpāda (Sanskrit; Pali: paticcasamuppāda; Tibetan: rten.cing.'brel.bar.'byung.ba; Chinese: 緣起) is an important part of Buddhist metaphysics. It states that phenomena arise together in a mutually interdependent web of cause and effect. It is variously rendered into English as &quot;dependent origination&quot;, &quot;conditioned genesis&quot;, &quot;dependent co-arising&quot;, &quot;interdependent arising&quot;, or &quot;contingency&quot;.

The best-known application of the concept of pratītyasamutpāda is the scheme of [[Twelve Nidānas]] (from Pāli &quot;nidāna&quot; meaning &quot;cause, foundation, source or origin&quot;), which explain the continuation of the cycle of suffering and rebirth (saṃsāra) in detail.&lt;ref&gt;This twelve nidana scheme can be found, for instance, in multiple discourses in chapter 12 of the ''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]''—''Nidana Vagga'' (e.g., see SN 12.2, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html Thanissaro, 1997a)]. Other &quot;applications&quot; of what might be termed &quot;mundane dependent origination&quot; include the nine-nidana scheme of ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' 15 (e.g., [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html Thanissaro, 1997b)] and the ten-nidana scheme of ''Samyutta Nikaya'' 12.65 (e.g., [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.065.than.html Thanissaro, 1997c).] So-called &quot;transcendental dependent origination&quot; (also involving twelve nidanas) is described in ''Samyutta Nikaya'' 12.23 (e.g., see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html Bodhi, 1995).] In addition, Digha Nikaya 15 describes an eleven-nidana scheme (starting with &quot;feeling&quot;) that leads to interpersonal suffering (&quot;the taking up of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and lies&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Twelve Nidānas}}
The Twelve Nidānas describe a causal connection between the subsequent characteristics or conditions of cyclic existence, each one giving rise to the next:

# Avidyā: ignorance, specifically spiritual ignorance of the nature of reality;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Introduction to Buddhism, page 56&lt;/ref&gt;
# Saṃskāras: literally formations, explained as referring to [[karma]];
# Vijñāna: [[consciousness]], specifically discriminative;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Introduction to Buddhism, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;
# Nāmarūpa: literally name and form, referring to mind and body;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Introduction to Buddhism, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
# Ṣaḍāyatana: the six sense bases: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind-organ;
# Sparśa: variously translated contact, impression, stimulation (by a sense object);
# Vedanā: usually translated feeling: this is the &quot;hedonic tone&quot;, i.e. whether something is pleasant, unpleasant or neutral;
# Tṛṣṇā: literally thirst, but in Buddhism nearly always used to mean craving;
# Upādāna: clinging or grasping; the word also means fuel, which feeds the continuing cycle of rebirth;
# Bhava: literally being (existence) or becoming. (The Theravada explains this as having two meanings: karma, which produces a new existence, and the existence itself.);&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Introduction to Buddhism, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
# Jāti: literally birth, but life is understood as starting at conception;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Introduction to Buddhism, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
# Jarāmaraṇa: (old age and death) and also śokaparidevaduḥkhadaurmanasyopāyāsa (sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and misery).

Sentient beings always suffer throughout saṃsāra, until they free themselves from this suffering by attaining [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]]. Then the absence of the first Nidāna—ignorance—leads to the absence of the others.

====Emptiness====
{{Main|Śūnyatā}}
[[Mahayana]] Buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from [[Nagarjuna]] (perhaps c. 150–250 CE), arguably the most influential scholar within the Mahayana tradition. Nagarjuna's primary contribution to [[Buddhist philosophy]] was the systematic exposition of the concept of [[śūnyatā]], or &quot;emptiness&quot;, widely attested in the ''[[Prajñāpāramitā]]'' sutras that emerged in his era. The concept of emptiness brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination), to refute the metaphysics of [[Sarvastivada]] and [[Sautrantika]] (extinct non-Mahayana schools). For Nagarjuna, it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of [[Atman (Buddhism)|ātman]]; all phenomena ([[Dharma (Buddhism)#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]]) are without any [[svabhava]] (literally &quot;own-nature&quot; or &quot;self-nature&quot;), and thus without any underlying essence; they are &quot;empty&quot; of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. Nagarjuna's school of thought is known as the [[Mādhyamaka]]. Some of the writings attributed to Nagarjuna made explicit references to Mahayana texts, but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|agamas]]. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent [[exegesis]] of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the Canon. In the eyes of Nagarjuna the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Mādhyamaka system.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lindtner, ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing 1997, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarvastivada teachings—which were criticized by Nāgārjuna—were reformulated by scholars such as [[Vasubandhu]] and [[Asanga]] and were adapted into the [[Yogacara]] (Sanskrit: yoga practice) school. While the Mādhyamaka school held that asserting the existence or non-existence of any ultimately real thing was inappropriate, some exponents of Yogacara asserted that the mind and only the mind is ultimately real (a doctrine known as [[cittamatra]]). Not all Yogacarins asserted that mind was truly existent; Vasubandhu and Asanga in particular did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Lusthaus]], [http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm &quot;What is and isn't Yogacara&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; These two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahayana metaphysics in the Indo-Tibetan tradition.

Besides emptiness, Mahayana schools often place emphasis on the notions of perfected spiritual insight ([[prajñāpāramitā]]) and Buddha-nature ([[tathāgatagarbha]]).  There are conflicting interpretations of the ''tathāgatagarbha'' in Mahāyāna thought. The idea may be traced to ''[[Abhidharma]]'', and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the ''Nikāyas''. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], according to the [[Sakya]] school, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. In [[Nyingma]], tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the [[Gelug]] school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated). According to the [[Jonang]] school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc. when adventitious obscurations are removed. The &quot;[[Tathāgatagarbha Sutras]]&quot; are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature. Even though this collection was generally ignored in India,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts.

===Nirvana===
[[File:Mahabodhitemple.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mahabodhi|Mahabodhi temple]] in [[Bodhgaya]], India, where Gautama Buddha attained [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]] under the [[Bodhi Tree]] (left)]]
{{Main|Nirvana (concept)}}
[[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]] (Sanskrit; Pali: &quot;Nibbana&quot;) means &quot;cessation&quot;, &quot;extinction&quot; (of [[Tanha|craving]] and [[avijja|ignorance]] and therefore [[dukkha|suffering]] and the cycle of involuntary rebirths ([[saṃsāra]])), &quot;extinguished&quot;, &quot;quieted&quot;, &quot;calmed&quot;; it is also known as &quot;Awakening&quot; or &quot;Enlightenment&quot; in the West. The term for anybody who has achieved ''nirvana'', including the Buddha, is ''[[arahant]]''.

''[[Bodhi]]'' (Pāli and Sanskrit, in [[devanagari]]: बॊधि) is a term applied to the experience of Awakening of arahants. ''Bodhi'' literally means &quot;awakening&quot;, but it is more commonly translated into English as &quot;enlightenment&quot;. In [[Early Buddhism]], ''bodhi'' carried a meaning synonymous to ''nirvana'', using only some different metaphors to describe the experience, which implies the extinction of ''raga'' (greed, craving),&lt;ref&gt;''raga'', [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:489.pali Pali-English Dictionary], The Pali Text Society&lt;/ref&gt; ''dosa'' (hate, aversion)&lt;ref&gt;''dosa'', [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:2598.pali Pali-English Dictionary], The Pali Text Society&lt;/ref&gt; and ''moha'' (delusion).&lt;ref&gt;''moha'', [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:229.pali Pali-English Dictionary], The Pali Text Society&lt;/ref&gt; In the later school of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], the status of ''nirvana'' was downgraded in some scriptures, coming to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate, implying that delusion was still present in one who attained ''nirvana'', and that one needed to attain ''bodhi'' to eradicate delusion:

{{Quote|An important development in the Mahayana [was] that it came to separate nirvana from bodhi ('awakening' to the truth, Enlightenment), and to put a lower value on the former (Gombrich, 1992d). Originally nirvana and bodhi refer to the same thing; they merely use different metaphors for the experience. But the Mahayana tradition separated them and considered that nirvana referred only to the extinction of craving (passion and hatred), with the resultant escape from the cycle of rebirth. This interpretation ignores the third fire, delusion: the extinction of delusion is of course in the early texts identical with what can be positively expressed as [[gnosis]], Enlightenment.|Richard F. Gombrich|''How Buddhism Began''&lt;ref name=&quot;Gombrich&quot; /&gt;}}

Therefore, according to Mahayana Buddhism, the ''[[arahant]]'' has attained only ''nirvana'', thus still being subject to delusion, while the ''[[bodhisattva]]'' not only achieves ''nirvana'' but full liberation from delusion as well. He thus attains ''bodhi'' and becomes a ''buddha.'' In Theravada Buddhism, ''bodhi'' and ''nirvana'' carry the same meaning as in the early texts, that of being freed from greed, hate and delusion.

The term ''[[parinirvana]]'' is also encountered in Buddhism, and this generally refers to the complete ''nirvana'' attained by the ''arahant'' at the moment of death, when the physical body expires.

===Buddha eras===
Buddhists believe [[Gautama Buddha]] was the first to achieve enlightenment in this Buddha era and is therefore credited with the establishment of Buddhism. A Buddha era is the stretch of history during which people remember and practice the teachings of the earliest ''known'' Buddha. This Buddha era will end when all the knowledge, evidence and teachings of Gautama Buddha have vanished. This belief therefore maintains that many Buddha eras have started and ended throughout the course of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bullitt/bfaq.html#maitreya |title='&amp;#39;Access to Insight'&amp;#39;, a Theravada Buddhist website, discusses Buddha Eras |publisher=Accesstoinsight.org |date=2010-06-05 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.26.0.than.html |title=Gautama Buddha discusses the Maitreya Buddha in the Tipitaka |publisher=Accesstoinsight.org |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gautama Buddha, then, is ''the Buddha of this era'', who taught directly or indirectly to all other Buddhas in it (see types of Buddhas).

In addition, Mahayana Buddhists believe there are innumerable other Buddhas in other universes.&lt;ref&gt;Kogen Mizuno, ''Essentials of Buddhism'', Shunju-sha, 1972, English translation, Kosei, Tokyo, 1996, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; A Theravada commentary says that Buddhas arise one at a time in this world element, and not at all in others.&lt;ref&gt;''Dispeller of Delusion''. Vol. II. Pali Text Society, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; The understandings of this matter reflect widely differing interpretations of basic terms, such as &quot;world realm&quot;, between the various schools of Buddhism.

The idea of the decline and gradual disappearance of the teaching has been influential in East Asian Buddhism. Pure Land Buddhism holds that it has declined to the point where few are capable of following the path, so it may be best to rely on the power of the Amitabha Buddha.

Devotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional practices include bowing, offerings, pilgrimage, and chanting. In Pure Land Buddhism, devotion to the Buddha Amitabha is the main practice. In Nichiren Buddhism, devotion to the Lotus Sutra is the main practice.

Buddhism traditionally incorporates states of meditative absorption (Pali: ''[[jhāna]]''; Skt: ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'').&lt;ref name=Heisig&gt;''Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)'' by [[Heinrich Dumoulin]], James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 22)&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient sustained expression of yogic ideas is found in the early sermons of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stoler Miller, ''Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: the Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali; a Translation of the Text, with Commentary, Introduction, and Glossary of Keywords.'' University of California Press, 1996, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; One key innovative teaching of the Buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with liberating cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the Buddha's teaching and the yoga presented in early Brahminic texts is striking. Meditative states alone are not an end, for according to the Buddha, even the highest meditative state is not liberating. Instead of attaining a complete cessation of thought, some sort of mental activity must take place: a liberating cognition, based on the practice of mindful awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meditation]] was an aspect of the practice of the [[yogi]]s in the centuries preceding the Buddha. The Buddha built upon the yogis' concern with introspection and developed their meditative techniques, but rejected their theories of liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrithers, ''The Buddha.'' Taken from ''Founders of Faith'', published by Oxford University Press, 1986, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] and [[sampajanna|clear awareness]] are to be developed at all times; in pre-Buddhist yogic practices there is no such injunction. A yogi in the Brahmanical tradition is not to practice while defecating, for example, while a Buddhist monastic should do so.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The origin of Buddhist meditation.'' Routledge, 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious knowledge or &quot;vision&quot; was indicated as a result of practice both within and outside of the Buddhist fold. According to the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'', this sort of vision arose for the Buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of &quot;meditation&quot; coupled with the perfection of &quot;discipline&quot; (Pali ''[[sīla]]''; Skt. ''[[śīla]]''). Some of the Buddha's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day, but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of &quot;transcendent wisdom&quot; (Pali ''[[paññā]]''; Skt. ''[[prajñā]]'') was original.&lt;ref name=&quot;westernbuddhistreview.com&quot;&gt;Dharmacarini Manishini, ''Western Buddhist Review.'' Accessed at http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/kamma_in_context.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist texts are probably the earliest describing meditation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; They describe meditative practices and states that existed before the Buddha as well as those first developed within Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bronkhorst, ''The Two Traditions of Mediation in Ancient India.'' Franz Steiner Verlag Weisbaden GmbH, pages 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Upanishads written after the rise of Buddhism do contain full-fledged descriptions of [[yoga]] as a means to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA199,M1 page 199].&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no convincing evidence for meditation in pre-Buddhist early Brahminic texts, Wynne argues that formless meditation originated in the Brahminic or Shramanic tradition, based on strong parallels between Upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the Buddha as recorded in the early Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Wynne 2007, page 51&quot;&gt;Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions less likely possibilities as well.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge 2007, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Having argued that the cosmological statements in the Upanishads also reflect a contemplative tradition, he argues that the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] contains evidence for a contemplative tradition, even as early as the late Rig Vedic period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Wynne 2007, page 51&quot;/&gt;

====Refuge in the Three Jewels====
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|Relic depicting footprint of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] with [[Dharmachakra]] and [[Three Jewels|triratna]], 1st century CE, [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]].]]
{{Main|Refuge (Buddhism)|Three Jewels}}

Traditionally, the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking refuge in the Three Jewels ([[Sanskrit]]: ''tri-ratna'', [[Pāli]]: ''ti-ratana'')&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|title=Refuge
|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/refuge.html#goi
|author= Bhikku, Thanissaro
|year=2001
|work=An Introduction to the Buddha, Dhamma, &amp; Sangha
|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the foundation of one's religious practice. The practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned&lt;ref&gt;''Middle-Length Discourses of the Buddha'', tr. Nanamoli, rev. Bodhi, Wisdom Publications, 1995, pp. 708f&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[Majjhima Nikaya]]'', recognized by most scholars as an early text (cf. [[Infant baptism]]). Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the ''[[lama]]''. In Mahayana, the person who chooses the ''[[bodhisattva]]'' path makes a vow or pledge, considered the ultimate expression of compassion. In Mahayana, too, the Three Jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect: &quot;The Three Jewels have the quality of excellence. Just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness, whether praised or reviled, so are the Three Jewels (Refuges), because they have an eternal and immutable essence. These Three Jewels bring a fruition that is changeless, for once one has reached Buddhahood, there is no possibility of falling back to suffering.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Professor C.D. Sebastian, ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism'', Sri Satguru Publications, Bibliotheca Indo-Buddhica Series No. 238, Delhi, 2005, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The Three Jewels are:
* The [[Buddha]]. This is a title for those who have attained Nirvana. See also the [[Tathagata|Tathāgata]] and [[Gautama Buddha]]. The Buddha could also be represented as a concept instead of a specific person: the perfect wisdom that understands ''Dharma'' and sees reality in its true form. In Mahayana Buddhism, the Buddha can be viewed as the supreme Refuge: &quot;Buddha is the Unique Absolute Refuge. Buddha is the Imperishable, Eternal, Indestructible and Absolute Refuge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Professor C.D. Sebastian, ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism'', Delhi, 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]''. The teachings or law of nature as expounded by the Gautama Buddha. It can also, especially in Mahayana, connote the ultimate and sustaining Reality that is inseparable from the Buddha. Further, from some Mahayana perspectives, the Dharma embodied in the form of a great sutra (Buddhic scripture) can replace the need for a personal teacher and can be a direct and spontaneous gateway into Truth (Dharma). This is especially said to be the case with the [[Lotus Sutra]]. Dr. Hiroshi Kanno writes of this view of the ''Lotus Sutra'': &quot;it is a Dharma-gate of sudden enlightenment proper to the Great Vehicle; it is a Dharma-gate whereby one awakens spontaneously, without resorting to a teacher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshi Kanno, ''Huisi's Perspective on the Lotus Sutra as Seen Through the Meaning of the Course of Ease and Bliss in the Lotus Sutra'', p. 147, http://www.iop.or.jp/0414/kanno2.pdf, consulted 5 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''[[Sangha]]''. Those who have attained to any of the [[Four stages of enlightenment]], or simply the congregation of [[Buddhist monasticism|monastic practitioners]].

According to the scriptures, Gautama Buddha presented himself as a model. The Dharma offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of Nirvana. The Sangha is considered to provide a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable.

===Buddhist ethics===
{{Main|The Five Precepts}}
[[File:StandingBuddha.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of [[Gautama Buddha]], 1st century CE, [[Gandhara]]]]
''[[Śīla]]'' (Sanskrit) or ''sīla'' (Pāli) is usually translated into English as &quot;virtuous behavior&quot;, &quot;morality&quot;, &quot;ethics&quot; or &quot;precept&quot;. It is an action committed through the body, speech, or mind, and involves an intentional effort. It is one of the ''three practices'' (''sila'', ''samadhi'', and ''panya'') and the second ''[[Paramita|pāramitā]]''. It refers to moral purity of thought, word, and deed. The four conditions of ''śīla'' are chastity, calmness, quiet, and extinguishment.

''Śīla'' is the foundation of ''Samadhi/Bhāvana'' (Meditative cultivation) or mind cultivation. Keeping the precepts promotes not only the peace of mind of the cultivator, which is internal, but also peace in the community, which is external. According to the Law of Karma, keeping the precepts are meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects. Keeping these precepts keeps the cultivator from rebirth in the four woeful realms of existence.

''Śīla'' refers to overall principles of ethical behavior. There are several levels of ''sila'', which correspond to &quot;basic morality&quot; ([[five precepts]]), &quot;basic morality with asceticism&quot; ([[eight precepts]]), &quot;novice monkhood&quot; ([[Ten Precepts (Buddhism)|ten precepts]]) and &quot;monkhood&quot; (''[[Vinaya]]'' or ''[[Patimokkha]]''). Lay people generally undertake to live by the five precepts, which are common to all Buddhist schools. If they wish, they can choose to undertake the [[eight precepts]], which add basic asceticism.

The five precepts are training rules in order to live a better life in which one is happy, without worries, and can meditate well:
# To refrain from taking life ([[Ahimsa#Buddhism|non-violence]] towards [[Sentience|sentient]] life forms), or ''ahimsā'';
# To refrain from taking that which is not given (not committing [[theft]]);
# To refrain from sensual (including sexual) misconduct;
# To refrain from lying (speaking truth always);
# To refrain from intoxicants which lead to loss of [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] (specifically, drugs and alcohol).

The precepts are not formulated as imperatives, but as training rules that laypeople undertake voluntarily to facilitate practice.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, page 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist thought, the cultivation of [[Dana (Buddhism)|dana]] and ethical conduct themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower heavens is likely, even if there is no further Buddhist practice. There is nothing improper or un-Buddhist about limiting one's aims to this level of attainment.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[eight precepts]], the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict, and becomes a precept of [[celibacy]]. The three additional precepts are:
:6. To refrain from eating at the wrong time (eat only from sunrise to noon);
:7. To refrain from dancing and playing music, wearing jewelry and cosmetics, attending shows and other performances;
:8. To refrain from using high or luxurious seats and bedding.

The complete list of ten precepts may be observed by laypeople for short periods. For the complete list, the seventh precept is partitioned into two, and a tenth added:

:6. To refrain from taking food at an unseasonable time, that is after the mid-day meal;
:7. To refrain from dancing, music, singing and unseemly shows;
:8. To refrain from the use of garlands, perfumes, ointments, and from things that tend to beautify and adorn (the person);
:9. To refrain from (using) high and luxurious seats (and beds);
:10. To refrain from accepting gold and silver;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions|edition= 2nd|editor1-first= Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A.|editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Edinburgh University Press|location= Edinburgh|isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3|pages= 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monastic life===
[[File:Chinese Buddhist Monks Ceremony Hangzhou.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Buddhist monk]]s performing a ceremony in Hangzhou, China]]
[[Vinaya]] is the specific moral code for monks and nuns. It includes the [[Patimokkha]], a set of 227 rules for monks in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the [[vinayapitaka]] (scriptures on Vinaya) differs slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. [[Samanera|Novice-monks]] use the [[Ten Precepts (Buddhism)|ten precepts]], which are the basic precepts for monastics.

Regarding the monastic rules, the Buddha constantly reminds his hearers that it is the spirit that counts. On the other hand, the rules themselves are designed to assure a satisfying life, and provide a perfect springboard for the higher attainments. Monastics are instructed by the Buddha to live as &quot;islands unto themselves&quot;. In this sense, living life as the vinaya prescribes it is, as one scholar puts it: &quot;more than merely a means to an end: it is very nearly the end in itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 89. He is quoting Carrithers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eastern Buddhism, there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana [[Brahmajala Sutra]] (not to be confused with the Pali text of that name) for [[Bodhisattvas]], where, for example, the eating of meat is frowned upon and [[vegetarianism]] is actively encouraged (see ''[[vegetarianism in Buddhism]]''). In Japan, this has almost completely displaced the monastic vinaya, and allows clergy to marry.

===Meditation===
[[File:Rank celebration of Thai Buddhist monk 1.jpg|thumb|[[Buddhist monk]]s praying in Thailand]]
{{Main|Buddhist meditation}}

Buddhist meditation is fundamentally concerned with two themes: transforming the mind and using it to explore itself and other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''Contemplative Science.'' Columbia University Press, 2007, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theravada Buddhism the Buddha taught two types of meditation, [[Samatha meditation|''samatha'' meditation]] (Sanskrit: ''śamatha'') and [[vipassana|''vipassanā'' meditation]] (Sanskrit: ''vipaśyanā''). In Chinese Buddhism, these exist (translated ''chih kuan''), but [[Chinese Chán|Chán]] (Zen) meditation is more popular.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, ''Practice of Chinese Buddhism'', Harvard, 1967, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Harvey, whenever Buddhism has been healthy, not only monks, nuns, and married lamas, but also more committed lay people have practiced meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Routledge's Encyclopedia of Buddhism, in contrast, throughout most of Buddhist history before modern times, serious meditation by lay people has been unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown, Charles S Prebish, editors, ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. Routledge, 2007. p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of the early texts suggests that at the time of the Buddha, many male and female lay practitioners did practice meditation, some even to the point of proficiency in all eight [[jhana|jhānas]] (see the next section regarding these).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Shaw, ''Buddhist Meditation: An Anthology of Texts from the Pāli Canon''. Routledge, 2006, page 13. Shaw also notes that discourses on meditation are addressed to &quot;bhikkhave&quot;, but that in this context the terms is more generic than simply (male) &quot;monks&quot; and refers to all practitioners, and that this is confirmed by Buddhaghosa.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Samādhi (meditative cultivation): samatha meditation====
{{Main|Samādhi (Buddhism)|Dhyāna in Buddhism}}

In the language of the Noble Eightfold Path, ''samyaksamādhi'' is &quot;right concentration&quot;. The primary means of cultivating ''samādhi'' is meditation. Upon development of ''samādhi'', one's mind becomes purified of defilement, calm, tranquil, and luminous.

Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration (''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna]]'', Sanskrit ध्यान ''dhyāna''), his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight ([[vipassana|vipassanā]]) into the ultimate nature of reality, eventually obtaining release from all suffering. The cultivation of [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] is essential to mental concentration, which is needed to achieve insight.

[[Samatha]] meditation starts from being mindful of an object or idea, which is expanded to one's body, mind and entire surroundings, leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility (''jhāna'') There are many variations in the style of meditation, from sitting cross-legged or kneeling to chanting or walking. The most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one's breath ([[anapanasati]]), because this practice can lead to both ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'.

In Buddhist practice, it is said that while ''samatha'' meditation can calm the mind, only ''vipassanā'' meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with, which is what leads to knowledge (''[[jnana|jñāna]]''; Pāli ''{{IAST|ñāṇa}}'') and understanding (''[[prajñā]]'' Pāli ''paññā''), and thus can lead to ''nirvāṇa'' (Pāli ''nibbāna''). When one is in jhana, all defilements are suppressed temporarily. Only understanding (''prajñā'' or ''vipassana'') eradicates the defilements completely. Jhanas are also states that ''[[Arahants]]'' abide in order to rest.

=====In Theravāda=====
{{Main|Jhāna in Theravada}}

In Theravāda Buddhism, the cause of human existence and suffering is identified as craving, which carries with it the various defilements. These various defilements are traditionally summed up as greed, hatred and delusion. These are believed deeply rooted afflictions of the mind that create suffering and stress. To be free from suffering and stress, these defilements must be permanently uprooted through internal investigation, analyzing, experiencing, and understanding of the true nature of those defilements by using ''jhāna'', a technique of the Noble Eightfold Path. It then leads the meditator to realize the Four Noble Truths, Enlightenment and ''[[Nirvana (concept)|Nibbana]]''. Nibbana is the ultimate goal of Theravadins.

====Prajñā (Wisdom): vipassana meditation====
{{Main|Prajñā|Vipassana}}

''Prajñā'' (Sanskrit) or ''paññā'' (Pāli) means wisdom that is based on a realization of [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent origination]], The Four Noble Truths and the [[three marks of existence]]. ''Prajñā'' is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about ''bodhi''. It is spoken of as the principal means of attaining ''{{unicode|nirvāṇa}}'', through its revelation of the true nature of all things as ''[[dukkha]]'' (unsatisfactoriness), ''[[anicca]]'' (impermanence) and ''[[anatta]]'' (not-self). ''Prajñā'' is also listed as the sixth of the six ''[[Paramita|pāramitās]]'' of the Mahayana.

Initially, ''prajñā'' is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons (dharma talks), reading, studying, and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse. Once the conceptual understanding is attained, it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha's teaching at a practical level. Notably, one could in theory attain Nirvana at any point of practice, whether deep in meditation, listening to a sermon, conducting the business of one's daily life, or any other activity.

====Zen====
{{Main|Zen}}

Zen Buddhism (禅), pronounced [[Chinese Chán|''Chán'']] in Chinese, ''seon'' in Korean or ''zen'' in Japanese (derived from the Sanskrit term ''dhyāna'', meaning &quot;meditation&quot;) is a form of Buddhism that became popular in China, Korea and Japan and that lays special emphasis on meditation.&lt;ref&gt;According to Charles S. Prebish (in his ''Historical Dictionary of Buddhism'', Sri Satguru Publications, Delhi, 1993, p. 287): &quot;Although a variety of Zen 'schools' developed in Japan, they all emphasize Zen as a teaching that does not depend on sacred texts, that provides the potential for direct realization, that the realization attained is none other than the Buddha nature possessed by each sentient being ...&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Zen places less emphasis on scriptures than some other forms of Buddhism and prefers to focus on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth.

Zen Buddhism is divided into two main schools: [[Rinzai]] (臨済宗) and [[Sōtō]] (曹洞宗), the former greatly favouring the use in meditation on the [[koan]] (公案, a meditative riddle or puzzle) as a device for spiritual break-through, and the latter (while certainly employing koans) focusing more on ''[[shikantaza]]'' or &quot;just sitting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Prebish comments (op. cit., p. 244): &quot;It presumes that ''sitting in meditation itself'' (i.e. ''[[zazen]]'') is an expression of Buddha nature.&quot; The method is to detach the mind from conceptual modes of thinking and perceive Reality directly. Speaking of Zen in general, Buddhist scholar Stephen Hodge writes (''Zen Masterclass'', Godsfield Press, 2002, pp. 12–13): &quot;... practitioners of Zen believe that Enlightenment, the awakening of the Buddha-mind or Buddha-nature, is our natural state, but has been covered over by layers of negative emotions and distorted thoughts. According to this view, Enlightenment is not something that we must acquire a bit at a time, but a state that can occur instantly when we cut through the dense veil of mental and emotional obscurations.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Zen Buddhist teaching is often full of paradox, in order to loosen the grip of the ego and to facilitate the penetration into the realm of the True Self or Formless Self, which is equated with the Buddha himself.&lt;ref&gt;(''Critical Sermons on the Zen Tradition'', Hisamatsu Shin'ichi, Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2002, ''passim'') Commenting on Rinzai Zen and its Chinese founder, Linji, Hisamatsu states: &quot;Linji indicates our true way of being in such direct expressions as 'True Person' and 'True Self'. It is independent of words or letters and transmitted apart from scriptural teaching. Buddhism doesn't really need scriptures. It is just our direct awakening to Self ...&quot; (Hisamatsu, op. cit., p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zen master Kosho Uchiyama, when thoughts and fixation on the little &quot;I&quot; are transcended, an Awakening to a universal, non-dual Self occurs: &quot;When we let go of thoughts and wake up to the reality of life that is working beyond them, we discover the Self that is living universal non-dual life (before the separation into two) that pervades all living creatures and all existence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kosho Uchiyama, ''Opening the Hand of Thought: Approach to Zen'', Penguin Books, New York, 1993, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking and thought must therefore not be allowed to confine and bind one.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction'', pp. 165f&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vajrayana and Tantra====
Though based upon Mahayana, Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhism is one of the schools that practice ''[[Vajrayana]]'' or &quot;Diamond Vehicle&quot; (also referred to as Mantrayāna, Tantrayāna, [[Tantra|Tantric]] Buddhism, or [[esotericism|esoteric]] Buddhism). It accepts all the basic concepts of Mahāyāna, but also includes a vast array of spiritual and physical techniques designed to enhance Buddhist practice. Tantric Buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, 1st ed., 1989, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; One component of the Vajrayāna is harnessing psycho-physical energy through ritual, visualization, physical exercises, and meditation as a means of developing the mind. Using these techniques, it is claimed that a practitioner can achieve Buddhahood in one lifetime, or even as little as three years. In the Tibetan tradition, these practices can include [[sexual yoga]], though only for some very advanced practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', p. 781 .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical roots===
[[File:ElloraPuja.jpg|thumb|right|The Buddhist &quot;Carpenter's Cave&quot; at [[Ellora]] in [[Maharashtra]], India]]
Historically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of [[Iron Age India|ancient India]] during the second half of the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin, ''Sayings of the Buddha'', Oxford University Press, 2008, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; That was a period of social and religious turmoil, as there was significant discontent with the sacrifices and rituals of [[Vedic Brahmanism]].&lt;ref name= ebbuddh&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online.

Masih (2000) In : A Comparative Study of Religions, Motilal Banarsidass Publ : Delhi, ISBN 81-208-0815-0 Page 18. &quot;There is no evidence to show that Jainism and Buddhism ever subscribed to vedic sacrifices, vedic deities or caste. They are parallel or native religions of India and have contributed to much to the growth of even classical Hinduism of the present times.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Cromwell Crawford, review of L. M. Joshi, ''Brahmanism, Buddhism and Hinduism'', Philosophy East and West (1972): &quot;Alongside Brahmanism was the non-Aryan Shramanic culture with its roots going back to prehistoric times.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have reasons to believe that ideas such as samsara, karma (in the sense of the influence of morality on rebirth), and [[moksha]] originated in the shramanas, and were later adopted by [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmin]] orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This confirms that the doctrine of transmigration is non-aryan and was accepted by non-vedics like Ajivikism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Indo-aryans have borrowed the theory of re-birth after coming in contact with the aboriginal inhabitants of India. Certainly Jainism and non-vedics [..] accepted the doctrine of rebirth as supreme postulate or article of faith.&quot; Masih, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner, ''The Longhaired Sage'' in ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Karel Werner, ed., Curzon Press, 1989, page 34. &quot;Rahurkar speaks of them as belonging to two distinct 'cultural strands' ... Wayman also found evidence for two distinct approaches to the spiritual dimension in ancient India and calls them the traditions of 'truth and silence.'

Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University&amp;nbsp;— Press : UK ISBN 0-521-43878-0 - &quot;The origin and doctrine of Karma and Samsara are obscure. These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahaminical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions.&quot; Page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Padmanabh S. Jaini 2001 &quot;Collected Paper on Buddhist Studies&quot; Motilal Banarsidass Publ 576 pages ISBN 81-208-1776-1: &quot;Yajnavalkya's reluctance and manner in expounding the doctrine of karma in the assembly of Janaka (a reluctance not shown on any other occasion) can perhaps be explained by the assumption that it was, like that of the transmigration of soul, of non-brahmanical origin. In view of the fact that this doctrine is emblazoned on almost every page of sramana scriptures, it is highly probable that it was derived from them.&quot; Page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Govind Chandra Pande, (1994) Life and Thought of Sankaracarya, Motilal Banarsidass ISBN 81-208-1104-6 : Early Upanishad thinkers like Yajnavalkya were acquainted with the sramanic thinking and tried to incorporate these ideals of Karma, Samsara and Moksa into the vedic thought implying a disparagement of the vedic ritualism and recognising the mendicancy as an ideal. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The sudden appearance of this theory [of karma] in a full-fledged form is likely due, as already pointed out, to an impact of the wandering muni-and-[[shramana]]-cult, coming down from the pre-Vedic non-Aryan time.&quot; Kashi Nath Upadhyaya, ''Early Buddhism and the Bhagavadgita''. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1998, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view is supported by a study of the region where these notions originated.  Buddhism arose in Greater Magadha, which stretched from Sravasti, the capital of Kosala in the north-west, to Rajagrha in the south east.  This land, to the east of [[aryavarta]], the land of the Aryas, was recognised as non-Vedic.&lt;ref&gt;Satapatha Brahmana 13.8.1.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Vedic texts reveal a dislike of the people of Magadha, in all probability because the Magadhas at this time were not Brahmanised.&lt;ref&gt;Oldenburg, Hermann, The Doctrine of the Upanishads and Early Buddhism, 1915, reprinted 1991 by Shridhar B. Shrotri, Delhi, Motilalal Banardass&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until the 2nd or 3rd centuries BCE that the eastward spread of Brahmanism into Greater Magadha became significant.  Ideas that developed in Greater Magadha prior to this were not subject to Vedic influence.  These include rebirth and karmic retribution that appear in a number of movements in Greater Magadha, including Buddhism.  These movements inherited notions of rebirth and karmic retribution from an earlier culture.&lt;ref&gt;Greater Magadha, Studies the Culture of Early India, Bronkhorst, Johannes, Brill Academic Publishers Inc, 2007, Series: Handbook of Oriental Studies, Section 2 South Asia Series, ISBN 978-90-04-11519-4&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, these movements were influenced by, and in some respects continued, philosophical thought within the Vedic tradition as reflected e.g. in the [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. 2000. Indian Buddhism. P.30-32&lt;/ref&gt; These movements included, besides Buddhism, various [[skeptic]]s (such as [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]]), [[atomist]]s (such as [[Pakudha Kaccayana]]), [[materialist]]s (such as [[Ajita Kesakambali]]), [[antinomians]] (such as [[Purana Kassapa]]); the most important ones in the 5th century BCE were the [[Ajivikas]], who emphasized the rule of fate, the [[Lokayata]] ([[materialists]]), the [[Ajnana]]s ([[agnostics]]) and the [[Jainism|Jains]], who stressed that the soul must be freed from matter.&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. 2000. Indian Buddhism. P.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these new movements shared the same conceptual vocabulary - [[Ātman (Buddhism)|atman]] (&quot;Self&quot;), [[buddha]] (&quot;awakened one&quot;), [[dhamma]] (&quot;rule&quot; or &quot;law&quot;), [[karma]] (&quot;action&quot;), [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]] (&quot;extinguishing&quot;), [[samsara]] (&quot;eternal recurrence&quot;) and [[yoga]] (&quot;spiritual practice&quot;).&lt;ref name= ebbuddh/&gt; The shramanas rejected the Veda, and the authority of the brahmans, who claimed they possessed revealed truths not knowable by any ordinary human means. Moreover, they declared that the entire Brahmanical system was fraudulent: a conspiracy of the brahmans to enrich themselves by charging exorbitant fees to perform bogus rites and give useless advice.&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. P.33&lt;/ref&gt; 

A particular criticism of the Buddha was Vedic animal sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;westernbuddhistreview.com&quot;/&gt; The Buddha declared that priests reciting the Vedas were like the blind leading the blind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walpola Rahula]], ''What the Buddha Taught'', pages 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, those priests who had memorized the Vedas really knew nothing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The brahmin by caste alone, the teacher of the ''Veda'', is (jokingly) etymologized as the 'non-meditator' (''ajhāyaka''). Brahmins who have memorized the three ''Vedas'' (''tevijja'') really know nothing: it is the process of achieving Enlightenment—what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the three watches of that night—which constitutes the true 'three knowledges.'&quot; R.F.

===Indian Buddhism===
{{Main|History of Buddhism in India}}

The history of Indian Buddhism may be divided into five periods:&lt;ref&gt;A History of Indian Buddhism&amp;nbsp;— Hirakawa Akira (translated and edited by Paul Groner) - Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 1993, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Early Buddhism (occasionally called [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism]]), [[Nikaya Buddhism]] or Sectarian Buddhism: The period of the [[Early Buddhist schools]], Early [[Mahayana Buddhism]], Later Mahayana Buddhism, and Esoteric Buddhism (also called [[Vajrayana Buddhism]]).

====Pre-sectarian Buddhism====
{{Main|Pre-sectarian Buddhism}}

Pre-sectarian Buddhism is the earliest phase of Buddhism, recognized by nearly all scholars. Its main scriptures are the [[Vinaya Pitaka]] and the four principal [[Nikaya]]s or [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agama]]s. Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, so most scholars conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the [[Three marks of existence]], the [[Skandha|Five Aggregates]], [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent origination]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]], the [[Four Noble Truths]], the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], and [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, ''Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 34 &amp;amp; table of contents&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars disagree, and have proposed many other theories.&lt;ref&gt;Skorupski, ''Buddhist Forum'', vol I, Heritage, Delhi/SOAS, London, 1990, p. 5; ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'', vol 21 (1998), part 1, pp. 4, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also the book ''Bones, Stones, and Buddhist Monks'', University of Hawai'i Press, by Dr Gregory Schopen&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Buddhist schools====
{{Main|Early Buddhist schools|Buddhist councils|Theravada}}
[[File:Buddhaghosa offering his commentaries.jpg|thumb|left|Painting depicting [[Buddhaghosa]] offering his ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' to monks in [[Mahavihara]], the center of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] in [[Sri Lanka]]]]
According to the scriptures, soon after the [[Parinirvana|{{IAST|parinirvāṇa}}]] (from Sanskrit: &quot;highest extinguishment&quot;) of Gautama Buddha, the [[first Buddhist council]] was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission. In the first council, [[Ananda|Ānanda]], a cousin of the Buddha and his personal attendant, was called upon to recite the discourses (''sūtras'', Pāli ''sutta''s) of the Buddha, and, according to some sources, the [[abhidhamma]]. [[Upali|Upāli]], another disciple, recited the monastic rules (''[[vinaya]]''). Scholars regard the traditional accounts of the council as greatly exaggerated if not entirely fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Religion'', Macmillan, New York, sv Councils, Buddhist&lt;/ref&gt;

According to most scholars, at some period after the Second Council the ''Sangha'' began to break into separate factions.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Pāli Text Society'', volume XVI, p. 105)&lt;/ref&gt; The various accounts differ as to when the actual schisms occurred. According to the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'' of the Pāli tradition, they started immediately after the Second Council, the Puggalavada tradition places it in 137 AN&lt;!-- Assume this is &quot;After Nirvana&quot;. Please convert to BCE/CE--&gt;, the [[Sarvastivada]] tradition of [[Vasumitra]] says it was in the time of Asoka and the [[Mahasanghika]] tradition places it much later, nearly 100 BCE.

The root schism was between the [[Sthaviras]] and the [[Mahāsāṅghikas]]. The fortunate survival of accounts from both sides of the dispute reveals disparate traditions. The Sthavira group offers two quite distinct reasons for the schism. The Dipavamsa of the Theravāda says that the losing party in the Second Council dispute broke away in protest and formed the Mahasanghika. This contradicts the Mahasanghikas' own ''vinaya'', which shows them as on the same, winning side. The Mahāsāṅghikas argued that the Sthaviras were trying to expand the ''vinaya'' and may also have challenged what they perceived were excessive claims or inhumanly high criteria for [[arhat]]ship. Both parties, therefore, appealed to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Janice J. Nattier and Charles S. Prebish, 1977. ''Mahāsāṅghika Origins: the beginnings of Buddhist sectarianism'' in History of Religions, Vol. 16, pp. 237–272&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sthaviras gave rise to several schools, one of which was the [[Theravada|Theravāda]] school. Originally, these schisms were caused by disputes over vinaya, and monks following different schools of thought seem to have lived happily together in the same monasteries, but eventually, by about 100 CE if not earlier, schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Introduction to Buddhism'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Following (or leading up to) the schisms, each Saṅgha started to accumulate an [[Abhidhamma|Abhidharma]], a detailed scholastic reworking of doctrinal material appearing in the [[Sūtra|Suttas]], according to schematic classifications. These Abhidharma texts do not contain systematic philosophical treatises, but summaries or numerical lists. Scholars generally date these texts to around the 3rd century BCE, 100 to 200 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore the seven Abhidharma works are generally claimed not to represent the words of the Buddha himself, but those of disciples and great scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Abhidamma&quot;&gt;&quot;Abhidhamma Pitaka.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Every school had its own version of the Adhidharma, with different theories and different texts. The different Adhidharmas of the various schools did not agree with each other. Scholars disagree on whether the Mahasanghika school had an Abhidhamma Pitaka or not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Abhidamma&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. Routledge. p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Mahayana Buddhism====
{{Main|Mahāyāna}}
[[File:BuddhistTriad.JPG|thumb|right|A Buddhist triad depicting, left to right, a [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]], the future buddha [[Maitreya]], [[Gautama Buddha]], the bodhisattva [[Avalokiteśvara]], and a [[Buddhist monk]]. 2nd—3rd century. [[Guimet Museum|Musée Guimet]]]]
The origins of Mahāyāna, which formed between 100 BCE and 100 AD,&lt;ref name=VeryShort&gt;{{cite book|author=Keown, Damien|title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=58, 61|isbn=978-0-19-285386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; are still not completely understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 260&quot;&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest views of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the West assumed that it existed as a separate school in competition with the so-called &quot;[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]&quot; schools. The split was on the order of the European [[Protestant Reformation]], which divided Christians into [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]].&lt;ref name=VeryShort /&gt; Due to the veneration of buddhas and bodhisattvas, Mahāyāna was often interpreted as a more devotional, lay-inspired form of Buddhism, with supposed origins in [[stupa|stūpa]] veneration.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (1993), ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Sakyamuni to Early Mahayana'': p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; The old views of Mahāyāna as a lay-inspired sect are now largely considered misguided and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One of the most frequent assertions about the Mahayana ... is that it was a lay-influenced, or even lay-inspired and dominated, movement that arose in response to the increasingly closed, cold, and scholastic character of monastic Buddhism. This, however, now appears to be wrong on all counts.&quot; ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194&quot;&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was known as ''Bodhisattvayāna'' (the &quot;Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas&quot;).&lt;ref name=VeryShort /&gt; Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[Vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the [[early schools of Buddhism]], and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] ordination lineage in East Asia, and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] ordination lineage in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2000) ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'': p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Large empty outline of a person in a rock cliff|[[Buddhas of Bamiyan]]: [[Vairocana]] before and after destruction by the [[Taliban]] in 2001]]
The Chinese monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] who visited India in the 7th century CE, distinguishes Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Both adopt one and the same Vinaya, and they have in common the prohibitions of the five offences, and also the practice of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Those who venerate the bodhisattvas and read the Mahāyāna sūtras are called the Mahāyānists, while those who do not perform these are called the Hīnayānists.}}

Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mahāyāna comes from early Chinese translations of Mahāyāna texts. These Mahāyāna teachings were first propagated into [[China]] by [[Lokaksema|Lokakṣema]], the first translator of Mahāyāna sūtras into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] during the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;China 2004, page 492&quot;&gt;&quot;The most important evidence — in fact the only evidence — for situating the emergence of the Mahayana around the beginning of the common era was not Indian evidence at all, but came from China. Already by the last quarter of the 2nd century CE, there was a small, seemingly idiosyncratic collection of substantial Mahayana sutras translated into what Erik Zürcher calls 'broken Chinese' by an Indoscythian, whose Indian name has been reconstructed as Lokaksema.&quot; ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have traditionally considered the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras to include the very first versions of the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] series, along with texts concerning [[Aksobhya|Akṣobhya Buddha]], which were probably composed in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 263&quot;&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 263, 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The south (of India) was then vigorously creative in producing Mahayana Sutras&quot; – Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late Mahayana Buddhism====
During the period of Late Mahayana Buddhism, four major types of thought developed: [[Madhyamaka]], [[Yogacara]], [[Tathagatagarbha]], and [[Indian logic#Buddhist logic|Buddhist Logic]] as the last and most recent.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Indian Buddhism&amp;nbsp;— Hirakawa Akira (translated and edited by Paul Groner) - Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 1993, p. 8,9&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahayana were the Madhyamaka and the later Yogacara.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, &quot;An Introduction to Buddhism.&quot; Cambridge University Press, 1993, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dan Lusthaus, Madhyamaka and Yogacara have a great deal in common, and the commonality stems from early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, pages 236-237.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no great Indian teachers associated with tathagatagarbha thought.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, &quot;An Introduction to Buddhism.&quot; Cambridge University Press, 1993, page 113. &quot;There were no great Indian teachers associated with this strand of thought.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vajrayana (Esoteric Buddhism)====
{{main|Vajrayana}}
Scholarly research concerning [[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]] is still in its early stages and has a number of problems that make research difficult:&lt;ref&gt;A History of Indian Buddhism&amp;nbsp;— Hirakawa Akira (translated and edited by Paul Groner) - Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 1993, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
# Vajrayana Buddhism was influenced by [[Hinduism]], and therefore research must include explore Hinduism as well.
# The scriptures of Vajrayana have not yet been put in any kind of order.
# Ritual must be examined as well, not just doctrine.

===Development of Buddhism===
{{Main|Timeline of Buddhism}}
[[File:Asoka Kaart.gif|thumb|left|Buddhist [[proselytism]] at the time of emperor [[Ashoka]] (260–218 BCE).]]
[[File:MenandrosCoin.jpg|thumb|Coin depicting [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander I|Menander]], who, according to Buddhist tradition records in the [[Milinda Panha]], converted to the Buddhist faith and became an [[arhat]] in the 2nd century BCE .]]

Buddhism may have spread only slowly in India until the time of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]], who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of Aśoka and his descendants led to the construction of more [[stupa|stūpas]] (Buddhist religious memorials) and to efforts to spread Buddhism throughout the enlarged Maurya empire and even into neighboring lands—particularly to the Iranian-speaking regions of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Central Asia]], beyond the Mauryas' northwest border, and to the island of [[Sri Lanka]] south of India. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, and in the second case, to the emergence of Theravāda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to the coastal lands of [[Southeast Asia]].

This period marks the first known spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of Aśoka]], emissaries were sent to various countries west of India to spread Buddhism (Dharma), particularly in eastern provinces of the neighboring [[Seleucid Empire]], and even farther to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] kingdoms of the Mediterranean. It is a matter of disagreement among scholars whether or not these emissaries were accompanied by Buddhist missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, ''Theravada Buddhism'', Routledge, 2nd ed, 2006, page 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The gradual spread of Buddhism into adjacent areas meant that it came into contact with new ethnical groups. During this period Buddhism was exposed to a variety of influences, from Persian and Greek civilization, to changing trends in non-Buddhist Indian religions—themselves influenced by Buddhism. Striking examples of this syncretistic development can be seen in the emergence of Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs in the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], and in the development of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]. A Greek king, [[Menander I|Menander]], has even been immortalized in the Buddhist canon.

The Theravada school spread south from India in the 3rd century BCE, to Sri Lanka and [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]] and later also [[Indonesia]]. The Dharmagupta school spread (also in 3rd century BCE) north to [[Kashmir]], Gandhara and Bactria (Afghanistan).

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to [[China]] is most commonly thought to have started in the late 2nd or the 1st century CE, though the literary sources are all open to question.&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1972), pp. 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill (2009), p. 30, for the Chinese text from the ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'', and p. 31 for a translation of it.&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented translation efforts by foreign [[Buddhist monk]]s in China were in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;Zürcher (1972), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century CE, Mahayana Sutras spread to China, and then to Korea and Japan, and were translated into Chinese. During the Indian period of Esoteric Buddhism (from the 8th century onwards), Buddhism spread from India to Tibet and [[Mongolia]].

===Buddhism today===
{{Main|Timeline of Buddhism#Common Era|l1=Timeline of Buddhism:Common Era}}
[[File:Bon shim.jpg|thumb|upright|Polish Buddhists]]
By the late Middle Ages, Buddhism had become virtually extinct in India, and although it continued to exist in surrounding countries, its influence was no longer expanding. It is now again gaining strength in India and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Carol E. Henderson, ''Culture and Customs of India.'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph B. Tamney in William H. Swatos, editor, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society.'' Rowman Altamira, 1998, page 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the number of Buddhist followers by scholars range from 230 million to 1.691 billion. Most scholars classify similar numbers of people under a category they call &quot;Chinese folk&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; religion, an amalgam of various traditions that includes Buddhism.

Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The [[Three Jewels]]: the ''[[Buddha]]'', the ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]'' (the teachings of the Buddha), and the ''[[Sangha]]'' (the Buddhist community).

Estimates are uncertain for several reasons:
* difficulties in defining who counts as a Buddhist;

According to one analysis, Buddhism is the fourth-largest [[major world religions|religion in the world]] behind [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Garfinkel, Perry | title = Buddha Rising | journal = National Geographic | month= December | year= 2005 | pages = 88–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monks' order ([[Sangha]]), which began during the lifetime of the Buddha, is among the oldest organizations on earth.

The [[Dalit Buddhist movement]] in India (inspired by [[B. R. Ambedkar]]) also practices Theravada. Approximately 124 million adherents.&lt;ref name=&quot;adherents.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Buddhism Major Branches of Buddhism], Adherents.com, retrieved on 2008-01-15&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is found in [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[Mongolia]], areas of [[Buddhism in India|India]] (it's the majority religion in [[Ladakh]]; significant population in [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Sikkim]]), [[China]] (particularly in [[Tibet]] and [[Inner Mongolia]]), and [[Russia]] (Kalmyk Autonomous Republic). Approximately 20 million adherents.&lt;ref name=&quot;adherents.com&quot;/&gt;

Most Buddhist groups in the West are at least nominally affiliated with one of these three traditions.

At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the [[Buddhism in the West|West]] Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In a number of countries, it is recognized as an official religion and receives state support. Modern influences increasingly lead to [[Buddhist modernism|new forms of Buddhism]] that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.

Overall there is an overwhelming diversity of recent forms of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy East and West'', volume 54, page 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and traditions==
{{Main|Schools of Buddhism|Buddhahood}}
Two of his disciples became the inspiration for two main [[schools of Buddhism]] that were developed at least 200 years after Gautama died. Gautama praised both of them and to this day both schools are &quot;authentic&quot;. [[Sariputta]] inspired the [[Theravada]] school, generally known to be analytical and monastic. [[Maudgalyayana]] inspired the [[Mahayana]] school, which emphasizes compassion and tends to be democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong,  pp. 130—131.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Dubious|date=October 2012}} 
[[File:Young Mo nk s.jpg|thumb|A young monk]]

Buddhists generally classify themselves as either [[Theravada]] or [[Mahayana]].&lt;ref&gt;Keown, ''Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 1996, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is also used by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Buddhism''; Juergensmeyer, ''Oxford Handbook''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and is the one ordinarily used in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Tibetan Buddhism |encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language | publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company | year=2004 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tibetan%20buddhism | accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative scheme used by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;(Harvey, 1990); (Gombrich,1984); Gethin (1998), pp. 1–2, identifies &quot;three broad traditions&quot; as: (1) &quot;The Theravāda tradition of Sri Lanka and South-East Asia, also sometimes referred to as 'southern' Buddhism&quot;; (2) &quot;The East Asian tradition of China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, also sometimes referred to as 'eastern' Buddhism&quot;; and, (3) &quot;The Tibetan tradition, also sometimes referred to as 'northern' Buddhism.&quot;; Robinson &amp; Johnson (1982) divide their book into two parts: Part One is entitled &quot;The Buddhism of South Asia&quot; (which pertains to Early Buddhism in India); and, Part Two is entitled &quot;The Development of Buddhism Outside of India&quot; with chapters on &quot;The Buddhism of Southeast Asia&quot;, &quot;Buddhism in the Tibetan Culture Area&quot;, &quot;East Asian Buddhism&quot; and &quot;Buddhism Comes West; Penguin ''handbook of Living Religions'', 1984, page 279; Prebish &amp; Keown, ''Introducing Buddhism'', ebook, Journal of Buddhist Ethics, 2005, printed ed, Harper, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; divides Buddhism into the following three traditions or geographical or cultural areas: [[Theravada]], [[East Asian Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the multi-dimensional classification in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', Macmillan, New York, 1987, volume 2, pages 440ff&lt;/ref&gt; use other schemes. Buddhists themselves have a variety of other schemes. [[Hinayana]] (literally &quot;lesser vehicle&quot;) is used by Mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Theravada emerged, but as this term is rooted in the Mahayana viewpoint and can be considered derogatory, a variety of other terms are increasingly used instead, including [[Shravakayana|Śrāvakayāna]], Nikaya Buddhism, early Buddhist schools, sectarian Buddhism, conservative Buddhism, mainstream Buddhism and non-Mahayana Buddhism.

&lt;!-- comparison and contrast--&gt;
Not all traditions of Buddhism share the same philosophical outlook, or treat the same concepts as central. Each tradition, however, does have its own core concepts, and some comparisons can be drawn between them. For example, according to one Buddhist ecumenical organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/comparative.htm A Comparative Study of the Schools], Tan Swee Eng&lt;/ref&gt; several [[Basic Points Unifying the Theravada and the Mahayana|concepts common to both major Buddhist branches]]:
* Both accept [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] as their teacher.
* Both accept the [[Middle way]], [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent origination]], the [[Four Noble Truths]], the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Three marks of existence]].
* Both accept that members of the laity and of the [[sangha]] can pursue the path toward enlightenment ([[bodhi]]).
* Both consider buddhahood the highest attainment.

===Timeline===
This is a rough timeline of the development of the different schools/traditions:
{{Buddhist traditions timeline|notes=1}}

===Theravada school===
{{Main|Theravada}}
Theravada (&quot;Doctrine of the Elders&quot;, or &quot;Ancient Doctrine&quot;) is the oldest surviving Buddhist school. It is relatively conservative, and ''generally'' closest to early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin, ''Foundations'', page 1&lt;/ref&gt; This school is derived from the [[Vibhajjavada|Vibhajjavāda]] grouping that emerged amongst the older [[Sthavira]] group at the time of the Third Buddhist Council (c. 250 BCE). This school gradually declined on the Indian subcontinent, but its branch in Sri Lanka and South East Asia continues to survive.

The Theravada school bases its practice and doctrine exclusively on the [[Pali Canon|Pāli Canon]] and its commentaries. After being orally transmitted for a few centuries, its scriptures, the Pali Canon, were finally committed to writing in the 1st century BCE, in Sri Lanka, at what the Theravada usually reckon as the fourth council. It is also one of the first Buddhist schools to commit the complete set of its canon into writing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The [[sutra|Sutta]] collections and [[Vinaya]] texts of the Pāli Canon (and the corresponding texts in other versions of the [[Tripitaka]]), are generally considered by modern scholars to be the earliest Buddhist literature, and they are accepted as authentic in every branch of Buddhism.

Theravāda is primarily practiced today in [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[Buddhism in Burma|Burma]], [[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]], [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]], [[Buddhism in Cambodia|Cambodia]] as well as small portions of China, [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Malaysia|Malaysia]] and [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]. It has a growing presence in Europe and America.

Theravadin Buddhists think that personal effort is required to realize rebirth. Meditation is done by forest monks for the most part, while village monks teach and serve their lay communities. Laypersons can perform good actions, producing merit that can be traded to the gods who may reward it with material benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Theravada doctrine, a person may awaken from the &quot;sleep of ignorance&quot; by directly realizing the true nature of [[Reality in Buddhism|reality]]; such people are called ''[[arahant]]s'' and occasionally ''buddhas.'' After numerous lifetimes of spiritual striving, they have reached the end of the cycle of rebirth, no longer reincarnating as human, animal, ghost, or other being. The commentaries to the Pali Canon classify these awakened beings into three types:
* ''[[Buddhahood|Sammasambuddha]]'', usually just called Buddha, who discovers the truth by himself and teaches the path to awakening to others
* ''[[Pratyekabuddha|Paccekabuddha]]'', who discovers the truth by himself but lacks the skill to teach others
* ''[[Savakabuddha]]'', who receive the truth directly or indirectly from a Sammasambuddha

''Bodhi'' and ''nirvana'' carry the same meaning, that of being freed from craving, hate, and delusion. In attaining ''bodhi'', the ''arahant'' has overcome these obstacles. As a further distinction, the extinction of only hatred and greed (in the sensory context) with some residue of delusion, is called ''[[anagami]].''

===Mahayana traditions===
{{Main|Mahayana}}
[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Chinese and [[Central Asia]]n monks. [[Bezeklik]], Eastern [[Tarim Basin]], China, 9th–10th century.]]

Mahayana Buddhism flourished in India from the 5th century CE onwards, during the dynasty of the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]]. Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the [[Nalanda University|Nālandā University]] in north-eastern India.

Mahayana schools recognize all or part of the [[Mahayana Sutras]]. Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself, and faith in and veneration of those texts are stated in some sutras (e.g. the [[Lotus Sutra]] and the [[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]) to lay the foundations for the later attainment of Buddhahood itself.

Native Mahayana Buddhism is practiced today in China, Japan, [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Singapore|Singapore]], parts of Russia and most of [[Vietnam]] (also commonly referred to as &quot;Eastern Buddhism&quot;). The Buddhism practiced in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahayana in origin, but is discussed below under the heading of Vajrayana (also commonly referred to as &quot;Northern Buddhism&quot;. There are a variety of strands in Eastern Buddhism, of which &quot;the Pure Land school of Mahayana is the most widely practised today.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Beyer, ''The World's Religions'', Routledge, 2009, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; In most of this area however, they are fused into a single unified form of Buddhism. [[Buddhism in Japan|In Japan in particular]], they form separate denominations with the five major ones being: [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]], peculiar to Japan; [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]]; [[Shingon]], a form of Vajrayana; [[Tendai]], and [[Zen]]. In Korea, nearly all Buddhists belong to the Chogye school, which is officially Son (Zen), but with substantial elements from other traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (Volume One), pages 430, 435&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Japanese buddhist monk by Arashiyama cut.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Japanese Mahayana Buddhist monk with alms bowl]]
In the [[Mahayana]], the Buddha tends not to be viewed as merely human, but as the earthly projection of a beginningless and endless, omnipresent being (see ''[[Dharmakaya]]'') beyond the range and reach of thought. Moreover, in certain Mahayana sutras, the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are viewed essentially as One: all three are seen as the [[eternal Buddha]] himself.

The Buddha's death is seen as an illusion, he is living on in other planes of existence, and monks are therefore permitted to offer &quot;new truths&quot; based on his input. Mahayana also differs from Theravada in its concept of [[śūnyatā]] (that ultimately nothing has existence), and in its belief in [[bodhisattva]]s (enlightened people who vow to continue being reborn until all beings can be enlightened).&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, pp. 40, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Celestial Buddhas are individuals who no longer exist on the material plane of existence, but who still aid in the enlightenment of all beings.

Nirvana came to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate,{{Dubious|date=November 2009}} implying that delusion was still present in one who attained Nirvana. Bodhi became a higher attainment that eradicates delusion entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gombrich&quot;&gt;Richard F. Gombrich, ''How Buddhism Began'', Munshiram Manoharlal, 1997, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the ''[[Arahant]]'' attains Nirvana but not Bodhi, thus still being subject to delusion, while the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] attains Bodhi.{{Dubious|date=November 2009}}
&lt;!-- I've hidden these passages temporarily while I consider them
Bodhi is attained when the [[Four Noble Truths]] are fully grasped, and all [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] has reached cessation. Although the earliest sources do not have any mention of ''Paramitas,''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It is evident that the Hinayanists, either to popularize their religion or to interest the laity more in it, incorporated in their doctrines the conception of Bodhisattva and the practice of ''paramitas.'' This was effected by the production of new literature: the ''Jatakas'' and ''Avadanas''.&quot; ''Buddhist Sects in India,'' Nalinaksha Dutt, Motilal Banararsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition, 1978, p. 251. The term 'Semi-Mahayana' occurs here as a subtitle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;the Theravadins' early literature did not refer to the ''paramitas''.&quot; ''Buddhist Sects in India,'' Nalinaksha Dutt, Motilal Banararsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition, 1978, Dutt, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; the later traditions of Theravada and Mahayana state that one also needs to fulfill the ''[[Paramita|pāramitās]].'' After attainment of Bodhi, it is believed one is freed from the compulsive cycle of [[saṃsāra|{{unicode|saṃsāra}}]]: birth, suffering, death and rebirth, and attains the &quot;highest happiness&quot; (Nirvana, as described in the ''[[Dhammapada]]''). Belief in self (''[[Atman (Buddhism)|ātmān]],'' Pāli ''attā'') has also been extinguished as part of the eradication of delusion, and Bodhi thus implies understanding of ''[[anatta|anattā]]'' (Sanskrit: ''Anatman'').

Some Mahayana sources contain the idea that a ''bodhisattva,'' which in other Mahayana sources is someone on the path to Buddhahood, deliberately refrains from becoming a Buddha in order to help others.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism''. Vol. 1, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cook. ''Hua-yen Buddhism''. pp. 110f&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mahayana]]''' (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) is an inclusive, cosmically-dimensioned faith characterized by the adoption of additional texts. Mahayana Buddhists place emphasis on the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal. Mahayana practitioners are less concerned with the traditional early Buddhist emphasis on release from suffering (''[[dukkha]]'') characteristic of the Arahant, and instead vow to remain in the world to liberate all beings, without exception, from suffering. Mahayana is further typified by a pantheon of quasi-divine Bodhisattvas devoting themselves to personal excellence for the sake of rescuing others from suffering and delivering them into the bliss of Nirvana. The quest of the Bodhisattvas is for ultimate Buddhic knowledge, so as to effect the salvation of all humanity (and indeed all living beings, including animals, ghosts and gods).

The Mahayana branch emphasizes infinite, universal compassion (''maha-karuna'') or the selfless, ultra-altruistic quest of the Bodhisattva to attain the &quot;Awakened Mind&quot; (''[[bodhicitta]]'') of Buddhahood so as to have the fullest possible knowledge of how most effectively to lead all sentient beings into [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]].

&lt;!--According to a saying in one of the [[Mahayana sutras]], if a person does not aim for Bodhi, one lives one's life like a preoccupied child playing with toys in a house that is burning to the ground.&lt;ref name=norbu&gt;{{cite book| title = The Crystal and the Way of Light: Sutra, Tantra and Dzogchen| author = Norbu, Chogyal Namkhai| editors = Shane, John | year= 2000 |publisher = Snow Lion Publications | isbn = 1-55939-135-9|page= 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

The method of self-exertion or &quot;self-power&quot;—without reliance on an external force or being—stands in contrast to another major form of Buddhism, [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], which is characterised by utmost trust in the salvific &quot;other-power&quot; of [[Amitabha]] Buddha. Pure Land Buddhism is a very widespread and perhaps the most faith-orientated manifestation of Buddhism and centres upon the conviction that faith in Amitabha Buddha and the chanting of homage to his name liberates one at death into the Blissful (安樂), Pure Land (淨土) of Amitabha Buddha. This Buddhic realm is variously construed as a foretaste of Nirvana, or as essentially Nirvana itself. The great vow of Amitabha Buddha to rescue all beings from [[saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsaric]] suffering is viewed within Pure Land Buddhism as universally efficacious, if only one has faith in the power of that vow or chants his name.

====Bodhisattvas====

{{Main|Bodhisattva}}

''Bodhisattva'' means &quot;enlightenment being&quot;, and generally refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood, typically as a fully enlightened buddha (Skt. ''{{IAST|samyaksaṃbuddha}}''). Theravada Buddhism primarily uses the term in relation to Gautama Buddha's previous existences, but has traditionally acknowledged and respected the bodhisattva path as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha126.htm|title=Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism|accessdate=2010-10-18|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahāyāna Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva.
According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) was originally even an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', or the &quot;Bodhisattva Vehicle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174&quot;&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'', an early and important Mahāyāna text, contains a simple and brief definition for the term ''bodhisattva'', and this definition is the following:&lt;ref&gt;Mall, Linnart. ''Studies in the Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita and Other Essays.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2005. pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: from Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2007. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. ''The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines and its Verse Summary.'' Grey Fox Press. 2001. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Because he has enlightenment as his aim, a bodhisattva-mahāsattva is so called.}}

Mahāyāna Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas and to take the [[bodhisattva vows]]. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all beings by practicing six perfections (Skt. ''[[paramita|pāramitā]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others'', pages 4-12, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) ISBN 978-0-948006-50-0&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Mahāyāna teachings, these perfections are: [[Dāna|giving]], [[Śīla|discipline]], [[kshanti|forbearance]], [[virya|effort]], [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|meditation]], and [[prajna|transcendent wisdom]].

===Vajrayana traditions===
{{Main|Vajrayana}}
[[File:IMG 0361 Kathmandu Bodnath.jpg|thumb|[[Bodhnath]] [[Stupa]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]]]

The Vajrayana tradition of Buddhism spread to China, Mongolia, and Tibet. In Tibet, Vajrayana has always been a main component of Tibetan Buddhism, while in China it formed a separate sect. However, Vajrayana Buddhism became extinct in China but survived in elements of Japan's Shingon and Tendai sects.

There are differing views as to just when Vajrayāna and its [[Tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantric practice]] started. In the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan tradition]], it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were passed on orally first and only written down long after the Buddha's other teachings. [[Nalanda|Nālandā University]] became a center for the development of Vajrayāna theory and continued as the source of leading-edge Vajrayāna practices up through the 11th century. These practices, scriptures and theories were transmitted to China, [[Tibet]], Indochina and Southeast Asia. China generally received Indian transmission up to the 11th century including tantric practice, while a vast amount of what is considered [[Tibetan Buddhism]] (Vajrayāna) stems from the late (9th–12th century) Nālandā tradition.

In one of the first major contemporary academic treatises on the subject, [[Fairfield University]] professor Ronald M. Davidson argues that the rise of Vajrayana was in part a reaction to the changing political climate in India at the time. With the fall of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta dynasty]], in an increasingly fractious political environment, institutional Buddhism had difficulty attracting patronage, and the folk movement led by [[siddhas]] became more prominent. After perhaps two hundred years, it had begun to get integrated into the monastic establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Davidson, Ronald M. | title = Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement | publisher = Columbia University Press |location =New York| year= 2003 |isbn= 0-231-12619-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Vajrayana combined and developed a variety of elements, a number of which had already existed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Prebish &amp;amp; Keown, ''Introducing Buddhism'', page 89&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Mahāyāna scriptures, Vajrayāna Buddhists recognise a large body of [[Buddhist texts#Vajrayana texts|Buddhist Tantras]], some of which are also included in Chinese and Japanese collections of Buddhist literature, and versions of a few even in the [[Pali Canon]].

==Buddhist texts==
{{Main|Buddhist texts}}

Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety. Different schools of Buddhism place varying levels of value on learning the various texts. Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves, while others take a more scholastic approach. Buddhist scriptures are mainly written in [[Pāli]], [[Tibetan (language)|Tibetan]], [[Mongolian (language)|Mongolian]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Some texts still exist in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]].

Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions. However, some scholars have referred to the [[Vinaya Pitaka]] and the first four Nikayas of the [[Sutta Pitaka]] as the common core of all Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Warder, Indian Buddhism, 3rd edition (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This could be considered misleading, as Mahāyāna considers these merely a preliminary, and not a core, teaching. The Tibetan Buddhists have not even translated most of the āgamas (though theoretically they recognize them) and they play no part in the religious life of either clergy or laity in China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, ''Japanese Buddhism'', Edward Arnold, London, 1935, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars say there is no universally accepted common core.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin, ''Sayings of the Buddha'', Oxford University Press, 2008, page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some (including Buddhist social reformer [[Babasaheb Ambedkar]]) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy.

The followers of Theravāda Buddhism take the scriptures known as the Pāli Canon as definitive and authoritative, while the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism base their faith and philosophy primarily on the Mahāyāna sūtras and their own ''vinaya''. The Pāli sutras, along with other, closely related scriptures, are known to the other schools as the ''[[Agama (Buddhism)|āgamas]]''.

Over the years, various attempts have been made to synthesize a single Buddhist text that can encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism. In the Theravada tradition, condensed 'study texts' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks. Later in [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Dhammapada]] was championed as a unifying scripture.

Dwight Goddard collected a sample of Buddhist scriptures, with the emphasis on Zen, along with other classics of [[Eastern philosophy]], such as the [[Tao Te Ching]], into his 'Buddhist Bible' in the 1920s. More recently, Dr. [[Babasaheb Ambedkar]] attempted to create a single, combined document of Buddhist principles in [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/ &quot;The Buddha and His Dhamma&quot;]. Other such efforts have persisted to present day, but currently there is no single text that represents all Buddhist traditions.

===Pāli Tipitaka===
{{Main|Pāli Canon}}
{{PaliCanon|abbrev=1}}

The Pāli Tipitaka, which means &quot;three baskets&quot;, refers to the ''Vinaya Pitaka'', the ''Sutta Pitaka'', and the ''Abhidhamma Pitaka''. The ''[[Vinaya|Vinaya Pitaka]]'' contains disciplinary rules for the Buddhist [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s, as well as explanations of why and how these rules were instituted, supporting material, and doctrinal clarification. The ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]'' contains discourses ascribed to [[Gautama Buddha]]. The ''[[Abhidhamma|Abhidhamma Pitaka]]'' contains material often described as systematic expositions of the Gautama Buddha's teachings.

The Pāli Tipitaka is the only early Tipitaka (Sanskrit: ''Tripiṭaka'') to survive intact in its original language, but a number of early schools had their own recensions of the Tipitaka featuring much of the same material. We have portions of the Tipitakas of the Sārvāstivāda, Dharmaguptaka, Sammitya, Mahāsaṅghika, Kāśyapīya, and Mahīśāsaka schools, most of which survive in Chinese translation only. According to some sources, some early schools of Buddhism had five or seven pitakas.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Pali Text Society'', volume XVI, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the scriptures, soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named [[Mahakasyapa|Mahākāśyapa]] (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's teachings. [[Upali|Upāli]] recited the ''vinaya''. [[Ananda|Ānanda]], the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the dhamma. These became the basis of the Tripitaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in the last century BCE. Both the sūtras and the ''vinaya'' of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Gautama Buddha's previous lives, and various other subjects.

Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically &quot;Theravadin&quot;, but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey, it contains material at odds with later Theravadin orthodoxy. He states: &quot;The Theravadins, then, may have ''added'' texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.'' Curzon Press, 1995, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana sutras===
{{Main|Mahayana sutras}}
[[File:Korea-Haeinsa-Tripitaka Koreana-01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tripitaka Koreana|Tripiṭaka Koreana]] in South Korea, an edition of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] carved and preserved in over 81,000 wood printing blocks.]]

The [[Mahayana sutras]] are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the [[Mahayana]] Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings (including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma, which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, &quot;Sarvastivada and its theory of sarvam asti.&quot; ''University of Ceylon Review'' 24 1966, 94-105.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha, and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding.

The Mahayana sutras often claim to articulate the Buddha's deeper, more advanced doctrines, reserved for those who follow the [[bodhisattva]] path. That path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name ''Mahāyāna'' (lit., ''the Great Vehicle'').

According to Mahayana tradition, the Mahayana sutras were transmitted in secret, came from other Buddhas or [[Bodhisattva]]s, or were preserved in non-human worlds because human beings at the time could not understand them:&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Buddhism'', 3rd edition, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Some of our sources maintain the authenticity of certain other texts not found in the canons of these schools (the early schools). These texts are those held genuine by the later school, not one of the eighteen, which arrogated to itself the title of Mahayana, 'Great Vehicle'. According to the Mahayana historians these texts were admittedly unknown to the early schools of Buddhists. However, they had all been promulgated by the Buddha. [The Buddha's] followers on earth, the sravakas ('pupils'), had not been sufficiently advanced to understand them, and hence were not given them to remember, but they were taught to various supernatural beings and then preserved in such places as the Dragon World.}}

Approximately six hundred Mahayana sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] translations. In addition, East Asian Buddhism recognizes some sutras regarded by scholars as of Chinese rather than Indian origin.

Generally, scholars conclude that the Mahayana scriptures were composed from the 1st century CE onwards: &quot;Large numbers of Mahayana sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMillan&quot;&gt;''MacMillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', 2004, page 494&lt;/ref&gt; five centuries after the historical [[Gautama Buddha]]. Some of these had their roots in other scriptures composed in the 1st century BCE. It was not until after the 5th century CE that the Mahayana sutras started to influence the behavior of mainstream Buddhists in India: &quot;But outside of texts, at least in India, at exactly the same period, very different—in fact seemingly older—ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behavior, and old and established Hinnayana groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacMillan&quot; /&gt; These texts were apparently not universally accepted among Indian Buddhists when they appeared; the pejorative label ''[[hinayana]]'' was applied by Mahayana supporters to those who rejected the Mahayana sutras.

Only the Theravada school does not include the Mahayana scriptures in its canon. As the modern Theravada school is descended from a branch of Buddhism that diverged and established itself in Sri Lanka prior to the emergence of the Mahayana texts, debate exists as to whether the Theravada were historically included in the ''hinayana'' designation; in the modern era, this label is seen as derogatory, and is generally avoided. 

Scholar Isabelle Onians asserts that although &quot;the Mahāyāna ... very occasionally referred contemptuously to earlier Buddhism as the Hinayāna, the Inferior Way,&quot; &quot;the preponderance of this name in the secondary literature is far out of proportion to occurrences in the Indian texts.&quot; She notes that the term [[Śrāvakayāna]] was &quot;the more politically correct and much more usual&quot; term used by Mahāyānists.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Onians, &quot;Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm,&quot; D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001 pg 72&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Silk has argued that the term &quot;Hinayana&quot; was used to refer to whomever one wanted to criticize on any given occasion, and did not refer to any definite grouping of Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A Silk. What, if anything, is Mahayana Buddhism?  Numen 49:4 (2002):335-405. Article reprinted in Williams, ''Buddhism, Vol III'', Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative studies==
Buddhism provides many opportunities for comparative study with a diverse range of subjects. For example, Buddhism's emphasis on the [[Middle way]] not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various differing beliefs, customs and institutions in countries where it has resided throughout its history. Also, its moral and spiritual parallels with other systems of thought—for example, with various tenets of Christianity—have been subjects of close study. In addition, the Buddhist concept of [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent origination]] has been compared to modern scientific thought, as well as Western metaphysics.

===Is Buddhism a religion?===
There are differences of opinion on the question of whether or not Buddhism should be considered a religion. While many sources commonly refer to Buddhism as a religion,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Many sources commonly refer to Buddhism as a religion. For example:
* Donal Lopez states: &quot;Rather than portray Buddhism as a philosophy or a way of life, as it is so often characterized in the West, I prefer to view Buddhism as a religion to which ordinary people have turned over the centuries for the means to confront, control, or even escape the exigencies of life.&quot;{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=14}}
* Peter Harvey states: &quot;The English term 'Buddhism' correctly indicates that the religion is characterized by devotion to 'the Buddha', 'Buddhas', or 'buddhahood'.&quot;{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=1}}
* Joseph Goldstein states: &quot;Although there are many difference among the various religions of the world, and among the various schools of Buddhism itself, there is also a great deal in common...&quot;{{sfn|Goldstein|2011|p=27}} }} other sources note that the answer to this question depends upon how religion is defined.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Many sources note that Buddhism does not conform to the traditional Western concept of a religion. For example:
* Surya Das states: &quot;For Buddhism is less a theology or religion than a promise that certain meditative practices and mind trainings can effectively show us how to awaken our Buddha-nature and liberate us from suffering and confusion.&quot;{{sfn|Lama Surya Das|1997|p=16}}
* Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse states: &quot;Although essentially very simple, Buddhism cannot be easily explained. It is almost inconceivably complex, vast, and deep. Although it is nonreligious and nontheistic, it’s difficult to present Buddhism without sounding theoretical and religious.&quot;{{sfn|Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse|2011|p=2}}
* B. Alan Wallace states: &quot;When we in the West first engage with Buddhism, it is almost inevitable that we bring out one of our familiar stereotypes and apply it to Buddhism, calling it simply a 'religion.'... But Buddhism has never been simply a religion as we define it in the West. From the very beginning it has also had philosophical elements, as well as empirical and rational elements that may invite the term 'science.'&quot;{{sfn|Goleman|2008|loc=Kindle Locations 1301-1305}}
* Rupert Gethin states: &quot;I am not concerned here to pronounce on a question that is sometimes asked of Buddhism: is it a religion? Obviously it depends on how one defines ‘a religion’. What is certain, however, is that Buddhism does not involve belief in a creator God who has control over human destiny, nor does it seek to define itself by reference to a creed; as Edward Conze has pointed out, it took over 2,000 years and a couple of Western converts to Buddhism to provide it with a creed.12 On the other hand, Buddhism views activities that would be generally understood as religious—such as devotional practices and rituals—as a legitimate, useful, and even essential part of the practice and training that leads to the cessation of suffering.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=65-66}}
* Damien Keown states: &quot;Problems [...] confront us as soon as we try to define what Buddhism is. Is it a religion? A philosophy? A way of life? A code of ethics? It is not easy to classify Buddhism as any of these things, and it challenges us to rethink some of these categories. What, for example, do we mean by ‘religion’? Most people would say that religion has something to do with belief in God. [...] If belief in God in this sense is the essence of religion, then Buddhism cannot be a religion. [...] Some have suggested that a new category – that of the ‘non-theistic’ religion – is needed to encompass Buddhism. Another possibility is that our original definition is simply too narrow.{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 361-372}}
* The Dalai Lama states: &quot;From one viewpoint, Buddhism is a religion, from another viewpoint Buddhism is a science of mind and not a religion. Buddhism can be a bridge between these two sides. Therefore, with this conviction I try to have closer ties with scientists, mainly in the fields of cosmology, psychology, neurobiology and physics. In these fields there are insights to share, and to a certain extent we can work together.&quot;{{sfn|Pinburn|1990|p=101}}
* Walpola Rahula states: &quot;The question has often been asked: Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy? It does not matter what you call it. Buddhism remains what it is whatever label you may put on it. The label is immaterial. Even the label 'Buddhism' which we give to the teaching of the Buddha is of little importance. The name one gives it is inessential.
*:What's in a name? That which we call a rose,
*:By any other name would smell as sweet.
:In the same way Truth needs no label: it is neither Buddhist, Christian, Hindu nor Moslem. It is not the monopoly of anybody. Sectarian labels are a hindrance to the independent understanding of Truth, and they produce harmful prejudices in men's minds.&quot;{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 316-323}}
 }} For example, Lama Surya Das states:{{sfn|Lama Surya Das|1997|p=16}}
{{quote|...Buddhism is less a theology or religion than a promise that certain meditative practices and mind trainings can effectively show us how to awaken our Buddha-nature and liberate us from suffering and confusion.}}

[[B. Alan Wallace]] notes that Buddhism does not fit the definition of religion as it is typically used in the West. Wallace states:
{{quote| ...Buddhism has never been simply a religion as we define it in the West. From the very beginning it has also had philosophical elements, as well as empirical and rational elements that may invite the term &quot;science.&quot;}}

Rupert Gethin points out that some key differences between Buddhism and conventionally considered Western religions are that Buddhism does not assert a belief in a creator god, nor does it define itself by a particular creed. On the other hand, Gethin notes, Buddhist practice often includes devotional practices and ritual, which are typically associated with religious belief.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=65-66}}

Walpola Rahula emphasizes that the label is unimportant from the Buddhist point of view:{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 316-323}}

{{quote|The question has often been asked: Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy? It does not matter what you call it. Buddhism remains what it is whatever label you may put on it.
