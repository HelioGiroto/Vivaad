==DOB==
Date of birth immediately after his name was listed as 1613, yet the referenced dates immediately below were all between 1599 and 1607. I've changed it to c. 1600. 1613 can't be correct - few people gain B.A.s from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] at the age of fourteen, even in the 17th century.

== Two Articles on the Same Person ==

[[Roger Williams (puritan)]] is the same person as [[Roger Williams (theologian)]].  [[User:Logophile|Logophile]] 16:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::So lets dump the theologian one. [[User:207.214.244.173|207.214.244.173]] 30 June 2005 04:32 (UTC) [[User:WB2|WB2]] 30 June 2005 04:33 (UTC) [proper credit]

:::Please note that [[Roger Williams (puritan)]] was merged into [[Roger Williams (theologian)]].

::::Thank you. [[User:WB2|WB2]] 1 July 2005 05:35 (UTC)

== Descendants ==

Generally, the ancestor ought to be noted in the article about the descendant, and not descendants in the article about the ancestor.  The information about [[Jeffrey R. Holland]] ought to be moved, as information about Williams, to Holland's article. --[[User:Eric Forste|Eric Forste]] [[User_talk:Eric Forste|(Talk)]] 02:35, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

== Roger Williams birthplace and parents ==

I found a reference that there were 2 Roger Williams at [[Pembroke College]] at around the same time. One was a Roger Williams son of Lewis Williams of [[St Albans]] and the other was Roger Williams son of William Williams of Cornwall. 

The originator of the source is Dr. [[Rueben Guild]] the learned Librarian of [[Brown University]], [[New England]] (dated 1880).

Dr Guild claims that Roger The Theologian was the son of William Williams of [[Cornwall]], UK. (You spelled Theologian wrong. --[[User:LOOKIE MILK!|LOOKIE MILK!]] ([[User talk:LOOKIE MILK!|talk]]) 01:35, 6 December 2007 (UTC))

The date of the baptism is 21st of December [[1602]] at [[Gwinear]], Cornwall.

:Not according to the Roger Williams Family Association [http://www.rogerwilliams.org/biography.htm].  [[User:Logophile|Logophile]] 03:44, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

::Interesting, but I notice the earliest source given on this webpage is [[1909]]. The Dr Rubin source dates from circa 1880. I'm not saying he was right and someone else is wrong I just think that it could be a possibility. [[User:Talskiddy|Talskiddy]] 10:45, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

Williams geneology shows he is the son of James and Alice (Pemberton) Williams of London. [[User:WLRoss|Wayne]] 15:27, 11 May 2007 (UTC)

==Dates==
The [[Dictionary of National Biography]] states that Williams is thought to have been born in 1606, &quot;but no record of the exact date survives&quot;. It also states &quot;The exact date of his death was not recorded, though it was between 27 January and 15 March 1683&quot;. I am interested, therefore, in what basis there is for exact birth and death dates to be listed here in 1603 and 1684 respectively. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] 16:16, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
:Good question.  The dates were already in the article when I first encountered it, and so I assumed that the original editor had a source for them.  No source that I have access to myself has any exact dates for either his birth or death.  [[User:Logophile|Logophile]] 23:29, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

==No Stub==
I removed this article from the category &quot;Christian clergy stubs&quot; as the article is way too long to be considered such now. [[User:Whyaduck|Whyaduck]] 01:05, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
== WikiProject class rating==
This article was automatically assessed because at least one WikiProject had rated the article as start, and the rating on other projects was brought up to start class. [[User:BetacommandBot|BetacommandBot]] 14:04, 10 November 2007 (UTC)

==Article contradicts the summary==
The summary states &quot;Williams started the First Baptist Church in America Providence before leaving to become a Seeker.&quot;, but the section &quot;Relations with the Baptists&quot; states &quot;He has been mistakenly called a &quot;Seeker&quot;, both in his own time by his enemies and by his admirers in the last century.&quot; and goes on to explain that he has been mistakenly called a Seeker, because it was used as a smear against him by his opponents. This contradicts the statement in the introduction section.

== Welsh? ==
Wasn't Williams a Welsh man educated in England? --[[User:LOOKIE MILK!|LOOKIE MILK!]] ([[User talk:LOOKIE MILK!|talk]]) 01:35, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

==Objectivity?==
Does this article seem to be written in an objective manner? The general tone and language used through much of the description of his works seems highly positively balanced. [[User:Monkthatgotfunk|Monkthatgotfunk]] ([[User talk:Monkthatgotfunk|talk]]) 15:07, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

== Date of death ==

The date in the info box - and later on in the article - is given as 1 April, but in the opening para it's said to be between January and February. We should be consistent. [[User:Headhitter|Headhitter]] ([[User talk:Headhitter|talk]]) 10:20, 7 June 2011 (UTC)
:I agree. It needs to be consistent. What ''is'' the date or range? I'll try to look up, but don't have access to a lot of the resources listed on the page. Neither date given is cited. Please, someone, put it in correctly and cite. Thank you. -- [[User:JoannaSerah|JoannaSerah]] ([[User talk:JoannaSerah|talk]]) 18:07, 27 January 2012 (UTC)
::FWIW, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/644376/Roger-Williams ''Britannica''] says, &quot;(born 1603?, London, Eng.—died Jan. 27/March 15, 1683, Providence, R.I. [U.S.])&quot;, seemingly indicating general uncertainty on the point. It may be worth a try, but it seems doubtful we'll come up with a definitive answer. [[User:Fat&amp;#38;Happy|Fat&amp;#38;Happy]] ([[User talk:Fat&amp;#38;Happy|talk]]) 20:57, 27 January 2012 (UTC)
:::As we don't have a citation for his death being on 1 April, I've changed the dates in the info box to January-March, consistent with the main text. [[User:Headhitter|Headhitter]] ([[User talk:Headhitter|talk]]) 09:05, 14 August 2012 (UTC)</text>
