==Meaning of Sodom and Gomorah==
I am fluent in both modern and biblical Hebrew, and the idea that &quot;Sodom&quot; is based on the Hebrew root for 'scorched' was news to me.  The only source cited for this is a website by Jim Cornwell (who is he?), wherein he indeed makes this claim;  however, he not only adduces no evidence of any kind whatsoever, he even states that this is &quot;an unused root&quot;.  Even if we accept the dubious premise that the name of the city must be based on a Hebrew root, how do we know that that root does not mean &quot;frozen&quot;, &quot;windy&quot; or &quot;unclean&quot;.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:BenDen2|BenDen2]] ([[User talk:BenDen2|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/BenDen2|contribs]]) 01:35, 24 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Christian Views==
This section is highly POV from the conservative Evangelical / Traditionalist Catholic side and is not reflective of the diversity of Christian thought. It suggests that the main division in interpretation is whether &quot;know&quot; should be interpreted as sexual or non-sexual. This is actually a very minor critical issue. Most fo the discussion I have seen hinges on whether the understanding of attempted gang rape succests that the men of the city were homosexual. It looks to studies on gang rape as a crime of dominance in which the gender of the victim is unimpportant to the aggressors. It also looks to ancient Near Eastern traditions of honor and shame in which the rape of one man by another was a way of symbolicaly emasculating him. The Christian discussion also draws heavily the idea of hospitality and inhospitality as discussed in the section on Jewish views.

I think this section is in need of revision by an impratial expert.   &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.216.112.117|108.216.112.117]] ([[User talk:108.216.112.117|talk]]) 17:14, 16 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


The comment about Greek and Roman societies as an explanation of a story that was much older seems sort of irrelevant and it isn't well sourced.

Also this section claims to represent two different opinions, but really gives very little attention to the second.  It really appears that the author of this section wants to stress the inhospitality part without giving any reference to equally held views that might be seen as a condemnation of homosexuality.  I think both sides should be considered fully, I would like to offer a third view that the city was not destroyed for an particular sin but as it says in the text: &quot;Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave&quot;  --[[User:Kraftlos|Kraftlos]] ([[User talk:Kraftlos|talk]]) 11:43, 11 February 2008 (UTC)

The source for views about inhospitality are from the prophet Ezekiel chapter 16:48-50.  The words are quite explicit in verse 48 citing arrogance, abundance of food, inhospitality of strangers and ignoring the needs of the poor and needy.  Whether or not archaelogical findings ever validate the actual cities, the parable/meaning of the story is quite profound and in line with the salvation/liberation strand of the Biblical texts.  The sin here is a breach of justice.  God sees the suffering and oppression.  God calls for hospitality and awarness of those who are &quot;less than&quot; in society.  Given most of our problems today, this story points to the Levitical Code to &quot;love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord&quot;.  Further, as many have pointed out, Lot's response to the men at his door by offering his two daughters is equally in my mind a statement of the abuse of power of men over women, a failure of justice and a failure of hospitality.  This is a story about our failure to be fully human.  The longing here points to being fully humane to our brothers and sisters.  It stands in a long line of examples of humanity's failure to humanity.  Sin here is an action of failing to empathize.  So, the questions of homosexuality as the import of the story are far too minimal to be the reason for the story.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Badvali|Badvali]] ([[User talk:Badvali|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Badvali|contribs]]) 19:54, 7 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:I'm more convinced now that a critical mass of sin was the reason, not for any particular sin.  The sodomy/gangrape inccident would just have been a microcausim of the general sinful condition of the city as there were not authorities present to stop the inccident or the authorities were complicant in the activity (it is also evidenced by the fact that Lot offered his daughters to the mob).  

::&quot;That they were all wicked, v. 4. Wickedness had become universal, and they were unanimous in any vile design. Here were old and young, and all from every quarter, engaged in this riot; the old were not past it, and the young had soon come up to it. Either they had no magistrates to keep the peace, and protect the peaceable, or their magistrates were themselves aiding and abetting.

::That they had arrived at the highest pitch of wickedness; they were sinners before the Lord exceedingly (ch. 13:13); for, 1. It was the most unnatural and abominable wickedness that they were now set upon, a sin that still bears their name, and is called Sodomy. They were carried headlong by those vile affections (Rom. 1:26, 27), which are worse than brutish, and the eternal reproach of the human nature, and which cannot be thought of without horror by those that have the least spark of virtue and any remains of natural light and conscience.&quot; (Ctrl-click)&quot;&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/comm_read.pl?book=Gen&amp;chapter=19&amp;verse=5&amp;Comm=Comm%2Fmhc%2FGen%2FGen019.html%233%26Matthew%26Henry&amp;Select.x=24&amp;Select.y=13 commentary] by [[Matthew_Henry|Matthew Henry]] (1706-1717)

:What I'm noticing in this Christian views section is that someone is trying to make a case that homosexuality is not a sin. Such a debate is not what is trying to be accomplished here, we just need to present views as they are.  The church has traditionally regarded homosexuality as one of many reasons that the city was destroyed and to diminish that would be to skew the article toward a more liberal position.  I realize though that this is a serious topic of debate right now, especially in the Anglican denomication.  Please try to keep [[WP:NPOV]] in mind and not try to impose one particular view over this section.

For the Christian view, 2 Peter 2:6-7 must also be included, and currently is not.
6if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; 7and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men
For the Greek see: http://www.studylight.org/isb/bible.cgi?query=2pe+2:7&amp;it=nas&amp;ot=bhs&amp;nt=na&amp;sr=1&amp;l=en
word here of importance is at: http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=766
defined as:  unbridled lust, excess, licentiousness, lasciviousness, wantonness, outrageousness, shamelessness, insolence

The concluding paragraph is particularly bad.  &quot;This view of the Biblical story reflects that of other ancient civilizations, such as Greece and Rome, where hospitality was of singular importance and strangers were under the protection of the gods.&quot;  This is just plain messy - generalizing all ancient civilizations with an article on Greek / Latin words hospitality which covers Greece and Rome, and only specifically says that in Greece travellers were, if not hostile, seen as protected by Zeus - and supposing that this applies here.  It only gets worse in making a statement about Greek culture regarding women, and supposing this is relevant for the cultures involved here.

&quot;Hospitality&quot; should not have the last word here.  The quote of Matthew seems to be referring more to judgement than it does specifically judgement tied to the particular sins in question; no one supposes the disciples were ever raped in the towns they visited or that this was even a remote possibility - and the judgement of Sodom and Gomorrah is clearly not for simply &quot;not welcoming someone,&quot; as the context in the book of Genesis makes clear.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/80.201.106.126|80.201.106.126]] ([[User talk:80.201.106.126|talk]]) 16:12, 31 August 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:I agree.  I've never heard any serious interpretation of this passage which suggests that they were destroyed for inhospitality.  I think its a bit extreme to say it was for sodomy and only that sin.  I don't think either of those views are particularly representative.

Is it possible to break this into two sections? I think the old story that the Sodomites were destroyed for being sodomites has its place as a historical interpretation--but it is not supported by the Biblical text. Perhaps we could call a section &quot;cultural interpretations&quot; rather than &quot;Christian Views.&quot; I would prefer to put the &quot;homosexuality&quot; theory under a section called &quot;relatively new views dreamed up as a way to justify prejudice&quot; but I don't think I can get a consensus on that one. On the other hand, the &quot;homosexuality&quot; theory is not supported by the Biblical text alone.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.79.91.80|68.79.91.80]] ([[User talk:68.79.91.80|talk]]) 18:42, 14 December 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Well, I'd like to change what I wrote here.... your edits were pretty good at restoring balance to the article.  What you are proposing though I think inserts a POV that this is a cultural interpretation that has come up recently.  While I think stressing that it was because of homosexuality inaccurately downplays that fact that city had other issues; you can't deny that this view has been held historically.

::I did some editing as much of this page read like a personal essay, and somewhat still does, and needed for references, esp. for the &quot;conservative&quot; position which was somewhat more minimized. As regards the debate btwn the two views, while inhospitality was a prime sin, it was the specific expression that is the issue. The parallel story of Judges 19 along with Jude 1:7, and other references linking Sodom to sex, does provide evidence that this was their most notable physical sin, although things like pride, idleness and full stomachs and lack of compassion were concomitant with it. http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Homosex_versus_the_Bible.html But as Jesus stated, even they would have repented had they been given the grace the cities He ministered in saw, and thus such proud impenitence in the light of such grace is revealed to be even more damnable.[[User:Daniel1212|Daniel1212]] ([[User talk:Daniel1212|talk]]) 22:43, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

Let me first say that my attempt to add a reference to the Levite concubine (Judges 19ff) may be clumsy, but it does figure among Christian interpretation of the story (including Phyllis Trible's Texts of Terror). The Judges story is roughly parallel, including a gang rape (intended for the Levite, but inflicted upon his concubine). I used this to illustrate that the &quot;sexual&quot; part of the sexual/non-sexual interpretation is not merely sexual = consensual homosexual sex, but is more likely to be rape with intention to kill. For some reason, this only got a passing, difficult-to-understand reference at the end of the &quot;Christian&quot; section.  While it is true that Christians who are completely ignorant of the Gibeah story (most are) may generally interpret the Sodom story as about consensual homosexual sex (and have had plenty of assistance in doing so), those who are familiar with the Judges story are more likely, in my opinion, to interpret the Sodom story as a rape story, with the same-sex aspect of the rape meant to show a heightened hatred, as anal rape may be more frightening, or considered more taboo (if possible) than vaginal rape.  I hope that rather than deleting my edits entirely, those who think they can be improved upon will do so without attempting to discount this position. (RobP)

:You will need to cite some secondary [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] for this view, a reference to a Bible passage is not enough as that is a primary source, and making conjectures by comparing primary sources constitutes [[WP:SYNTH|synthesis]].

==Too many quotes==

RK, while you added some interesting material, but there are way too many quotes for my taste. Also, one of the main problems with the article was that it began in the end. The story of Sodom appeared before Lot's daughters, which I started getting to. Abraham's bargain with God, the war of the five kings, etc. I also have a problem with the abundance of Jewish interpretations, which give an unstated sense of Judaism versus Christianity in interpretting the story of Sodom (even though you did not do so explicitly). I do not think that is the case. It is more a result of interpretations reflecting particular social conditions at the time of their composition, whether by Jews, Christians, or others. I will take a better look at it Sunday night, when I get back. [[User:Danny|Danny]]

- I don't know, but it was severely flawed; it was based on a complete textual misunderstanding (&quot;anashim&quot; is actually the plural of &quot;ish&quot; not a different word - it just has a somewhat irregular form.) I gave it an extensive edit to fix it up. I have no idea which denomination it is supposed to represent and I doubt that Reform Judaism has any single &quot;official&quot; textual interpretation. 

I think this section would best work as a nondenomination example of what you might notice if you examine the text from a non-&quot;traditional&quot; angle. Perhaps, in this light, it should be merged into one of the previous sections.

==Random musing...==
Why isn't Lot condemned for offering his own two virgin daughters to a mob for sex? Just wondering... - Cheryl
: It would be better to ask why he isn't condemned for having sex with them himself. [[User:Drostie|Drostie]] 06:12, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::He's not chastised for offering them to the mob because, as their father, it was in his authority to offer them in such a manner if he saw fit. The fact that he was ruining any marriage prospects for them was his responsibility, and his offering up their virtue for the greater good of the laws of hospitality provided fair justification. As for his committing incest, he was not guilty, since it was at the initiative of the daughters, and they had gotten him drunk so he did not know he was doing it, and could not be regarded as responsible. --[[User:Svartalf|Svartalf]] 10:10, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

As far as I know, he is very much condemned for both acts in the Jewish tradition. [[User:Frikle|Frikle]] 22:15, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

Really? Never saw any such thing, mind sourcing that comment? --[[User:Svartalf|Svartalf]] 22:35, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

Sorry I can't remember exactly where it was from. I'll try look for something in the next while. However as far as I see, many Jews would disagree with your above paragraph. Lot is NOT presented as a sympathetic figure in the Tanach. The fact that there is no specific condemnation does not mean anything, the passages around this incident follow the same pattern: no explicit condemnation. Also, where in halakha does a father have authority to give his daughter up for rape? Marriage maybe but not assault. As for the second incident, I'm pretty sure tradition gives this as an example of the horrors of alcoholism and condemns Lot for his negligence. Furthermore, by the second night I'm pretty sure he knew what was going on (according to commentaries).

Anyway the whole evaluation of the incident is not clearcut - and I've seen modern debates about these incidents.
[[User:Frikle|Frikle]] 03:44, 4 August 2006 (UTC)


:Honestly, your assertions surprise me. a) the Tanakh texts do specify he was loved of G*d, since he was saved from the destruction, even despite having offered his daughters to the mob in the presence of the angels; and nothing is said about his losing divine favor after his daughters begat children with him. Now, it's true, I have no access to talmudic sources, but I've never heard of Jewish doctrine being disapproving of Lot's action. --[[User:Svartalf|Svartalf]] 10:55, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

I once heard it suggested that Lot's comment was sarcastic. &quot;You want to abuse my guests? Huh?

== Textual references and translations. ==

===Presentation===
First off, I would like to suggest that the quote here come from the NRSV, not the KJV. The NRSV is the current scholarly translation, and Wikipedia is meant to be a scholarly resource. I'll be changing it myself if nobody's responded to this comment within a couple of days; tell me if you're extremely concerned about this.

Secondly, it's academically dishonest to say &quot;In this context, 'know' is a euphemism for sexual intercourse.&quot; The Hebrew word used for &quot;know&quot; is indeed used occasionally to refer to carnally knowing your wife. However, this is a broad usage of a primitive root; the exact same construction appears in the following:

:Psalm 39:4, &quot;that I may know &lt;03045&gt; (8799) how frail I am,&quot; 

:Psalm 101:4, &quot;A froward [sic] heart shall depart from me: I will not know &lt;03045&gt; (8799) a wicked person&quot; (which is explicitly '''not''' talking about sex), 

:Daniel 9:25, &quot;Know &lt;03045&gt; (8799) therefore and understand: from the time that the word went out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of an anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks; and for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with streets and moat, but in a troubled time.&quot; 

:Jer 31:34, &quot;And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know &lt;03045&gt; (8798) the LORD : for they shall all know &lt;03045&gt; (8799) me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.&quot;

(Many of these come from the KJV because I'm intellectually lazy at the moment.)

... the list can go on and on. See [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22%3C03045%3E%20(8799)%22 this Google search] for as many examples as you want.

Indeed, the specificness of the construction isn't particularly important (that is, you can ignore the (8799) part), because not all passages talking about sex use (8799)

: Gen 4:1, &quot;And Adam knew &lt;03045&gt; (8804) &lt;0853&gt; Eve.&quot;

So, I would challenge that statement as not being particularly NPOV given the textual data. Moreover, we have reason to think that this is not explicit, because the different Rabbis cited in the rest of the article never took it that way. These are people fluent in Hebrew who did not substantiate this interpretation.

I think we can delete that parenthetical comment safely, as it is neither factual nor NPOV.

I ask that replies to this Talk comment come in subsection form (see the first line of this section) so that it's clear to readers when someone else is speaking.

==Presense of Sulphur==

Can someone add some &quot;quick link&quot; (As in... a link to an accredited article from a reputable site) confirming the &quot;Sulphur from Earthquake&quot; theory?

I'd like to add that followed a link from Google searching for &quot;evidence of Soddom and Gomorrah&quot; (not that exact string, however) and came accross this site with photographs of the sulphur deposits that appear to be circular in shape, thus backing up the claims that God really did &quot;rain fire&quot; down on the cities. I'm presently unable to do this, so can someone find the site with this info on? I remember it having a pale-blue (but not cyan) background with a reference to a comic-book on it.

A quick search turns out two bible-archaeology pages with photographic and some scientific evidence.  [http://www.arkdiscovery.com/sodom_&amp;_gomorrah.htm] and [http://www.bibleplus.org/discoveries/sodomfound.htm]



I really wouldn't trust either of those pages.  Ron Wyatt is a known fraud, and the other site could have easily been faked as well, and clearly has a religious agenda.  I've done several google searches and all have failed to find any neutral sites that mention the sulfur.  Smells like like bullshit to me.

I don't get it.  That article seems to acknowledge that the earthquake theory is very plausible (and I would argue far more plausible than the fireballs from God theory), but still says it must have been fireballs from God.

== Lot and his daughters ==

The bible says that his daughters got him drunk to have intercourse, and he was unaware of what was happening so this statement: &quot;...the incident where Lot's daughters have sex with their father soon after they escape the city, means that this is not a tale of sexual morality, but a condemnation of rape...&quot; seems to overlook the context of the situation.

: Even so, how is rape not about sexual morality?  You seem to overlook the obvious.[[User:Boscobites|Boscobites]] ([[User talk:Boscobites|talk]]) 14:04, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

Jehovah condones neither incest nor drunkenness. (Leviticus 18:6, 7, 29; 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10) Lot actually deplored the “lawless deeds” of Sodom’s inhabitants. (2 Peter 2:6-8) The very fact that Lot’s daughters got him intoxicated suggests that they realized that he would not consent to having sexual relations with them while he was sober. But as aliens in the land, his daughters felt that this was the only way to prevent the extinction of Lot’s family. The account is in the Bible to reveal the relationship of the Moabites (through Moab) and the Ammonites (through Benammi) to Abraham’s descendants, the Israelites. Why, then, is Lot called a “righteous man,” at 2 Peter 2:8? Not because God approved of his getting drunk, nor because God approved of incest. God did not approve such conduct. But it should be noted that there is nothing in the record to indicate that Lot was a habitual drunkard, nor was he habitually involved in acts of incest. His reputation was that of a “righteous man,” and this reputation he had with God, who examines the heart. Lot deplored the “lawless deeds” of the people of Sodom. And, evidently, for the Examiner of hearts to view him as righteous, Lot must also have grieved over the wrong conduct in which he himself got involved.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.57.55.213|24.57.55.213]] ([[User talk:24.57.55.213|talk]]) 23:02, 16 June 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== The possibility that those cities don't exist ==

Why isn't the article entertaining the possibility that those cities don't exist, or are &quot;composite events&quot; based on the story destruction of many cities

The article gives this or that possible candidate but the Historicity section doesn't end with &quot;Those cities might not have even existed&quot;

This makes sense because it lets the story be a more effective narrative and helps better drive home the point that disobeying religious officials (even small commands like don't look back or you will turn into salt !) will get you some hardcore retribution

the exaggerated account of how complete the destruction of the cities lets you know that &quot;god&quot; doesn't fuck around (in other words religious authority giving you this story, you do what they say because decide &quot;what god says&quot;)

== Gomorrah ==

Seriously... there is a statement at the beginning of the article, explicitly stating that (in relation to the cities):

== Using the term Homosexual is an anachronism ==

I my opinion it is illogical to interpret any Biblical verse or commentary as directly related to homosexuality. The term itself was invented in the 19th century in Germany to tag a psychological behavior, regarded as a mental illness. The meaning of the term has shifted from a behavioral point of view to one of identity in the twentieth century (in western parts of the world).

: The term &quot;homosexual&quot; is an anachronism? LOL Just because they used different words in 2000 BC? It's certainly not an anachronism today, the word is in common usage.

[[User:Kirkesque|Kirkesque]] 04:16, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

From Rashi himself:

18.2 '''and behold, three men''' One to bring the news [of Isaac’s birth] to Sarah, and one to overturn Sodom, and one to heal Abraham, for one angel does not perform two errands (Gen. Rabbah 50:2). You should know that [this is true] because throughout the entire chapter, Scripture mentions them in the plural, e.g., (below verse 8): “and they ate” ; (ibid. verse 9): “and they said to him.” Concerning the announcement, however, it says (ibid. verse 10): “And he said: I will surely return to you.” And concerning the overturning of Sodom, it says (below 19:22): “For I will not be able to do anything” ; (ibid. verse 21): “I will not overturn” (Gen. Rabbah 50:11). And Raphael, who healed Abraham, went from there to save Lot. This is what is stated:“And it came to pass when they took them outside, that he [the angel] said, ‘Flee for your life.’” You learn that only one acted as a deliverer.

19.1 '''the…angels''' But elsewhere (18:2) Scripture calls them men! When the Shechinah was with them, it calls them men. Another explanation: In connection with Abraham, whose power was great, and the angels were as frequently with him as men, it calls them men, but in connection with Lot, it calls them angels. — [from Gen. Rabbah 52; Tan. Buber, Vayera 20]

You are correct: one of the 3 persons are YeVovaH God Himself in person. FYI: Hebrew does not have a “J” sound.
Use American Standard Version translation at Biblegateway.com to understand it clearly.

“And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre … And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah … And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.  And Jehovah went his way … And the two angels came to Sodom  … Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven” (Genesis 18:1, 22, 32-33; 19:1, 24, ASV translation). Thus not the 3 angels, but YeHoVaH in person destroyed Sodom &amp; Gomorrah from JeHoVaH out of heaven.

A far more plausible explaination would be a volcanic erupion of some sort. Brimstone is sulfer.--[[User:Phiddipus|Phiddipus]] 20:46, 2 November 2007 (UTC)

I would dispute the volcanic explanation: &quot;Considering its supernatural origin, one would expect to find unique characteristics in such sulfur, and this is indeed the case. Its composition reveals lengthy exposure to high temperatures. Sulfur found in geothermal regions is invariably the &quot;rhombic&quot; form, evident from it's familiar bright yellow colour.

By contrast, the brimstone from these Dead Sea sites is the pale white &quot;monoclinic&quot; form. Sulphur changes to this form when exposed to high temperatures for an extended period of time, as would have been the case.. X-ray Fluorescence Semiquant analysis and other tests reveal the sulfur balls to be up to 98.4% pure sulphur, significantly more pure than naturally occurring sulphur.

The sulfur balls have been found at all five destroyed cities, and although numerous geologists have been consulted, no other examples of naturally occurring sulfur is found anywhere on earth that remotely resembles the form found at these sites.&quot;

And elsewhere on the same site (http://users.netconnect.com.au/~leedas/sodomgom.html): &quot;Inside Pompeii, paintings in pristine condition can still be seen on the walls of the houses. People and animals buried during Pompeii's destruction have been unearthed as empty cavities. By contrast, everything at the Sodom &amp; Gomorrah sites have been turned totally to ash. A skeleton found by Ron Wyatt in one of the lost cities still had human form but was composed of ash. Even the marrow, visible in the bones, was totally turned to ash.

The cities were built largely of limestone, and when limestone is incinerated with sulphur, it produces calcium sulphate ash. Analysis of the remains at Sodom &amp; Gomorrah reveals it is very clean calcium sulphate, with virtually no trace elements. The fact that few trace elements remain is indicative of intense, fierce heat, enough to break down entire limestone buildings and vaporise all other minerals. Volcanism does not produce this kind of clean ash.&quot;

== Appropriate Statement:  ==

It was written in the article that &quot;''A similar event is recorded in the Judges 19:20-22, this time involving the town of Gibeah. This suggests that the occurrences in Sodom were not unique.&quot;''

The only problem I see with this statement is that most of the bible, especially the Old Testament, has a number of stories that are reiterated again and again in a slightly different (or sometimes) completely different light in an effort to prove a point.  Many of these stories have been accepted by biblical historians and archaeologists as being written backwards into the bible as a way of explaining why something happened in their contemporary day.

The intro to the section talks about film portrayals of the Biblical story. ''Sodom and Gomorrah: The Movie'' isn't one of those. It's a contemporary film about a Christian man struggling with homosexuality. Obviously the title was chosen for the association with the cities' putative sin, but that's a pretty tenuous connection.

I fail to see what a video game weapon that happened to borrow the names of the cities has to do with the article. If we were to drag in every pop-culture mention of Sodom and/or Gomorrah, it would comprise the bulk of the article. It's not a &quot;Film&quot; in any event.

Perhaps the bible's stories, fables, parables and conflicting interpretations are by design or ignorance of the authors. Within this discussion we have conflicting interpretations of two cities that may or may not have existed; may or may not have been destroyed due to immoral values; may or may not have involved a technology that many believe is a 19th century invention. All bypass the obvious Natural sexual intent, BY DESIGN, of the human species, be we designed by creationism or evolution. Man and woman are design to intercourse with one another, as opposed to same sex intercourse, for the purpose of recreating and survival.

I don't want to undo it without discussion though because it's been two months and no one else has noticed this.

: Since there appears to be no contention I have put it back to its original state per Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view|NPOV]] policy. Inhospitality as the sin of Sodom is a common thread in [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=inhospitality+sin+sodom&amp;btnG=Search biblical scholarship] and also has grounding in the Bible, see [http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=Ezekiel+16%3A49-50 Ezekiel 16:49-50]. [[User:Petrichor|Petrichor]] ([[User talk:Petrichor|talk]]) 22:27, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

: First off, if you're going to claim there are two 'prevailing' views, you should at least be accurate.  The view that was relegated below the so-called hospitality view IS the prevailing view, like it or not.  Second, the inclusion of &quot;informed by certain interpretations of other Biblical texts&quot; in the second suggests that this is just a result of a certain view point, thus it is not &quot;factual&quot; and or accepted.  The absence of this same sentence in what was labeled here as the first view point then suggest that it is more credible than the &quot;second&quot; view point.  The exhaustive explanation of the &quot;hospitality&quot; view (complete with further explanatory links) and the relative diminutive explanation of the homosexual view suggests the writer to be heavily biased, or at the very least woefully uninformed.  Hospitality is most certainly a recurrent theme in the Bible, however it in no way is represented here.  Furthermore, as it is currently written, it makes no sense:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Biblical text itself seems to suggest that the sin is based in part on inhospitality to some (if not a major) extent (although traditionally, the reason promulgated for the punishment has been focused on sexual immorality and not assault):
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

1]Why is the so-called &quot;traditional&quot; explanation a note at the end of the sentence?  If its TWO prevailing view points, why would one be mentioned as if it were a foot note?&lt;br /&gt;
2]So one of the viewpoints is &quot;traditional.&quot; Whats the other one?&lt;br /&gt;
3]The reason for what is referred to as the &quot;homosexual&quot; viewpoint isn't even mentioned (which is yet more evidence of the authors willful misrepresentation or, hopefully, accidental negligence; however I suspect the former as it is not difficult to find such information)&lt;br /&gt;
4]The writer first talks about &quot;inhospitality&quot; then notes &quot;assault?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
5]It makes no sense to interweave ones own views on homosexuality into this Biblical story as there are far more, and rather blunt, examples of what the Christian view of homosexuality is:

{{quote|Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.|[[Gospel of Corinthians|Corinthians]] 6:9-11}}

In any event, what should be plainly noted is the reasoning behind the &quot;homosexual&quot; viewpoint.  There isn't even any mention of homosexuality, just a suspiciously vague mention of &quot;sexual immorality&quot;  when in fact Genesis 19:4-5 notes exactly the kind of &quot;sexual immorality&quot; present:

{{quote|Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house.  They called to Lot, &quot;Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.&quot;|[[Gospel of Genesis|Genesis]] 19:4-5}}

This is a place for information, not misinformation.  Let us be mature and professional with the information.  As such, I think the &quot;second&quot; view point should be on the top, and the suggestive language should be revised --[[User:Boscobites|Boscobites]] ([[User talk:Boscobites|talk]]) 20:59, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

:: I have to agree, it seems like someone is trying to push a specific Christian view because they're afraid the other one is offensive or they don't agree with it.  I'm not sure that it IS in fact the prevailing view that inhospitality was the sin, I'd hardly say that the second view is in the minority.  I think the wording now seems a bit more neutral, still I think both views need some more verifiable sources.  --[[User:Kraftlos|Kraftlos]] ([[User talk:Kraftlos|talk]]) 21:26, 4 March 2008 (UTC)

Since we seem to have a consensus, I'm going to re-write the section.  I'm going to place the so called &quot;traditional view first&quot;, using reputable commentaries as sources (as it is, the section barely has any sources). In order to maintain NPOV, this is no longer going to focus on a specific sin that caused the city to be destroyed since the passage doesn't say it was destroyed for any particular sin.  Homosexuality and inhospitality have to be mentioned of course, but the purpose of a Christian view is not to do original writing and to speculate as to what particular sin was being punished here, but to describe the existing Christian interpretation and what makes it specifically different to say the Jewish interpretation.  So just a warning, this entire section is going to be changed.  No reverts without discussing it here, Thank you.  --[[User:Kraftlos|Kraftlos]] ([[User talk:Kraftlos|talk]]) 05:47, 16 April 2008 (UTC)

:Just for clarification, I don't think that the city was destroyed just for homosexuality or for inhospitality or any other sin.  It seems apparent that the city has simply reached a critical mass of sin.  I'm not sure if I was clear on that.  However I also want to be clear that the Pentatuch (the first five books of the Bible) is not at all unclear in saying that homosexuality is a sin.  I think people were trying to engineer this passage to say the opposite, which would not be supported by the context.  --[[User:Kraftlos|Kraftlos]] ([[User talk:Kraftlos|talk]]) 18:43, 21 April 2008 (UTC)

They came to a conclusion that Sumerian astronomers tracked a comet. This comet landed Kofels. The reason it didn't make a Roland Emerich esque crater is because it burned up in the atmosphere like in Tunguska. Evidence was apparently found worldwide and caused quite a change in the climate. They found a city near the dead sea with many dead and evidence of scorching. They claimed it a possibility that some of the debris thrown into the atmosphere could have fallen in teh area. They also claimed that the Hebrew description of what happened fits exactly with the description of that kind of event. I'm not christian but did find it very intersting.

:The proposed impact event that this documentary refers to is the Köfels Impact event initially propose by the Austrian scientist Franz Eduard Suess in 1936 and later revived by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann (1994) as discussed in [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]]. Later, [[Alan Bond (rocket developer)|Allan Bond]] self-published a book, Bond and Hempsell (2008), in which he argued that this propose impact actually occurred 3150 BCE, not 7640 BCE, and connected it with Sodom and Gomorrah. As discussed in Deutsch et al. (1994), [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]], [http://bluecollarscientist.com/2008/04/01/a-sumerian-observation-of-the-kofe=ls-impact-almost-certainly-not/ &quot;A Sumerian Observation of the Köfels Impact? Almost Certainly Not…&quot;], there are innumerable factual and physical problems with the arguments made by E. Kristan-Tollmann and A. Tollmann and Allan Bond and M. Hempsell in their books and papers for their hypothesized Köfels Impact event. It remains to be documented that the description of what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah matches in any meaningful way the actual physical consequences of any asteroid impact and that any of the many prehistoric cities in the Middle East known to have suffered catastrophic fires can be confidently attributed to an extraterrestrial impact of any sort.

:The best that I can tell, the starting point for the Köfels Impact event hypothesis was the discovery of natural glass in the Köfels landslide deposits. At that time, it was argued that the landslide was impact related because natural glass was only known to be either created volcanic or extraterrestrial impact processes and the there was clearly no evidence of volcanic activity associated with the Köfels landslide. However, since that time, natural glass generated by catastrophic landslides, called &quot;frictionite&quot;, has been found associated with similar catastrophic landslides elsewhere in world. Still, the idea that the Köfels landslide is of extraterrestrial impact origin is recycled in catastrophist literature and documentaries despite the lack of physical evidence supporting this idea and physically implausible nature of the processes and mechanics that have been proposed for such an event. In my opinion, this is part of extraterrestrial impact bandwagon that seems to be fashionable in science as discussed by Reimond (2007) and in popular documentaries.

:If you want to determine what sort of damage that an asteroid 0.5 mile (0.8 km) in diameter will do, go to [http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/impacteffects/ Earth Impact Effects Program]. For example, a stony (density of 3000 kg/m3) asteroid 0.5 mile (0.8 km) in diameter impacting in crystalline rock at a 6 degree angle will have an impact energy of 9,000 MegaTons and create a final crater that is 1.11 miles miles (1.78 km) in diameter. If this asteroid consists of iron (density of 8000 kg/m3), the impact energy will be 70,000 MegaTons and the final crater will be 4.95  miles (7.97 km) in diameter. You can also calculate what the effects of an impact will be at a distance of 1800 miles, which is the distance between Kofels and Israel, away from the point of impact.

 this is in reference to Lot inpregnating his daughters once out of sodom.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/115.188.144.21|115.188.144.21]] ([[User talk:115.188.144.21|talk]]) 00:17, 5 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== The Lyre of Orpheus ==
Nothing in the article about the similarity between the story of Lot and the legend of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]]?

Eurydice died.  Orpheus - who could play his lyre so beautifully rocks rolled towards him and trees uprooted themselves to walk closer - crossed the Styx and charmed Hades and Persephone with his music.  Hades returned Eurydice to him, but told them on their journey out of Hades they must never look back - they walked from Hades, climbing upwards, came to the very exit - and Orpheus turned to speak to his wife - and in doing so looked back.  She disappeared from him, returned to Hades.

== The Battle of the Kings ==

Have just scanned this article and I see no mention of the events of Genesis 14, which would seem to be relevent to this article. I have just created the article [[Battle of the Vale of Siddim]], so wouldn't expect any great detail here, but thought that a link and a brief mention might be appropriate.--[[User:FimusTauri|FimusTauri]] ([[User talk:FimusTauri|talk]]) 11:51, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

== women as property ==

&quot;Another cultural aspect which is noted is that in these civilisations, men were held in a much higher regard than women, as in Greece women were often seen as little more than property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshistory.about.com/od/ancientgreece/Ancient_Greece_Women.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is therefore argued that to demand not only a guest, but a male guest, be violated against his will, would be seen as more of a crime than to allow women to be used to save the guest.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} However, noted Christian commentators see Lot's offer being one of substitute bodies for sex, though his hasty attempt to a solution was hardly excusable.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Clarke, John Gill, Matthew Henry, Keil &amp; Delitzsch&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

questionable interpretation, no backup evidence

== Homosexual rape ??? ==

&quot;The 7th sura, Al-A'raf, confirms that like the biblical account, the Islamic Sodom and Gomorrah is referring to homosexuality and specifically homosexual rape.&quot;

If one reads the surate (if possible in arabic in order to avoid personnal interpretations), he'll see no reference to &quot; gay rape&quot; but only to &quot;regular&quot; homosexuality. This surate only states that Islam condemns homosexuality. Everybody is entitled to his opinion about this matter but let's not distort the scriptures[[User:Mitch1981|Mitch1981]] ([[User talk:Mitch1981|talk]]) 08:11, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

I agree with your point of not distorting scripture. This will also help: use the clearest scripture translation that accurately transmits the message of the original text. [[User:Habibullah rRahman|Habibullah rRahman]] ([[User talk:Habibullah rRahman|talk]]) 12:49, 2 November 2010 (UTC)

== What about the kids? ==

The article talks about a city Sodom that there people were homosexual .. are this mean that the men were gays and The women were lesbains? ok, but what about the kids .. why God kill them ? are the city were contain only men? the article not mention any thing about the women and kids.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.188.85.156|213.188.85.156]] ([[User talk:213.188.85.156|talk]]) 23:55, 3 November 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: God typically murders children, fetuses, etc along with everybody else when His divine panties are put in a bunch. Sparing the innocent is something He only does when He feels generous, which was shockingly uncommon in the Old Testament. Even mentioning them is usually too much effort for Him.

== Use of scripture outside of canon. ==

The use of the book of wisdom as a reference goes beyond the context of passages considered in the article. Though it may reference Sodom, it should not be used as a reliable source due to the controversial nature of the canonicity of the book. --[[Special:Contributions/24.206.221.83|24.206.221.83]] ([[User talk:24.206.221.83|talk]]) 17:30, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

== LORD (YHVH, God's name) versus Lord (Master) in the Old Testament and New Testament ==

I noticed that many articles do not differentiate between LORD and Lord.
The Hebrew tetragram YHVH (God's name) is translated into LORD, all capital letters, in most English Bible. Thus, the LORD is YeHoVaH God Himself, one of the three persons who appeared to Abraham. While the LORD is Lord, the word Lord simply means Master.

In the second paragraph of this article, &quot;brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven&quot; should have been written as &quot;brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven&quot; See the references below:

“Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven” (Genesis 19:24, ESV)

“Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven” (Genesis 19:24, ASV)

Thus, by correctly using LORD instead of Lord, all the articles in Wikipedia will become more alive. Also by putting the entire Genesis 19:24, people can see how the Jehovah on earth (one of the three persons) rained fire and brimstone.

FYI: according to the New Testament, Jesus (YeHoVaH on earth, one of the 3 persons) destroyed Sodom &amp; Gomorrah as shown in the verses below (Jesus Hebrew, full name is YHVShA (see Biblesoft for Joshua or YeHoVaShA meaning &quot;YeHoVaH Saves&quot;):

“Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgement of the great day – just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire” (Jude 5-7, ESV). The NIV Study Bible uses the word “Lord” instead of “Jesus” but adds the footnote “Some early manuscripts Jesus.”

Thus, according to Jude the LORD who appeared to Abraham was Jesus, and the God who led the Jews out of Egypt was Jesus as no one has seen God (the Father) except His Divine Word (Messenger/Malak often translated and confused as Angel).

“No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known” (John 1:18, NKJV)

“No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father” (John 6:46, NKJV).

Note: NKJV would translate NT &quot;Lord&quot; into &quot;LORD&quot; whenever clear, equivalent verses were found in the Old Testament.

Thus, let's start to correctly edit and use the word &quot;LORD&quot; when appropriate to more acccurately reflect the original Hebrew Bible.

:If we are citing a text, we use whatever the text uses. Other than that, for the average reader I'd say all caps is just confusing. A single capital 'L' in context is enough. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 07:35, 28 October 2010 (UTC)


Your first point is my exact point for bringing up this issue &quot;If we are citing a text, we use whatever the text uses.&quot; Thus, if the Bible/text uses LORD, do not replace it with Lord.

The purpose of an encyclopedia is to accurately inform and educate so that people can distinguish. If it is confusing, an explanation is due, though I do not expect confusion as the word LORD is the accurate quote from the Bible in this case. If we use American Standard Version translation, the encyclopedia will be even clearer and improved, as it uses the word &quot;Jehovah&quot; (tetragram YHVH in the original Hebrew) instead of LORD. With ASV, a new reader will immediately and easily understand whether the Bible is talking about God Himself or a Master (Boss). That will make Wiki a better encyclopedia, won't it?

Thus, let's make Wikipedia as informative and as clear as possible by using the clearest Bible translation. And let's transmit quotation accurately instead of changing it.      [[User:Habibullah rRahman|Habibullah rRahman]] ([[User talk:Habibullah rRahman|talk]]) 12:43, 2 November 2010 (UTC)

I agree with [[Talk:PiCo]] that Josephus &amp; Philo have way more content than they should. However, I think its poor form for PiCo to hack the whole damn thing.
