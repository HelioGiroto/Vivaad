In [[Abrahamic religions]], '''Gabriel''' ({{Hebrew Name|גַּבְרִיאֵל|Gavri'el|Gaḇrîʼēl, God is my strength}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: جبريل, ''Jibrīl'' or جبرائيل ''Jibrāʾīl'') is an [[archangel]] who typically serves as a messenger to humans from [[God]].  

Gabriel is mentioned in the [[Bible]] once in the [[Old Testament]] and once in the [[New Testament|New]]. In the Old Testament, he appears to the prophet [[Daniel]], delivering explanations of Daniel's visions ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 8:15–26, 9:21–27). In the [[Gospel of Luke]], Gabriel appears to the [[virgin Mary]] and to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], foretelling the births of [[Jesus]] and [[John the Baptist]], respectively ([[Gabriel#New_Testament|Luke 1:11–38]]). 

Daniel does not explicitly identify Gabriel as an angel: he is a visionary figure whom Daniel calls &quot;the man Gabriel&quot;. In the Gospel of Luke, Gabriel is referred to as &quot;an angel of the Lord&quot;. (Luke 1:11) But Christians of the [[Catholic]] traditions call him an [[archangel]], following terminology developed in the [[Intertestamental period]], especially the [[Book of Enoch]]. In the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the archangels Michael, Raphael and Gabriel are considered [[saint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Julie|title=Test Your Knowledge on Angels|url=archangels Michael, Raphael and Gabriel are also saints.|publisher=AmericanCatholic.org|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, Gabriel (''[[Jibra'il]]'') is believed to have been the angel who revealed the [[Qur'an]] to the [[Prophet]] [[Mohammed]] in the period of 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;Nader, M. [http://www.submission.org/jesus/holy_spirit.html The Holy Spirit in the Quran]. Submission.org. Retrieved 11 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Gabriel is mentioned in the Book of Daniel, in the [[Hebrew Scriptures]] where he is sent as a messenger of [[Yehowah|YHWH]] (see [[God in Judaism]]) to [[Daniel]] during the [[Babylonian Captivity|Jewish captivity in Babylon]]. He is later mentioned in the [[Talmud]].

Gabriel is interpreted by the Rabbis to be the &quot;man in linen&quot; in the [[Book of Daniel]] and the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. In the Book of Daniel, he is responsible for interpreting Daniel's visions and acting as a spokesman providing God's responses to his prayers and fasting. In the Book of Ezekiel, Gabriel is understood to be the angel that was sent to destroy [[Jerusalem]] for its wickedness and idolatry during the late [[Kingdom of Judah]], separating the few righteous Jews that would not be destroyed and would be exiled from the majority of wicked ones that would perish there for their iniquities and failure to return. 

In the [[Kabbalah]], he is identified with the [[sephirot]] of [[gevurah]]. He also has a prominent role as one of God's archangels in the [[Kabbalah]] literature. There, he is portrayed as working in concert with [[Michael]] as part of God's court. He is not to be prayed to directly; only God can answer prayers and send him as His agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabriel|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6450-gabriel|work=Gabriel|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jewish mythology]], in the [[Garden of Eden]] there is a [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of life]] or the ''Tree of Souls''&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=9dRi8v-j7OMC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=Tree+of+Souls&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oNAhKRJFDh&amp;sig=4XkJf_jvNVEvAzw-PmKQ_SDKdr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VKIhUN3nIInM9gSLq4HACg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Tree%20of%20Souls&amp;f=false Origins of the Kabbalah]&lt;/ref&gt; that blossoms and produces new [[souls]], which fall into the [[Guf]], the ''Treasury of Souls''. Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then [[Lailah]], the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertestamental literature==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
The inter-testamental period (roughly 200 BCE – 50 CE) produced a wealth of [[Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible|literature]], much of it having an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] orientation. The names and ranks of angels and devils were greatly expanded there, and given particular duties and status before God.

In  [[1 Enoch]] 9:1–2, Gabriel, along with [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Raphael (angel)|Raphael]], [[Uriel (angel)|Uriel]] and [[Suriel]], hears the cries of humanity under the strain of the [[Nephilim]]. It was their beseeching of &quot;the [[Ancient of Days]]&quot; - interpreted to be [[Yahweh]] - that prompted God to call [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] to the prophetical office. After Enoch informed the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]] (or &quot;Grigori&quot;) of their fall from [[Grace of God|grace]], the Ancient of Days sent the archangels to earth to complete various tasks. In Enoch 10:13, Gabriel was to &quot;Go to the biters, to the reprobates, to the children of fornication, the offspring of the Watchers, from among men; bring them forth and excite them against one another. Let them perish under mutual slaughter; for length of days shall not be theirs.&quot; And so, Gabriel instigated wars among the Nephilim (the sons of the Watchers).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Enoch (20:7) says that Gabriel presides over &quot;Ikisat&quot; (the fiery serpents) or Seraphim, Cherubim, and paradise, while Enoch 40:9 states that Gabriel presides over &quot;all that is powerful.&quot; Gabriel sits on the left hand of God with [[Metatron]].&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix

===New Testament===
[[File:Mestia Museum. Archangel Gabriel. 12th c..jpg|thumb|right|12th century depiction, [[Georgian National Museum]]]]
First, concerning [[John the Baptist]], an angel appeared to his father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]], a priest of the course of Abia, ({{bibleref|Luke|1:5-7|9}}) whose &quot;barren&quot; wife [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elisabeth]] was of the daughters of [[Aaron]], while he ministered in the temple:

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;Luke 1:10  And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.&lt;br&gt;
11  And there appeared unto him &lt;u&gt;an angel of the Lord&lt;/u&gt; standing on the right side of the altar of incense.&lt;br&gt;
12  And when Zacharias saw ''him'', he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.&lt;br&gt;
13  But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.&lt;br&gt;
14  And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.&lt;br&gt;
15  For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost,&lt;!-- Ghost is correct KJV, do not change to spirit. --&gt; even from his mother’s womb.&lt;br&gt;
16  And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.&lt;br&gt;
17  And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&lt;br&gt;
18  And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.&lt;br&gt;
19  And the angel answering said unto him, &lt;U&gt;I am Gabriel&lt;/U&gt;, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.&lt;br&gt;
20  And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.&lt;br&gt;({{bibleref|Luke|1:10-20|KJV}} KJV) (other versions: {{bibleref|Luke|1:1-25|!}}) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

After completing his week&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avbtab.org/rc/read/dedicate.htm THE Dedication (Jesus' birth)] &quot;The priests serve 4 weeks per year: 1 week twice a year in courses, and the two week-long feasts, unleavened bread and tabernacles. Pentecost is a one-day observance, which would have come before Zacharias' (the 8th) course began, or at the latest, the 1st day of his course, which was from 12 thru 18 Sivan, or noon on the 19th, if Josephus is correct that courses changed at noon on the sabbaths.&quot; Josephus Antiquities b.7 ch.14 s.7 &quot;eight days, from sabbath to sabbath.&quot; Josephus against Apion b.2 sect.8 &quot;mid-day&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; of ministry, Zacharias returned to his house (in [[Hebron]])&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Joshua|21:9-11|9}} with {{bibleref|Luke|1:39-40|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Elizabeth conceived. After she completed &quot;five months&quot; ({{bibleref|Luke|1:21-25|9}}) of her pregnancy, Gabriel is mentioned again:

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;Luke 1:26 ¶ And in the sixth month &lt;U&gt;the angel Gabriel&lt;/U&gt; was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,&lt;br&gt;
27  To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name ''was'' Mary.&lt;br&gt;
28  And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, ''thou that art'' highly favoured, the Lord ''is'' with thee: blessed ''art'' thou among women.&lt;br&gt;
29  And when she saw ''him'', she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.&lt;br&gt;
30  And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.&lt;br&gt;
31  And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.&lt;br&gt;
32  He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:&lt;br&gt;
33  And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.&lt;br&gt;
34  Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?&lt;br&gt;
35  And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.&lt;br&gt;
36  And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.&lt;br&gt;
37  For with God nothing shall be impossible.&lt;br&gt;
38  And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.&lt;br&gt;({{bibleref|Luke|1:26-38|KJV}} KJV) (other versions: {{bibleref|Luke|1:26-38|!}}) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

Gabriel only appears by name in those two passages in Luke. In the first passage the angel identified himself as Gabriel, but in the second it is Luke who identified him as Gabriel.  The only other named angel in the New Testament is &quot;Michael the archangel&quot; (in {{bibleref|Jude|1:9|9}}). Gabriel is not called an archangel in the Bible. Believers are expressly warned not to worship angels (in {{bibleref|Colossians|2:18-19|9}} and {{bibleref|Revelation|19:10|9}}).&lt;ref&gt;See also Easton's Bible Dictionary entry on ''angels''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gabriel's horn===
In English-speaking culture, a familiar [[Literary trope|trope]] is the image of Gabriel blowing a trumpet blast to indicate the Lord's return to Earth. It ranges from its first appearance in English in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667)&lt;ref&gt;Milton, ''Paradise Lost'', XI.72ff was identified by S. Vernon McCasland, (&quot;Gabriel's Trumpet&quot; ''Journal of Bible and Religion'' '''9'''.3 [August 1941:159–161] p. 161) as the first identification in English of Gabriel as the trumpeter: &quot;Betwixt these rockie pillars Gabriel sat, Chief of the Angelic guards&quot; (IV.545f)... he Blew his trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps When God descended, and perhaps once more To sound at general doom.&quot; (IX.73ff).&lt;/ref&gt; to African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]]: in [[Marc Connelly]]'s play based on spirituals, ''[[The Green Pastures]]'' (1930), Gabriel has his beloved trumpet constantly with him, and the Lord has to warn him not to blow it too soon.&lt;ref&gt;Both spirituals and ''Green Pastures'' were noted by McCasland 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later &quot;Blow, Gabriel, Blow&quot; was introduced by [[Ethel Merman]] in [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934). The mathematical figure given the modern name &quot;[[Gabriel's Horn]]&quot;, was invented by [[Evangelista Torricelli]]  (1608–1647); it is a paradoxical [[solid of revolution]] that has [[infinity|infinite]] [[surface area]], but finite [[volume]].

In [[Islam|Islamic tradition]], though not specified in the [[Qur'an]], the trumpeter sounding the ''trump of doom''&lt;ref&gt;''Trump of doom'': &quot;The wakeful trump of doom&quot; is [[John Milton]]'s phrase in his [http://www.online-literature.com/milton/554/ &quot;Hymn on the morning of Christ's Nativity&quot;], drawing upon the King James Version's &quot;We shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:51f).&lt;/ref&gt; is not Gabriel, but [[Israfel]].

The earliest identification of Gabriel as the trumpeter that  S. Vernon McCasland was able to trace was in an Armenian illuminated manuscript dated 1455, at the [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Walters MS 543, fol. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feast days===
[[Image:Gabriel byzantine.jpg|thumb|right|[[Icon]] of Gabriel, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], ''ca''. 1387–1395 ([[Tretyakov Gallery]])]]

The feast of Saint Gabriel was included for the first time in the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1921, for celebration on March 24. In 1969 it was transferred to 29 September for celebration together with [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]] and [[Raphael (archangel)|St. Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of England]] has also adopted the 29 September date, known as [[Michaelmas]].

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]] celebrate his [[feast day]] on 8 November (for those churches that follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], 8 November currently falls on 21 November of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]], a difference of 13 days). Eastern Orthodox commemorate him, not only on his November feast, but also on two other days: 26 March is the &quot;[[Synaxis]] of the Archangel Gabriel&quot; and celebrates his role in the Annunciation. 13 July is also known as the &quot;Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel&quot;, and celebrates all the appearances and miracles attributed to Gabriel throughout history. The feast was first established on [[Mount Athos]] when, in the ninth century, during the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Basil II]] and the Empress Constantina Porphyrogenitus and while [[Nicholas II Chrysoberges|Nicholas Chrysoverges]] was [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], the Archangel appeared in a cell near [[Karyes]], where he wrote with his finger on a stone tablet the hymn to the [[Theotokos]], &quot;[[Axion Estin|It is truly meet...]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Velimirovic | first =Bishop Nikolai  | contribution =July 13: The Holy Archangel Gabriel | year =1985 | title =Prologue from Ochrid | place=Birmingham, UK | publisher =Lazarica Press  | isbn =978-0-948298-05-9 | url =http://www.westsrbdio.org/prolog/my.html?month=July&amp;day=13&amp;Go.x=6&amp;Go.y=12 | accessdate =2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ethiopian Church]] celebrates his feast on 28 December, with a sizeable number of its believers making a pilgrimage to a church dedicated to &quot;Saint Gabriel&quot; in [[Kulubi]] on that day.&lt;ref&gt;Nega Mezlekia, ''Notes from the Hyena's Belly: An Ethiopian Childhood'' (New York: Picador, 2000), p. 266. ISBN 0-312-28914-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally Gabriel is the [[patron saint]] of messengers, those who work for broadcasting and telecommunications such as radio and television, [[remote sensing]], and postal workers.

==Islam==&lt;!-- [[Djibril]]redirects here --&gt;

{{Main|Gabriel in Islam}}
According to the Quran, '''Gabriel''' (''Jibra'il'') the angel who revealed the Qur'an to the [[Prophet of Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]],&lt;ref&gt;Nader, M. [http://www.submission.org/jesus/holy_spirit.html The Holy Spirit in the Quran]. Submission.org. Retrieved 11 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lil Abdo. [http://bahai-library.com/abdo_female_holy-spirit &quot;Female Representations of the Holy Spirit in Bahá'í and Christian writings and their implications for gender roles&quot;] ''Bahá'í Studies Review'' Volume 4.1, 1994. Retrieved 11 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and sent a message to most [[prophet]]s, if not all, revealing their obligations. Gabriel is named numerous times in the [[Qur'an]] (II: 97, 98; LXVI: 4); and, in II: 97, the [[Qur'an]] expressly narrates:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is who hath revealed (this scripture) to thy heart by God's leave, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Gabriel makes a famous appearance in the [[Hadith of Gabriel]], where he quizzes the Prophet Muhammad on the core tenets of Islam.

In [[Muslim]] [[tradition]], Gabriel occupies the role of one of the primary [[archangel]]s and all historical commentaries build upon Gabriel's role as the transmitter of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;All ancient sources, including ''Tabari'', ''Zamakhshari'' and ''Baydawi'' elaborate on Gabriel's role as the transmitter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exegesis]] narrates that [[Muhammad]] saw Gabriel in his full angelic splendor only twice, the first being when he received his first revelation.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Djabrail''&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims also revere Gabriel for a number of historical events predating the first revelation. Muslims believe that Gabriel was the angel who informed [[Zechariah (priest)|Zachariah]] of [[John the Baptist|John]]'s birth as well as [[Islamic views of Mary|Mary]] of the future birth of [[Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Zachariah''; ''Story of Jesus''&lt;/ref&gt; and that Gabriel was one of three angels who had earlier informed [[Abraham]] of the birth of [[Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Ishmael''&lt;/ref&gt;  These events of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zachariah]] and [[Islamic views of Mary|Mary]] can  be found also in the Quran, mentioned in surah Maryam, below are some [[ayat]] from the Quran referring to the [[archangel]] Gabriel (interpretation of the meanings).

&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;
Mary 19:2 [This is] a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zechariah&lt;br&gt;
19:3 When he called to his Lord a private supplication.&lt;br&gt;
19:4 He said, &quot;My Lord, indeed my bones have weakened, and my head has filled with white, and never have I been in my supplication to You, my Lord, unhappy.&lt;br&gt;
19:5 And indeed, I fear the successors after me, and my wife has been barren, so give me from Yourself an heir&lt;br&gt;
19:6 Who will inherit me and inherit from the family of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, pleasing [to You].&quot;&lt;br&gt;
19:7 [He was told], &quot;O Zechariah, indeed We give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be John. We have not assigned to any before [this] name.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
19:8 He said, &quot;My Lord, how will I have a boy when my wife has been barren and I have reached extreme old age?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
19:9 &lt;U&gt;[An angel] said&lt;/U&gt;, &quot;Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, for I created you before, while you were nothing.' &quot;&lt;br&gt;
19:10 [Zechariah] said, &quot;My Lord, make for me a sign.&quot; He said, &quot;Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights, [being] sound.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

When the [[angel]] Gabriel appeared to Mary:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;&lt;br&gt;
19:16 And mention, [O Muhammad], in the Book [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.&lt;br&gt;
19:17 And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her&lt;U&gt; Our Angel&lt;/U&gt;, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.&lt;br&gt;
19:18 She said, &quot;Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah .&quot;&lt;br&gt;
19:19 He said, &quot;I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
19:20 She said, &quot;How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
19:21 He said, &quot;Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.' &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

==Mormonism==
In [[Latter-day Saint|Mormon]] theology, Gabriel is believed to have lived a mortal life as the prophet [[Noah]]. The two are regarded as the same individual; Noah being his mortal name and Gabriel being his heavenly name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Noah|title=Encyclopedia of Mormonism - NOAH}}&lt;/ref&gt;
