      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5447">[[Image:Westerminster catechism first page.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The first page of the ninth edition of ''The Shorter Catechism Explained'' ([[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], 1785).]]

The '''''Westminster Shorter Catechism''''' (also known simply as the '''''Shorter Catechism,''''' hereinafter referred to as the '''WSC''') is a [[catechism]] that was written in the 1640s by [[England|English]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Divine (noun)|divine]]s. The assembly also produced the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] and the [[Westminster Larger Catechism]].  The three documents are considered by many Protestants to be the grandest doctrinal statements to come out of the [[English Reformation]].  Completed in 1647, it was presented to the [[Long Parliament]] on 14 April 1648.

The purpose of the WSC is to educate lay persons in matters of [[doctrine]] and [[belief]]. The WSC is in a simple question and answer format to facilitate memorization. Typically, parents and the church would use the shorter catechism to train their children in the ways of the Lord. New converts are also given the WSC as well as the Confession of Faith and [[Holy Scripture]] to study. Various denominations have used the Westminster Confession and Catechism to instruct their members.

Although the church in Scotland (the Kirk) had produced ''The New Catechisme according to the Forme of the Kirk of Scotland'' in 1644, it was aimed particularly at children and youth, and was not adopted by the Westminster Assembly of Divines. It was, however, later acknowledged that the Shorter Catechism was not suitable for young children or those of a weak capacity. Various other catechisms were created for this purpose, including the Mother's Catechism.

The ''[[First Book of Discipline]]'' (1560) required that a [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] afternoon session be set aside for examination of young children in catechism, and this practice was adopted in the Kirk on [[John Knox]]'s return to Scotland. Catechizing became a part of life in the Scottish Churches with itinerant catechists being employed to instruct the people &amp;mdash; a practice that continued into the 19th century. The Church of Scotland approved the Westminster Shorter Catechism in 1648, and thereafter it was the manual for instruction. However, because a significant portion of the Scottish Highland population spoke only [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]], the Synod of Argyll in 1649 instructed seven of its ministers to translate the Westminster Shorter Catechism into that language. The result was published that same year, and the Gaelic Shorter Catechism continued to play a part in church life for decades after it had ceased to be used in the English speaking churches.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}} The [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] still presents a Bible to a child who can answer all 107 questions accurately at one sitting.

The catechism is composed of 107 questions and answers. The first 12 questions concern [[God]] as [[Creator deity|Creator]]. Questions 13-20 deal with [[original sin]] and the fallen state of man's nature. Questions 21-38 concern [[Christ]] the Redeemer and the benefits that flow from redemption. The next set of questions, 39-84, discuss the [[ten commandments]]. Questions 85-97 teach concerning the [[Sacrament]]s of [[Baptism]] and [[Holy Communion]]. The final set of questions, 98-107, teach and explain the [[Lord's prayer]]. This organization mimics the earlier [[Heidelberg Catechism]] of the continental [[Reformed]] churches. 

The most famous of the questions (known to a great many Presbyterian children) is the first: 

''Q. What is the chief end of man?''&lt;br&gt;
A. Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.

In 1675, the Presbyterian [[Thomas Vincent]] in London published a popular exposition called ''The Shorter Catechism Explained''. Later, Reformed catechisms such as the 1693 Baptist [[Keach's Catechism]] mimic the Westminster catechism on most points except infant baptism.
