==Untitled==
In the cited verses from the Book of Daniel it speaks of &quot;someone like a son of man ..... coming to the Ancient of Days&quot;. Jesus Christ referred to himself as that Son of Man (John 3:13) which clearly differentiates him from the Father, the Ancient of Days, Jehovah. Why other religions can't see this rests with them to explain.

Good overview though.

FYI The 'Ancients of Days' are given much attention by The Urantia BOok which describes them as an important order of universe beings/adjudicators representing God's will to the universes of time and space (sorry, not the best summary). 

Van Morrison has also published a song titled 'Ancient of Days'.

==Psalm 69:14==

The first reference to &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; used is cited as being from Psalm 69:14, but that is incorrect.  &quot;Psalm 69:14 - Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.&quot; [KJV [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2069:14;&amp;version=9;]]

Does anybody know what the real reference is supposed to be?  It sounds like it comes from the Koran.

== Know Your Blake ==

This image depicts the &quot;Ancient of Days,&quot; for Blake, a Urizenic[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urizen] figure. There is an erroneous implication that these figures are viewed by Blake as deserving of reverence. In fact, Urizen is a relatively negative figure in Blake's pantheon. According to Joseph Hogan[http://facstaff.uww.edu/hoganj/], Urizen

&lt;blockquote&gt;
    is reason, the rational faculty of the individual....His function is to limit and give outline to the creative energy of the individual....[H]e tries to stop the creative activity of the Eternals and to fix the world in one state. As a result he creates the fallen material universe...In his pursuit of single rule, he is also the archetypal King, the political oppressor[http://facstaff.uww.edu/hoganj/gloss.htm#uriz]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Blake, he has more in common with the traditional view of Satan as the oppressor of Man (perpetrated by John Milton[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_milton]) than the caption suggests.  Thus, Urizen is Blake's satire on the Jehovah of Christian theology.   

See also the entry here at WikiPedia for Urizen (above).

==Enochian terminology==
I have done some research of the figure of [[Enoch]] and have found that this term was being used by those who were close or friends with the biblical patriarch. Anyways, I think that further research needs to be done on Enoch and why some people have called an ''ancient''. [[User:ADM|ADM]] ([[User talk:ADM|talk]]) 19:18, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

==Book series==
in the book series the alchemist, the third book, at the end, Dee's master is apperently the ancient of days.

== &quot;Palaios Hemeron&quot;  in Greek ==

That's not what I'd expected the Greek rendering to be, Not the Hemeron part for Days but the first word.  I feel something related to Arca or Arche would better poetically fit the Auhtor's intent.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.92.229.89|70.92.229.89]] ([[User talk:70.92.229.89|talk]]) 22:58, 12 January 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
