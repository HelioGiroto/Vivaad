{{redirect|Weeks}}

A '''week''' is a [[time unit]] equal to [[Seven-day week|seven days]]. The English word [[:wikt:week|week]] continues an [[Old English]] ''wice'', ultimately from a [[Common Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem|*wikōn-}}'', from a root ''{{lang|gem|*wik-}}'' &quot;turn, move, change&quot;. The Germanic word probably had a wider meaning prior to the adoption of the [[Roman calendar]], perhaps &quot;succession series&quot;, as suggested by [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''wikō'' translating ''taxis'' &quot;order&quot; in [[gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:8. The term &quot;week&quot; is sometimes expanded to refer to other time units comprising a few days. Such &quot;weeks&quot; of between four and ten days have been used historically in various places.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] s.v. &quot;week ''n.''&quot;, entry 1.c.: &quot;Sometimes applied ''transf.'' to other artificial cycles of a few days that have been employed by various peoples&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
Intervals longer than 10 days are not usually termed &quot;weeks&quot; as they are closer in length to the [[fortnight]] or the [[month]] than to the seven-day week.

==Seven-day week==
{{Main|Seven-day week|Weekday names}}
Evidence of continuous use of a seven-day week appears with the Jews during the [[Babylonian Captivity]] of the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Both Judaism (based on the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation narrative in the Bible]]) and ancient Babylonian religions used a seven-day week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pinches, T.G.|editor=Hastings, James|others=Selbie, John A., contrib|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=20|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003|pages=889–891|chapter=Sabbath (Babylonian)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qVNqXDz4CE8C|isbn=978-0-7661-3698-4|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultures adopted the seven-day week at different times. Between the 1st and 3rd centuries the [[Roman Empire]] gradually replaced the eight-day Roman [[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinal cycle]] with the seven-day week. Hindus may have adopted a seven-day week earlier than 11th century BC.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} See [[Rig Veda]].  There is evidence of some Chinese groups using a seven-day week as early as 4th century.

==Systems derived from the seven-day week==
===Soviet Union===
[[Image:Revolution kalendar.jpg|thumb|Soviet calendar &lt;br&gt; 12 December 1937 &lt;br&gt;(Below 12:)&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Sixth day of the six-day week&quot; &lt;br&gt; ————————— &lt;br&gt; &quot;Election day for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR&quot;]]
{{Main|Soviet calendar}}
Between 1929 and 1931 the [[USSR]] changed from the seven-day week to a five-day week. There were 72 weeks and an additional five national holidays inserted within three of them totaling a year of 365 days.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 1931, after its brief experiment with a five-day week, the Soviet Union changed to a six-day week. Every sixth day (6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 30th) of the [[Gregorian Calendar]] was a state rest day. The five additional national holidays in the earlier five-day week remained and did not fall on the state rest day. But as January, March, May, July, August, October and December have 31 days, the week after the state rest day of the 30th was seven days long (31st&amp;ndash;7th). This extra day was a working day for most or an extra holiday for others. Also as [[February]] is only 28 or 29 days depending on whether it is a [[leap year]] or not, the first of March was also made a state rest day, although not every enterprise conformed to this. To clarify, the week after the state rest day, 24/25 February to 1 March, was only five or six days long, depending on whether it was a leap year or not. The week after that, 2 to 6 March, was only five days long.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The calendar was abandoned 26 June 1940 and the seven-day week reintroduced the next day.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Decimal calendar===
{{Main|Decimal calendar|French Revolutionary Calendar#Ten days of the week}}
A 10-day week, called ''décade'', was used in France for nine and a half years from October 1793 to April 1802; furthermore, the Paris Commune adopted the Revolutionary Calendar for 18 days in 1871.

===Christian &quot;eighth day&quot;===
{{Main|Octave (liturgical)}}
For early Christians, Sunday, as well as being the first day of the week, was also the spiritual eighth day, as it symbolised the new world created after Christ's resurrection. The concept of [[the eighth day (Christian)|the eighth day]] was symbolic only and had no effect on the use of the seven-day week for calendar purposes. [[Justin Martyr]] wrote: &quot;the first day after the Sabbath, remaining the first of all the days, is called, however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the cycle, and [yet] remains the first&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html Dialogue with Trypho, chapter XLI]&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not set up an eight-day week, since the eighth day is also considered to be the first day of the next cycle (i.e., not the following day).

A period of eight days, starting and ending on a Sunday or starting on a major feast day and finishing on the same day of the week a (seven-day) week later, is called an [[octave (liturgical)|octave]].  For centuries these were a major feature of the liturgical calendar, particularly of the [[Catholic Church]], and some are still observed, though the number of such octaves has now been radically reduced.  Some modern Church uses also preserve the idea of an eight-day period, starting and finishing on the same day of the week, and retain the name &quot;octave&quot; for them; for example, many churches observe an annual &quot;[[Octave of Prayer for Christian Unity]]&quot; on 18–25 January or in the week that begins with [[Pentecost|Pentecost Sunday]]. Organizations such as [[8th Day Center for Justice]], based out of [[Chicago, Illinois]], use the concept in terms of social justice as well.

===Hermetic lunar week===

The Hermetic Lunar Week Calendar is one of many [[Calendar_reform#Proposals|proposed reforms]] to the Gregorian Calendar. The [[lunation]] is divided into the four [[lunar phase|moon phases]] and has six, seven, eight, or nine days depending on the actual time difference between the [[full moon]], first quarter, [[new moon]] and last quarter.&lt;ref&gt;

==&quot;Weeks&quot; in other calendars==
Periods termed &quot;weeks&quot; in calendars unrelated to the Judeo-Christian tradition.

===Three-day===
The names of the days of the week (''aste'') in [[Guipuscoan Basque]] point to an earlier three-day week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knorr&quot;&gt;''[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?articulo=26362&amp;orden=59718 Astronomy and Basque Language]'', [[Henrike Knörr]], ''Oxford VI and SEAC 99 &quot;Astronomy and Cultural Diversity&quot;'', [[La Laguna]], June 1999. It references [[Alessandro Bausani]], 1982, ''The prehistoric Basque week of three days: archaeoastronomical notes'', ''The Bulletin of the [[Center for Archaeoastronomy]]'' (Maryland), v. 2, 16-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''astelehena'' (&quot;week-first&quot;, Monday)
#''asteartea'' (&quot;week-between&quot;, Tuesday)
#''asteazkena'' (&quot;week-last&quot;, Wednesday)

===Four-day===
{{Main|Igbo Culture#Calendar (Iguafo Igbo)}}
The [[Igbo people|Igbo]] of [[Nigeria]] have a traditional calendar with a four-day week. This &quot;market week&quot; features prominently in the fiction of [[Chinua Achebe]].

===Five-day===
{{Main|Javanese calendar}}
The [[Javanese people]] of [[Indonesia]] have a five-day week known as the [[Javanese calendar#Five-day week (Pasaran)|Pasaran]] cycle. This is still in use today and superimposed with seven-day week of the Gregorian calendar and [[Islamic calendar]] to become what is known as the 35-day [[Javanese calendar#Wetonan_cycle|Wetonan Cycle]].

===Six-day===
{{Main|Akan Calendar}}
The [[Akan people]] of [[West Africa]] have a 42-day cycle known as ''Adaduanan''. The ''Adaduanan'' cycle appears to be based on an older six-day week, still extant in some northern Guan communities such as the Nchumuru, on which is superimposed a seven-day week which may have been brought south with itinerant traders from the Savannah.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six-day week is referred to as ''Nanson'' (literally seven-days), reflecting an [[inclusive numbering]] system.

===Eight-day===
====Nundinal cycle====
{{Main|Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle}}
The ancient [[Etruscans]] developed an eight-day market week known as the [[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinal cycle]] around the 8th or 7th century [[Anno Domini|BC]]. This was passed on to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] no later than the 6th century BC. As Rome expanded, it encountered the seven-day week and for a time attempted to include both. The popularity of the seven-day rhythm won and the eight-day week disappeared forever.

The cycle of seven days, named after the sun, the moon, and the five planets visible to the naked eye, was already customary in the time of [[Justin Martyr]], who wrote of the Christians meeting on the Day of the Sun (Sunday).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxvii.html Apology, chapter LXVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Constantine eventually established the seven-day week in the [[Roman calendar]] in AD 321.&lt;ref&gt;

====Celts====
{{Further|Celtic calendar}}
With regards to measuring time, the [[Celts]] regarded darkness as taking precedence over light, so used periods of darkness such as night and winter to begin their calculations of time.  This meant that the first period of time in a &quot;week&quot; was a night, followed by a day.  Further, they also counted the ending night period, giving rise to periods of time with more nights than days.  In Irish, the term ''nómad'' is used to signify a small number of days and is exactly the length of the nine night week as in ''co cend nomaide'' - a period of time with nine nights bracketing eight days.  The nine nights divided nicely into a [[Sidereal_month#Sidereal_month|sidereal month]] of 27 nights.  In Welsh a similar word ''wythnos'' meaning &quot;a week&quot; literally means &quot;an eight-night&quot; since it started and ended with a period of night bracketing seven days.  Similarly a fortnight ''pythewnos'' means &quot;a fifteen night&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

===Nine-day===
[[Image:Gediminas calendar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Gediminas Sceptre, a medieval Lithuanian calendar. Showing 12 months and 9 days in a week]]

====Baltic calendars====
In the 14th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] used a solar-lunar calendar.  The structure of this calendar was understood with the help of the so-called [[Gediminas]] Sceptre discovered in 1680.&lt;ref&gt;

Similarly in Latvia petroglyphs were found in 1987, which are considered to show nine day calendar with three weeks in a month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dabasretumi.lv/Raksti/GEnIdumejaRaksti.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence suggests that the week of the ancient [[Balts]] was nine days long. Thus, the [[Month#Sidereal_month|sidereal month]] must have been divided into three parts.&lt;ref&gt;

===Ten-day===
====China, Japan====

The Chinese ten-day week went as far back as the [[Xia Dynasty]] (2070-1600 BC).&lt;ref&gt;

Months were almost three weeks long (alternating 29 and 30 days to keep in line with the  [[lunation]]). The weeks were labelled ''shàng xún'' (上旬), ''zhōng xún'' (中旬), and ''xià xún'' (下旬) which mean roughly &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; week.

Markets in Japan followed the Chinese ''jun'' (旬) system; see [[Japanese calendar]].

====Egypt====
{{Main|Egyptian calendar}}
Ancient Egypt had a ten-day week, three weeks per month with five extra days at the end of the year.

====Revolutionary France====
In the [[French Republican Calendar]], each month consisted of three ten-day weeks, called ''décades''.

==Other calendar intervals==
===Aztecs===
[[Image:Aztec Sun Stone Replica cropped.jpg|thumb|Restored Aztec sun stone showing the 20 Days]]
{{Main|Tonalpohualli}}
The Aztecs divided a ritual cycle of 260 days, known as [[Tonalpohualli]], into 20 weeks of 13 days known as [[Trecena]].

The Aztecs divided a solar year of 365 days, [[Xiuhpohualli]], into 18 periods of 20 days and five nameless days known as ''Nemontemi''. Although some call this 20-day division or grouping a month, it has no relation to a [[lunation]] and therefore the word &quot;week&quot; is more appropriate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Maya===
{{Main|Tzolk'in| Maya calendar#Haab'}}
The Maya divided a 260-day ritual cycle known [[Tzolk'in]] into 20 weeks of 13 days known as [[Trecena]].

The Maya also divided the year, [[Haab']], into 18 periods of 20 days, ''Uinal'', and five nameless days known as ''Wayeb'''.

===Bali, Indonesia===
{{Main|Pawukon}}
The Pawukon is a 210-day calendar consisting of 10 different concurrent weeks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 days.
