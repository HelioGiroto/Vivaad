{{Christianity}}
'''Christian Science''' is a system of [[religion|religious]] thought and practice developed by [[Mary Baker Eddy]] based on her study of the [[Bible]] and explained in her work ''[[Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures]]''. In it, Eddy describes the teachings of Jesus as a complete and coherent divine science.&lt;ref name=S&amp;H /&gt;{{rp|275,473-474}}

Its adherents may be, but are not required to be, members of the main church, [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]], a branch church, or both. Its central texts are the Bible and ''Science and Health''.

The major teachings of Christian Science include the belief that spiritual [[reality]] is the only reality and all else is [[illusion]] or &quot;error.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;frost&quot;/&gt;  In contrast to conventional Christian theology, Christian Science rejects both the common [[Atonement in Christianity|Christian views of the atonement]] and the concept of [[Hell]] as a place of eternal punishment. 

Christian Scientists believe that sickness and disease are the result of [[fear]], [[ignorance]], or [[sin]], and should be healed through prayer or introspection. Combined with a belief that the use of medicine is incompatible with Christian Science healing methods, this has led to outbreaks of preventable disease and a number of deaths.&lt;ref name=Novo/&gt; Its claim that sickness can be healed through prayer rather than medicine, its rejection of science as illusory, and its attempts to present itself as science make Christian Science a [[pseudoscience]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;johnsearle&quot;&gt;John R. Searle (1986). ''Minds, Brains and Science'' (1984 Reith Lectures) Harvard University Press ISBN 0674576330&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
The theology of Christian Science follows the writings of its founder Mary Baker Eddy, with little change. The central texts of Christian Science are the Bible and ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures''.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost&quot;&gt;J. William Frost, &quot;Part V: Christianity and Culture in America,&quot; Christianity: A Social and Cultural History, 2nd Edition, (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1998), 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Science has been described as a form of philosophical [[idealism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Idealism&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Rescher| first =Nicholas| title =&quot;Idealism,&quot; in The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy| publisher =Cambridge University Press| year =1995| location =New York| page =356}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regarded the development of Christian Science as an important event that resulted from embracing continuous [[revelation|divine revelation]].&lt;ref name=Gott&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottschalk|first=Stephen|title=The emergence of Christian science in American religious life|year=1973|publisher=Univ. of Calif. P.|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520023080|edition=2nd pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} Christian Scientists do not view Jesus as having died for our sins.&lt;ref name=Walter&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Martin|title=The kingdom of the cults|year=1985|publisher=Bethany House Publishers|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=0871237962|edition=Rev. and expanded ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|146}}

Christian Science's focus on spiritual healing led to some measure of stir in the theological realm at first. During the religion's early days of rapid growth, the teachings were frequently attacked from the pulpit and press.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomlinson&quot;&gt;Rev. Irving C. Tomlinson. ''Twelve Years with Mary Baker Eddy'' (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kimball. &quot;Facts and Fictions about Christian Science.&quot; Lecture delivered April 8, 1898, from ''Lectures and Articles on Christian Science'' (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Science and Legislation.'' (1909) Chapter: Editorial Comments (a collection of quotes from magazines and newspapers around the US).&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Science's has an abstract, all-encompassing conception of God. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The core of Christian Science theology is the &quot;scientific statement of being&quot;.&lt;ref name=S&amp;H /&gt;{{rp|468}} Adherents of Christian Science believe that Genesis contains  two interleaved  stories of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], one spiritual, the other material &lt;ref name=S&amp;H /&gt;{{rp|501-557}} and hold that the reality of all that God made is spiritual, and not material. They see this reality as the only [[reality]] and all else as [[illusion]] or, in Christian Science parlance, &quot;error&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost&quot;/&gt; They believe that the recognition and understanding of the spiritual nature of reality allows for healing through [[prayer]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;H &gt;{{cite book| last =Eddy| first =Mary Baker| title =Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures| publisher =The Christian Science Board of Directors| date =1934 [1875]| location =United States of America| url = http://www.spirituality.com/dt/book_lookup.jhtml?reference=SH%2B1&amp;marks=false&amp;baseURL=book_lookup.jhtml|isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1-17}}

Christian Science theology is sometimes criticized by mainstream Christians {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} because of its assertion that [[evil]] and the material world are illusions, its definition of the &quot;Christ&quot;, its explanation of the Trinity, its de-emphasis on a personal God and its rejection of [[anthropomorphism]], its rejection of the teaching of everlasting damnation, and its view of Jesus as the &quot;Way-shower&quot; (see [[moral influence theory of atonement]]) rather than as one whose death per se provided for humanity's [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin. See chapter &quot;Atonement and Eucharist&quot; in ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures''.&lt;ref name=S&amp;H /&gt;{{rp|18–55}}

Evangelical theologian and writer [[Walter Ralston Martin]] believed that Christian Scientists were trained to ignore &quot;obnoxious literature&quot; about the natural world and to disconnect by not looking at evidence which may convince them that the world is not illusory.&lt;ref name=Walter /&gt;{{rp|292}} Martin also remarked on Eddy's lack of experience in relevant areas such as [[theology]] and [[The Bible and history|history in biblical times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Martin| first = Walter| coauthors = Jill Martin-Rische, Ravi Zacharias (Editor)| title = The Kingdom of the Cults| publisher = Bethany House Publishers|month=October | year=2003| pages = 149–192| url = http://www.waltermartin.org/science.html| isbn = 0-7642-2821-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine and science==
Christian Science is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]: ''[http://www.mukto-mona.com/new_site/mukto-mona/Articles/randi/science_pseudoscience.htm Commentary Science Pseudoscience: the Differences]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell]]: ''[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/christian_science_maneuvering/ Christian Science Maneuvering]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Derksen|first=A.A|journal=Journal for General Philosophy of Science / Zeitschrift für allgemeine|year=1993|volume=24|issue=1|pages=17–42|publisher=Springer|quote=&quot;Neither are typical pseudo-sciences like astrology, Bach-kabbalistics and Christian Science.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Science is opposed to science and uses the appearance of being a science to give itself extra legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Schrager&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrager|first=Cynthia D.|title=Both Sides of the Veil: Race, Science, and Mysticism in W.

Religions such as Christian Science, Science of Mind, and Scientology claim just that&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Eddy regarded Christian Science much like science, except she viewed its creation as a spiritual rather than a physical discovery, with herself as the divinely chosen discover.&lt;ref name=Gott /&gt;{{rp|28}}  Christian Science regards science as not important and an illusion, while the text by Eddy, ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures'' is promoted by the Church as &quot;a pioneer in the science of the mind body connection&quot;. Eddy viewed herself as similar to [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]].&lt;ref name=tseop&gt;{{cite book|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=The Skeptic encyclopedia of pseudoscience.|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576076539}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|317}} She believed that Christian Science healing is available to all people now as much as in biblical times.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost&quot; /&gt; Christian Scientists see themselves as practising a well-defined process with a proven track record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel-Spiritual Healing&quot;&gt;Robert Peel. &quot;Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age'' (1987) ISBN 978-0-06-066484-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Century of Christian Science Healing'' (1966) ISBN 978-0-87510-067-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Christian Scientists use prayer as their first choice for treatment over medical treatments such as drugs and surgery.&lt;ref name=SkepDict&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|title=The skeptic's dictionary : a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions|year=2003|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0-471-27242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|302}} They believe that healing only occurs through complete submission to God.&lt;ref name=SkepDict /&gt;{{rp|302}} In Christian Science it is not forbidden to seek medical attention, but they believe that those who do have turned their back on their beliefs. Eddy put this as &quot;if we trust matter, we distrust spirit&quot;.&lt;ref name=Pray4Cure /&gt;{{rp|75}} Exceptions described by Eddy include going to the dentist, fixing broken limbs, and basic surgical procedures.&lt;ref name=Pray4Cure /&gt;{{rp|75}} The official stance of the Church of Christ, Scientist is against diagnosing illness.&lt;ref name=Pray4Cure&gt;{{cite book|last=May|author=Peggy DesAutels, Margaret P. Battin, Larry|title=Praying for a cure : when medical and religious practices conflict|year=1999|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md|isbn=0847692620}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}} However, numerous claims of healings of near- and far-sightedness, dental problems and broken bones have been reported in the periodicals published by the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel1987&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peel| first = Robert E.| author-link = Robert Peel (Christian Science)| title = Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age| isbn = 0-06-066484-3| publisher = Harper and Row| year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy wrote that she learned the Christian Science method of healing as she recovered from an injury in 1866 after reading a Bible passage describing one of Jesus' healings. Eddy's healing principles relied on some of the concepts of [[Homeopathy|homoeopathy]].&lt;ref name=USHistory&gt;{{cite book|first=Ed. by Paul S. Boyer|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0195082095}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1862 Eddy was a student of the homoeopath and spiritualist [[Phineas Quimby]]&lt;ref name=tseop /&gt;{{rp|317}} after he helped her with a spinal problem. She believed that Quimby had cured her because &quot;the truth which he establishes in the patient cures him&quot;,&lt;ref name=LifeandHistory /&gt;{{rp|90}} From 1863 at the latest, Quimby referred to his theories as &quot;Science of Health and Happiness&quot;, &quot;Science of Christ&quot;, and &quot;Science&quot;&lt;ref name=LifeandHistory /&gt;{{rp|87}} and in &quot;Aristocracy and Democracy&quot; he referred to it as &quot;Christian Science&quot;.&lt;ref name=LifeandHistory /&gt;{{rp|87}} For several years she defended him publicly and regularly talked with him, and worked to perform healings based on his methods.&lt;ref name=Gott /&gt;{{rp|106}} Eventually, in 1872 she distinguished her methods by the name of Christian Science.&lt;ref name=Gott /&gt;{{rp|106}} Later, she stated that Quimby had not been a major influence&lt;ref name=Gott /&gt;{{rp|108}}&lt;ref name=LifeandHistory /&gt;{{rp|88}} and that Quimby healed by animal magnetism, something which she had denied earlier in her public writings.&lt;ref name=LifeandHistory&gt;{{cite book|last=Stouck|author=By Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine ; Introduction and afterword to the Bison book edition by David|title=The life of Mary Baker G.

===Increased Morbidity===
Epidemiological studies show higher mortality rates among Christian Scientists than those using conventional medicine, and there is a lack of non-[[anecdotal evidence]] for the efficacy of Christian Science.&lt;ref name='CDC longevity'&gt;{{cite journal| title = Comparative Mortality of Two College Groups, 1945–1983| journal = MMWR Weekly| date = August 23, 1991| first = W.

The Christian Science school's cohort had a higher overall mortality rate than the comparison cohort (though the dietary habits of Seventh-day Adventists may make them less susceptible to some diseases than the bulk of the population, possibly biasing that result).&lt;ref name='CDC longevity'/&gt;

Outbreaks of preventable diseases, for which there are known vaccines, can occur due to intentional non-vaccination. Outbreaks which stem from a refusal to vaccinate typically occur amongst those exempt from vaccination for religious reasons, such as Christian Science.&lt;ref name=Asser&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asser|first=Seth M.|coauthors=Rita Swan|title=Child fatalities from religion-motivated medical neglect|journal=Pediatrics (journal)|date=April 1998|volume=101|series=Part 1 of 2,|issue=4|pages=625 (5 pages)|accessdate=28 September 2012|publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|issn=00314005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sugerman|first=D.

In a 1998 analysis of 172 children who died from medical neglect because of the religious beliefs of their parents, 28 were from a Christian Science background.&lt;ref name=Asser/&gt;{{rp|626}}

===Health of children===
{{see also|Commonwealth v. Twitchell}}

With respect to children, two important rights are in apparent opposition: the rights of children to medical care and the rights of parents to make decisions about the well-being of their children. The position that constitutional protections of freedom of religion allow parents to choose the method of healing which best benefits their children contradicts court rulings which state that children cannot, on the basis of parental belief, be denied what is regarded as essential health care.&lt;ref&gt;See Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 US 158 (1944) and Jehovah's Witnesses v. Washington King County Hospital, 278 F Supp 488 (Washington DC 1967), affirmed per curiam 390 US 598 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;{{or|date=October 2012}} In a number of nationally publicized cases in the early 1990s, prosecutors charged parents belonging to the Christian Science church with [[murder]] or [[manslaughter]] after their children died of likely curable ailments without being medically treated. The best-known of these was the [[Twitchell Case]] in Massachusetts, in which parents David and Ginger Twitchell were convicted in 1990 of involuntary manslaughter in the death of their two-year-old son Robyn, who succumbed to a bowel obstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1990Aug06&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In the [[United States]], the constitutional guarantee of protection of religious practice from intrusion by government has been used by Christian Scientists and other religious groups to seek exemption from legal requirements regarding medical treatment of children in more than three-quarters of the states. There are statutes in 44 states which allow that children are not to be deemed neglected because they are receiving treatment by spiritual means according to the tenets of a recognized religion. While these exemptions take different forms and interpretations in different states, the effect has been to limit the ability to prosecute parents for medical neglect of children as a result of religious practice.&lt;ref name=sufferingchildren&gt;{{cite web| last = Fraser| first = Caroline| title = Suffering Children and the Christian Science Church| publisher = The Atlantic Monthly|date=1995-04| url = http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/xsci/suffer.htm| accessdate = 2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social views==
Christian Scientists generally defend the [[separation of church and state]] as affording a protection for civil freedom and religion. However, Eddy insisted on obedience by Christian Scientists to state laws in regard to health care. Progressive for her time, she was in favor of women's rights, and rejected the &quot;corporeal punishment&quot; of children.&lt;ref name=Misc&gt;Mary Baker Eddy, Miscellaneous Writings, in Prose Works other than Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Boston, Trustees Under the Will of Mary Baker G. Eddy, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} While she generally steered clear of politics per se, she stated her support of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]&lt;ref name=Misc/&gt;{{rp|282}} as well as her opposition to imperialism and economic monopoly.&lt;ref name=Misc/&gt;{{rp|129}} The ''[[The Christian Science Monitor|Christian Science Monitor]]'', which she founded, has traditionally been a staunch defender of [[civil liberties]] and individual freedom; nonetheless, it also supported the [[prohibition]] of alcohol.

There are no specific references to [[homosexuality]] in Eddy's writings. Her writings prescribe the living of a morally decent life, which is not an explicit condemnation of homosexuality, but it may account for some of the discomfort with homosexuality seen within some Christian Science communities. There is some dissent among Christian Scientists as to what exactly the position with regard to homosexuality ought to be. In this matter, as in others (such as [[abortion]]), the Church chooses not to have an official position, as it is considered that each individual Christian Scientist should seek their own highest sense of right through prayer.

==Church of Christ, Scientist==
{{Refimprove|date=October 2012}}
The Church of Christ, Scientist was founded in 1879 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], USA, by Eddy. The first building constructed as a Christian Science Church was erected in 1886 in [[Oconto, Wisconsin]] and still stands at the corner of Main Street and Chicago Street.&lt;ref name=LifeandHistory /&gt;{{rp|364}}&lt;ref&gt;Hall, George E. 2009.

''The Cross and the Crown, the History of Christian Science.'' New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce,&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|580-582}} The original edifice of the Mother Church was completed some years later on Saturday, December 29, 1894, just in time for the first service held there the following day.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt;{{rp|289}} Eddy was the author of the book ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]],'' the Christian Science textbook and which, along with the Bible, serve as the permanent &quot;impersonal pastor&quot; of the church. The church was founded &quot;to commemorate the word and works of [Christ Jesus]&quot; and &quot;reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing&quot;. Sunday services are held throughout the year and weekly testimony meetings are held on Wednesday evenings, where following brief readings from the Bible and the Christian Science textbook, those in attendance are invited to give testimonies of healing brought about through Christian Science prayer. Christian Science metaphysics teach that God is Spirit and cites the first chapter of Genesis as the true story of creation, where in the [[King James Bible]], &quot;man&quot; is both &quot;male and female&quot;, created &quot;in the image and likeness&quot; of God. The story of Adam and Eve is held to be an allegory. Healing on this basis is accomplished without material means and is the traditional bedrock of the church. In the early decades of the 20th century, churches sprang up in communities around the world, though in the last several decades of that century, there was a marked decline in membership, except in Africa, where there has been growth. Several controversies have rocked the church and remain unresolved, according to dissidents. Headquartered in Boston, the church has a worldwide membership of about 85,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/cr_sci.htm The Church Of Christ, Scientist (Christian Science)]&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Scientists are usually, though not always or necessarily, members of [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]] (also called The Mother Church) in [[Boston]], Massachusetts.

The Christian Science Board of Directors is a five-person executive entity created by Eddy to conduct the business of the Christian Science Church under the terms defined in the by-laws of the [[Church Manual]]. Its functions and restrictions are defined by the ''Manual''.

There are also Christian Science &quot;branch churches.&quot; Each Sunday, church members hold services where citations from the Bible and ''Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures'' by Eddy are read by lay members of the church. These Readers are voted into office by the members of the church for a limited period of time (usually for three years). Churches will most often hold mid-week public Testimony Meetings, a time in which anyone can testify to what they believe to be the healing power of the Christ in their lives. Christian Scientists do not regard human affiliation to a church organization as crucial to an individual's salvation. Each individual must follow his/her own path in such matters according to their light, and a person describing him/herself as a Christian Scientist may be a member of a branch church and/or of The First Church of Christ, Scientist (or sometimes of neither).

Some Christian Scientists, after class instruction, become Christian Science Practitioners and start public practices. Practitioners devote all of their time to healing, and normally charge for their services, but may not usually take legal action against patients for non-payment of fees.&lt;ref name=MMC&gt;{{cite book| last =Eddy| first =Mary Baker| title =Manual of the Mother Church| publisher =Trustees under the Will of Mary Baker G.

The church has at times been accused of attempting to silence dissenters&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stecklow, [http://articles.philly.com/1991-10-14/news/25813897_1_church-employees-church-records-christian-science-church/ &quot;Church's Media Moves At Issue A Burgeoning Network Sparks Dissent&quot;] ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' (October 14, 1991). Retrieved March 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; by methods such as delisting them as practitioners in the Christian Science Journal, or excommunicating them. Some dissenting groups continue to solicit support among current members of the church.{{Who|date=July 2008}}

===Practices===
Christian Scientists celebrate the sacraments of [[baptism]] and [[Eucharist]] in an entirely non-material way. &quot;Our baptism,&quot; wrote Eddy, &quot;is purification from all error...Our Eucharist is spiritual communion with the one God. Our bread, 'which cometh down from heaven,' is Truth. Our cup is the cross. Our wine the inspiration of Love, the draught the Master drank and commended to his followers&quot;. (''Science and Health,'' page 35) There are no rituals in the Christian Science church, but at the communion service, held twice a year, those in attendance are invited to kneel for silent prayer, followed by the audible repetition of the Lord's Prayer. The communion service is not held at The Mother Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 61, Article XVIII, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage is not a sacrament of the Christian Science church, but the church's by-laws require a legal, religious ceremony for marriage: &quot;If a Christian Scientist is to be married, the ceremony shall be performed by a clergyman who is legally authorized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 49, Article IX, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Scientists may take an intensive two-week &quot;Primary&quot; class from an authorized Christian Science teacher.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 92, Article XXX, Section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who wish to become &quot;Journal-listed&quot; (accredited) practitioners, devoting themselves full-time to the public practice of healing, must first have Primary class instruction. When they have a proven record of healing, they may submit their names for publication in the directory of practitioners and teachers in the ''Christian Science Journal.'' A practitioner who has been listed for at least three years' may apply for &quot;Normal&quot; class instruction, given just once every three years.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 89, Article XXIX, Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual,'' page 84, Article XXVi, Section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who receive a certificate are authorized to teach.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual, page 85, Article XXVI, Section 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Primary and Normal classes are based on the Bible and the writings of Mary Baker Eddy. The Primary class focuses on the chapter, &quot;Recapitulation&quot; in ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures''. This chapter uses the Socratic method of teaching and contains the &quot;Scientific Statement of Being&quot;. The &quot;Normal&quot; class focuses on the platform of Christian Science, contained on pages 330-340 of ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures|Science and Health]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Church Manual, page 86, Article XXVII, Section 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===

Churches worldwide hold a one-hour service each Sunday, consisting of hymns, prayer, and currently, readings from the ''[[King James Version]]'' (KJV) of the Bible (although there is no requirement that this version of the Bible be used) and ''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]''. These readings are the weekly Lesson-Sermon, which is read aloud at all Sunday services in all Christian Science churches worldwide, and is studied by individuals at home throughout the preceding week. The Lesson, as it is informally called, is compiled by a committee at The Mother Church, and is usually made up of six sections, each of which consists of passages from the Bible (read by the Second Reader) and passages from ''Science and Health'' (read by the First Reader).

Eddy selected 26 subjects for the Lesson-Sermon. These Lessons run in continuous rotation in the order she established, hence each subject is studied twice a year. In years in which there are 53 Sundays, the topic &quot;Christ Jesus&quot; occurs a third time, in December. In addition, there is a special, shortened Lesson-Sermon for Thanksgiving Day. Branch churches outside the United States may schedule their Thanksgiving service when convenient for them, most choosing a day in October or November, and the Thanksgiving Day proclamation by the United States president, may be omitted.

Because there are no clergy in the church, branch church Sunday services are conducted by two Readers: the First Reader, who reads passages from Science and Health, and the Second Reader, who reads passages from the Bible. First Readers determine the beginning &quot;scriptural selection&quot;, hymns to be sung on Sundays, and the benediction. The vast majority of the service is the reading of the weekly Bible lesson supplied by Boston, and the order of the service set out by the Manual. To be elected the First Reader in one's branch church is one of the highest and most important positions the lay Christian Scientist may aspire to.

Churches also hold a one-hour Wednesday evening testimony meeting, with similar readings, after which, those in attendance are invited to share accounts of healing through prayer. At these services, the First Reader reads passages from the Bible and Science and Health. Departing from denominational practice for over 120 years, English language churches may now choose alternate Bible translations at these services (i.e. [[Phillips New Testament in Modern English|Phillips]]).

Branch churches also sponsor annual public talks (called lectures) given by speakers selected annually by the Board of Lectureship in Boston.

===Broadcasting===
Beginning in the mid-1980s, church executives undertook a controversial and ambitious foray into electronic broadcast media. The first significant effort was to create a weekly half-hour syndicated television program, The Christian Science Monitor Reports. &quot;Monitor Reports&quot; was anchored in its first season by newspaper veteran Rob Nelson. He was replaced in the second by the ''Christian Science Monitor'''s former Moscow correspondent, David Willis. The program was usually broadcast by independent stations&amp;nbsp;— often at odd hours.

In 1988, Monitor Reports was supplanted by a nightly half-hour news show, World Monitor, which was broadcast by the [[Discovery Channel]]. The program was anchored by veteran journalist [[John Hart (journalist)|John Hart]]. The Church then purchased a Boston [[cable TV]] station for elaborate in-house programming production. In parallel, the church purchased a [[shortwave radio]] station and syndicated radio production to [[National Public Radio]]. However, revenues fell far short of optimistic predictions by church managers, who had ignored early warnings by members and media experts.

In October 1991, after a series of conflicts over the boundaries between Christian Science teachings and his journalistic independence, John Hart resigned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-09-02/features/1992246098_1_world-monitor-non-church-christian-science-church &quot;Ex-anchor cites interference at Monitor&quot;] ''The Baltimore Sun'' September 2, 1992. Accessed Feb. 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Monitor Channel went off the air in June 1992. Most of the other operations closed in well under a decade. Public accounts in both the mainstream and trade media reported that the church lost approximately $250 million on these ventures.

The hundreds of millions lost on broadcasting brought the church to the brink of bankruptcy. However, with the 1991 publication of ''[[The Destiny of The Mother Church]]'' by the late [[Bliss Knapp]], the church secured a $90 million bequest from the Knapp trust. The trust dictated that the book be published as &quot;Authorized Literature,&quot; with neither modification nor comment. Historically, the church had censured Knapp for deviating at several points from Eddy's teaching, and had refused to publish the work. The church's archivist, fired in anticipation of the book's publication, wrote to branch churches to inform them of the book's history. Many Christian Scientists thought the book violated the church's [[Manual of The Mother Church|by-laws]], and the editors of the church's religious periodicals and several other church employees resigned in protest. Alternate beneficiaries subsequently sued to contest the church's claim it had complied fully with the will's terms, and the church ultimately received only half of the original sum.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Steinfels. [http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/29/us/fiscal-and-spiritual-rifts-shake-christian-scientists.html?pagewanted=1 &quot;Fiscal and Spiritual Rifts Shake Christian Scientists&quot;] ''New York Times'' (February 29, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/93/931216Arc3005.html Press release] Stanford University. December 16, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The fallout of the broadcasting debacle also sparked a minor revolt among some prominent church members. In late 1993, a group of Christian Scientists filed suit against the Board of Directors, alleging a willful disregard for the [[Manual of The Mother Church|Manual of the Mother Church]] in its financial dealings. The suit was thrown out by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1997, but a lingering discontent with the church's financial matters persists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.appellate.net/briefs/weaverbrief.pdf | title = Appellate Brief No. SJC-07156 | accessdate = 2011-08-20 | format = pdf | publisher = COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership decline and financial setbacks===
In spite of its early meteoric rise, church membership has declined sharply over the past eight decades, according to the church's former treasurer, J. Edward Odegaard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian Science Journal'' November, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Church is prohibited by the [[Manual of The Mother Church|Manual]] from publishing membership figures, the number of branch churches in the United States has fallen steadily since World War II. Dr. Stephen Barrett has reported that since 1971, the number of practitioners and teachers in the United States listed in the Christian Science Journal has fallen from nearly 5,000 to just over 300 and the number of churches in the United States has fallen from about 1,800 to about 900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/cs.html Christian Science Statistics: Practitioners, Teachers, and Churches in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, for the first time in church history, more new members came from Africa than the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Christa Case Bryant, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2009/0609/p02s07-usgn.html &quot;Africa contributes biggest share of new members to Christian Science church&quot;] ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' (June 9, 2009).

==Christian Science Monitor, Journal and Sentinel==
[[File:2006 ChristianScienceMonitor building Boston 2594437787.jpg|350px|thumb|The entrance to the Christian Science Monitor offices.]]

[[The Christian Science Monitor]] is a well-respected newspaper run from the headquarters of the First Church of Christ, Scientist.  It was founded by Eddy under the slogan: &quot;To injure no man, but to bless all mankind&quot;.  At its maximum it had a circulation of 200,000, but this had contracted to 60,000 by 2005. Printed paper copies stopped in October 2008, where it was making a loss of $18.9 million, and it is now available online. It was not made with the goal of conversion to Christian Science, but for providing news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Linda K.|title=The Christian Science Monitor : an evolving experiment in journalism|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780313379949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Science church publishes a weekly periodical called the Christian Science Sentinel, a monthly publication called the Christian Science Journal, a non-English publication called The Herald of Christian Science. A project is currently under way to make all back issues of the Christian Science publications (Journal, Sentinel and Herald) available on-line.&lt;ref&gt;Sparkman, John, &quot;JSH-Online Progress&quot;, The Christian Science Journal, February 2012, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Christian Science Journal]]'' and the ''[[Christian Science Sentinel]]'' include comments from individuals claiming to have had been healed through the use of Christian Science prayer.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen Barrett, M.D.|title=Some Thoughts about Faith Healing|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/dantest/faith.html|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testimonies of healings reported in Christian Science publications are sometimes drawn from cases in which a doctor confirmed the initial condition and the subsequent healing, according to the testifier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel1987&quot; /&gt; Typically these testimonies, which generally include nothing but a vague description, do not have doctors making the initial diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt; The verification process requires the contact information for three people (one a member of &quot;The Mother Church&quot;) who &quot;have either witnessed the healing or can vouch for its accuracy based on their knowledge of [the testifier],&quot;&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt; according to the Christian Science Publishing Society website.&lt;ref name=&quot;testimony verification&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spirituality.com/sentinel/testimony-guidelines.jhtml |title=Testimony Guidelines|author=Christian Science Sentinel|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the Boston Globe reported that the church was considering consolidating Boston operations into fewer buildings and leasing out space in buildings it owned. Church official Philip G. Davis noted that the administration and Colonnade buildings had not been fully used for many years and that vacancy increased after staff reductions in 2004. The church posted an $8 million financial loss in fiscal 2003, and in 2004 cut 125 jobs, a quarter of the staff, at the ''Christian Science Monitor''.  Conversely, Davis said that &quot;the financial situation right now is excellent&quot; and stated that the church was not facing financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Globe'' October 13, 2005 p. A1&lt;/ref&gt;
