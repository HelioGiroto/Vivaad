== Badi Calendar as a product==
I know we are not to put up commercial products, but the fist ever Badi Calendar (www.kdkfactory.com/badi) is being published and sold, so I think it has some historical relevancy.

== Dates contradiction ==

Someone has pointed out to me an apparent contradiction in this article.  It states, &quot;Years in the Bahá'í calendar begin at the vernal equinox (usually March 21 in the Gregorian calendar).&quot;  However, definite Gregorian dates are given throughout the article, suggesting that dates do not vary between the two calendars.  If the quoted statement is true, then the Gregorian dates can only be approximate, in which case the article should say so.

I have also been told that dates are calculated using different reference locations, such as Teheran or Haifa, and sometimes from the Gregorian calendar, i.e. the new year always starts on March 21.  Thus, different people are apparently using different dates on the Bahá'í calendar.  Perhaps someone who knows about the Bahá'í calendar could clarify this. -- [[User:Nike|Nike]] 05:34, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:My understanding is that the calendar was &quot;set&quot; to Gregorian dates some time after it was originally envisioned (mid-19th century). As such, the exact dates as on the article are correct and fixed (in the eyes of a modern Baha'i). I'm not sure enough to edit the article though, but I'll see if I can find out. -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 09:53, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::''`Abdu'l-Baha explained the significance of Naw-Ruz in terms of the symbolism of the new life of spring. Baha'u'llah defines Naw-Ruz as the Baha'i day on which the vernal equinox occurs. Thus, even if the equinox should occur just before sunset, that day -- which in the Baha'i calendar began at the moment of sunset on the previous day -- is Naw-Ruz. At present, however, Naw-Ruz is fixed as 21 March for Baha'is in all countries outside the Middle East, regardless of exactly when the equinox occurs.'' - From Baha'i Encyclopaedia Article by John Walbridge [[User:Rboatright|Rick Boatright]] 14:05, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Spellings ==

Can we fix the spellings? I don't actually mind whether its Rahmah or Rahmat, but people persistently changing it etc... I don't mind what spelling it adopted just so we can fix a more permanent one -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 09:36, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:The spellings, since this is a page on the &quot;Bahá'í calendar&quot;, should reflect the standardized Bahá'í usage.  Although there is some variance in how different systems transliterate the original Arabic forms, the current Bahá'í system uses the “t” to transcribe the Arabic &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&amp;#65171;&lt;/font&gt; (''&quot;t&amp;#257;&amp;#700; marb&amp;#363;&amp;#7789;a&quot;''), the final letter in most of the words whose spelling is under discussion.  Though its shape is like that of the Arabic &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&amp;#65257;&lt;/font&gt; (''&quot;h&amp;#257;&amp;#700;&quot;'', i.e. h), it is actually a different orthographical shape for the &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&amp;#65173;&lt;/font&gt; (''&quot;t&amp;#257;&amp;#700;&quot;'', i.e. t), as indicated by the diacritc double-dot.  There is little use in someone who wants to read about the Bahá'í calendar outside the Wikipedia going and running a search for &quot;Rahmah&quot;, as all authoritative sources use the standardized Bahá'í system of transliteration.  Googling &quot;Bahá'í calendar Rahmah&quot; returns only 16 hits, most of which are simply mirrors of the Wikipedia article, whereas the same search for &quot;Bahá'í calendar Rahmat&quot; yields 634 returns.  There is a clear utility in maintaining a consistent spelling schema that is in line with the Bahá'í standard.  I'll go ahead and change the spellings to their norms.  Anyone wanting to alter them again, please discuss it here first.

== Specific references and quotations ==

Could someone who knows please list some specific references which cover this material in more detail?  [[User:Forteanajones|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:Forteanajones|FJ]] | [[User talk:Forteanajones|&lt;FONT COLOR=#808080&gt;hello&lt;/FONT&gt;]] 20:42, May 22, 2005 (UTC)

== Name of Bahá'í solar calendar system ==

Does the ''Badi`'' name refer specifically to the 360-day solar calendar?  This should be clarified.  In fact I would prefer to list all three systems right up front, since clearly they are all important.  Are these three the ''only'' Bahá'í calendar systems? [[User:Forteanajones|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:Forteanajones|FJ]] | [[User talk:Forteanajones|&lt;FONT COLOR=#808080&gt;hello&lt;/FONT&gt;]] 20:55, May 22, 2005 (UTC)

:I only know of these three calendars for Baha'is. Another may be used by [[Bayani]]s (or Azalis). Apart from that , I think its unlikely there are any others (because who else would make one? unless someone had a draft version), but I don't know for sure.
:First off, all three calendars listed below are Badi' calendars, but the last two are the ones followed by Baha'is (known as the two Baha'i calendars). As you will see they're almost identical:
:1. The original Badi calendar first started by the Bab
::I don't know much about this and I think thats true for most Baha'is. I've never seen anything specifically written about it. I believe it was based around the lunar calendar that islam uses.
:2. Confirmed by Baha'u'llah, but revamped somehow (and is definitely fixed to the solar calendar)
::Best resource for this is the Kitab-i-Aqdas. 
:3. Calendar fixed to the gregorian calendar
:Not sure when this happened. It's almost identical to the Aqdas's version except it fixes new year to 21st March rather than the Vernal equinox (20th, 21st, or 22nd of March - most commonly the 21st though).

:From re-reading the Aqdas it appears the original calendar was a little vague about where the intercalary days were so Baha'u'llah offered a solution.
:Anyway, I feel its not appropriate to put up calendar 2 as basically, every day you see on the article is +/- 1 day -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 22:54, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::Anyway, I've tried to clarify it a bit in the text... knowing my luck I've only made it worse... -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 23:06, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:Just done a bit more research and it happens that the calendar might have actually been named after [[Badí']], a famous martyr. That would have been only a year before Baha'u'llah made the calendar, so not relevant for the Bab's calendar. Not sure enough about it yet though -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 23:42, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

== Month days ==

Is it true that Bahá'ís place some significance on the day of the month that has the same number as the month in the year, e.g. 4 Azamat (20 May), the fourth day of the fourth month? --[[User:Garzo|Gareth Hughes]] 5 July 2005 17:04 (UTC)

:Well I never have (and I presume this is the same for all modern Baha'is). Early Baha'is and Babis were rather mystical so they may have in the past, but couldn't say. -- [[User:Tomhab|Tomhab]] 5 July 2005 18:03 (UTC)

:I have also never heard of such a significance being put on the day of the month that has the same number as the day of the year.  -- [[User:Jeff3000|Jeff3000]] July 6, 2005 01:07 (UTC)

Probably a archaic tradition from the early days of the faith.  [[User:Zazaban|Zazaban]] 22:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

== Revert re. spellings ==

I just reverted the page to align it again with the established standard Bahá'í calendar spellings (months of the year, days of the week, holy days, etc.).  Again, anyone wanting to change the spellings, please discuss it here first.  Misinformation, intentional or not, gets us nowhere.

== Arabic Script ==

Can someone ammend the tables to include the Arabic names in the Arabic script? I would do it but I'm afraid I would make a mistake because I've only taken ARB101, and I'm a little unfamiliar with the wiki text protocol for Arabic. I could figure that part out and do it if someone could point out to me a reference where the names are written in Arabic script. Thanks. [[User:LambaJan|LambaJan]]

I learned today that the Arabic lettering is backwards on the calendar. I'm don't know Arabic myself, but my Arabic friend showed me the letters on the calendar written left to right as English is, not right to left as Arabic is.  As he reading the Arabic it wasn't coming out Nur, for example, but run.  Maybe someone could fix that.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:164.231.65.28|164.231.65.28]] ([[User talk:164.231.65.28|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/164.231.65.28|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- [Template:Unsigned] --&gt;

:Well, I checked, but everything shows up correctly (Arabic runs right to left).  All I can think is that you and/or your friend may be using browsers that don't support right-to-left text encoding.  [[User:Keldan|Keldan]] 17:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

== B.B.E.? ==

I know that the Badí' equivalent of A.D. is B.E., but what's the equivalent of B.C.?  I seem to remember encountering B.B.E. (Before the Bahá'í Era) before, but I'm not at all sure. [[User:WikiMarshall|WikiMarshall]] 18:23, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
:I have never seen the B.B.E. used in any Baha'i literature (and I have not seen anything else that would be equivalent to a BBE).  Usually the Islamic (AH) or the Gregorian (AD) is used to represent dates beforehand.  Since BE is usually just used for intra-Baha'i communication, and is usally always used in addition to the Gregorian date, I don't know if there is much use for the BBE equivalent.  But, BBE is an interesting idea; please do post if you've seen it used anywhere. -- [[User:Jeff3000|Jeff3000]] 22:23, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:::Actually, it's a practice I'd like to not see develop. It implies that all time is measured, both forwards and backwards, from a given date.

-----     -----
One interesting thing, quite difficult to understand, is that the badi calendar don't have a year 0 (zero). Christian calendars don't have it because the monks who worked with the first calendar didn't understand the concept. But the badi calendar is new, and the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh lived in a part of the world where the concept 0 (zero) was understand and explained much earlier than in Christian countries.  Nevertheless 1843 is the year 1 B.E.E. and 1844 is the year 1 B.E.  (I have seen the years B.E.E. used in Bahá'í papers about the Shaykhis).

== Conflict with previous Scripture ==

Given the huge importance of the rites associated with Muslim calendar, and the fact that the founders of the Baha'i Faith claim to be the promised ones of the Abrahamic Religions, the discrepancy between the long extant 12 month division of the Year (solar or lunar) and the innovation of the 19th century claimant is a rather glaring one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''The number of months with ALLAH is twelve months by ALLAH's ordinance since the day when HE created the heavens and the earth'''. Of these four are sacred. '''That is the Right Religion So wrong not yourselves therein!''' And fight the idolaters all together; and know that ALLAH is with those who fear HIM. 9:35
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(The above is being deleted by another editor of this topic.  The link on the top right hand clearly claims &quot;ISLAMIC&quot; in its association.  Why are you preventing this clearly relevant citation to be removed from this page?

::The Islamic calendar was abrogated in the Baha'i faith in favor of the Badi calendar, just as the Christian calendar was abrogated in Islam in favor of the Islamic calendar.

To put the same point in another way, the introduction of a 19-month year marks an important break with Islam, particularly considering the quote from the [[Quran]] provided above (thanks for that btw). I suggest this is relevant to this article and could be included - perhaps along the lines of the way it's included in the article [[Ayyam-i-Ha]]:

[[User:AndrewRT|AndrewRT]]([[User talk:AndrewRT|Talk]]) 23:34, 8 June 2008 (UTC)

There are several issues in this discussion page that I'd like to address:

First, the Baha'i Calendar is not simply a solar calendar.  It is BOTH solar and lunar.  A study of the revisions made by Baha'u'llah will reveal that some Baha'i Holy Days are fixed to solar dates while others are fixed to Islamic lunar dates.  Therefore, it is necessary to track both lunar and solar dates to celebrate them.  In general, dates related to the Bab are celebrated according to the lunar date while dates relating to Baha'u'llah are celebrated according to the solar date.  The Twin Birthdays of the Bab and Baha'u'llah (Muharram 1 and 2) are clearly to be celebrated in the future according to the lunar dates. There are 12 lunar months and 19 solar sunths (&quot;months according to the Bayan&quot;), with 5 days remaining (called Ayyam-I-Ha).  Every 19 years, or a Vahid, the solar and lunar calendars realign with respect to each other to where they were in 1844 when the Bab announced His mission.  I could quote the Quranic verses about the 19 guardian angels, but I will refrain.  I will simply say that, in my opinion, there is no conflict with any prior religion here...not even an abrogation.  I'd say it is an improvement, since most religious calendars are lunar and the Islamic calendar is the most accurate lunar calendar around...except for some odd requirements that Baha'u'llah eliminates.

Second, the Baha'i calendar was called the Badi' calendar by the Bab.

Third, The lunar portion of the Baha'i calendar is the same as the Islamic lunar calendar.  There is a small difference, however, in that Baha'u'llah permits the use of calculation and devices to determine time, particularly in extreme northern and southern latitudes where the length of the day varies enormously.  Therefore, it is not required that someone use their bare eyes to spot the crescent moon before a month can begin.  You can calculate the date of the new moon and figure out when the crescent is visible or even use telescopes to do so.

Fourth.  The sun does enter the constellation of Aries in April, astronomically.  However, Abdul-Baha made it clear that this phrase was meant in the astrological sense to refer to the Vernal Equinox, which currently occurs near March 21. So, the Vernal Equinox marks the Naw Ruz Festival and the start of the year in the Badi' Calendar.

Fifth.  In modern times, due to lack of familiarity with the calendar and certain details that need to be determined by the Universal House of Justice -- such as the prime meridian location, the measurement locations for sunrise and sunset, etc.-- the solar dates on the Baha'i calendar have been fixed to the Gregorian calendar dates making March 21 always the first day of the Baha'i solar year.  For now, this makes the length of Ayyam-I-Ha change every Gregorian leap year and Baha'i dates the same every Gregorian year.

Sixth.  Eventually, however, the Naw Ruz Festival will be determined by sunset and the timing of the Vernal Equinox at a location determined by the Universal House of Justice.  This will adjust the length of Ayyam-I-Ha and shift the last sunth of Loftiness accordingly.

Finally.  The Baha'i day only overlaps the Gregorian day from midnight to sunset.  The Baha'i day actually goes from sunset to sunset, instead of midnight to midnight.  The Baha'i week begins with Saturday (called Glory) and ends with Friday (called Independence).  Saturday (or Saturn) which according to the planetary week is the slowest moving celestial body, begins the week.  Friday (or Venus) which has always represented love and is the fastest moving celestial body, is the seventh day.

I hope this answers many of the questions raised here. [[User:Jkhalilprince|Jkhalilprince]] ([[User talk:Jkhalilprince|talk]]) 19:49, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
: Interesting, but for inclusion in the article would require citations for such details. But thanks for adding to the discussion. [[User:Smkolins|Smkolins]] ([[User talk:Smkolins|talk]]) 04:25, 25 March 2009 (UTC)

I didn't intend for any changes to be made to the article, just to add to the discussion.  But, I would like people to be able to verify any information they wish to look into.

Regarding the solar/lunar aspect of the Baha'i calendar.  Refer to paragraph 110 of the Aqdas, where Baha'u'llah speaks of &quot;...the two other Festivals that fall on the twin days...&quot; when referring to the Twin Birthdays of Muharram 1 and 2.  Also, refer to the non-authoritative pilgrim notes of Ruhiyyih Khanum (Volume 2) where the Guardian comments that Baha'u'llah says these days should be consecutive.(&quot;These two days are accounted as one in sight of God.&quot; Q2, Kitab-i-Aqdas) Furthermore, these dates are currently celebrated according to the Islamic lunar calendar in the Middle East. (See &quot;A Concise Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith&quot;, by Peter Smith under &quot;Holy Days&quot;)  One can also see in the Question and Answer section of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, that in Question 1, Baha'u'llah fixes the date of Ridzwan to the Babi' solar date and then in Question 2, Baha'u'llah fixes the date of the Twin Birthdays to Muharram 1 and 2.  Thereby, utilizing both solar and lunar dates within moments of each other. --And don't forget the Metonic cycle of the Vahids.

Regarding the name &quot;Badi',&quot;  you can refer to the same encyclopedia under &quot;Calendar.&quot;

Regarding the use of calculation and instruments, Baha'u'llah says, &quot;In regions where the days and nights grow long, let times of prayer be gauged by clocks and other instruments that mark the passage of the hours.&quot;  Kitab-i-Aqdas, para. 10  There's also more about this in the Q&amp;A.

Regarding the Islamic lunar calendar and the Baha'i lunar calendar being the same.  I will not go into all the quotes necessary.  However, initially, the Bab changed the Islamic year by starting the lunar calendar from the date of Muhammed's initial declaration in Medina, prior to the Hijra.  Because of this, I believe, religious calendars should begin at the moment and spot of the Manifestation's declaration.--Baha'u'llah, though, does not adopt the Bab's practice of backdating the Islamic lunar calendar.  He uses the Islamic year without any alteration. 

Regarding the timing of Naw Ruz.  Shoghi Effendi quotes Abdul Baha in God Passes By page 99, as comparing the Bab's revelation to the sun in &quot;the sign of Aries--which the sun enters at the Vernal Equinox.&quot;  

The fixing of the dates to the Gregorian calendar is a decision made by Baha'i communities worldwide based on their circumstances.  That's why in the Middle East lunar dates are used rather than Gregorian.  Until the Universal House of Justice makes a determination about the details, many of these things are flexible and up to the communities to decide.

If you're interested in why the sun isn't in the constellation of Aries anymore at the Vernal Equinox, it's because of the precession of the equinoxes.  From the earth's perspective, the sun will move through all the signs of the zodiac in 26,000 years. Projecting forward, using a Baha'i framework, you can predict that there will be one Manifestation roughly every 3 Kull-I-Shays (3 x 361 years).  That means 24 Manifestations per precession.  Shoghi Effendi has said that the Baha'i Cycle, starting from Adam 6000 years ago, will last 500,000 years.  That works out to about 19 precessions. [I'm just musing here, but it's as if the 24 hour day and 19 day sunth is repeated cosmically.  There are no references to provide for this precession part.  But, you can do your own calculations.]

I'd just like to point out that the Islamic lunar calendar is the most accurate because it is based on observation of the moon and not on calendrical charts and calculations.  Similarly, the 19 sunths of the Baha'i calendar are determined by observation of the sun and not simply calculation. &quot;The Festival of Naw Ruz falleth on the day that the sun entereth the sign of Aries, even should this occur no more than one minute before sunset.&quot;  Kitab-I-Aqdas, Q35. This makes the Baha'i calendar, once fully instituted, the most accurate around--both as a solar and lunar calendar.

And since I am making all these other citations, I might as well provide the one I mentioned before from the Quran.  &quot;Then he turned back and was haughty; Then said he: 'This is nothing but magic, derived from of old.  This is nothing but the word of a mortal!'  Soon will I cast him into Hell-Fire!...Over it are Nineteen. And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire: and We have fixed their number only as a trial for Unbelievers...&quot;  74:23-31  [[User:Jkhalilprince|Jkhalilprince]] ([[User talk:Jkhalilprince|talk]]) 10:19, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

== Inheritance from the Iranian calendar ==

First of all, Baha'u'llah did not make Naw Ruz the New Year. Naw Ruz has been the new year for Iranian peoples for millennia (and I don't just mean Persians).

Second and third, the &quot;Badi Calendar&quot;, though distinct for abandoning natural lunar cycles (the ~12:1 lunar:solar ratio), inherits the ideas of feast days and intercalary days from the old Iranian Calendar.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Kaweah|Kaweah]] ([[User talk:Kaweah|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kaweah|contribs]]) 01:04, 1 October 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I should also mention that the Baha'i calendar, as stipulated by Baha'u'llah (according to notes to the Kitab-i-Aqdas, begins when the sun passes through Aries (not at the first 12-hour day), which, due to precession, no longer happens at the vernal equinox.

The ''History'' section still credits Baha'u'llah with placing Naw Ruz on the Vernal Equinox, which he never did. The 2nd source cited parenthetically implies that he did, but that source is in error. Rather, Baha'u'llah placed Naw Ruz at the point that the Sun enters the constellation Aries, which does not occur near the Vernal Equinox. Naw Ruz does at present occur near the Equinox, but only because the Baha'i calendar no longer follows the astrological formula specified by Baha'u'llah.

:In [http://www.theaqdas.org/notes.php#26 Note 26] of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas it is stated:
::&quot;The Báb introduced a new calendar, known now as the Badí' or Bahá'í calendar (see notes 27 and 147). According to this calendar, a day is the period from sunset to sunset. In the Bayán, the Báb ordained the month of 'Alá' to be the month of fasting, decreed that the day of Naw-Rúz should mark the termination of that period, and designated Naw-Rúz as the Day of God. Bahá'u'lláh confirms the Badí' calendar wherein Naw-Rúz is designated as a feast. 
::Naw-Rúz is the first day of the new year. It coincides with the spring equinox in the northern hemisphere, which usually occurs on 21 March. Bahá'u'lláh explains that this feast day is to be celebrated on whatever day the sun passes into the constellation of Aries (i.e. the vernal equinox), even should this occur one minute before sunset (Q&amp;A 35). Hence Naw-Rúz could fall on 20, 21, or 22 March, depending on the time of the equinox.
::Bahá'u'lláh has left the details of many laws to be filled in by the Universal House of Justice. Among these are a number of matters affecting the Bahá'í calendar. The Guardian has stated that the implementation, worldwide, of the law concerning the timing of Naw-Rúz will require the choice of a particular spot on earth which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the time of the spring equinox. He also indicated that the choice of this spot has been left to the decision of the Universal House of Justice.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Even though the vernal equinox occurs at this time with the sun in Pisces, astronomers still call the position at which the sun crosses the celestial equator &quot;the first point of Aries&quot;, and the symbol for the intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator at the beginning of spring is the sign, ♈, the symbol for Aries. - [[User:Parsa|Parsa]] ([[User talk:Parsa|talk]]) 17:32, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

== What event?  ==

What event in AD 1844 made the Bahai calendar start that year? I shall clarify what I mean with some examples. ''Anno Domini'' (Christianity) started when it did due to the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ, ''Anno Hegirae'' (Islam) due to when Muhammad fled Mecca for Medina, ''Anno Mundi'' (Judaism) due to an alleged date of Creation, ''Anno Lucis'' ([[Freemasonry|Masonic]] secular calendar) due to another alleged date of Creation contradicting that of ''Anno Mundi'', and ''Ab Urbe Condita'' (Ancient Roman secular calendar) due to the founding of the City of Rome. 

What analog to these happened with the Bahai so that this calendar started when it did? I see no mention of the starting event of this calendar in the Article. [[User:The Mysterious El Willstro|The Mysterious El Willstro]] ([[User talk:The Mysterious El Willstro|talk]]) 07:22, 27 July 2010 (UTC)
:The [[Báb#Declaration_to_Mull.C3.A1_Husayn|Declaration of the Báb]] on evening of May 22rd, 1844 (which Baha'is count as part of May 23rd), was the initiating event and completing the annular cycle meant back-dating the year to March 20th. Also cf the [[Great Disappointment]]. The calendar itself wasn't defined until a few years later but it was &quot;rolled back&quot; to start back then. [[User:Smkolins|Smkolins]] ([[User talk:Smkolins|talk]]) 10:37, 27 July 2010 (UTC)
::In that case, there should be a link to the Article to which you directed me in this Article on the Bahai calendar. Perhaps such a link could be part of a New Section on the Declaration of the Bab as the starting event.

== Names of days within the month ==

I believe the 19 days within a month bear the same names as the months themselves. Does anyone have a source on this? There would therefore be alternate ways to list a date. Thus Sunday, 1st  of August, 2010 could be Jamál, 1 Kamál, 167 or Jamál, Bahá Kamál, 167... not to mention using the year within the Vahid as an alternate to the numbered year (167). - [[User:Parsa|Parsa]] ([[User talk:Parsa|talk]]) 19:26, 1 August 2010 (UTC)
