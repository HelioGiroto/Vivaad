'''Aztec mythology''' is the body or collection of myths of [[Aztec]] civilization of Central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, p. 8; &quot;myth&quot;, ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztecs were [[Nahuatl]] speaking groups living in central Mexico and much of their mythology is similar to that of other [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures.  According to legend, the various groups who were to become the Aztecs arrived from the north into the [[Valley of Mexico|Anahuac valley]] around [[Lake Texcoco]]. The location of this valley and lake of destination is clear &amp;ndash; it is the heart of modern [[Mexico City]] &amp;ndash;  but little can be known with certainty about the origin of the Aztec. There are different accounts of their origin. In the myth the ancestors of the Mexica/Aztec came from a place in the north called [[Aztlan]], the last of seven ''nahuatlacas'' (Nahuatl-speaking tribes, from ''tlaca'', &quot;man&quot;) to make the journey southward, hence their name &quot;Azteca.&quot; Other accounts cite their origin in [[Chicomostoc]], &quot;the place of the seven caves,&quot; or at [[Tamoanchan]] (the legendary origin of all civilizations).

The Mexica/Aztec were said to be guided by their god [[Huitzilopochtli]], meaning &quot;Left-handed [[Hummingbird]]&quot; or &quot;Hummingbird from the South.&quot; When they arrived at an island in the lake, they saw an [[eagle]] which was perched on a [[nopal]] cactus full of its fruits (''nochtli''). (Due to a mistranslation of an account by [[Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc|Tesozomoc]], it became popular to say the eagle was devouring a snake, but in the original Aztec accounts, the snake is not mentioned. One states that it was eating a bird, another indicates that it was only perched in the cactus, and a third just says it was eating something.) This vision fulfilled a prophecy telling them that they should found their new home on that spot. The Aztecs built their city of [[Tenochtitlan]] on that site, building a great [[artificial island]], which today is in the center of [[Mexico City]]. This legendary vision is pictured on the [[Coat of Arms of Mexico]].

== Creation myth ==
[[File:Codex Borgia page 50.jpg|thumb|[[Huitzilopochtli]] is raising up the skies of the [[South]], one of the four directions of the world, surrounded by their respective trees, temples, patterns and divination symbols.]]
According to legend, when the Mexicans arrived in the Anahuac valley around [[Lake Texcoco]], they were considered by the other groups as the least civilized of all, but the Mexican/Aztec decided to learn, and they took all they could from other people, especially from the ancient [[Toltec]] (whom they seem to have partially confused with the more ancient civilization of  [[Teotihuacan]]). To the Aztec, the Toltec were the originators of all culture; &quot;Toltecayotl&quot; was a synonym for culture. Aztec legends identify the Toltecs and the cult of [[Quetzalcoatl]] with the legendary city of [[Tollan]], which they also identified with the more ancient Teotihuacan.

Because the Aztec adopted and combined several traditions with their own earlier traditions, they had several [[creation myth]]s. One of these, the [[Five Suns]] describes four great ages preceding the present world, each of which ended in a catastrophe, and &quot;were named in function of the force or divine element that violently put an end to each one of them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portilla|first=Miguel León|title=Native Mesoamerican Spirituality: Ancient Myths, Discourses, Stories, Hymns, Poems, from the Aztec,Yucatec, Quiche-Maya, and other sacred traditions|year=1980|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-8091-2231-6|pages=40|url=http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=hTH1jEM2uokC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coatlicue]] was the mother of [[Centzon Huitznahua]] (&quot;Four Hundred Southerners&quot;), her sons, and [[Coyolxauhqui]], her daughter. She found a ball filled with feathers and placed it in her waistband, becoming pregnant with [[Huitzilpochtli]]. Her other children became suspicious as to the identity of the father and vowed to kill their mother. She gave birth on Mount Coatepec, pursued by her children, but the newborn Huitzilpochtli defeated most of his brothers, who became the stars. He also killed his half-sister [[Coyolxauhqui]] by tearing out her heart using a [[Xiuhcoatl]] (a blue snake) and throwing her body down the mountain. This was said to inspire the Aztecs to rip the hearts out of their victims and throw their bodies down the sides of the temple dedicated to Huitzilpochtli, who represents the sun chasing away the stars at dawn.

Our age (''Nahui-Ollin''), the [[Fifth World (Native American mythology)|fifth age]], or fifth creation, began in the ancient city of Teotihuacan. According to the myth, all the gods had gathered to self-sacrifice themselves and create a new age. Although the world and the sun had already been created, it would only be through their sacrifice that the sun would be set into motion and time as well as history could begin. The handsomest and strongest of the gods, [[Tecuciztecatl]], was supposed to sacrifice himself but when it came time to self-immolate, he could not jump into the fire. Instead, [[Nanauatzin|Nanahuatl]] the smallest and humblest of the gods, who was also covered in boils, sacrificed himself first and jumped into the flames. The sun was set into motion with his sacrifice and time began. Humiliated by Nanahuatl's sacrifice, Tecuciztecatl too leaped into the fire and became the moon &lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E. &quot;The Aztecs&quot;. Blackwell Publishers, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Cosmology ==
[[Aztec Mythology|In the beginning]] there was [[Ometeotl]], (known [[Ometeotl|Ilhuicateotl]] « Sky god », [[Ometeotl|Moyocoyan]] « Whom invented himself and created himself », [[Ometeotl|Tloque Nahuaque]] « Mighty », [[Ometeotl|Ipalnemohuani]] « Surrounding »), god of the duality, who divided himself in to two primordial beings [[Ometecuhtli]] (the male essence of the creator) and [[Omecihuatl]] (the female essence of the creator).&lt;ref name=&quot;Otilia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=El Mundo Mágico de los Dioses del Anáhuac|editor=Editorial Universo México|authorlink=Otilia Meza|language=Spanish|year=1981|location=México|page=23|isbn=968-35-0093-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aztec gods and goddess were mainly taken from the sources of [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]], [[Alfredo Chavero]], [[Francisco del Paso y Troncoso]], [[Manuel Orozco y Berra]] and [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], where depending on the source the suffixes of the Aztec names are exchanged &quot;Lli&quot;, &quot;Li&quot;, &quot;Tl&quot;, &quot;Tli&quot;, &quot;Tlli&quot; as occasionally the initials of the Aztec names are changed &quot;Ch&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Qu&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;.

#Also recognized as [[Camaxtle]].
#[[Quetzalcoatl]] was also related to gods of the wind, of [[Venus]], of the dawn, of merchants and of arts, crafts and knowledge. He was also the patron god of the Aztec priesthood, of learning and knowledge, patron of priests, the inventor of the calendar and of books, and the protector of goldsmiths and other craftsmen. As the morning and evening star, Quetzalcoatl was the symbol of death and resurrection. A feathered serpent deity has been worshipped by many different ethno-political groups in [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican history]].
#[[Huitzilopochtli]] was also a tribal god of the Mexica. He became a primary god of the triple alliance lead by the Mexica, [[Huitzilopochtli]] at the same level as [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Tezcatlipoca]]. Huitzilopochtli is presented as the deity who guided the long migration the Aztecs undertook from [[Aztlan]], their traditional home, to the [[Valley of Mexico]].

* [[Cipactli]], a primeval sea monster, part crocodile, part fish and part toad, of indefinite gender. Always hungry, every joint on its body was adorned with an extra mouth.
