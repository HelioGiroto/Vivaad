== Bill Nye ==

An editor has added a sentence to the lead relating some recent comments from Bill Nye to ID.  I have moved this information to the &quot;[[Intelligent design#Reaction from the scientific community|Reaction from the scientific community]]&quot; section, where it seems more appropriate.  I don't know if this information really needs to be in the article at all though: other than Nye's TV fame, we already elucidate the fact that ID is rejected by most scientists/scientific organizations.  If someone else feels the same, feel free to remove this new material.  -- [[User:MisterDub|MisterDub]] ([[User talk:MisterDub|talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/MisterDub|contribs]]) 19:49, 24 September 2012 (UTC)
:Thank you for your comments - yes, I added the edit - I thought it worthy - or - at least worth a consideration - however, it's *entirely* ok w/ me to rv/mv/adj/etc - no problem whatsoever - in any case - thanks again for your comments - and - Enjoy! :) [[User:Drbogdan|Drbogdan]] ([[User talk:Drbogdan|talk]]) 20:03, 24 September 2012 (UTC)
::A reason to include him is that he is viewed as a &quot;friendly&quot; person, not hostile like some of academics and debunkers.

:::::Oh, I so wish that was true. Unfortunately, bad religion and denial of real science happens in my country (Australia) too, and is aggressively fed from America. But we don't get Bill Nye on TV here. I only know about him because I'm a science teacher, and use his videos in class.

::::::Are you aware of the pages of discussion here showing that the Discovery Institute, located in Seattle, is the source and promulgator of ID? I suspect [[Brian Houston]] and [[Hillsong Church]] do most of the ID-spreading in Australia. I don't watch TV; I know about Bill Nye from a book of his I read a long time ago and from a video my granddaughter was watching. But I'm not adamant about inclusion. We could always say, &quot;American children's television personality Bill Nye said. . .&quot; Clunky, huh? I'm just laying out facts, here, and will leave the conclusion to others.

== Help with [[Natural genetic engineering]] ==

Not that long ago we had a disruptive editor here who was blocked in fairly short order.  During his brief tenure he created an article on [[Natural genetic engineering]] which was subsequently abandonded.  I picked it up and took it as far as I could, but at this point I could stand having a molecular biologist take a look.  I think the bibliography is in pretty good shape and I have pdfs of most of the 25-odd cites that I've managed to dig up and will be happy to send them along.  Much of the criticism of Shapiro's work in on a level that can be understood by a non-specialist, but I've had less luck being able to summarize his work proper.  If you're not a molecular biologist then you might want to have a look at the Intelligent Design section; that's in much better shape, but I'm sure it can be improved.

Thanks much,

[[User:Garamond Lethe|&lt;span style=&quot;padding:3px;color:gray;font:400 0.9em 'Garamond', serif&quot;&gt;Garamond&lt;/span&gt;]][[User_talk:Garamond Lethe|&lt;span style=&quot;padding:3px;color:gray;font:400 0.9em 'Garamond', serif&quot;&gt;Lethe&lt;/span&gt;]] 01:21, 1 October 2012 (UTC)

PS:  This is the first article where I've been the majority contributor; no need to be gentle, but please be understanding.

::I'm going to go ahead and state that I highly doubt that any &quot;peer reviewed&quot; paper by this person makes the case for Intelligent Design, and are merely articles that support the current synthesis. Therefore any links this guy tries to make that his research disproves evolution and proves some magical sky daddy created everything is NOT peer reviewed and likely NOT worthy of it's own article. The article should be merged into Shapiro's article because of that. —&amp;nbsp;&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Raeky|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#669900;color:#fff;padding:0 4px&quot;&gt;raeky&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Raeky|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#99CC66;padding:0 4px;color:#fff;&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 01:53, 1 October 2012 (UTC)

:::Shapiro's work focuses on how cellular machinery changes DNA in response to environmental conditions.  As such, he thinks the [[Central dogma of molecular biology]] is too simplistic and cellular-directed mutation has had a much greater impact on evolution than non-directed mutation.  Scientifically he's a strict materialist and dismisses the ID folks on this basis.  However, that didn't stop the ID folks from trying to co-opt his work, and as Shapiro is reluctant to admit that directed-mutation systems could have resulted from non-directed mutations + selection, the ID folks keep bringing up his name.  (Shapiro's position is that we can't know yet how the direct-mutation systems arose, but he's certain it was a material cause and that we might figure it out eventually.)

:::All of which, properly cited to the peer-reviewed literature, made its way into the article.  

:::You evidently had a different narrative that you preferred.  Because of that, you wrongly condemned a scientist you knew nothing about, despite the relevant article being a click away.

:::So let's turn this into a teachable moment.  What could I have done differently that would have caused you to read the article first before commenting?

:::Thanks in advance,

::::Sure, I assumed he was in the crazies boat, my bad. The question though is [[WP:N]] of this area of study, is his views widely accepted among biologists? Is his papers highly cited by others? I haven't really looked into it because I don't really have time at the moment, but if his views are on the margins of biology and not widely accepted or being investigated then again it probably doesn't deserve it's own page.... I'm just guessing that since this didn't have a topic before some creationist created it, and it's not linked from anywhere except his page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&amp;target=Natural+genetic+engineering&amp;namespace=], it MIGHT mean it's not notable... —&amp;nbsp;&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Raeky|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#669900;color:#fff;padding:0 4px&quot;&gt;raeky&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Raeky|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#99CC66;padding:0 4px;color:#fff;&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 03:35, 1 October 2012 (UTC)

:::::Good questions.  It was an evolutionist who created the article (here's his best contribution to this article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_design&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=507528838]).  I would say the community considers Shapiro to have a minority but still respectable view.  His ''[http://shapiro.bsd.uchicago.edu/Shapiro1997TIG.pdf Trends in Genetics]'' paper has been cited 90 times, his ''[https://rowan.biology.ualberta.ca/courses/genet302/uploads/winter06/lecture/b1/shelagh_campbell/lecture_outlines/topic_1/TEgenomeevol.pdf Gene]'' paper has been cited 78 times and his ''[http://shapiro.bsd.uchicago.edu/Shapiro.1992.Gentica.NatGenEngInEvo.pdf Genetica]'' paper has been cited 117 times.  His book garnered at least nine reviews in the peer-reviewed literature, ranging from &quot;He's wrong&quot; (Larry Moran) to &quot;This is important but he's probably wrong&quot; to &quot;This is interesting but don't bet the farm&quot;.  Nice catch on the lack of links to the article; I might not be able to address that tonight but that definitely needs work.  Thanks!

::::::I was going by the article's form [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Natural_genetic_engineering&amp;oldid=507507412 before you] started editing, which has some creationist buzzwords like &quot;Darwinian evolution.&quot; But irregardless, I'm not entirely convinced it meets [[WP:GNG]]. I think the question is does the phrasing &quot;Natural genetic engineering&quot; appear enough in academic literature to merit it's own page as opposed to containing it within the author's article? According to a search of the phrase on Google scholar (exact phrase search yields: About 664 results) it may not... —&amp;nbsp;&lt;font style=&quot;font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Raeky|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#669900;color:#fff;padding:0 4px&quot;&gt;raeky&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Raeky|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#99CC66;padding:0 4px;color:#fff;&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 04:11, 1 October 2012 (UTC)

Probably best to move this conversation over to [[talk:Natural genetic engineering]].

== Plantinga reviewed ==

An interesting take on the usual Plantingaisms. H/T [http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/boudry-vs-plantinga.html Larry Moran]. By coincidence, it's followed by a review of James A. Shapiro (2011), ''Evolution. A View from the 21st century''. See also John S. Wilkins &amp; Paul E.

:Good to see Wilkins getting cited.  I think I read a couple of his earlier blog posts about this paper.  Looking forward to reading it on the flight home.

== &quot;Redefinition&quot; of Science ==

The introductory paragraph to the Intelligent Design page states that the leaders of the ID movement wish to redefine science to include theistic explanations. In his book, Signs of Intelligence, Phillip E. Johnson makes a notable point on this issue. He says that the popular science of today, what he calls &quot;naturalistic&quot; science, rejects any theory that isn't entirely in agreement with a naturalistic worldview. That is, any theory that doesn't make sense in a world where the universe is all there ever was is labeled as religion. True science, &quot;empirical&quot; science as he calls it, makes the conclusions that are most feasible based on the evidence set before it. Johnson makes the case that biology bears the distinct hallmarks of design by an intelligent agent, and that evolution is not an adequate explanation for the development of life on Earth.[[Special:Contributions/76.17.165.40|76.17.165.40]] ([[User talk:76.17.165.40|talk]]) 03:19, 3 October 2012 (UTC)Err, let's say my name is staples.

:Well, there's making a case and there's making a case successfully.  Is there a particular change you wanted to make to the lead?
