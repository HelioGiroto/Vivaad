[[File:DSCN2842 campionchurch e 600.jpg|thumb|right|A Seventh-day Adventist church.]]
The seventh-day '''Sabbath''', observed from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset, is an important part of the beliefs and practices of '''[[list of Sabbath-keeping churches|seventh-day churches]]'''. These churches emphasize biblical references such as the ancient Hebrew practice of beginning a day &quot;at the going down of the sun&quot;, and the [[Biblical Sabbath|scriptural account]] of [[creation in Genesis]] wherein an &quot;evening and morning&quot; established a day, predating the giving of the [[Ten Commandments]] (thus the command to &quot;remember&quot; the sabbath). Seventh-day Sabbatarianism was the practice of all or most of the early Christian church through the 4th century.&lt;ref name=socrates&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26015.htm|title=Church History, Book V|author=[[Socrates Scholasticus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sozomen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/26027.htm|title=Ecclesiastical History, Book VII|author=[[Sozomen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh day of the week is recognized in many languages and calendars as ''Sabbath'', and is still observed as such in modern [[Judaism]]. 

Christian seventh-day Sabbatarians seek to reestablish the practice of the early apostolic Christians who kept the sabbath. They usually believe that all humanity is obliged to keep the [[Ten Commandments]], including the sabbath, and that keeping all the commandments is a moral responsibility that honors, and shows love towards, God as [[Creator deity|creator]], sustainer, and redeemer. The majority of Christians do not observe the sabbath on the seventh day, but instead honor Sunday, the first day of the week, as the [[Lord's Day]] and the day of Christ's resurrection, and (in some traditions) as the [[Christian Sabbath]].&lt;ref name=gi&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=G. I.|author-link=G. I. Williamson|title=The Westminster Confession of Faith for Study Classes|year=1978|publisher=Presbyterian and Reformed|pages=170, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sabbath is one of the defining characteristics of seventh-day denominations, including [[Seventh Day Baptists]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], the [[Seventh-Day Evangelist Church]], the [[Church of God (7th Day)]] headquartered in Salem, West Virginia and the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)]] conferences, and the [[United Church of God]], among many others.

==Biblical Sabbath==
{{Main|Biblical Sabbath|Shabbat}}
{{See also|Paul the Apostle and Judaism}}
The sabbath was first described in the biblical account of the seventh day of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]]. Observation and remembrance of the sabbath is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] (the fourth in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and most [[Protestant]] traditions, the third in [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] traditions). Most people who observe first-day or seventh-day sabbath regard it as having been instituted as a perpetual [[covenant (Biblical)|covenant]]: &quot;Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.&quot; ({{bibleref2|Exodus|31:13-17|9}}) (see also  {{bibleref2|Exodus|23:12}}, {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|5:13-14}})) This rule also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|applies to strangers within their gates]], a sign in respect for the day during which God rested after having completed creation in six days ({{bibleref2|Genesis|2:2-3}}, {{bibleref2|Exodus|20:8-11}}).

==History==

===Early church===
{{See also|Sabbath in Christianity}}
According to [[R. J. Bauckham]], the [[Ante-Nicene Period|post-apostolic church]] contained diverse practices regarding the sabbath.&lt;ref name=Bauckham&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Sabbath and Sunday in the Post-Apostolic Church|authorlink=Richard Bauckham|first=R. J.|last=Bauckham|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers/Zondervan|pages=252–98|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first centuries, the first day of the week, being made a festival in honor of Christ's resurrection, received attention as a day of religious services and recreation, but seventh-day sabbath rest was still observed by &quot;almost all churches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcbermuda.com/reference/ellen-white-books-g-m/great-controversy/1899-chap-3-an-era-of-spiritual-darkness|title=The Great Controversy|page=52|authorlink=Ellen G. White|first=Ellen G|last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=August 2012}}

Early Christian observance of both spiritual seventh-day sabbath and [[Lord's Day]] assembly is evidenced in [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]]'s letter to the [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesians]] ca. 110.&lt;ref name=Bauckham/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Epistle to the Magnesians|author=Ignatius|authorlink=Ignatius of Antioch|volume=9|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-magnesians-roberts.html|publisher=Early Christian Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pseudo-Ignatian additions amplified this point by combining weekly observance of spiritual seventh-day sabbath with the Lord's assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ignatius|title=Epistle to the Magnesians|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.iii.ix.html|volume=9|authorlink=Ignatius of Antioch|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|quote=Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness .... But let every one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner, rejoicing in meditation on the law, not in relaxation of the body, admiring the workmanship of God, and not eating things prepared the day before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a prescribed space, nor finding delight in dancing and plaudits which have no sense in them. And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every friend of Christ keep the Lord's [Day, ''Dominicam''] as a festival, the resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Pseudo-Ignatius dates as early as 140, its admonition must be considered important evidence on 2nd-century sabbath and Lord's Day observance.&lt;ref name=guy&gt;{{cite book|title=&quot;The Lord's Day&quot; in the Letter of Ignatius to the Magnesians|first=Fritz|last=Guy|publisher=La Sierra College|url=http://www.auss.info/auss_publication_file.php?pub_id=371&amp;journal=1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to classical sources, widespread seventh-day sabbath rest by gentile Christians was also the prevailing mode in the 3rd and 4th centuries.&lt;ref name=socrates/&gt;&lt;ref name=sozomen/&gt;

On March 7, 321, the Roman emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] issued [[Constantine I and Christianity|a decree]] making Sunday a day of rest from labor, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph Cullen|last=Ayer|title=A Source Book for Ancient Church History|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1913|volume=2.1.1.59g|pages=284–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|All judges and city people and the craftsmen shall rest upon the venerable day of the sun. Country people, however, may freely attend to the cultivation of the fields, because it frequently happens that no other days are better adapted for planting the grain in the furrows or the vines in trenches. So that the advantage given by heavenly providence may not for the occasion of a short time perish.}}

[[Ellen G. White]] states that [[ecumenical councils]] generally each pressed the sabbath down slightly lower and exalted Sunday correspondingly, and that the bishops eventually urged Constantine to syncretize the worship day to promote the nominal acceptance of Christianity by pagans. But &quot;while many God-fearing Christians were gradually led to regard Sunday as possessing a degree of sacredness, they still held [seventh-day] Sabbath.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.crcbermuda.com/reference/ellen-white-books-g-m/great-controversy/1899-chap-3-an-era-of-spiritual-darkness|title=The Great Controversy|first=Ellen G|last=White|authorlink=Ellen G. White|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauckham also states some church authorities continued to oppose this as a [[judaizing]] tendency.&lt;ref name=Bauckham/&gt;

In the 4th century, [[Socrates Scholasticus]] (''Church History, Book V'') stated:&lt;ref name=socrates/&gt; {{quote|For although almost all churches throughout the world celebrate the sacred mysteries on the sabbath of every week, yet the Christians of Alexandria and at Rome, on account of some ancient tradition, have ceased to do this. The Egyptians in the neighborhood of Alexandria, and the inhabitants of Thebaïs, hold their religious assemblies on the sabbath, but do not participate of the mysteries in the manner usual among Christians in general: for after having eaten and satisfied themselves with food of all kinds, in the evening making their offerings they partake of the mysteries.}}

In the 5th century, [[Sozomen]] (''Ecclesiastical History, Book VII''), referencing Socrates Scholasticus, added to his description:&lt;ref name=&quot;sozomen&quot;/&gt;{{quote|Assemblies are not held in all churches on the same time or manner. The people of Constantinople, and almost everywhere, assemble together on the Sabbath, as well as on the first day of the week, which custom is never observed at Rome or at Alexandria. There are several cities and villages in Egypt where, contrary to the usage established elsewhere, the people meet together on Sabbath evenings, and, although they have dined previously, partake of the mysteries.}}

Thus both early church historians, Socrates and Sozomen, cite the seventh day as the Christian day of rest and corporate worship, with the exception of the Christians in Rome and Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church: Socrates, Sozomenus: Church Histories|last=Schaff|first=Philip|year=1890|pages=132, 390|publisher=The Christian Literature Company|location=New York|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KXlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Sabbath in Africa Study Group&quot; (SIA), founded by [[Charles E. Bradford]] in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adventistpeace.typepad.com/african_christianity/sabbath-in-africa-project.html|title=Sabbath in Africa Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that the sabbath has existed in [[Africa]] since the beginning of [[recorded history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sabbath Roots: The African Connection|authorlink=Charles E.

In Bohemia, as much as one quarter of the population kept seventh-day the sabbath in 1310. This practice continued until at least the 16th century, when [[Erasmus]] wrote about the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Robert Cox (anti-Sabbatarian)|first=Robert|last=Cox|title=The Literature of the Sabbath Question|volume=2|pages=201–2|publisher=Maclachlan and Stewart|year=1864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unitarian Church]] condemned Sabbatarianism as innovation (forbidden by the Transylvanian law on religious toleration) in 1618. The last Sabbatarian congregation in Transylvania disappeared in the 19th century and the remaining Sabbatarians, who were known as &quot;Somrei Sabat&quot; (the Hungarian transliteration of the Hebrew words for &quot;Sabbath observers&quot;) joined the existing Jewish communities, into which they were eventually absorbed. Sabbatarianism also expanded into [[Russia]], where its adherents were called [[Subbotniks]], and, from there, the movement expanded into other countries. Some of the Russian Subbotniks maintained a Christian identity doctrinally, while others formally converted to Judaism and assimilated within the Jewish communities of Russia. Some of the latter, however, who had become Jewish, although they and their descendants practiced Judaism and had not practiced Christianity for nearly two centuries, still retained a distinct identity as ethnic Russian converts to Judaism until later.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

A small number of the anti-Trinitarian [[Socinian]] churches of Eastern Europe and the Netherlands adopted the seventh day as the day of worship and rest.

===Reformation===
Sects such as the [[Waldenses]], [[Albigenses]], and [[Leonist]]s appear to have retained sabbath observance in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. A report of an inquisition, before which were brought some Waldenses of Moravia in the middle of the 15th century, declares that among the Waldenses &quot;not a few indeed celebrate the Sabbath with the Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Johann Joseph Ignaz|last=von Doellinger|title=Beitrage zur Sektengeschichte des Mittelalters|trans_title=Reports on the History of the Sects of the Middle Ages|location=Munich|year=1890|edition=2d|page=661}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taiping Rebellion]] kept the sabbath in China. The [[Goa Inquisition]] attacked Sabbatarian [[Saint Thomas Christians]].

At the time of the Protestant Reformation some [[Anabaptists]], such as [[Oswald Glait]], argued that the seventh day should be observed as the sabbath and that Sunday sabbath was an invention of the Pope.&lt;ref name=Bauckham4&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Sabbath and Sunday in the Protestant Tradition|first=R.J.|last=Bauckham|title=From Sabbath to Lord's Day|editor1-first=Don A|editor1-last=Carson|year=1982|pages=311–42|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers/Zondervan|editor-link=Don Carson|isbn=978-1-57910-307-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventh-day Sabbatarianism was revived in 17th-century England. Early advocates included the [[Elizabethan]] [[Seventh-Day Men]], the [[Traskite]]s (after [[John Traske]], 1586–1636), and [[Thomas Brabourne]]. The majority of seventh-day Sabbatarians were part of the [[Seventh Day Baptist]] church and experienced harsh opposition from Anglican authorities and Puritans. The first Seventh Day Baptist church in the United States was established in [[Rhode Island]] in 1671.&lt;ref name=Bauckham4/&gt;

==Modern churches==

===Seventh Day Baptists===
[[Seventh Day Baptists]] are [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Baptists]] who observe [[seventh-day Sabbath]]. The Seventh Day Baptist World Federation today represents over 50,000 Baptists in 22 countries.

It is the oldest modern Sabbatarian denomination. The first recorded Seventh Day Baptist meeting was held at The Mill Yard Church in [[London]] in 1651&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brackney|first=William H|title=Baptists in North America: An Historical Perspective|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=11|isbn=1405118644}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of [[Peter Chamberlen]].

===Seventh-day Adventism===
{{See also|Biblical law in Seventh-day Adventism}}
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] is the largest modern seventh-day Sabbatarian denomination, with about 16 million members, and holds the sabbath as one of [[the Pillars of Adventism]]. Seventh-day Adventism grew out of the [[Millerite]] movement in the 1840s, and its founders were converted to Sabbatarianism under the influence of [[Rachel Oakes Preston]], a young [[Seventh Day Baptist]] laywoman living in [[New Hampshire]].

Seventh-day Adventists observe the sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset. In places where the sun does not appear or does not set for several months, such as northern Scandinavia, the tendency is to regard an arbitrary time such as 6 p.m. as &quot;sunset&quot;. During the sabbath, Adventists avoid secular work and business, although medical, relief, and humanitarian work is accepted. Though there are cultural variations, most Adventists also avoid activities such as shopping, sport, and certain forms of entertainment. Adventists typically gather for church services on Saturday morning. Some also gather on Friday evening to welcome in the sabbath hours (sometimes called &quot;[[vespers]]&quot; or &quot;opening Sabbath&quot;), and some similarly gather at &quot;closing Sabbath&quot;.

Traditionally, Seventh-day Adventists hold that the [[Ten Commandments]] (including the fourth commandment concerning the sabbath) are part of the [[moral law]] of God, not abrogated by the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]], which apply equally to [[Christian]]s. This was a common Christian understanding&lt;ref&gt;The seventh of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England states, &quot;Although the law given from God by Moses, as touching ceremonies and rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet, notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; before the Sabbatarian controversy led Sunday-keepers to adopt a more radical [[antinomian]] position. Adventists have traditionally distinguished between &quot;moral law&quot; and &quot;ceremonial law&quot;, arguing that moral law continues to bind Christians, while events predicted by the ceremonial law were fulfilled by Christ's death on the cross.

====History====
{{Main|History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church}}
&quot;Sabbatarian Adventists&quot; emerged between 1845 and 1849 from within the [[Adventism|Adventist]] movement of [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], later to become the Seventh-day Adventists. Frederick Wheeler&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagnet.org/washington/photographs/people/frederick_wheeler.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; began keeping the seventh day as the sabbath after personally studying the issue in March 1844 following a conversation with Rachel Preston, according to his later report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Probably in the early spring of 1844.|title=Light Bearers}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is reputed to be the first ordained Adventist minister to preach in support of the sabbath. Several members of the church in [[Washington, New Hampshire|Washington]], New Hampshire, to which he occasionally ministered, also followed his decision, forming the first Sabbatarian Adventist church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward G. Fortmiller, Email: ef24w at fortmiller.us |url=http://www.tagnet.org/washington/washingtonbackup/history/index.html#sdaencyclopedia |title=Washington NH: History |publisher=Tagnet.org |date=2004-02-04 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included William Farnsworth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagnet.org/washington/washingtonbackup/photographs/people/farnsworth/williamfarnsworth.html], [http://www.sabbathtrail.org/william_and_22/contents.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and his brother Cyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward G. Fortmiller, Email: ef24w at fortmiller.us |url=http://www.tagnet.org/washington/washingtonbackup/photographs/people/farnsworth/cyrus_farnsworth.html |title=Cyrus K. Farnsworth |publisher=Tagnet.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. M. Preble]] soon accepted it from either Wheeler, Oakes, or someone else at the church. These events preceded the [[Great Disappointment]], which followed shortly after, when Jesus did not return as Millerites expected on October 22, 1844.

Preble was the first Millerite to promote the sabbath in print form, through the February 28, 1845, issue of the Adventist&lt;!--http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T._M._Preble&amp;oldid=94021031--&gt; ''Hope of Israel'' in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]]. In March he published his sabbath views in tract form as ''A Tract, Showing that the Seventh Day Should be Observed as the Sabbath, Instead of the First Day; &quot;According to the Commandment&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/tract.htm |title=A Sabbath Tract by T.M. Preble |publisher=Aloha.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tract led to the conversion of John Nevins Andrews and other Adventist families in [[Paris, Maine|Paris]], Maine, as well as the 1845 conversion of [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)|Joseph Bates]], who became the foremost proponent of the sabbath among this group. These men in turn convinced [[James Springer White]], Ellen Harmon (later White), and [[Hiram Edson]] of New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;''Light Bearers to the Remnant''&lt;/ref&gt; Preble is known to have kept seventh-day sabbath until mid-1847. He later repudiated the sabbath and opposed the Seventh-day Adventists, authoring ''The First-Day Sabbath''.

Bates proposed an 1846 meeting among the believers in New Hampshire and Port Gibson, which took place at Edson's farm, where Edson and other Port Gibson believers readily accepted the sabbath message and forged an alliance with Bates, White, and Harmon. Between April 1848 and December 1850, 22 sabbath conferences in [[New York]] and [[New England]] allowed White, Bates, Edson, and Stephen Pierce to reach conclusions about doctrinal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sabbath Conferences|last=Neufield|first=D.|year=1976|pages=1255–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1846, a pamphlet written by Bates created widespread interest in the sabbath. Bates, White, Harmon, Edson, Wheeler, and S. W. Rhodes led the promotion of the sabbath, partly through regular publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Seventh-day Adventists|pages=270–3|first=Frank S.|last=Mead|first2=Samuel S.|last2=Hill|first3=Craig D|last3=Atwood|title=Handbook of Denominations in the United States|edition=12th|location=Nashville|publisher=Abingdon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Present Truth'' magazine was largely devoted to the sabbath at first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventistarchives.org/documents.asp?CatID=31&amp;SortBy=1&amp;ShowDateOrder=True |title=General Conference Archives |publisher=Adventistarchives.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. N. Andrews was the first Adventist to write a book-length defense of the sabbath, first published in 1861. Two of Andrews' books include ''Testimony of the Fathers of the First Three Centuries Concerning the Sabbath and the First Day''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giveshare.org/HolyDay/firstcenturies/index.html |title=Testimony of the Fathers of the First Three Centuries Concerning the Sabbath and the First Day |publisher=Giveshare.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''History of the Sabbath''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventistarchives.org/doc_info.asp?DocID=42638] {{DjVulink}}, [http://www.giveshare.org/HolyDay/historysabbath/] HTML&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eschatology====
{{See also|Seventh-day Adventist eschatology}}
The pioneers of the church have traditionally taught that the seventh-day sabbath will be a test, leading to the sealing of God's people during the end times, though there is little consensus about how this will play out. The church has traditionally taught that there will be an international [[blue law|Sunday law]] enforced by a coalition of religious and secular authorities, and that all who do not observe it will be persecuted and killed. This is taken from the church's interpretation, following Ellen G. White, of {{Bibleverse||Daniel|7:25}}, {{Bibleverse||Revelation|13:15}}, {{Bibleverse||Revelation|7}}, {{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|20:12-20}}, and {{Bibleverse||Exodus|31:13}}. Where the subject of persecution appeared in prophecy, it was thought to be about the sabbath. Some early Adventists were jailed for working on Sunday, in violation of various local blue laws that legislated Sunday as a day of rest. It was expected that a universal Sunday law would soon be enforced, as a sign of the end times.

===Armstrongism===
Seventh-day Sabbatarianism was a key feature of the former [[Worldwide Church of God]], founded by [[Armstrongism|Herbert W. Armstrong]], and its various [[Armstrongism#Related churches|descendent movements]]. Armstrong, who began the [[Radio Church of God]], was in 1931 ordained by the Oregon Conference of the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)]], an Adventist group, and began serving a congregation in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. The broadcast was essentially a condensed church service on the air, with hymnsinging featured along with Armstrong's message, and was the launching point for what would become the Worldwide Church of God.

The primarily Chinese [[True Jesus Church]] supports the seventh-day sabbath, and has approximately 2 million believers worldwide. Initial founder [[Ling-Sheng Zhang]] accepted the sabbath after studying [[Seventh-day Adventist theology]], and co-founder [[Paul Wei]] was originally a Seventh-day Adventist. An American missionary named Berntsen, who was from a sabbath-keeping Church of God, was also influential upon the founders.
