[[File:MarcusAureliusSacrificeRelief.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Marcus Aurelius]] and members of the Imperial family offer sacrifice in gratitude for success against [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]: contemporary [[bas-relief]], [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline Museum]], Rome]]
'''Sacrifice'''  is the offering of food, objects or the lives of animals to a higher purpose or to God or the gods as an act of [[propitiation]] or [[worship]]. While ''sacrifice'' often implies [[ritual killing]], the term '''offering''' (Latin ''[[Oblation|oblatio]]'') can be used for bloodless sacrifices of cereal food or artifacts. For offerings of liquids (beverages) by pouring, the term [[libation]] is used.

==Terminology==
The Latin term came to be used of the Christian [[eucharist]] in particular, sometimes named a &quot;bloodless sacrifice&quot; to distinguish it from [[blood sacrifice]]s. In individual pre-Christian [[ethnic religion]]s, terms translated as &quot;sacrifice&quot; include the Indic ''[[yajna]]'', the Greek ''thusia'', the Germanic ''[[blót|blōtan]]'', the Semitic ''[[qorban]]''/''[[qurban]]'', etc.

The term is also used [[metaphor]]ically to describe selfless good deeds for others or a short term loss in return for a greater power gain, [[Sacrifice (chess)|such as in a game of chess]].  Recently it has also come into use as meaning 'doing without something' or 'giving something up' (see also [[self-sacrifice]]).&lt;ref&gt;

==Animal sacrifice==

{{main|Animal sacrifice}}
Animal sacrifice is the ritual killing of an animal as part of a religion. It is practiced by adherents of many religions as a means of appeasing a god or gods or changing the course of nature. It also served a social or economic function in those cultures where the edible portions of the animal were distributed among those attending the sacrifice for consumption. Animal sacrifice has turned up in almost all cultures, from the [[Hebrews]] to the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (particularly the purifying ceremony [[Lustratio]]), [[Ancient Egyptians]] (for example in the cult of [[Apis (god)|Apis]]) and from the [[Aztecs]] to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]. Animal sacrifice is still practiced today by the followers of [[Santería]] and other lineages of Orisa as a means of curing the sick and giving thanks to the [[Orisa]] ([[deity|gods]]). However in Santeria, such animal offerings constitute an extremely small portion of what are termed ''ebos''—ritual activities that include offerings, prayer and deeds.  Christians from some villages in Greece also sacrifice animals to Orthodox saints in a practice known as [[kourbània]].  The practice, while publicly condemned, is often tolerated{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

===Walter Burkert theory on origins of Greek sacrifice===
According to [[Walter Burkert]], a scholar on sacrifice, Greek sacrifices derived from hunting practices. Hunters, feeling guilty for having killed another living being so they could eat and survive, tried to repudiate their responsibility in these rituals. The primary evidence used to suggest this theory is the [[Dipolieia]], which is an Athenian festival, in limited circulation, during which an ox was sacrificed. The protagonist of the ritual was a plough ox, which it had, at one point, been a crime to kill in Athens. According to his theory, the killer of the ox eased his conscience by suggesting that everybody should participate in the killing of the sacrificial victim.

In the expansion of the Athenian state, numerous oxen were needed to feed the people at the banquets and were accompanied by state festivals. The [[hecatomb]] (“hundred oxen”) became the general designation for the great sacrifices offered by the state. These sacrificial processions of hundreds of oxen remove the original ties, which the farmers of an earlier and smaller Athens will have felt with their one ox.

==Human sacrifice==
[[File:Codex Magliabechiano (141 cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Aztec]] [[human sacrifice]], from [[Codex Mendoza]], 16th century ([[Bodleian Library]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]]).]]

{{main|Human sacrifice}}
[[Human sacrifice]] was practiced by many ancient cultures. People would be ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease a [[god]] or [[spiritual being|spirit]].

Some occasions for human sacrifice found in multiple cultures on multiple continents include:
* Human sacrifice to accompany the dedication of a new temple or bridge.
* Sacrifice of people upon the [[death]] of a king, high priest or great leader; the sacrificed were supposed to serve or accompany the deceased leader in the next life.
* Human sacrifice in times of natural disaster. Droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc. were seen as a sign of anger or displeasure by deities, and sacrifices were supposed to lessen the divine ire.

Human sacrifices were practiced by various [[Pre-Columbian]] civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]]. The [[Aztec]] practiced human sacrifice on an unusually large scale; a  sacrifice would be made every day to aid the [[sun]] in rising, the dedication of the great temple at [[Tenochtitlán]] was reportedly marked with the sacrificing of thousands, and there are multiple accounts of captured [[Conquistador]]es being sacrificed during the wars of the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of [[Mexico]].

In [[Scandinavia]], the old [[Scandinavian religion]] contained human sacrifice, and both the [[Norse saga]]s and German historians relate of this, see e.g. [[Temple at Uppsala]] and [[Blót]].

There is evidence to suggest Pre-Hellenic [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cultures practiced human sacrifice. Sacrificed corpses were found at a number of sites in the [[citadel]] of [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]]. The north house at Knossos contained the bones of children who appeared to have been butchered. It is possible they may have been for human consumption as was the tradition with sacrificial offerings made in Pre-Hellenic [[Civilization]]. [http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/15.html] The myth of [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]] (set in the labyrinth at Knossos) provides evidence that human sacrifice was commonplace. In the myth, we are told that [[Athens]] sent [[sacrificial victims of Minotaur|seven young men and seven young women]] to Crete as human sacrifices to the Minotaur. This ties up well with the archaeological evidence that most sacrifices were of young adults or [[child sacrifice|children]].

Human sacrifice still happens today{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} as an underground practice in some traditional religions, for example in [[muti]] killings. Human sacrifice is no longer officially condoned in any country, and these cases are regarded as [[murder]].

In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' by [[Virgil]], the character [[Sinon]] claims (falsely) that he was going to be a human sacrifice to [[Poseidon]] to calm the seas.

==Judaism==
{{see also|Korban|Shechita}}
The centrality of sacrifices in Ancient Israel is clear, with much of the [[Bible]], particularly the opening chapters of the book [[Leviticus]], detailing the exact method of bringing [[korban|sacrifice]]s.  Sacrifices were either blood sacrifices (animals) or bloodless offerings (grain and wine). Blood sacrifices were divided into the [[burnt offering]]s (Hebrew: עלה קרבנות)  in which the whole animal was burnt, [[guilt offering]]s (in which part was burnt and part left for the priest) and [[peace offering]]s (in which similarly only part of the animal was burnt and the rest eaten in ritually pure conditions).  The prophets point out that prayer and sacrifices are only a part of serving God and need to be accompanied by inner morality and goodness.

After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]], ritual sacrifice ceased except among the [[Samaritans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-samaritans.com/festival.htm The Samaritans .com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]], a medieval Jewish rationalist, argued that God always held sacrifice inferior to prayer and philosophical meditation. However, God understood that the Israelites were used to the animal sacrifices that the surrounding pagan tribes used as the primary way to commune with their gods. As such, in Maimonides' view, it was only natural that Israelites would believe that sacrifice was a necessary part of the relationship between God and man. Maimonides concludes that God's decision to allow sacrifices was a concession to human psychological limitations. It would have been too much to have expected the Israelites to leap from pagan worship to prayer and meditation in one step.  In the ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', he writes:

:&quot;But the custom which was in those days general among men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up consisted in sacrificing animals... It was in accordance with the wisdom and plan of God...that God did not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service.  For to obey such a commandment would have been contrary to the nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would make at present [the 12th Century] if he called us to the service of God and told us in His name, that we should not pray to God nor fast, nor seek His help in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by any action.&quot; (Book III, Chapter 32. Translated by M. Friedlander, 1904, ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Dover Publications, 1956 edition.)

In contrast, many others such as [[Nachmanides]] (in his Torah commentary on Leviticus 1:9) disagreed, contending that sacrifices are an ideal in Judaism, completely central. 

The teachings of the [[Torah]] and [[Tanakh]] reveal the Israelites's familiarity with human sacrifices, as exemplified by the near-sacrifice of Isaac by his father Abraham (Genesis 22:1-24) and some believe, the actual sacrifice of [[Jephthah]]'s daughter (Judges 11:31-40), while many believe that Jephthah's daughter was committed for life in service equivalent to a nunnery of the day, as indicated by her lament over her &quot;weep for my virginity&quot; and never having known a man (v37).  The king of Moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering (''olah'', as used of the Temple sacrifice). It is apparently effective, as his enemy is promptly repelled by a 'great wrath' ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|3:27|HE}}). In the book of [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]], one asks, 'Shall I give my firstborn for my sin, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?' ({{bibleverse||Micah|6:7|HE}}), and receives a response, 'It hath been told thee, O man, what is good, and what the LORD doth require of thee: only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.' ({{bibleverse||Micah|6:8|HE}}) Abhorrence of the practice of child sacrifice is emphasized by [[Jeremiah]].  See Jeremiah 7:30-32.

==Christianity==
In [[trinitarianism|trinitarian]] Christian teaching, God became incarnate in [[Jesus Christ]], sacrificing his first-born son to accomplish the reconciliation of God and humanity, which had separated itself from God through sin (see the concept of [[original sin]]). According to a view that has featured prominently in Western theology since early in the 2nd millennium, God's justice required an atonement for sin from humanity if human beings were to be restored to their place in creation and saved from damnation. However, God knew limited human beings could not make sufficient atonement, for humanity's offense to God was infinite, so God created a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[Abraham]], which he fulfilled when he sent his only Son to become the sacrifice for the broken covenant. In Christian theology, this sacrifice replaced the insufficient animal sacrifice of the [[Old Covenant]]; Christ the &quot;[[Lamb of God]]&quot; replaced the lambs' sacrifice of the ancient Korban Todah (the Rite of Thanksgiving), chief of which is the Passover in the Mosaic law.

[[Geza Vermes]] argues that the title &quot;[[Lamb of God]]&quot; does not necessarily refer to the metaphor of a sacrificial animal. He points out that in Galilean [[Aramaic]], the word ''talya'', literally &quot;lamb&quot;, had the common meaning of &quot;male child&quot;. This is akin to ''kid'' meaning &quot;child&quot; in modern colloquial [[English language|English]]. The female equivalent of ''talya'' was ''talitha'', literally &quot;ewe lamb&quot; and figuratively &quot;girl&quot; (the word is found in the [[narrative of the daughter of Jairus]]). {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, as well as among some [[High Church]] Anglicans, the [[Eucharist]] or Mass, and the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], it is seen as a sacrifice. It is however, not a separate or additional sacrifice to that Christ on the cross; it is rather exactly the same sacrifice, which transcends time and space (&quot;the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world&quot;) (Rev. 13:8), renewed and made present, the only distinction being that it is offered in an unbloody manner. The sacrifice is made present without Christ dying or being crucified again; it is a re-presentation to God, of the &quot;once and for all&quot; sacrifice of Calvary by the now risen Christ, who continues to offer himself and what he has done on the cross as an oblation to the Father. The complete identification of the Mass with the sacrifice of the cross is found in Christ's words at the last supper over the bread and wine: &quot;This is my body, which is given up for you,&quot; and &quot;This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed...unto the forgiveness of sins.&quot; The bread and wine, offered by [[Melchizedek]] in sacrifice in the old covenant (Genesis 14:18; Psalm 110:4), are transformed through the Mass into the body and blood of Christ (see [[transubstantiation]]; note: the Orthodox Church does not hold as dogma, as do Catholics, the doctrine of transubstantiation, preferring rather to not make an assertion regarding the &quot;how&quot; of the [[sacraments]]), and the offering becomes one with that of Christ on the cross. In the Mass as on the cross, Christ is both priest (offering the sacrifice) and victim (the sacrifice he offers is himself), though in the Mass in the former capacity he works through a solely human priest who is joined to him through the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]] and thus shares in Christ's priesthood. Through the Mass, the merits of the one sacrifice of the cross can be applied to the redemption of those present, to their specific intentions and prayers, and to the release of the souls from [[purgatory]].

&lt;span id=&quot;suffering&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The concept of self-sacrifice and [[martyr]]s are central to Christianity. Often found in Roman Catholicism is the idea of joining one's own sufferings to the sacrifice of Christ on the cross. Thus one can offer up involuntary suffering, such as illness, or purposefully embrace suffering in acts of [[penance]].  Some Protestants criticize this as a denial of the all-sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, but it finds support in St. Paul: &quot;Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church&quot; (Col 1:24). [[Pope John Paul II]] explained in his [[Apostolic Letter]] ''[[Salvifici Doloris]]'' (11 February 1984):&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In the Cross of Christ not only is the Redemption accomplished through suffering, but also human suffering itself has been redeemed...Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished...In bringing about the Redemption through suffering, Christ has also raised human suffering to the level of the Redemption. Thus each man, in his suffering, can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of Christ...The sufferings of Christ created the good of the world's redemption. This good in itself is inexhaustible and infinite. No man can add anything to it. But at the same time, in the mystery of the Church as his Body, Christ has in a sense opened his own redemptive suffering to all human suffering&quot; (''Salvifici Doloris'' 19; 24).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some Protestants reject the idea of the [[Eucharist]] as a sacrifice, inclining to see it as merely a holy meal (even if they believe in a form of the [[real presence]] of Christ in the bread and wine, as [[Lutherans]] do). The more recent the origin of a particular tradition, the less emphasis is placed on the sacrificial nature of the Eucharist. The Catholic/Orthodox response is that the sacrifice of the Mass in the New Covenant is that one sacrifice for sins on the cross which transcends time offered in an unbloody manner, as discussed above, and that Christ is the real priest at every Mass working through mere human beings to whom he has granted the grace of a share in his priesthood. As ''priest'' carries connotations of &quot;one who offers sacrifice&quot;, Protestants usually do not use it for their [[clergy]]. Evangelical Protestantism emphasizes the importance of a decision to accept [[Christ's sacrifice on the Cross]] consciously and personally as atonement for one's individual sins if one is to be saved—this is known as &quot;accepting Christ as one's personal Lord and Savior&quot;.

The Orthodox Church sees the celebration of the Eucharist as a continuation, rather than a reenactment, of the [[Last Supper]], as Fr. John Matusiak (of the [[Orthodox Church in America|OCA]]) says: &quot;The Liturgy is not so much a reenactment of the Mystical Supper or these events as it is a continuation of these events, which are beyond time and space. Unlike many of the Protestant bodies, the Orthodox also see the Eucharistic Liturgy as a bloodless sacrifice, during which the bread and wine we offer to God become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ through the descent and operation of the Holy Spirit, Who effects the change.&quot; This view is witnessed to by the prayers of the [[Divine Liturgy]] of [[St. John Chrysostom]], when the priest says: &quot;Accept, O God, our supplications, make us to be worthy to offer unto thee supplications and prayers and bloodless sacrifices for all thy people,&quot; and &quot;Remembering this saving commandment and all those things which came to pass for us: the cross, the grave, the resurrection on the third day, the ascension into heaven, the sitting down at the right hand, the second and glorious coming again, Thine own of Thine own we offer unto Thee on behalf of all and for all,&quot; and &quot;… Thou didst become man and didst take the name of our High Priest, and deliver unto us the priestly rite of this liturgical and bloodless sacrifice…&quot;

==Islam==
{{main|Dhabihah}}
An animal sacrifice in Arabic is called ''ḏabiḥa'' (ذَبِيْحَة) or ''Qurban'' (قُرْبَان) . The term may have roots from the Jewish term ''Korban''; in some places such as in Pakistan, ''qurbani'' is always used for Islamic animal sacrifice.  In the Islamic context, an animal sacrifice referred to as ''ḏabiḥa'' (ذَبِيْحَة) meaning &quot;sacrifice as a ritual&quot; is offered only in [[Eid ul-Adha]]. The sacrificial animal may be a lamb, a sheep, a goat, a camel, or a cow. The animal must be healthy and conscious.
...&quot;Therefore to the Lord turn in Prayer and Sacrifice. &quot; (Surat Al-Kawthar) Quran, 108.2
Qurban is an Islamic prescription for the affluent to share their good fortune with the needy in the community.
On the occasion of Eid ul Adha (Festival of Sacrifice), affluent Muslims all over the world perform the Sunnah of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) by sacrificing a cow or sheep. The meat is then divided into three equal parts. One part is retained by the person who performs the sacrifice. The second is given to his relatives. The third part is distributed to the poor.
The Qur'an states that the sacrifice has nothing to do with the blood and gore ([[Qur'an]] 22:37: &quot;It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches God. It is your piety that reaches Him...&quot;). Rather, it is done to help the poor and in remembrance of [[Abraham]]'s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael at God's command.

The Urdu and Persian word &quot;Qurbani&quot; comes from the Arabic word 'Qurban'. It suggests that associate act performed to hunt distance to Almighty God and to hunt His sensible pleasure. Originally, the word 'Qurban' enclosed all acts of charity as a result of the aim of charity is nothing however to hunt Allah's pleasure. But, in precise non secular nomenclature, the word was later confined to the sacrifice of associate animal slaughtered for the sake of God.

==Hinduism==
{{main|Yagya}}
The Sanskrit ''Yagya'' is often translated as &quot;sacrifice&quot; (also &quot;offering, oblation&quot;, or more generically as &quot;worship&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;act of worship or devotion, offering, oblation, sacrifice (the former meanings prevailing in Veda, the latter in post-Vedic literature&quot;, Monier-Williams.&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially used to describe the offering of [[ghee]] (clarified butter), grains, spices, and wood into a fire along with the chanting of sacred [[mantra]]s. The fire represents [[Agni]], the divine messenger who carries offerings to the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Subramuniyaswami | first =Satguru Sivaya | title =Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism | publisher =Himalayan Academy Publications | year =2003 | isbn =0-945497-96-2 }} p. 849.&lt;/ref&gt; The offerings can represent devotion, aspiration, and seeds of past karma. In Vedic times, ''Yagya'' commonly included the sacrifice of milk, ghee, curd, grains, and the ''soma'' plant&amp;mdash;animal offerings were less common.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Indeed the offering of milk into the fire was more common than animal offerings.&quot;{{cite book | last =Flood | first =Gavin | title =An Introduction to Hinduism | publisher =Cambridge University Press | year =1996 | isbn =0-521-43878-0 }} p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, ''Yagya'' is often performed at weddings and funerals, and in personal worship. Sacrifice in Hinduism can also refer to personal surrender through acts of inner and outer worship.&lt;ref&gt;Subramuniyaswami, p. 849.&lt;/ref&gt;
