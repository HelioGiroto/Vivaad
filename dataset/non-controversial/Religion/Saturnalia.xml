'''Saturnalia''' was an [[Roman festival|ancient Roman festival]] in honor of the [[List of Roman deities|deity]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] originally held December 17 and later expanded with unofficial festivities through December 23. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the [[Temple of Saturn]] in the [[Roman Forum]] and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a [[carnival]] atmosphere that overturned [[Ancient Roman culture|Roman social norms]]: [[Dice#History|gambling]] was permitted, and masters provided table service for their [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;John F. Miller, &quot;Roman Festivals,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Catullus]] called it &quot;the best of days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 14.15 ''(optimo dierum)'', as cited by Hans-Friedrich Mueller, &quot;Saturn,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], Saturn was an agricultural deity who reigned over the world in the [[Golden Age]], when humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labor in a state of [[egalitarian society|social egalitarianism]]. The revelries of Saturnalia were supposed to reflect the conditions of the lost mythical age, not all of them desirable. The Greek equivalent was the [[Kronia]].&lt;ref&gt;William F. Hansen, ''Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature'' (Cornell University Press, 2002), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although probably the best-known Roman holiday, Saturnalia as a whole is not described from beginning to end in any single ancient source. Modern understanding of the festival is pieced together from several accounts dealing with various aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Fanny Dolansky, &quot;Celebrating the Saturnalia: Religious Ritual and Roman Domestic Life,&quot; in ''A Companion to Families in the Greek and Roman Worlds'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt; The Saturnalia was the dramatic setting of the multivolume work of that name by [[Macrobius]], a Latin writer from [[late antiquity]] who is the major source for the holiday. In one of the interpretations in Macrobius's work, Saturnalia is a festival of light leading to the [[winter solstice]], with the abundant presence of candles symbolizing the quest for knowledge and truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.1.8–9; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, CE 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The renewal of light and the coming of the [[new year]] was celebrated in the later [[Roman Empire]] at the ''Dies Natalis'' of [[Sol Invictus]], the &quot;Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun,&quot; on December 25.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Kaster, ''Macrobius: Saturnalia, Books 1–2'' ([[Loeb Classical Library]], 2011), note on p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Saturnalia continued into the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, and as the [[Roman Empire]] came under Christian rule, some of its customs may have influenced the seasonal celebrations surrounding [[Christmas]] and the New Year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 2, p. 124; Craig A. Williams, ''Martial: Epigrams Book Two'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 259 (on the custom of gift-giving). Many observers schooled in the [[classical tradition]] have noted similarities between the Saturnalia and historical revelry during the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] and the [[Feast of Fools]]; see entry on &quot;Bacchanalia and Saturnalia,&quot; in ''The Classical Tradition'', edited by [[Anthony Grafton]], [[Glenn W. Most]], and Salvatore Settis (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 116. &quot;The reciprocal influences of the Saturnalia, [[Yule|Germanic solstitial festivals]], Christmas, and [[Chanukkah]] are familiar,&quot; notes C. Bennet Pascal, &quot;October Horse,&quot; ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public religious observance==
{{See also|Religion in ancient Rome}}
The main cult statue of Saturn normally had its feet bound in wool, which was removed for the holiday as an act of liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius 1.8.5, citing [[Verrius Flaccus]] as his authority; see also [[Statius]], ''Silvae'' 1.6.4; [[Arnobius]] 4.24; [[Minucius Felix]] 23.5; Miller, &quot;Roman Festivals,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 172; H.S. Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; in ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual'' (Brill, 1993, 1994), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The official rituals were carried out according to &quot;Greek rite&quot; ''([[ritus graecus]])''. The sacrifice was officiated by a priest&lt;ref&gt;The identity or title of this priest is unknown; perhaps the ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' or one of the [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]]: [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; whose head was uncovered; in Roman rite, priests sacrificed ''[[capite velato]]'', with head covered by a special fold of the [[toga]].&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure is usually explained by the [[Hellenization]] of Saturn's cult through assimilation with his Greek counterpart [[Cronus]], but it may also be one of the Saturnalian reversals, the opposite of what was normal.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the sacrifice the [[Roman Senate]] arranged a ''[[lectisternium]]'', a ritual of Greek origin that typically involved placing the deity's image on a sumptuous couch, as if he were present and actively participating in the festivities. A public banquet followed ''([[convivium]] publicum)''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 22.1; Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 141; [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''Rome and Carthage at Peace'' (Franz Steiner, 1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The day was supposed to be a holiday from all forms of work. Schools were closed, and exercise regimens were suspended. The courts were closed, so no justice was administered, and no [[declaration of war]] could be made.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 147, citing [[Pliny the Younger]], ''Letters'' 8.7.1, [[Martial]] 5.84 and 12.81; [[Lucian]], ''Cronosolon'' 13; Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.10.1, 4, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the public rituals, observances continued [[domus|at home]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 18 and 19, which were also holidays from public business, families conducted domestic rituals. They bathed early, and those with means sacrificed a [[suckling pig]], a traditional offering to an [[chthonic|earth deity]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Odes'' 3.17, Martial 14.70; Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Io Saturnalia''===
The phrase ''io Saturnalia'' was the characteristic shout or salutation of the festival, originally commencing after the public banquet on the single day of December 17.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 141; Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[interjection]] ''io'' (Greek ''ἰώ'', ''ǐō'') is pronounced either with two [[syllable]]s (a short ''i'' and a long ''o'') or as a single syllable (with the ''i'' becoming the Latin [[consonant]]al ''j'' and pronounced ''yō''). It was a strongly emotive ritual exclamation or invocation, used for instance in announcing [[Roman triumph|triumph]] or celebrating [[Bacchus]], but also to punctuate a joke.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on ''io,'' ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), p. 963.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private festivities==
{{Quote box4
|quote  = &quot;Meanwhile the head of the slave household, whose responsibility it was to offer sacrifice to the [[Penates]], to manage the provisions and to direct the activities of the domestic servants, came to tell his master that the household had feasted according to the annual ritual custom. For at this festival, in houses that keep to proper religious usage, they first of all honor the slaves with a dinner prepared as if for the master; and only afterwards is the table set again for the head of the household. So, then, the chief slave came in to announce the time of dinner and to summon the masters to the table.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.,'' ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'', vol. 2, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saturnalia is the best-known of several festivals in the [[Greco-Roman world]] characterized by role reversals and behavioral license.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Parker, ''On Greek Religion'' (Cornell University Press, 2011), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were treated to a banquet of the kind usually enjoyed by their masters. Ancient sources differ on the circumstances: some suggest that master and slave dined together,&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Epistulae'' 47.14; Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; while others indicate that the slaves feasted first, or that the masters actually served the food. The practice may have varied over time,&lt;ref&gt;Dolansky, &quot;Celebrating the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt; and in any case slaves would still have prepared the meal.

Saturnalian license also permitted slaves to enjoy a pretense of disrespect for their masters, and exempted them from punishment. It was a time for [[Marsyas#Prophecy and free speech at Rome|free speech]]: the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] poet [[Horace]] calls it &quot;December liberty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Horaces, ''Satires'' 2.7.4, ''libertas Decembri''; Mueller, &quot;Saturn,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt; In two [[Satires (Horace)|satires]] set during the Saturnalia, Horace has a slave offer sharp criticism to his master.&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Satires'', Book 2, poems 3 and 7; Catherine Keane, ''Figuring Genre in Roman Satire'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 90; Maria Plaza, ''The Function of Humour in Roman Verse Satire: Laughing and Lying'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 298–300 ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; But everyone knew that the leveling of the [[social class in ancient Rome|social hierarchy]] was temporary and had limits; no social norms were ultimately threatened, because the holiday would end.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The [[toga]], the characteristic garment of the male Roman citizen, was set aside in favor of the Greek ''[[Synthesis (clothing)|synthesis]]'', colourful &quot;dinner clothes&quot; otherwise considered in poor taste for daytime wear.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 147 (especially note 59).&lt;/ref&gt; Romans of citizen status normally went about bare-headed, but for the Saturnalia donned the ''[[Pileus (hat)|pilleus]]'', the conical felt cap that was the usual mark of a freedman. Slaves, who ordinarily were not entitled to wear the ''pilleus'', wore it as well, so that everyone was &quot;pilleated&quot; without distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 147; Dolansky, &quot;Celebrating the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

The participation of [[Women in ancient Rome|freeborn Roman women]] is implied by sources that name gifts for women, but their presence at banquets may have depended on the custom of their time; from the late Republic onward, women mingled socially with men more freely than they had in earlier times. Female entertainers were certainly present at some otherwise all-male gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;Dolansky, &quot;Celebrating the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 492–494.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Role-playing was implicit in the Saturnalia's status reversals, and there are hints of mask-wearing or &quot;[[guising]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;At the beginning of Horace's ''Satire'' 2.3, and the mask in the Saturnalia imagery of the [[Calendar of Philocalus]], and Martial's inclusion of masks as Saturnalia gifts; Beard ''et al.,'' ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'', vol. 2, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; No theatrical events are mentioned in connection with the festivities, but the classicist [[Erich Segal]] saw [[Roman comedy]], with its cast of impudent, free-wheeling slaves and libertine seniors, as imbued with the Saturnalian spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Segal]], ''Roman Laughter: The Comedy of Plautus'' (Oxford University Press, 1968, 2nd ed. 1987), pp. 8–9, 32–33, 103 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompeii - Osteria della Via di Mercurio - Dice Players.jpg|thumb|left|Dice players in a wall painting from [[Pompeii]]]]
Gambling and dice-playing, normally prohibited or at least frowned upon, were permitted for all, even slaves. Coins and nuts were the [[gambling|stakes]]. On the [[Calendar of Philocalus]], the Saturnalia is represented by a man wearing a fur-trimmed coat next to a table with dice, and a caption reading &quot;Now you have license, slave, to game with your master.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 148, citing [[Suetonius]], ''Life of Augustus'' 71; Martial 1.14.7, 5.84, 7.91.2, 11.6, 13.1.7; 14.1; Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl422.htm ''Saturnalia'' 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; Rampant overeating and drunkenness became the rule, and a sober person the exception.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 147, citing [[Cato the Elder]], ''De agricultura'' 57; [[Aulus Gellius]] 2.24.3; Martial 14.70.1 and 14.1.9; [[Horace]], ''Satire'' 2.3.5; Lucian, ''Saturnalia'' 13; ''Scriptores Historiae Augustae'', Alexander Severus 37.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] looked forward to the holiday, if somewhat tentatively, in a letter to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now the month of December, when the greatest part of the city is in a bustle. Loose reins are given to public dissipation; everywhere you may hear the sound of great preparations, as if there were some real difference between the days devoted to Saturn and those for transacting business. … Were you here, I would willingly confer with you as to the plan of our conduct; whether we should eve in our usual way, or, to avoid singularity, both take a better supper and throw off the toga.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger]], ''Epistulae'' 18.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Romans found it all a bit much. [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] describes a secluded suite of rooms in his Laurentine [[Roman villa|villa]] which he used as a retreat &quot;especially during the Saturnalia when the rest of the house is noisy with the licence of the holiday and festive cries. This way I don't hamper the games of my people and they don't hinder my work or studies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger]], ''Letters'' 2.17.24. Horace similarly sets ''Satire'' 2.3 during the Saturnalia but in the countryside, where he has fled the frenzied pace.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gift-giving===
The day of gift-giving was the Sigillaria on December 23.&lt;ref&gt;Dolansky, &quot;Celebrating the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 492, 502. Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.10.24, seems to indicate that the Sigillaria was a market that occurred at the end of Saturnalia, but the [[Gallo-Roman]] scholar-poet [[Ausonius]] (''Eclogues'' 16.32) refers to it as a religious occasion ''(sacra sigillorum,'' &quot;rites of the ''sigillaria''&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; Because gifts of value would mark social status contrary to the spirit of the season, these were often the [[ancient Roman pottery|pottery]] or wax figurines called ''[[Sigillaria (ancient Rome)|sigillaria]]'' made specially for the day, candles, or &quot;[[gag gift]]s&quot;, of which [[Augustus]] was particularly fond.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#75 75]; Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 148, pointing to the ''[http://lucianofsamosata.info/Cronosolon.html Cronosolon]'' of Lucian on the problem of unequal gift-giving.&lt;/ref&gt; In his many poems about the Saturnalia, Martial names both expensive and quite cheap gifts, including writing tablets, dice, [[knucklebones]], moneyboxes, combs, toothpicks, a hat, a hunting knife, an axe, various lamps, balls, perfumes, pipes, a pig, a sausage, a parrot, tables, cups, spoons, items of clothing, statues, masks, books, and pets.&lt;ref&gt;Martial, ''Epigrams'' 13 and 14, the ''Xenia'' and the ''Apophoreta'', published 84–85 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts might be as costly as a slave or exotic animal,&lt;ref&gt;Dolansky, &quot;Celebrating the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 492, citing Martial 5.18, 7.53, 14; Suetonius, ''Life of Augustus'' 75 and ''Life of Vespasian'' 19 on the range of gifts.&lt;/ref&gt; but Martial suggests that token gifts of low intrinsic value inversely measure the high quality of a friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Ruurd R. Nauta, ''Poetry for Patrons: Literary Communication in the Age of Domitian'' (Brill, 2002), pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Patrons]] or &quot;bosses&quot; might pass along a gratuity ''(sigillaricium)'' to their poorer clients or dependents to help them buy gifts. Some [[Roman emperor|emperors]] were noted for their devoted observance of the Sigillaria.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 148–149, citing Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.10.24 and 1.11.49; [[Suetonius]], ''Life of Claudius'' 5; ''[[Scriptores Historiae Augustae]]'' Hadrian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/2*.html#17.3 17.3], Caracalla [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html#1.8 1.8] and Aurelian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aurelian/3*.html#ref184 50.3.] See also Dolansky, &quot;Celebrating the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a practice that might be compared to modern [[greeting card]]s, verses sometimes accompanied the gifts. Martial has a collection of poems written as if to be attached to gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Martial, Book 14 ''(Apophoreta)''; Williams, ''Martial: Epigrams'', p. 259; Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 148; Nauta, ''Poetry for Patrons,'' p. 79 ''et [http://books.google.com/books?id=EelGbtB7ppsC&amp;dq=intitle%3Apoetry+intitle%3Afor+intitle%3Apatrons&amp;q=saturnalia#v=snippet&amp;q=saturnalia&amp;f=false passim.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Catullus received a book of bad poems by &quot;the worst poet of all time&quot; as a joke from a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Catullus, ''Carmen'' 14; Robinson Ellis, ''A Commentary on Catullus'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1876), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gift-giving was not confined to the day of the Sigillaria. In some households, guests and family members received gifts after the feast in which slaves had shared.&lt;ref&gt;Dolansky, &quot;Celebrating the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the calendar==
[[File:Chronography of 354 Mensis December.png|thumb|Drawing from the Calendar of Philocalus depicting the month of December, with Saturnalian dice on the table]]
Saturnalia was supposed to have been held on December 17 from the time of the oldest [[Roman calendar|Roman religious calendar]],&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage,'' p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; which the Romans believed to have been established by the legendary founder [[Romulus]] and his successor [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]]. It was a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#festus|dies festus]],'' a legal holiday when no public business could be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage'', p. 63; Beard ''et al.,'' ''Religions of Rome: A History'', vol. 1, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The day marked the dedication of the Temple to Saturn in the Roman Forum in 497 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage'', p. 63; Mueller, &quot;Saturn,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the celebration of Saturnalia had expanded to a full seven days,&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.10.3, citing the [[Atellan Farce|Atellane]] composers [[Quintus Novius|Novius]] and Mummius; Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; but during the Imperial period contracted variously to three to five days.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, &quot;Roman Festivals,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Augustus]], there was a three-day official holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.10.23; Mueller, &quot;Saturn,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 221; Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caligula]] extended it to five.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Caligula'' 17; [[Cassius Dio]] 59.6.4; Mueller, &quot;Saturn,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 221; Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 268, citing [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] and ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' I.337.&lt;/ref&gt;

December 17 was the first day of the [[Capricorn (astrology)|astrological sign Capricorn]], the [[house (astrology)|house]] of [[Saturn|Saturn, the planet]] named for the god.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 268, note 3; Roger Beck, &quot;Ritual, Myth, Doctrine, and Initiation in the Mysteries of Mithras: New Evidence from a Cult Vessel,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 90 (2000), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Its proximity to the [[winter solstice]] (December 25 on the [[Julian calendar]]) was endowed with various meanings by both ancient and modern scholars; for instance, the widespread use of wax candles ''(cerei,'' singular ''cereus)'' may refer to &quot;the returning power of the sun's light after the solstice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 272. Fowler thought the use of candles influenced the Christmas rituals of the [[Latin Church]], and compared the symbolism of the candles to the [[yule log]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Saturnalia underwent a major reform in 217 BCE, after the [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]], when the Romans suffered one of their most crushing defeats by [[Carthage]] during the [[Second Punic War]]. Until that time, they had celebrated the holiday according to Roman custom ''([[mos maiorum|more Romano]])''. It was after a consultation of the [[Sibylline books]] that they adopted &quot;Greek rite&quot;, introducing sacrifices carried out in the Greek manner, the public banquet, and the continual shouts of ''io Saturnalia'' that became characteristic of the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 22.1.20; Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.10.18 (on the shout); Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage'', pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cato the Elder]] (234–149 BCE) was aware of a time before the so-called &quot;Greek&quot; elements had been added to the Roman Saturnalia.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage'', p. 64, citing the implications of Cato, frg. 77 ''ORF&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not unusual for the Romans to offer cult to the gods of other nations in the hope of redirecting their favor (see ''[[evocatio]]''), and the Second Punic War in particular created pressures on Roman society that led to a number of religious innovations and reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage'', ''passim''. See also the [[Cybele#Roman Cybele|importation of Cybele to Rome]] during this time.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E.A. Palmer]] has argued that the introduction of new rites at this time was in part an effort to appease [[Baal-hamon|Ba'al Hammon]], the [[Religion in Carthage|Carthaginian god]] who was regarded as the counterpart of the Roman Saturn and Greek [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage'', p. 64. For other scholars who have held this view, including those who precede Palmer, see Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 141–142, especially note 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The table service that masters offered their slaves thus would have extended to Carthaginian or African war captives.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''Rome and Carthage'', pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===King of the Saturnalia===
[[File:Lawrence Alma-Tadema 06.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Ave, Caesar! Io, Saturnalia!'' (1880) by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], with the [[Praetorian Guard]] hailing [[Claudius]] (veiling himself in a curtain) as the new emperor after the assassination of [[Caligula]]&lt;ref&gt;The painting represents a scene recorded by [[Josephus]], ''Antiquitates Iudiacae'' 19; and [[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#1 60.1.3.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Roman Empire|Imperial]] sources refer to a ''Saturnalicius princeps'' who ruled as master of ceremonies for the proceedings. He was appointed by lot, and has been compared to the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] at the [[Feast of Fools]]. His capricious commands, such as &quot;Sing naked&quot; or &quot;Throw him into cold water,&quot; had to be obeyed by the other guests at the ''convivium:'' he creates and (mis)rules a chaotic and absurd world. The future emperor [[Nero]] is recorded&lt;ref&gt;By [[Tacitus]], ''Annales'' 13.15.&lt;/ref&gt; as playing the role in his youth.

Since this figure does not appear in accounts from the [[Roman Republic|Republican period]], the ''princeps'' of the Saturnalia may have developed as a satiric response to Rome's transition from a participatory republic to imperial monarchy under a ''[[princeps]]'', the title assumed by the first emperor [[Augustus]] to avoid the hated connotations of the word &quot;king&quot; ''(rex)''. Art and [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|literature under Augustus]] celebrated his reign as a new Golden Age, but the Saturnalia makes a mockery of a world in which law is determined by one man and the traditional social and political networks are reduced to the power of the emperor over his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 206–208.&lt;/ref&gt; In a poem about a lavish Saturnalia under [[Domitian]], [[Statius]] makes it clear that the emperor, like [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], still reigns during the temporary return of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Silvae'' 1.6; Nauta, ''Poetry for Patrons'', p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology and philosophical views==
[[File:Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Saturn driving a ''[[quadriga]]'' on the reverse of a [[denarius]] issued in 104 BCE by the [[tribune|plebeian tribune]] [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]], with the head of the [[Roma (mythology)|goddess Roma]] on the obverse: Saturninus was a [[populares|popularist]] politician whose Saturnian imagery played on his name and evoked both his program of grain distribution and intent to subvert the social hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Saturnalia reflects the contradictory nature of the deity Saturn himself: &quot;there are joyful and utopian aspects of careless well-being side by side with disquieting elements of threat and danger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; in ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual'' (Brill, 1993, 1994), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a god of agricultural bounty, Saturn embodied prosperity and wealth in general. The name of his consort [[Ops]], whose festival [[Opalia]] was celebrated December 19, meant &quot;Wealth, Resources.&quot; The [[Temple of Saturn]], the ruins of which still stand, housed the state treasury ''([[aerarium|aerarium Saturni]])'', and was the administrative headquarters of the [[quaestor]]s, the public officials whose duties included oversight of the [[mint (coin)|mint]]. It was among the oldest cult sites in Rome, and had been the location of &quot;a very ancient&quot; altar ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|ara]])'' even before the building of the first temple in 497 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 136–137; Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans regarded Saturn as the original and [[autochthon (person)|autochthon]]ous ruler of the [[Capitolium]],&lt;ref&gt;The Capitolium had thus been called the ''Mons Saturnius'' in older times.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first king of [[Latium]] or even the whole of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there was a tradition that Saturn had been an immigrant god, received by [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] after he was usurped by his son [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] ([[Zeus]]) and expelled from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 139. The Roman theologian [[Varro]] listed Saturn among the [[List of Roman deities#Sabine gods|Sabine gods]].&lt;/ref&gt; His contradictions—a foreigner with one of Rome's oldest sanctuaries, and a god of liberation who is kept in fetters most of the year—indicate Saturn's capacity for obliterating social distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 139, 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman mythology of the Golden Age of Saturn's reign differed from the Greek tradition. He arrived in Italy &quot;dethroned and fugitive,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; but brought agriculture and civilization and became a king. As the Augustan poet [[Vergil]] described it, &quot;He gathered together the unruly race&quot; of [[faun]]s and [[nymph]]s &quot;scattered over mountain heights, and gave them laws … . Under his reign were the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he ruled the nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.320–325, as cited by Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Saturn also had a less benevolent aspect. Another of his consorts was [[Lua (goddess)|Lua]], sometimes called ''Lua Saturni'' (&quot;Saturn's Lua&quot;) and identified with Lua Mater, &quot;Mother Destruction,&quot; a goddess in whose honor the weapons of enemies killed in war were burned, perhaps as expiation.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, &quot;Saturn,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 222. Versnel, however, proposes that ''Lua Saturni'' should not be identified with ''Lua Mater'', but rather refers to &quot;loosening&quot;; she represents the liberating function of Saturn (&quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 144).&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn's [[chthonic]] nature connected him to the underworld and its ruler [[Dis Pater]], the Roman equivalent of Greek [[Pluto (mythology)|Plouton]] (Pluto in Latin) who was also a god of hidden wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 144–145. See also the [[Satre (Etruscan god)|Etruscan god Satre]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 3rd-century CE sources and later, Saturn is recorded as receiving dead [[gladiator]]s as offerings ''(munera)'' during or near the Saturnalia.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Ausonius]], ''Eclogue'' 23 and ''De feriis Romanis'' 33–7. See Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; pp. 146 and 211–212, and Thomas E.J. Wiedemann, ''Emperors and Gladiators'' (Routledge, 1992, 1995), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; These gladiatorial events, ten days in all throughout December, were presented by the quaestors and sponsored with funds from the treasury of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;Eight days were subsidized from the Imperial treasury ''(arca fisci)'', and two mostly by the sponsoring [[Roman Magistrates|magistrate]] himself; Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex-Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of gladiatorial ''munera'' was criticized by [[Christian apologists]] as a form of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, &quot;Saturn,&quot; in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 222; Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no evidence of this practice during the Republic, the offering of gladiators led to later theorizing that the primeval Saturn had demanded human victims. Macrobius says that Dis Pater was placated with human heads and Saturn with sacrificial victims consisting of men ''(virorum [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victimis]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.7.31; Versnel, &quot;Saturnus and the Saturnalia,&quot; p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The figurines that were exchanged as gifts ''([[sigillaria (ancient Rome)|sigillaria]])'' may have represented token substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.10.24; Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 166. For other Roman practices that may represent substitutes for human sacrifice, see [[Argei]] and [[oscilla]], the latter of which were used also at the [[Feriae Latinae|Latin Festival]] and the [[Compitalia]]: Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Disc Sol BM GR1899.12-1.2.jpg|thumb|left|Roman disc in silver depicting Sol Invictus (from [[Pessinus]] in [[Phrygia]], 3rd century CE)]]
The [[Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], however, took an allegorical view of the Saturnalia. He saw the festival's theme of liberation and dissolution as representing the &quot;freeing of souls into immortality&quot;—an interpretation that [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithraists]] also may have followed, since they included a significant number of slaves and freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], ''De antro'' 23, following [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], as cited by Roger Beck, &quot;''Qui Mortalitatis Causa Convenerunt'': The Meeting of the Virunum Mithraists on June 26, CE 184,&quot; ''Phoenix'' 52 (1998), p. 340. One of the speakers in Macrobius's ''Saturnalia'' is [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]], a Mithraist.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Porphyry, the Saturnalia occurred near the [[winter solstice]] because the sun enters [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], the [[House (astrology)|astrological house]] of Saturn, at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Beck, &quot;Ritual, Myth, Doctrine, and Initiation in the Mysteries of Mithras: New Evidence from a Cult Vessel,&quot; ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 90 (2000), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Saturnalia'' of Macrobius, the proximity of the Saturnalia to the winter solstice leads to an exposition of solar [[monotheism]],&lt;ref&gt;R. van den Broek, &quot;The Sarapis Oracle in Macrobius ''Sat.'', I, 20, 16–17,&quot; in ''Hommages à Maarten J. Vermaseren'' (Brill, 1978), vol. 1, p. 123ff.&lt;/ref&gt; the belief that the Sun (see [[Sol Invictus]]) ultimately encompasses all divinities as one. Perceived relations among the [[Mithraic mysteries]], the ''Dies Natalis'' of Sol Invictus (the &quot;Birthday of the Unconquered Sun&quot;) on December 25, and the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christian Nativity]] as celebrated in December are a matter of longstanding and complex scholarly debate.

The [[Mishna]] and [[Talmud]] (Avodah Zara 8a) describe a pagan festival called Saturna which occurs 8 days before the winter solstice. It is followed 8 days after the solstice with a festival called [[Kalends|Kalenda]]. The Talmud ascribes the origins of this festival to [[Adam]], who saw that the days were getting shorter and thought it was punishment for his sin. He was afraid that the world was returning to the chaos and emptiness that existed before creation. He sat and fasted for 8 days. Once he saw that the days were getting longer again he realized that this was the natural cycle of the world, so made 8 days of celebration. The Talmud states that this festival was later turned into a pagan festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tanach.org/special/chanuka2.txt A portion of Avodah Zarah 8, quoted in Menachem Leibtag's ''Chanuka - Its Biblical Roots - Part Two''], hosted on [http://www.tanach.org/ The Tanach Study Center]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chagim.org.il/oldsite/chen50.html A portion of Avodah Zarah 8, quoted in Ebn Leader's ''The Darkness of Winter - Environmental reflections on Hanukah''], hosted on [http://www.chagim.org.il/ The Kibbutz Institute for Holidays and Jewish Culture].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Christmas==
Unlike several Roman religious festivals which were particular to cult sites in the city, the prolonged seasonal celebration of Saturnalia at home could be held anywhere in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Woolf, &quot;Found in Translation: The Religion of the Roman Diaspora,&quot; in ''Ritual Dynamics and Religious Change in the Roman Empire. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Heidelberg, July 5–7, 2007)'' (Brill, 2009), p. 249. See [[Aulus Gellius]] 18.2.1 for Romans living in Athens and celebrating the Saturnalia.&lt;/ref&gt; Saturnalia continued as a secular celebration long after it was removed from the official calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, &quot;Religious ''Koine'' and Religious Dissent,&quot; in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[William Warde Fowler]] noted, Saturnalia &quot;has left its traces and found its parallels in great numbers of mediaeval and modern customs, occurring about the time of the winter solstice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars view aspects of the Saturnalia festival as the origin of some later [[Christmas]] customs, particularly [[caroling]] and the practice of [[Gift economy|gift giving]], which was suppressed by the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Middle Ages]] due to perceived &quot;pagan origins&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OriginMyth&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110430004539/http://www.bsu.edu/web/01bkswartz/xmaspub.html The Origin of the American Christmas Myth and Customs] – ''Ball State University''. Swartz Jr., BK. Archived version retrieved 2011-10-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states the Church's view on the latter claim by saying that while midwinter pagan feasts such as Saturnalia may have helped influence the eventual choice to fix the date of Christmas, this does not mean that Christian Christmas traditions find their origin or inspiration there:  &quot;though the abundance of analogous midwinter festivals may indefinitely have helped the choice of the December date, the same instinct which set ''[[Natalis Invicti]]'' at the winter solstice will have sufficed, apart from deliberate adaptation or curious calculation, to set the Christian feast there too.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, Cyril,  &quot;Christmas: History and Celebration,&quot; ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1912 -- http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Christmas&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the ancient roman saturnalia, human-shaped biscuits were consumed and dance-like singing was performed in the streets, which makes it a &quot;precursor of modern [[gingerbread man]]&quot; and [[caroling]]. The ancient roman saturnalia were integrated in Christianity in the 4th century CE, as a means to [[Religious conversion|mass convert]] the pagan roman citizens.&lt;ref name=simpletoremember-xmas&gt;{{cite web|last=KELEMEN|first=LAWRENCE|title=The History of Christmas|url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/Christmas_TheRealStory.htm|publisher=SimpleToRemember.com|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;Because its pagan origin was known, the [[Christmas]] festival was banned in Massachusetts between 1659 and 1681 by the [[Puritans]] as an illegal observance. &lt;ref name=nissenbaum&gt;{{cite book|last=Nissenbaum|first=Stephen|title=The battle for Christmas|year=1997|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679740384|pages=3-4|edition=1st Vintage Books ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ruben&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph|first=Ruben|title=Why Are The Young People Leaving The Church|year=2011|publisher=Xlibris, Corp.|isbn=978-1465343796|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=iZ9U0BAV8MwC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=University+of+Massachusetts,+Amherst+Nissenbaum+Christmas+illegal+observance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3By-XHLsPS&amp;sig=D0jBaZHomLl6sCnWV70DHGNUlLs&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2auTUKKWFYWztAax_YC4DA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=University%20of%20Massachusetts%2C%20Amherst%20Nissenbaum%20Christmas%20illegal%20observance&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
