&lt;!-- Do ''not'' change the lede without taking it to discussion first AND achieving a consensus --&gt;
'''Marriage''' (also called '''matrimony''' or '''wedlock''') {{Citation needed span|text=is a social union or legal contract between people&lt;!--DO ''not'' change it to man and woman, it will be reverted. Discuss it on the talkpage if you are not OK with it--&gt; called [[spouse]]s that creates [[kinship]].|reason=This claim requires an explicit reference to the source of its origin|date=November 2012}} The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but is usually an [[institution]] in which interpersonal relationships, usually intimate and sexual, are acknowledged. Such a union is often formalized via a [[wedding]] ceremony. In terms of legal recognition, most sovereign states and other jurisdictions limit marriage to two persons of opposite [[sex]] or [[gender]] in the [[gender binary]], and some of these allow [[Polygyny|polygynous marriage]]. Since 2000, several countries and some other jurisdictions have legalized [[same-sex marriage]]. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or compulsory before pursuing any [[pre-marital sex|sexual activity]].

People marry for many reasons, including: legal, social, being in love, [[libido|libidinal]], emotional, financial, spiritual, and religious. Marriages can be performed in a secular [[Civil marriage|civil ceremony]] or in a religious setting. The act of marriage usually creates [[normative]] or legal obligations between the individuals involved. Some cultures allow the dissolution of marriage through [[divorce]] or [[annulment]]. Polygamous marriages may also occur in spite of national laws.

Marriage can be recognized by a [[State (polity)|state]], an [[organization]], a religious authority, a [[tribe|tribal group]], a local [[community]] or peers. It is often viewed as a [[contract]]. Civil marriage is the legal concept of marriage as a governmental institution irrespective of religious affiliation, in accordance with [[marriage law]]s of the jurisdiction. [[Forced marriage]]s are illegal in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2008 Vol.1 - Page 1353&lt;/ref&gt; 

A survey in the United Kingdom in 2011 showed that people who are married are more likely to be happy than those who are not married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18966729 ONS well-being report reveals UK's happiness ratings] retrieved 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that 50% of first marriages in America end in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divorcerate.org/ Information on divorce rates and statistics] retrieved 31 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

ISBN 0-554-50635-1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anthropologists have proposed several competing definitions of marriage so as to encompass the wide variety of marital practices observed across cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Duran|title=Defining Marriage and Legitimacy|work=Current Anthropology|year=1997|volume=38|issue=2|pages=237–254}} Bell describes marriage as &quot;a relationship between one or more men (male or female) in severalty to one or more women that provides those men with a demand-right of sexual access within a domestic group and identifies women who bear the obligation of yielding to the demands of those specific men.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The History of Human Marriage'' (1921), [[Edvard Westermarck]] defined marriage as &quot;a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Westermarck&quot;&gt;Westermarck, Edvard, (1921) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ShU3N7_GaMYC The History of Human Marriage Volume 1]'', p. 71. ISBN 0-7661-4618-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Future of Marriage in Western Civilization'' (1936), he rejected his earlier definition, instead provisionally defining marriage as &quot;a relation of one or more men to one or more women that is recognized by custom or law&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Westermarck2&quot;&gt;Westermarck, Edvard, (1936) ''[http://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ8LyGDtSZIC The Future of Marriage in Western Civilization]'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropological handbook ''Notes and Queries'' (1951) defined marriage as &quot;a union between a man and a woman such that children born to the woman are the recognized legitimate offspring of both partners.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Notes and Queries on Anthropology|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute|year=1951|pages=, p. 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of a practice by the Nuer of Sudan allowing women to act as a husband in certain circumstances, [[Kathleen Gough]] suggested modifying this to &quot;a woman and one or more other persons.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gough&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|last=Gough|first=E. Kathleen|title=The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage|work=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1959|pages=89:23–34}} Nuer female-female marriage is done to keep property within a family that has no sons. It is not a form of lesbianism.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Leach]] criticized Gough's definition for being too restrictive in terms of recognized legitimate offspring and suggested that marriage be viewed in terms of the different types of rights it serves to establish. Leach expanded the definition and proposed that &quot;Marriage is a relationship established between a woman and one or more other persons, which provides that a child born to the woman under circumstances not prohibited by the rules of the relationship, is accorded full birth-status rights common to normal members of his society or social stratum&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gudeman&quot;&gt;Gudeman, Stephen, (1976) ''Relationships, residence and the individual'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Leach argued that no one definition of marriage applied to all cultures. He offered a list of ten rights associated with marriage, including sexual monopoly and rights with respect to children, with specific rights differing across cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leach&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Leach|first=Edmund|title=Polyandry, Inheritance and the Definition of Marriage|work=Man|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Duran Bell]] also criticized the legitimacy-based definition on the basis that some societies do not require marriage for legitimacy, arguing that in societies where illegitimacy means only that the mother is unmarried and has no other legal implications, a legitimacy-based definition of marriage is circular. He proposed defining marriage in terms of sexual access rights.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bell&quot; /&gt;

==Etymology==
The word &quot;marriage&quot; derives from [[Middle English]] ''mariage'', which first appears in 1250–1300 [[Common Era|CE]] This in turn is derived from [[Old French]] ''marier'' (to marry) and ultimately [[Latin]] ''marītāre'' meaning to provide with a husband or wife and ''marītāri'' meaning to get married.  (The adjective ''marīt-us -a, -um'' meaning matrimonial or nuptial could also be used in the masculine form as a noun for &quot;husband&quot; and in the feminine form for &quot;wife.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OED_marriage&quot;&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 11th Edition, &quot;marriage&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
The related word &quot;matrimony&quot; derives from the Old French word ''matremoine'' which appears around 1300 [[Common Era|CE]] and ultimately derives from Latin ''mātrimōnium'' which combines the two concepts ''mater'' meaning &quot;[[mother]]&quot; and the suffix -''monium'' signifying &quot;action, state, or condition.&quot; &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=matrimony |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of marriage by culture==

Although the institution of marriage pre-dates reliable [[recorded history]], many cultures have legends concerning the origins of marriage. The way in which a marriage is conducted and its rules and ramifications  has changed over time, as has the institution itself, depending on the culture or demographic of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse&quot;&gt;Hobhouse, Leonard Trelawny (1906) Morals in evolution: a study in comparative ethics (Page 180)&lt;/ref&gt; Various cultures have had their own theories on the origin of marriage. One example may lie in a man's need for assurance as to paternity of his children. He might therefore be willing to pay a bride price or provide for a woman in exchange for exclusive sexual access.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bell&quot; /&gt; [[Legitimacy (law)|Legitimacy]] is the consequence of this transaction rather than its motivation. In [[Comanche]] society, married women work harder, lose sexual freedom, and do not seem to obtain any benefit from marriage.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bell&quot; /&gt; But [[nubile]] women are a source of jealousy and strife in the tribe, so they are given little choice other than to get married. &quot;In almost all societies, access to women is institutionalized in some way so as to moderate the intensity of this competition.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bell&quot; /&gt;
Forms of [[group marriage]] which involve more than one member of each sex, and therefore are not either [[polygyny]] or [[polyandry]], have existed in history. However, these forms of marriage are extremely rare. Of the 250 societies reported by the American anthropologist George P. Murdock in 1949, only the [[Caingang]] of Brazil had any group marriages at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/247131/group-marriage|title=Group Marriage|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online| accessdate = January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Types of marriages|marriage practices]] have existed throughout the world.  In some societies an individual is limited to being in one such couple at a time (''[[monogamy]]''), while other cultures allow a male to have more than one [[wife]] (''[[polygyny]]'') or, less commonly, a female to have more than one [[husband]] (''[[polyandry]]''). Some societies also allow marriage between two males or two females. Societies frequently have other restrictions on marriage based on the ages of the participants, pre-existing kinship, and membership in religious or other social groups.

===Ancient Israel===
&lt;!---taken from article, &quot;Jewish views on marriage&quot;---&gt;

A wife was seen as being of high value, and was therefore, usually, carefully looked after.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; Early nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as ''[[Beena marriage|beena]]'', in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband;&lt;ref name=&quot;WRSKinship167&quot;&gt;[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885),  167&lt;/ref&gt; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession&lt;ref name=&quot;WRSKinship167&quot; /&gt; (specifically, [[Jael]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|4:7|}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|24:26|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacob's wives&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|31:33-34|}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|15:1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|16:9|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:8|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:15|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not, however, a life of complete freedom&lt;!-- ''a life of riley'' would be better, if there was an article for it--&gt;. The descriptions of the Bible suggest that a wife was expected to perform certain household tasks: spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|2:16|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|2:19|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|8:13|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Proverbs]] contains an entire [[acrostic]] about the duties which would be performed by a ''virtuous'' wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Proverbs|31:10-31|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The husband too, is indirectly implied to have some responsibilities to his wife. The [[Covenant Code]] orders men who have two wives ([[polygyny|polygynously]]) to not deprive the first wife of food, of clothing, nor of sexual activity;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:11|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncHusWif&quot;&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Husband and Wife|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=H&amp;artid=986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[polygyny|polygynous]]&lt;!--this is NOT a spelling mistake for 'polygamous'--&gt; society, the Israelites did not have any laws which imposed marital fidelity on men.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackJeal&quot;&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Jealousy, Ordeal of|section=Jannaeus-Jerah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncAdu&quot;&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=Adultery|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=865&amp;letter=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adultery|Adulterous]] married women and adulterous betrothed women, however, were subject to the [[death penalty]] by [[Adultery#In the Hebrew Bible|the biblical laws against adultery]], as were their male accomplices.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:40|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22-25|}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Priestly Code]] of the [[Book of Numbers]], if a pregnant&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]'' (1962 edition), ad loc&lt;/ref&gt; woman was suspected of adultery, she was to be subjected to the [[Ordeal of the bitter water|Ordeal of Bitter Water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:11-31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[trial by ordeal]], but one that took a miracle to convict. The [[literary prophets]] indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite their strong protests against it,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|7:9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hosea|4:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:5|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these legal strictnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackJeal&quot; /&gt;

===Europe===

In [[Ancient Greece]], no specific civil ceremony was required for the creation of a [[Ancient Greek marriage law|marriage]] – only mutual agreement and the fact that the couple must regard each other as husband and wife accordingly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Men usually married when they were in their 20s {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and women in their teens. It has been suggested that these ages made sense for the Greeks because men were generally done with military service or financially established by their late 20s, and marrying a young girl ensured ample time for her to bear children, as life expectancies were significantly lower during this period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  Married Greek women had few rights in ancient Greek society and were expected to take care of the house and children.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Time was an important factor in Greek marriage. For example, there were superstitions that being married during a [[full moon]] was good luck and, according to [[Robert Flacelière]], Greeks married in the winter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  Inheritance was more important than feelings: a woman whose father dies without male heirs could be forced to marry her nearest male relative—even if she had to divorce her husband first.&lt;ref name = &quot;PT&quot;&gt;&quot;Marriage, a History.&quot; ''Psychology Today,'' May 01, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several types of marriages in ancient Roman society. The traditional (&quot;conventional&quot;) form called ''conventio in manum'' required a ceremony with witnesses and was also dissolved with a ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;magnusHirschfeldSexology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/history_of_marriage_in_western.html |title=Magnus Hirschfeld Archive of Sexology |publisher=.hu-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of marriage, a woman lost her family rights of inheritance of her old family and gained them with her new one. She now was subject to the authority of her husband.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} There was the free marriage known as ''sine manu''. In this arrangement, the wife remained a member of her original family; she stayed under the authority of her father, kept her family rights of inheritance with her old family and did not gain any with the new family.&lt;ref name=&quot;RomanEmpireMarriage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/society/soc-marriage.html |title=Roman empire.net marriage |publisher=Roman-empire.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum age of marriage for girls was 12.&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, Susan. [http://books.google.com/books?id=I0J1A6o4GuQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=susan%20treggiari&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges from the Time of Cicero to the Time of Ulpian]. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes, the bride and groom were roughly the same age and generally older than their Roman counterparts, according to [[Tacitus]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; The young men marry late and their vigor is thereby unimpaired. The girls, too, are not hurried into marriage. As old and full-grown as the men, they match their mates in age and strength, and their children reproduce the might of their parents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Where [[Aristotle]] had set the prime of life at 37 years for men and 18 for women, the [[Visigothic Code|Visigothic Code of law]] in the 7th century placed the prime of life at twenty years for both men and women, after which both presumably married. It can be presumed that most ancient Germanic women were at least twenty years of age when they married and were roughly the same age as their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, David. 1985. ''Medieval Households''. Harvard University Press. 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[early Christian]] era (30 to 325 CE), marriage was thought of as primarily a private matter, with no uniform religious or other ceremony being required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marriage, sex, and civic culture in late medieval London |last=McSheffrey

In the 12th century{{Where|date=July 2011}}, women were obligated to take the name of their husbands and starting in the second half of the 16th century{{Where|date=July 2011}} parental consent along with the church's consent was required for marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;those_terrible_middle_ages&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Pernoud|first1 = Régine|title = Those terrible Middle Ages: debunking the myths|year = 2000|publisher = Ignatius Press| location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-0-89870-781-6|page = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With few local exceptions, until 1545, Christian marriages in Europe were by mutual consent, declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;upennExcerptFromBook&quot;&gt;[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/toc/14042.html upenn.edu Excerpt from Marriage, Sex, and Civic Culture in Late Medieval London] &quot;''the sacramental bond of marriage could be made only through the freely given consent of both parties''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;marriageDotAbout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/cs/generalhistory/a/marriagehistory.htm |title=marriage.about.com |publisher=marriage.about.com |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple would promise verbally to each other that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or witnesses was not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploregenealogy.co.uk/FindingEarlyMarriageRecords.html |title=Marriage Records |publisher=Exploregenealogy.co.uk |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This promise was known as the &quot;verbum.&quot; If freely given and made in the present tense (e.g., &quot;I marry you&quot;), it was unquestionably binding;&lt;ref name=&quot;upennExcerptFromBook&quot;/&gt; if made in the future tense (&quot;I will marry you&quot;), it would constitute a [[betrothal]]. One of the functions of churches from the [[Middle Ages]] was to register marriages, which was not obligatory. There was no state involvement in marriage and personal status, with these issues being adjudicated in [[ecclesiastical courts]]. During the Middle Ages marriages were arranged, sometimes as early as birth, and these early pledges to marry were often used to ensure treaties between different royal families, nobles, and heirs of fiefdoms. The church resisted these imposed unions, and increased the number of causes for nullification of these arrangements.&lt;ref name=&quot;those_terrible_middle_ages&quot;/&gt; As Christianity spread during the Roman period and the Middle Ages, the idea of free choice in selecting marriage partners increased and spread with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;those_terrible_middle_ages&quot;/&gt;

The average age of marriage for most [[North-West Europe|Northwestern Europeans]] from the late 14th century into the 19th century was around [[Hajnal line|25 years of age]];&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Linda. 2010.

As part of the [[Protestant Reformation]], the role of recording marriages and setting the rules for marriage passed to the state, reflecting [[Martin Luther]]'s view that marriage was a &quot;worldly thing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=History of Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, many of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] European countries had a state involvement in marriage. As of 2000, the average marriage age range was 25–44 years for men and 22–39 years for women. In England, under the Anglican Church, marriage by consent and cohabitation was valid until the passage of [[Lord Hardwicke's Act]] in 1753. This act instituted certain requirements for marriage, including the performance of a religious ceremony observed by witnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;WestLaw&quot;&gt;''West's Encyclopedia of American Law, 2nd Edition.'' Thomson Gale, 2005. ISBN 0-7876-6367-0&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Counter-Reformation]], in 1563 the [[Council of Trent]] decreed that a [[Roman Catholic]] marriage would be recognized only if the marriage ceremony was officiated by a priest with two witnesses. The Council also authorized a [[Catechism]], issued in 1566, which defined marriage as, &quot;The conjugal union of man and woman, contracted between two qualified persons, which obliges them to live together throughout life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Witte Jr.|first=John|title=From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year = 1997|pages = 39–40|isbn=0-664-25543-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[early modern period]], [[John Calvin]] and his [[Protestant]] colleagues reformulated Christian marriage by enacting the Marriage Ordinance of Geneva, which imposed &quot;The dual requirements of state registration and church consecration to constitute marriage&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte&quot;/&gt; for recognition.

In England and [[Wales]], Lord Hardwicke's [[Marriage Act 1753]] required a formal ceremony of marriage, thereby curtailing the practice of [[Fleet Marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/17.1/leneman.html|title=The Scottish Case That Led to Hardwicke's Marriage Act|last=Leneman|first=Leah|year=1999|publisher=Law and History Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were clandestine or irregular marriages performed at Fleet Prison, and at hundreds of other places. From the 1690s until the Marriage Act of 1753 as many as 300,000 clandestine marriages were performed at Fleet Prison alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=For Better, for Worse: British Marriages, 1600 to the Present|last=Gillis|first=John R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn = 0-19-503614-X|year=1985|url=http://books.google.com/?id=t3kiLAQxrnMC|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act required a marriage ceremony to be officiated by an Anglican priest in the [[Anglican Church]] with two witnesses and registration. The Act did not apply to Jewish marriages or those of Quakers, whose marriages continued to be governed by their own customs.

In England and Wales, since 1837, civil marriages have been recognized as a legal alternative to church marriages under the [[Marriage Act 1836]]. In Germany, civil marriages were recognized in 1875. This law permitted a declaration of the marriage before an official clerk of the civil administration, when both spouses affirm their will to marry, to constitute a legally recognized valid and effective marriage, and allowed an optional private clerical marriage ceremony.

In contemporary [[English common law]], a marriage is a voluntary [[contract]] by a man and a woman, in which by agreement they choose to become husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Marriage |title=Marriage&amp;#124;LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Topics.law.cornell.edu |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edvard Westermarck proposed that &quot;the institution of marriage has probably developed out of a primeval habit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Human Marriage|last=Westermarck|first=Edward Alexander|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan and Co., Ltd., London]]|year=1903|isbn=1-4021-8548-0 (reprint)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Main|Chinese marriage}}

The mythological origin of Chinese marriage is a story about [[Nüwa]] and [[Fu Xi]] who invented proper marriage procedures after becoming married. In ancient Chinese society, people of the same surname are supposed to consult with their [[family tree]]s prior marriage to reduce the potential risk of unintentional incest. Marriaging to one's maternal relatives was generally not thought of as incest, families sometimes intermarried from one generation to another. Over time, Chinese people became more geographically mobile. Individuals remained members of their biological families. When a couple died, the husband and the wife were buried separately in the respective clans’ graveyard. In a maternal marriage, a male would become a son-in-law who lived in the wife's home.

The [[New Marriage Law]] of 1950 radically changed Chinese marriage traditions, enforcing [[monogamy]], equality of men and women, and choice in marriage; [[arranged marriage]]s were the most common type of marriage in China until then.

===Civil unions===
{{Main|Civil union}}

A ''civil union'', also referred to as a ''civil partnership'', is a legally recognized form of partnership similar to marriage. Beginning with [[Registered partnership in Denmark|Denmark]] in 1989, civil unions under one name or another have been established by law in several countries in order to provide [[homosexuality|same-sex couples]] [[right]]s, benefits, and [[Moral responsibility|responsibilities]] similar (in some countries, identical) to opposite-sex civil marriage. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, such as [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Civil union in New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Civil unions in Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Civil solidarity pact|France]] and the U.S. states of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Hawaii|Hawaii]] and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Illinois|Illinois]], civil unions are also open to opposite-sex couples.

==Group marriage==
[[Group marriage]] also known as multi-lateral marriage, is a form of [[polyamory]]  in which more than two persons form a [[family]] unit, with all the members of the group marriage being considered to be married to all the other members of the group marriage, and all members of the marriage share [[parent]]al responsibility for any children arising from the marriage.&lt;ref name=murdock-1949-definition&gt;Murdock, 1949, p. 24. &quot;''group marriage'' or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; No country legally condones group marriages, neither under the law nor as a common law marriage, but historically it has been practiced by some cultures of Polynesia, Asia, Papua New Guinea and the Americas - as well as in some [[intentional communities]] and alternative subcultures.

==Selection of a partner==
{{Main|Arranged marriage|Forced marriage}}
[[File:Lodewijk XIV-Marriage.jpg|thumb|left|An arranged marriage between [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].]]

There is wide cross-cultural variation in the social rules governing the selection of a partner for marriage. There is variation in the degree to which partner selection is an individual decision by the partners or a collective decision by the partners' kin groups, and there is variation in the rules regulating which partners are valid choices.

In many societies the choice of partner is limited to suitable persons from specific social groups. In some societies the rule is that a partner is selected from an individual's own social group – [[endogamy]], this is the case in many class and caste based societies. But in other societies a partner must be chosen from a different group than one's own – [[exogamy]], this is the case in many societies practicing [[totem]]ic religion where society is divided into several exogamous totemic clans, such as most [[Aboriginal Australian]] societies.  In other societies a person is expected to marry their [[cross-cousin]], a woman must marry her father's sister's son and a man must marry his mother's brother's daughter – this is often the case if either a society has a rule of tracing kinship exclusively through patrilineal or matrilineal descent groups as among the [[Akan people]] of Africa. Another kind of marriage selection is the [[levirate marriage]] in which widows are obligated to marry their husband's brother, mostly found in societies where kinship is based on endogamous clan groups.

In other cultures with less strict rules governing the groups from which a partner can be chosen the selection of a marriage partner may involve either the couple going through a selection process of [[courtship]] or the marriage may be [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by the couple's parents or an outside party, a [[matchmaking|matchmaker]].

A pragmatic (or 'arranged') marriage is made easier by formal procedures of family or group politics. A responsible authority sets up or encourages the marriage; they may, indeed, engage a professional [[matchmaking|matchmaker]] to find a suitable spouse for an unmarried person. The authority figure could be parents, family, a religious official, or a group consensus. In some cases, the authority figure may choose a match for purposes other than marital harmony.

In rural Indian villages, [[child marriage]] is also practiced, with parents at times arranging the wedding, sometimes even before the child is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/presskit/factsheets/facts_child_marriage.htm |title=Child Marriage Factsheet: State of World Population 2005  |publisher=UNFPA|date= |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was made illegal under the [[Child Marriage Restraint Act]] of 1929.

In some societies ranging from [[Central Asia]] to the [[Caucasus]] to Africa, the custom of [[bride kidnapping]] still exists, in which a woman is captured by a man and his friends. Sometimes this covers an [[elopement]], but sometimes it depends on [[sexual violence]]. In previous times, ''[[raptio]]'' was a larger-scale version of this, with groups of women captured by groups of men, sometimes in war; the most famous example is [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]], which provided the first citizens of Rome with their wives.

Other marriage partners are more or less imposed on an individual. For example, [[widow inheritance]] provides a widow with another man from her late husband's brothers.

==Marriage ceremony==
{{Main|Wedding}}
[[File:Shinto married couple.jpg|thumb|upright|Couple married in a [[Shinto]] ceremony in [[Takayama, Gifu]] prefecture.]]

A marriage is usually formalized at a wedding or marriage ceremony. The ceremony may be officiated either by a religious official, by a government official or by a state approved celebrant. In many European and some Latin American countries, any religious ceremony must be held separately from the required civil ceremony. Some countries – such as Belgium, [[Bulgaria]], France, the Netherlands, [[Romania]] and [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.wwhr.org/images/CivilandPenalCodeReforms.pdf Turkish Civil and Penal Code Reforms from a Gender Perspective: The Success of two Nationwide Campaigns]|6.21 MB}} (p. 18)&lt;/ref&gt; – require that a civil ceremony take place before any religious one. In some countries – notably the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the [[Republic of Ireland]], Norway and Spain – both ceremonies can be held together; the officiant at the religious and civil ceremony also serving as agent of the state to perform the civil ceremony. To avoid any implication that the state is &quot;recognizing&quot; a religious marriage (which is prohibited in some countries) – the &quot;civil&quot; ceremony is said to be taking place at the same time as the religious ceremony. Often this involves simply signing a register during the religious ceremony. If the civil element of the religious ceremony is omitted, the marriage is not recognized by government under the law.

While some countries, such as Australia, permit marriages to be held in private and at any location, others, including [[England and Wales]], require that the civil ceremony be conducted in a place open to the public and specially sanctioned by law. In England, the place of marriage need no longer be a church or [[register office]], but could also be a hotel, historic building or other venue that has obtained the necessary license. An exception can be made in the case of marriage by special emergency license, which is normally granted only when one of the parties is terminally ill. Rules about where and when persons can marry vary from place to place. Some regulations require that one of the parties reside in the locality of the registry office.

Within the parameters set by the law of the jurisdiction in which a marriage or wedding takes place, each religious authority has rules for the manner in which weddings are to be conducted by their officials and members.

==Cohabitation==
{{See also|Cohabitation}}

Marriage is an institution which can join together people's lives in a variety of [[emotion]]al and [[economics|economic]] ways. In many Western cultures, marriage usually leads to the formation of a new household comprising the married couple, with the married couple living together in the same home, often sharing the same bed, but in some other cultures this is not the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenblatt|first=Paul C.|title=Two in a Bed: The Social System of Couple Bed Sharing|year = 2006|publisher = State University of New York Press|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/details.asp?id=61306|isbn=0-7914-6829-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of [[West Sumatra]], residency after marriage is [[matrilocality|matrilocal]], with the husband moving into the household of his wife's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|title=Women at the center: life in a modern matriarchy|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8014-8906-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residency after marriage can also be [[patrilocal]] or [[avunculocal residence|avunculocal]]. Such marriages have also been increasingly common in [[Beijing]]. Guo Jianmei, director of the center for women's studies at Beijing University, told a [[Newsday]] correspondent, &quot;Walking marriages reflect sweeping changes in Chinese society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gargan|first=Edward A.|title=China's New Brides Put Freedom First/All perks, no work in 'walking marriages'|pages=A.04|publisher=[[Newsday]]|date=2001-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar arrangement in [[Saudi Arabia]], called [[Nikah Misyar|misyar marriage]], also involves the husband and wife living separately but meeting regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karam|first=Souhail|title=Misyar offers marriage-lite in strict Saudi society|publisher= Reuters| date = July 21, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/07/21/misyar_offers_marriage_lite_in_strict_saudi_society/}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, marriage is not a prerequisite for [[cohabitation]]. In some cases couples living together do not wish to be recognized as married, such as when pension or alimony rights are adversely affected, or because of taxation consideration, or because of immigration issues, and for many other reasons. In western societies some couples cohabitate before marriage to test whether such an arrangement might work in the long term.

In some cases cohabitation may constitute a common-law marriage, and in some countries the laws recognize cohabitation in preference to the formality of marriage for taxation and social security benefits. This is the case, for example, in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1997240/s995.1.html Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 – Sect 995.1(1)]: &quot;&quot;spouse&quot; of an individual includes: (a) another individual (whether of the same sex or a different sex) with whom the individual is in a relationship that is registered under a * State law or * Territory law prescribed for the purposes of section 22B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 as a kind of relationship prescribed for the purposes of that section; and (b) another individual who, although not legally married to the individual, lives with the individual on a genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual relations by a married person with someone other than his/her spouse is known as [[adultery]] and is also frequently disapproved by the major world religions (some calling it a [[sin]]). Adultery is considered in many jurisdictions to be a crime and [[grounds for divorce]].

Historically, and still in many countries, children born outside of marriage suffered severe social stigma and discrimination. In England and Wales, such children were known as [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastards and whoresons]]. 

Today, in the European countries, as well as in Latin America, the situation has changed radically, and children born outside marriage have become very common, and in some countries, the norm. [[Latin America]] has the highest rates of non-marital childbearing in the world (55–74% of all children in this region are born to un-married parents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustaindemographicdividend.org/articles/international-family-indicators/global-childrens-trends |title=Global Children’s Trends &amp;#124; The Sustainable Demographic Dividend |publisher=Sustaindemographicdividend.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Births outside marriage are also the norm in much of Northern Europe and some countries of the former Communist Bloc. In 2011, a very high level of extramarital births were found in [[Iceland]] (65%), [[Estonia]] (59.7%), [[Slovenia]] (56.8%), [[Bulgaria]] (56.1%), [[Norway]] (55%), [[Sweden]] (54.2%).&lt;ref name=&quot;europa1&quot;&gt;http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/dataset?p_product_code=TPS00018&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 2009 showed that in that year, in the [[European Union]], 37.3% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref name=&quot;europa1&quot;/&gt;

In the United States, births outside marriage are not as socially accepted as in other Western countries, but their prevalence has increased too, and social views have also become more positive. In 1992, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that 30.1% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Richard E.| coauthors=Kristin H.

Some married couples choose not to have children and so remain [[childfree]]. Others are unable to have children because of [[infertility]] or other factors preventing [[Conception (biology)|conception]] or the bearing of children. In some cultures, marriage imposes an ''obligation'' on women to bear children. In northern [[Ghana]], for example, payment of [[bridewealth]] signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face substantial threats of physical abuse and reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bawah|first=AA.|coauthors=Akweongo P, Simmons R, Phillips JF.|title=Women's fears and men's anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in northern Ghana|journal=Studies in Family Planning|volume = 30| issue =1|pages=54–66|publisher=Population Council|year=1999|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.1999.00054.x|accessdate=2008-12-29|pmid=10216896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage law==
{{Main|Marriage law}}

'''Marriage laws''' refer to the legal requirements which determine the validity of a marriage, which vary considerably between countries.

===Common-law marriage===
{{See also|Common-law marriage}}

In a small number of jurisdictions marriage relationships may be created by the operation of the law alone. Unlike the typical [[ceremonial marriage]] with legal contract, wedding ceremony, and other details, a [[common-law marriage]] may be called &quot;marriage by habit and repute (cohabitation).&quot; A '''de facto''' common-law marriage without a license or ceremony is legally binding in some jurisdictions but has no legal consequence in others.&lt;ref name=Nolo&gt;&quot;Common Law Marriage FAQ.&quot; ''Nolo.'' July 31, 2009. [http://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/objectID/709FAEE4-ABEA-4E17-BA34836388313A3C/118/304/192/FAQ/ Nolo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights and obligations===
{{See also|Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States}}
[[File:V03p128a01 Ketubah.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Ketubah]] in Hebrew, a Jewish marriage-contract outlining the duties of each partner.]]

A marriage bestows rights and obligations on the married parties, and sometimes on [[kinship|relatives]] as well, being the sole mechanism for the creation of [[affinity (law)|affinal ties]] (in-laws). These may include, depending on jurisdiction:

* Giving a husband/wife or his/her family control over a spouse's sexual services, labor, and property.
* Giving a husband/wife responsibility for a spouse's debts.
* Giving a husband/wife visitation rights when his/her spouse is incarcerated or hospitalized.
* Giving a husband/wife control over his/her spouse's affairs when the spouse is incapacitated.
* Establishing the second [[legal guardian]] of a parent's child.
* Establishing a [[joint property|joint fund of property]] for the benefit of children.
* Establishing a relationship between the families of the spouses.

These rights and obligations vary considerably between societies, and between groups within society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Leach| first =Edmund|editor=Paul Bonannan and John Middleton|title=Marriage, Family, and Residence|publisher=The Natural History Press| year =1968|isbn=1-121-64470-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These might include arranged marriages, family obligations, the legal establishment of a [[nuclear family]] unit, the legal protection of children and public declaration of [[Promise|commitment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James E.|last=Krier|coauthors=Gregory S.

===Marriage restrictions===
{{Main|Marriage law#Marriage restrictions}}
Marriage is an institution that is historically filled with restrictions. From age, to race, to social status, to [[consanguinity]], to gender, restrictions are placed on marriage by society for reasons of benefiting the children, passing on healthy genes, maintaining cultural values, or because of [[prejudice]] and [[fear]]. Almost all cultures that recognize marriage also recognize [[adultery]] as a violation of the terms of marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica adultery&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery &quot;Adultery&quot;] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age====
Most jurisdictions{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} set a [[marriageable age|minimum age for marriage]], that is, a person must attain a certain age to be legally allowed to marry. This age may depend on circumstances, for instance exceptions from the general rule may be permitted if the parents of a young person express their consent and/or if a court decides that said marriage is in the best interest of the young person (often this applies in cases where a girl is pregnant). Although most age restrictions are in place in order to prevent children from being forced into marriages, especially to much older partners, which lead to [[child sexual abuse]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  such [[child marriages]] remain common in parts of the world.

====Race, ethnicity, tribe, caste and social class====
The United States has had a history of marriage restriction laws. Many states enacted [[miscegenation]] laws which were first introduced in the late 17th century in the slave-holding colonies of Virginia (1691) and Maryland (1692) and lasted until 1967 (until it was overturned via ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''). Many of these states restricted several minorities from marrying whites. For example, [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Oklahoma]] banned Blacks in particular. States such as [[Mississippi]] and [[Missouri]] banned Blacks and Asians. States such as [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]] banned Blacks and Native Americans, and some states such as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], South Carolina, and [[Virginia]] banned all non-whites.

Many societies have required a person to marry within their own general social group, which anthropologists refer to as [[endogamy]]. An example of such restrictions would be a requirement to marry someone from the same tribe.

====Gender====
It is a relatively new practice that same-sex couples are being granted the same form of legal marital recognition available to mixed-sexed couples. In the United States, the 1996 [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) explicitly defines marriage for the purposes of federal law as between a man and a woman and allows states to ignore same-sex marriages from other states (though states arguably could do this already).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Scandals, 'Responsible Fatherhood' and the 2008 Election Campaign: When 'Sex Talk' Trumps Race and Class|first=Anna Marie|last=Smith|url=http://www.barnard.edu/sfonline/sexecon/smith_05.htm|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Evan. &quot;DOJ Shifts Tone on Marriage Act.&quot; ''The Wall Street Journal,'' U.S. ed., August 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-one US states currently define marriage as between a man and a woman. Three of those states have statutory language that pre-dates DOMA (enacted before 1996) defining marriage as such. Thirty states have defined marriage in their constitutions. Arizona is the only state that has ever defeated a constitutional amendment defining marriage as only between a man and a woman (2006), but it subsequently passed one in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships.&quot; National Conference of State Legislatures. August 18, 2009:&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consanguinity====
Societies have often placed restrictions on marriage to relatives, though the degree of prohibited relationship varies widely. With few exceptions, marriages between parents and children or between full siblings have been considered [[incest]] and forbidden. However, [[cousin marriage|marriages between more distant relatives]] have been much more common, with one estimate being that 80% of all marriages in history have been between second cousins or closer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conniff |first=Richard |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/featkiss |title=Richard Conniff. &quot;Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin.&quot; |publisher=Discovermagazine.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proportion has fallen dramatically, but still more than 10% of all marriages are believed to be between first and second cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Sarah |last = Kershaw |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/garden/26cousins.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |title = Shaking Off the Shame |date = November 26, 2009 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, such marriages are now highly stigmatized, and laws ban most or all first-cousin marriage in 30 states. Specifics vary: in South Korea, historically it was illegal to marry someone with the same last name.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Article 809 of the Korean Civil Code]] and {{Cite document|url=http://www.ccourt.go.kr/home/english/download/decision_10years.pdf|title=The first ten years of the Korean Constitutional Court |publisher=Constitutional Court of Korea|page=242 (p.256 of the PDF)|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Number of spouses in a marriage====
Restrictions against [[polygamy]] have been common.

In the United States, opposition to the recognition of [[State of Deseret|Deseret]] as a State by the Federal government was founded on opposition to the once-practiced polygamous marriages of [[Mormons]].

[[Richard Dawkins]] has pointed out that there is a &quot;mild&quot; predisposition towards polygamy in human society.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Ancestor's Tale]], (The Seal's Tale)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

===State recognition===
{{Main|Marriage law#State recognition}}
In many jurisdictions, a civil marriage may take place as part of the religious marriage ceremony, although they are theoretically distinct. Some jurisdictions allow civil marriages in circumstances which are notably not allowed by particular religions, such as [[same-sex marriage]]s or [[civil union]]s.

==Marriage and religion==
Among the precepts of mainstream religions are found, as a rule, unequivocal prescriptions for marriage, establishing both rituals and rules of conduct.

===Abrahamic religions===

[[File:Israëls-A Jewish Wedding-1903.jpg|thumb|A Jewish wedding, painting by [[Jozef Israëls]], 1903]]

====Bahá'í====

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]] marriage is encouraged and viewed as a mutually strengthening bond, but is not obligatory. A [[Bahá'í marriage]] requires the couple to choose each other, and then the consent of all living parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;oneworld&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Smith|first=Peter|encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|title=Marriage|year=2000|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85168-184-1|pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
{{Main|Christian views of marriage}}
[[File:St Mary's Church, Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Christian wedding in [[Kyoto]], Japan.]]

Christians variously regard marriage as a sacrament, a contract, a sacred institution, or a covenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/weddings_1.shtml |title=Religions – Christianity: Marriage and weddings |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the very beginning of the Christian Church, marriage law and theology have been a major matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;nuptial imagery&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1 = Batey| first1 = Richard|title = New Testament nuptial imagery|url = http://books.google.com/?id=Zz4VAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|year = 1971| publisher = Brill Archive|page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of the Western tradition of Christian marriages have been the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[Apostle Paul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte&quot;/&gt;

Christians often marry for religious reasons ranging from following the biblical injunction for a &quot;man to leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one,&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Gen.|2:24}}&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Bibleref2c|Mark|10:7}}, {{Bibleref2|Gen.|2:24}}, {{Bibleref2|Matt.|19:5}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph.|5:31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to obeying Canon Law stating marriage between baptized persons is a [[sacrament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehmkuhl, Augustinus 1910&quot;&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sacrament of Marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Divorce]] and [[remarriage]] while generally not encouraged are regarded differently by each Christian denomination. Most Protestant Churches allow people to marry again after a divorce. The Eastern Orthodox Church allows divorce for a limited number of reasons, and in theory, but usually not in practice, requires that a marriage after divorce be celebrated with a penitential overtone.  In the Roman Catholic Church, marriage can only be ended by an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]] where the Church for special reasons regards it as never having taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/relationships/chmarriageanddivorcerev1.shtml |title=GCSE Bitesize: Marriage |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|{{&quot;'}}...So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.&quot;|Jesus{{bibleref2c|Matthew|19:6|TNIV}}}}

[[Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians and many [[Anglicans]] consider marriage termed ''holy matrimony'' to be an expression of [[divine grace]], termed a ''[[sacrament]]'' or ''[[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]]''. In [[Latin liturgical rites|Western ritual]], the ministers of the sacrament are the husband and wife themselves, with a [[bishop]], [[priest]], or [[deacon]] merely witnessing the union on behalf of the church, and adding a blessing. In [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern ritual churches]], the bishop or priest functions as the actual minister of the Sacred Mystery (Eastern Orthodox deacons may not perform marriages). Western Christians commonly refer to marriage as a [[vocation]], while Eastern Christians consider it an [[ordination]] and a [[martyr]]dom, though the theological emphases indicated by the various names are not excluded by the teachings of either tradition.{{Dubious|date=January 2010}} Marriage is commonly celebrated in the context of a [[Eucharist]]ic service (a [[nuptial Mass]] or [[Divine Liturgy]]). The sacrament of marriage is indicative of the relationship between [[Christ]] and the Church.{{bibleref2c|Eph.|5:29–32}}

The Roman Catholic tradition of the 12th and 13th centuries defined marriage as a [[sacrament]] ordained by God,&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte&quot;/&gt; signifying the mystical marriage of Christ to his Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm#I |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition, Article Seven, Paragraph 1612 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between baptized persons has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm#I |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition, Article Seven, Paragraph 1601 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The mutual love between man and wife becomes an image of the eternal love with which God loves humankind. The celebration of marriage between two Catholics normally takes place during the public liturgical celebration of the Holy Mass, because of its sacramental connection with the unity of the Paschal mystery of Christ (Communion). Sacramental marriage confers a perpetual and exclusive bond between the spouses. By its nature, the institution of marriage and conjugal love is ordered to the procreation and upbringing of offspring. Marriage creates rights and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their children: &quot;[e]ntering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an annulment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sacrament of Holy Matrimony, by P. McLachlan [http://www.catholic-pages.com/marriage/sacrament.asp Catholic-pages.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to current Catholic legislation governing marriage, the essential properties of marriage are unity and indissolubility; in Christian marriage they acquire a distinctive firmness by reason of the sacrament.&lt;ref&gt;1983 CODE c.1056 (Latin-English edition of the Code of Canon Law and English-language translation of the 5th Spanish-language edition of the commentary prepared under the responsibility of the Instituto Martin de Azpilcueta, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce is not recognized, but annulments predicated upon previously existing impediments may be granted. Offspring resulting from annulled relationships are considered legitimate. Remarried persons divorced from a living, lawful spouse are not separated from the Church, but they cannot receive Eucharistic communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm#brief |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition, Article Seven, Paragraph 1665 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, the purposes of marriage include intimate companionship, rearing children and mutual support for both husband and wife to fulfill their life callings. Protestants are generally not opposed to the use of [[birth control]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and consider marital sexual pleasure to be a gift of God.

Most [[Reformed churches|Reformed Christians]] would deny the elevation of marriage to the status of a [[sacrament]], nevertheless it is considered a covenant between spouses before God.&lt;sup&gt;cf.&lt;/sup&gt;{{bibleref2c|Ephesians|5:31–33}}

Historically, five competing models of marriage in Christianity have shaped Western marriage and legal tradition:

*The Protestant [[Protestant Reformation|Reformationists]] replaced the Roman Catholic sacramental model.
*[[Martin Luther]] saw it as a social &quot;estate of the earthly kingdom...subject to the prince, not the Pope.&quot;
*[[John Calvin]] taught that marriage was a ''covenant of grace'' that required the coercive power of the state to preserve its integrity.
*Anglicans regarded marriage as a ''domestic [[commonwealth]]'' within England and the church. By the 17th century, Anglican theologians had begun to develop a theology of marriage to replace the sacramental model of marriage. These &quot;regarded the interlocking commonwealths of state, church, and family as something of an earthly form of heavenly government.&quot;
*The [[secularism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] emphasized marriage as a ''contract'' &quot;to be formed, maintained, and dissolved as the couple sees fit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A couple following their marriage in the [[Manti Utah Temple]].]]

====Mormonism====

Members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) believe that &quot;marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.&quot; The LDS belief is that marriage between a man and a woman can last beyond death and into eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,161-1-11-1,00.html |title=The Family: A Proclamation to the World |publisher=Lds.org |date=1995-09-23 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
{{Main|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}
[[File:Nikah 003.jpg|thumb|upright|A Muslim bride of [[Pakistan]] origin signing the ''nikkah nama'' or [[marriage certificate]].]]
[[File:Muslim wedding in India.jpg|thumb|A Muslim couple being wed alongside the [[Tungabhadra River]] at [[Hampi]], India.]]

[[Islam]] also commends marriage, with the age of marriage being whenever the individuals feel ready, financially and emotionally.

In Islam, [[polygyny]] is allowed while [[polyandry]] is not, with the specific [[Polygamy in Islam|limitation]] that men can only have no more than four wives at any one time, with the requirement that they are able and willing to partition their time and wealth equally among the respective wives.

For a Muslim wedding to take place, the bride and her guardian must both agree on the marriage. Should either the guardian or the girl disagree on the marriage, it may not legally take place. In essence, while the guardian/father of the girl has no right to force her to marry, he has the right to stop a marriage from taking place,{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} given that his reasons are valid. The professed purpose of this practice is to ensure that a woman finds a suitable partner whom she has chosen not out of sheer emotion.

From an Islamic ([[Sharia]]) law perspective, the minimum requirements and responsibilities in a Muslim marriage are that the groom provide living expenses (housing, clothing, food, maintenance) to the bride, and in return, the bride's main responsibility is raising children to be proper Muslims. All other rights and responsibilities are to be decided between the husband and wife, and may even be included as stipulations in the marriage contract before the marriage actually takes place, so long as they do not go against the minimum requirements of the marriage.

In [[Sunni Islam]] [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|marriage]] must take place in the presence of at least two reliable witnesses, with the consent of the guardian of the bride and the consent of both the bride and the groom. Following the marriage, the couple may consummate the marriage. To create a religious contract between them, it is sufficient that a man and a woman indicate an intention to marry each other and recite the requisite words in front of a suitable Muslim, nowadays priest will be asked to officiate. The wedding party usually follows but can be held days, or months later, whenever the couple and their families want to, however there can be no concealment of the marriage as it is regarded as public notification due to the requirement of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3079 The method of pronouncing the marriage formula]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3078 Marriage formula]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3080 Conditions of pronouncing Nikah]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3083 Women with whom matrimony is Haraam]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Shia Islam]], marriage may take place without the presence of witnesses as is often the case in temporary [[mutta]] marriage (prohibited in Sunni Islam), but with the consent of both the bride and the groom. Following the marriage they may consummate their marriage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

====Judaism====
{{Main|Jewish views of marriage}}

In [[Judaism]], marriage is viewed as a contractual bond commanded by God in which a man and a woman come together to create a relationship in which God is directly involved.{{bibleref2c|Deut.|24:1}} Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is also expected to fulfill the commandment to have children.{{bibleref2c|Gen.|1:28}} The main focus centers around the relationship between the husband and wife. [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistically]], marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul. This is why a man is considered &quot;incomplete&quot; if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm|title=Why Marry?|accessdate=2007-12-19|publisher=[[Chabad.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] (Christian [[Old Testament]]) describes a number of marriages, including those of [[Isaac]] ({{Bibleverse||Gen|24:49–67|NIV}}), [[Jacob]]({{Bibleverse||Gen|29:27|NIV}}) and [[Samson]] ({{Bibleverse||Judges|14:7–12|NIV}}). [[Polygyny]], or men having multiple wives at once, is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot;&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betrothal (''[[erusin]]''), which is merely a binding promise to get married, is distinct from marriage itself (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]''), with the time between these events varying substantially.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot;&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=MARRIAGE|section=Manius-Mash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a wife was regarded as property in those days, the betrothal (''erusin'') was effected simply by purchasing her from her father (or [[parental guardian|guardian]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; the girl’s consent is not explicitly required by any biblical law.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; Like the adjacent Arabic culture ([[Pre-Islamic Arabia|in the pre-Islamic period]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885),  81&lt;/ref&gt; the act of marriage appears mainly to have consisted of the groom fetching the bride, although among the [[Israelites]] (unlike the Arabs) the procession was a festive occasion, accompanied by music, dancing, and lights.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; To celebrate the marriage, week-long feasts were sometimes held.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt;

In biblical times, a wife was regarded as [[chattel]], belonging to her husband;&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; the descriptions of the Bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|29:9}}; {{bibleref2|Exodus|2:16}};{{Bibleref2|1|Samuel|2:19||1 Samuel 2:19}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Sam|8:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wives were usually looked after with care, and men with more than one wife were expected to ensure that they continue to give the first wife food, clothing, and marital rights.{{bibleref2c|Ex|21:10}}

Since a wife was regarded as property, her husband was originally free to divorce her for any reason, at any time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; A divorced couple were permitted to get back together, unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce.{{bibleref2c|Deut|24:2–4}}

[[File:Hindu marriage ceremony offering.jpg|thumb|Hindu marriage ceremony from a [[Rajput]] wedding.]]

[[Hinduism]] sees marriage as a sacred duty that entails both religious and social obligations. Old Hindu literature in [[Sanskrit]] gives many different types of marriages and their categorization ranging from &quot;Gandharva Vivaha&quot; (instant marriage by mutual consent of participants only, without any need for even a single third person as witness) to normal (present day) marriages, to &quot;Rakshasa Vivaha&quot; (&quot;demoniac&quot; marriage, performed by abduction of one participant by the other participant, usually, but not always, with the help of other persons). The Hindu Widow's Remarriage Act 1856 empowers a Hindu widow to remarry. Though traditionally widow remarriages were frowned upon and are still considered taboo in many parts of India,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/07/05/damon.india.widows/index.html Shunned from society, widows flock to city to die]&quot;. CNN.com. July 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the society is changing and the incidence of widow remarriage is on a rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawisgreek.com/widow-remarriage-under-hindu-laws/ |title=Widow Remarriage under Hindu Laws &amp;#124; Indian Laws |publisher=Lawisgreek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Sati (practice)|sati]], or the practice of a widow immolating herself on her husband's funeral pyre, was officially outlawed by [[British Raj|India]]'s British rulers in 1829, the rite persists. The most high-profile sati incident was in Rajasthan in 1987 when 18-year-old [[Roop Kanwar]] was burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New York Times, 1987 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D61139F933A1575AC0A961948260|accessdate=2008-05-31 | date=1987-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhist view of marriage}}
The Buddhist view of marriage considers marriage a secular affair and as such, it is not considered a [[sacrament]]. Buddhists are expected to follow the civil laws regarding marriage laid out by their respective governments.

===Sikhism===
In a Sikh marriage, the couple make rounds around the holy book called ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'' four times and the holy man speaks some words from the Guru Granth Sahib in the form of kirtan. The ceremony is known as '[[Anand Karaj]]' and represents the holy union of between two souls that are united as one.

===Wicca===
Wiccan marriages are commonly known as handfastings. Although handfastings vary for each Wiccan they often involve honoring Wiccan gods. Sex is considered a pious and sacred activity.&lt;ref&gt;A Wiccan Bible: Exploring the Mysteries of the Craft from Birth to Summerland - Page 124, A. J. Drew - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===

[[File:Terryandmarkwedding.jpg|thumb|left|A same-sex couple exchanging wedding vows in a [[Unitarian Universalist]] Fellowship.]]

For the most part, religious traditions in the world reserve marriage to heterosexual unions, but there are exceptions including [[Unitarian Universalist]], [[Metropolitan Community Church]], [[Quaker]], [[United Church of Canada]], [[United Church of Christ]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] congregations,  some [[Homosexuality and Anglicanism#Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]] dioceses, and various [[Neopagan]] faiths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marriagelaw.cua.edu/publications/wrr.pdf &quot;World Religions and Same-Sex Marriage&quot;], Marriage Law Project, [[Columbus School of Law]] at The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., July 2002 revision&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;united&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/exploring/marriage/affirmingcongregations |title=Affirming Congregations, The Episcopal Church and Ministries of the United Church of Canada |publisher=United-church.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is currently recognized by various jurisdictions&lt;ref&gt;Arce, Rose.

===Polygyny===
{{Further2|[[Polygyny#Sociology|Polygyny]]|[[Polygamy#Religion|Polygamy]]}}
Religious groups have differing views on the legitimacy of [[polygyny]], the practice of a man taking more than one wife. It is allowed in [[Islam]] and [[Confucianism]], though in most areas today it is uncommon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dinah&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinahproject.com/articles_view_details.asp?id=217 |title=The Dinah Project |publisher=The Dinah Project |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threekingdoms.com/history.htm |title=Romance of Three Kingdoms – by Luo Guanzhong – History |publisher=Threekingdoms.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Hinduism]] have  allowed polygyny in the past, but it is prohibited today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dinah&quot;/&gt;

===Close-kin marriage===
{{Further2|[[Cousin marriage]]|[[Affinity (canon law)]]}}

Religion has commonly weighed in on the matter of which relatives, if any, are allowed to marry. Relations may be by [[consanguinity]] or [[Affinity (law)|affinity]], meaning by blood or by marriage. On the marriage of cousins, [[Catholic]] policy has evolved from initial acceptance, through a long period of general prohibition, to the contemporary requirement for a dispensation.&lt;ref&gt;

==Financial considerations==
::''See also [[Economics of marriage]]''
The financial aspects of marriage vary between cultures and have changed over time.

In some cultures, dowries and bride prices continue to be required today. In both cases, the financial arrangements are usually made between the groom (or his family) and the bride's family; with the bride in many cases not being involved in the arrangement, and often not having a choice in whether to participate in the marriage.

In [[Early Modern Britain]], the social status of the couple was supposed to be equal. After the marriage, all the property (called &quot;fortune&quot;) and expected inheritances of the wife belonged to the husband.

===Dowry===
{{Main|Dowry}}

A [[dowry]] was not an unconditional gift,&lt;sup&gt;[in Early Modern Britain?]&lt;/sup&gt; but was usually a part of a wider marriage settlement. For example, if the groom had other children, they could not inherit the dowry, which had to go to the bride's children. In the event of her childlessness, the dowry had to be returned to her family, but sometimes not until the groom's death or remarriage.

In some cultures, especially in [[South Asia]], in countries such as [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Nepal]], dowries continue to be expected. In India, nearly 7,000 women were killed in 2001 over dowries,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm India's dowry deaths]&quot;. BBC News. July 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and activists believe that figures represent only a third of the actual number of such murders.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/international/1995/950911/women.india.html Women: killed by greed and oppression]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&quot;. TIME Magazine. September 11, 1995 Volume 146, No. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Dowry related violence is a problem in several places (see [[dowry deaths]]), and, in response to violent incidents regarding the practice, several jurisdictions have enacted laws restricting or banning dowry (see [[Dowry law in India]]). In Nepal, dowry has been made illegal in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southasia.oneworld.net/todaysheadlines/nepal-bans-dowry-caste-based-discrimination#.UGH0Nq4Zh0I |title=Nepal bans dowry, caste-based discrimination — OneWorld South Asia |publisher=Southasia.oneworld.net |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors believe that the giving and receiving of dowry reflects the status and even the effort to climb high in social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=NS_TOHRTWpgC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=dowry+climbing+social&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VIL3EZE2Tb&amp;sig=poICnRMkz_D2-3X8I2NqJU9i-do&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Taw5T6OGE47JrAec9JyyCA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bride price and dower===
{{Main|Bride price|Dower}}
[[File:Thai Bride Price 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional, formal presentation of the bride price (also known as &quot;sin sot&quot; or &quot;dowry&quot;) at an engagement ceremony in [[Thailand]]]]

In other cultures, the groom or his family were expected to pay a [[bride price]] to the bride's family for the right to marry the daughter, or [[dower]], which was payable to the bride. This required the groom to work for the bride's family for a set period of time.

In the Jewish tradition, the rabbis in ancient times insisted on the marriage couple entering into a marriage contact, called a ''[[ketubah]]''. Besides other things, the ''ketubah'' provided for an amount to be paid by the husband in the event of a [[get (divorce document)|divorce]] or his estate in the event of his death. This amount was a replacement of the biblical [[dower]] or [[bride price]], which was payable at the time of the marriage by the groom to the father of the bride.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} {{bibleref2c|Exodus|22:15–16|HE}} This innovation was put in place because the biblical bride price created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the bride price at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable these young men to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when they would be more likely to have the sum. It may also be noted that both the dower and the ''ketubah'' amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support cease, either by death or divorce. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. It is the predecessor to the wife's present-day entitlement to [[alimony|maintenance]] in the event of the breakup of marriage, and family maintenance in the event of the husband not providing adequately for the wife in his [[Will (law)|will]]. Another function performed by the ''ketubah'' amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife: he would need to have the amount to be able to pay to the wife.

[[Morning gift]]s, which might also be arranged by the bride's father rather than the bride, are given to the bride herself; the name derives from the Germanic tribal custom of giving them the morning after the wedding night. She might have control of this morning gift during the lifetime of her husband, but is entitled to it when widowed. If the amount of her inheritance is settled by law rather than agreement, it may be called [[dower]]. Depending on legal systems and the exact arrangement, she may not be entitled to dispose of it after her death, and may lose the property if she remarries. Morning gifts were preserved for many centuries in [[morganatic marriage]], a union where the wife's inferior social status was held to prohibit her children from inheriting a noble's titles or estates. In this case, the morning gift would support the wife and children. Another legal provision for widowhood was [[jointure]], in which property, often land, would be held in joint tenancy, so that it would automatically go to the widow on her husband's death.

Islamic tradition has similar practices. A '[[mahr]]', either immediate or deferred, is the woman's portion of the groom's wealth (divorce) or estate (death). These amounts are usually set on the basis of the groom's own and family wealth and incomes, but in some parts these are set very high so as to provide a disincentive for the groom exercising the divorce, or the husband's family 'inheriting' a large portion of the estate, especially if there are no male offspring from the marriage. In some countries, including Iran, the [[mahr]] or alimony can amount to more than a man can ever hope to earn, sometimes up to US$1,000,000 (4000 official Iranian gold coins). If the husband cannot pay the [[mahr]], either in case of a divorce or on demand, according to the current laws in Iran, he will have to pay it by installments. Failure to pay the [[mahr]] might even lead to imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international-divorce.com/iran_divorce.htm |title=A translation of some parts of the Civil Code of Iran |publisher=International-divorce.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bride price is a common practice in parts of [[South-East Asia]] ([[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]]), parts of [[Central Asia]], and in much of [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

===Contemporary customs===
In many countries today, each marriage partner has the choice of keeping his or her property separate or combining properties. In the latter case, called [[community property]], when the marriage ends by divorce each owns half. In many legal jurisdictions, laws related to property and [[inheritance]] provide by default for property to pass upon the death of one party in a marriage firstly to the spouse and secondly to the children. [[Will (law)|Wills]] and [[trust law|trusts]] can make alternative provisions for property succession.

In some legal systems, the partners in a marriage are &quot;jointly liable&quot; for the debts of the marriage. This has a basis in a traditional legal notion called the &quot;Doctrine of Necessities&quot; whereby a husband was responsible to provide necessary things for his wife. Where this is the case, one partner may be sued to collect a debt for which they did not expressly contract. Critics of this practice note that debt collection agencies can abuse this by claiming an unreasonably wide range of debts to be expenses of the marriage. The cost of defense and the burden of proof is then placed on the non-contracting party to prove that the expense is not a debt of the family. The respective maintenance obligations, both during and eventually after a marriage, are regulated in most [[jurisdiction]]s; [[alimony]] is one such method.

Some have attempted to analyze the institution of marriage using economic theory; for example, [[anarcho-capitalist]] economist [[David D. Friedman]] has written a lengthy and controversial study of marriage as a market transaction (the market for husbands and wives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_Chapter_21/PThy_Chap_21.html |title=The Economics of Love and Marriage |publisher=Daviddfriedman.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past the economic status of women was enhanced through marriage; however, as more women work nowadays, men gain more economically than women.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Fry, D’Vera Cohn: ''[http://pewsocialtrends.org/pubs/750/new-economics-of-marriage Women, Men and the New Economics of Marriage]'', Pew Research Center, January 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
In some countries, spouses are allowed to average their incomes; this is advantageous to a married couple with disparate incomes. To compensate for this somewhat, many countries provide a ''higher'' [[tax bracket]] for the averaged income of a married couple. While income averaging might still benefit a married couple with a stay-at-home spouse, such averaging would cause a married couple with roughly equal personal incomes to pay more total tax than they would as two single persons. This is commonly called the [[marriage penalty]].

Moreover, when the rates applied by the tax code are not based on averaging the incomes, but rather on the ''sum'' of individuals' incomes, higher rates will definitely apply to each individual in a two-earner households in progressive tax systems. This is most often the case with high-income taxpayers and is another situation where some consider there to be a marriage penalty.

Conversely, when progressive tax is levied on the individual with no consideration for the partnership, dual-income couples fare much better than single-income couples with similar household incomes. The effect can be increased when the welfare system treats the same income as a shared income thereby denying welfare access to the non-earning spouse. Such systems apply in Australia and Canada, for example.

===Other considerations===
Sometimes people marry for purely pragmatic reasons, sometimes called a [[marriage of convenience]] or sham marriage. For example, according to one publisher of information about &quot;green card&quot; marriages, &quot;Every year over 450,000 United States citizens marry foreign-born individuals and petition for them to obtain a permanent residency (Green Card) in the United States.&quot; While this is likely an overestimate, in 2003 alone 184,741 immigrants were admitted to the U.S. as spouses of [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/yearbook/2003/2003IMMtables.pdf Immigration to the United States: Fiscal years 1820–2003]|2.03&amp;nbsp;MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more were admitted as fiancés of US citizens for the purpose of being married within 90 days. Regardless of the number of people entering the US to marry a US citizen, it does not indicate the number of these marriages that are convenience marriages, which number could include some of those with the motive of obtaining permanent residency, but also include many people who are US citizens. One example would be to obtain an inheritance that has a marriage clause. Another example would be to save money on health insurance or to enter a health plan with preexisting conditions offered by the new spouse's employer. Many other situations exist, and, in fact, all marriages have a complex combination of conveniences motivating the parties to marry. A marriage of convenience is one that is devoid of normal reasons to marry.

Some people want to marry a person with higher or lower status than them. Others want to marry people who have similar status. Hypergyny refers to the act of seeking out those who are of slightly higher social status. In most cases, hypergyny refers to women wanting men of higher status. ''Isogyny'' refers to the act of seeking out those who are of similar status.

===Criticism of marriage customs===
[[Image:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]
In recent years, the customs of [[dowry]] and [[bride price]] have received international criticism. In some countries, these practices have been outlawed or restricted. Criticism of these traditions include that they incite conflicts between families and clans, they contribute to [[violence against women]], they promote materialism, they increase property crimes (where men steal goods such as cattle in order to be able to pay the bride price) and they make it difficult for poor people to marry. African women’s rights campaigners advocate the abolishing of bride price, which they argue is based on the idea that women are a form of property which can be bought, and once the man has paid the price, the wife belongs to him and he gains the right to control her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.arts.ubc.ca/asiwan/siwan-jep2.pdf |title=The Economics of Dowry and Brideprice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bride price has also been criticized for contributing to [[child trafficking]], where impoverished parents sell their young daughters to rich older men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Human+rights+groups+ask+NWFP+Govt.+to+ban+%27bride+price%27+to+curb+women...-a0216984357 |title=Human rights groups ask NWFP Govt. to ban 'bride price' to curb women Trafficking. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Papua New Guinea police officer has called for the abolishing of bride price arguing that it is one of the main reasons for the mistreatment of women in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iSite Interactive Limited |url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=26256/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl |title=PNG Police blame bride price for violence in marriage |publisher=Islands Business |date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite practice of dowry has been linked to a high level of violence (see [[dowry deaths]]) and to crimes such as [[extortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/830-addressing-dowry-related-violence-through-criminalization-of-dowry-demands.html |title=Addressing dowry-related violence through criminalization of dowry demands |publisher=Endvawnow.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
In most societies, the death of one of the partners terminates the marriage, and in monogamous societies this allows the other partner to remarry, though sometimes after a waiting or mourning period.

In some societies, a marriages can be [[annulment|annulled]], when an authority declares, that a marriage never happened.

A marriage may also be terminated through [[divorce]]. As of 2012, the [[Philippines]] and the [[Vatican City]] are the only jurisdictions which do not allow divorce (this is currently under discussion in  Philippines &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carreon |first=Shaun |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/07/12/philippines-ready-divorce-law |title=Is Philippines ready for a divorce law? |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 
After divorce, one spouse may have to pay [[alimony]]. [[Divorce law around the world|Laws concerning divorce]] and the ease with which a divorce can be obtained vary widely around the world. After a divorce or an annulment, the people concerned are free to remarry (or marry). 

A statutory right of two married partners to mutually consent to divorce was enacted in western nations in the mid-20th century. In the United States [[no-fault divorce]] was first enacted in California in 1969 and the final state to legalize it was New York in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divorcesupport.about.com/od/maritalproblems/i/nofault_fault_2.htm |title=No-Fault Divorce – The Pros and Cons Of No-Fault Divorce |publisher=Divorcesupport.about.com |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 45% of marriages in Britain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/mar/27/britishidentity.divorce Nearly half of marriaged doomed for divorce], [[The Guardian]] (March  27, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and 46% of marriages in the [[United States|U.S.]], according to a 2009 study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=13629644 Census; divorce decline but 7 year itch persists], [[ABC News]] (May 18, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; end in divorce.

==Temporary marriages==
Several cultures have practiced temporary and conditional marriages. Examples include the [[Celts|Celtic]] practice of [[handfasting]] and fixed-term marriages in the Muslim community. Pre-Islamic Arabs practiced a form of temporary marriage that carries on today in the practice of [[Nikah Mut'ah]], a fixed-term marriage contract. The prophet [[Muhammad]] sanctioned a temporary marriage—[[sigheh]] in [[Iran]] and muta'a in [[Iraq]]— which can provide a legitimizing cover for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim controversies related to Nikah Mut'ah]] have resulted in the practice being confined mostly to [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] communities.

==Post-marital residence==
Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence—with or near the husband's or wife's families, for example—(e.g., [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Edward Tylor]], or [[George Peter Murdock]]) connected it with the sexual division of labor. However, to date, [[cross-cultural]] tests of this [[hypothesis]] using worldwide samples have failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. However, [[Korotayev]]'s tests show that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general; however, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor. Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal [[polygyny]] which effectively destroys [[matrilocality]]. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e.g., through a multiple [[Regression analysis|regression]] model), division of labor turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock's hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labor and postmarital residence were basically correct, though, as has been shown by [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]], the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |title=Form of marriage, sexual division of labor, and postmarital residence in cross-cultural perspective: A reconsideration |journal=Journal of Anthropological Research |issn=0091-7710 |year=2003 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=69–89 |jstor=3631445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |title=Division of Labor by Gender and Postmarital Residence in Cross-Cultural Perspective: A Reconsideration |journal=Cross-Cultural Research |year=2003 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=335–372 |doi=10.1177/1069397103253685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a trend toward the [[neolocal residence]] in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marriage, Family, and Kinship: Comparative Studies of Social Organization |first=Melvin |last=Ember |first2=Carol R. |last2=Ember |location=New Haven |publisher=[[HRAF]] Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-87536-113-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
{{Main|Criticism of marriage}}
Many people have proposed arguments against marriage for various reasons. These include political, philosophical and religious criticisms; concerns about the [[divorce rate]], individual liberty and gender equality, and questioning of the necessity to have a personal relationship sanctioned by government or religious authorities; or the promotion of [[celibacy]] for religious or philosophical reasons.

===Controversial views===
{{See also|Anti-miscegenation laws|Interracial marriage|Transnational marriage|Interfaith marriage|Mixed marriage (disambiguation)|Same-sex marriage|Divorce|Polygamy|Child marriage|Arranged marriage}}

Many controversies have arisen over the centuries in relation to marriage – including issues relating to the suitability of partners of different denominations, faiths, tribes or races, the acceptable number and minimum age of wives, the rights of partners, especially wives, and wider family obligations. For example, a contemporary controversy of particular significance in the USA concerns the exclusion of homosexual relationships from legal and social recognition and the rights and obligations it provides. [[Social conservatism|Social conservatives]] opposed to same-sex marriage in some countries claim that any attempt to define marriage to include anything other than the union of one man and one woman would &quot;deprive the term of its fundamental and defining meaning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title = Same-Sex Marriage|publisher=Rabbinical Council of America|date=2004-03-30|url=http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100556}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, [[polygamy]] is a &quot;socially conservative&quot; practice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Advocates of same-faith marriage and same-race marriage may criticize the legalization of [[interfaith marriage]]&lt;ref&gt;2 Corinthians 6:14 ''Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[interracial marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;Werner Sollors (2000-10-19). Interracialism: Black-White Intermarriage in American History, Literature, and Law (Sollors, Werner ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-512856-7&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

The state of Massachusetts has sued the U.S. federal government over its definition of marriage. The lawsuit, brought by the first state to legalize gay marriage, said the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) infringed on a state's sovereign right to define marital status. The lawsuit alleges that DOMA infringed on a state's sovereign right to define marital status and is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Shishkin, Philip. &quot;Massachusetts Sues U.S. Over Definition of Marriage.&quot; ''Wall Street Journal – Eastern Edition''; 7/9/2009, Vol. 254 Issue 7, pA3, 0p, 1 bw&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power and gender roles==
[[Feminist theory]] approaches opposite-sex marriage as an institution traditionally rooted in [[patriarchy]] that promotes male superiority and power over women.  This [[powerful|power dynamic]] conceptualizes men as &quot;the provider operating in the public sphere&quot; and women as &quot;the caregivers operating within the private sphere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weadock&quot;&gt;Briana Weadock, &quot;Disciplining Marriage: Gender, Power, and Resistance&quot;, [http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/1/0/3/0/p110303_index.html], 2000&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Theoretically, women ... [were] defined as the property of their husbands .... The adultery of a woman was always treated with more severity than that of a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Tanya, ''Women, Marriage and the Family'', in Barker, Hannah, &amp; Elaine Chalus, eds., ''Women's History: Britain, 1700–1850: An Introduction'' (Oxon/London: Routledge, 2005 (ISBN 0-415-29177-1)), p. 64 (author Evans postdoctoral research fellow, Ctr. for Contemp. Brit. Hist., Institute for Historical Research, London, editor Barker sr. lecturer history, Univ. of Manchester, &amp; editor Chalus sr. lecturer history, Bath Spa Univ. Coll.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[F]eminist demands for a wife's control over her own property were not met [in parts of Britain] until ... [laws were passed in the late 19th century].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Tanya, ''Women, Marriage and the Family'', ''op. cit.'', in Barker, Hannah, &amp; Elaine Chalus, eds., ''Women's History'', ''op. cit.'', p. 66 &amp; n. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; This patriarchal dynamic is contrasted with a conception of [[egalitarian]] or [[Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage|Peer Marriage]] in which power and labour are divided equally, and not according to [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weadock&quot; /&gt;

The performance of dominant gender roles by men and submissive gender roles by women influence the power dynamic of a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Jaris Tichenor, &quot;Thinking About Gender and Power in Marriage&quot;, The Kaleidoscope of Gender, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  In some American households, women internalize gender role stereotypes and often assimilate into the role of &quot;wife&quot;, &quot;mother&quot;, and &quot;caretaker&quot; in conformity to societal norms and their male partner.  Author [[bell hooks]]&lt;!-- bell hooks, the writer, spells her name in all lower-case, and that applies even at the beginning of a sentence. --&gt; states &quot;within the family structure, individuals learn to accept sexist oppression as 'natural' and are primed to support other forms of oppression, including heterosexist domination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;bell hooks, Feminist Theory From Margin to Center, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[T]he cultural, economic, political and legal supremacy of the husband&quot; was &quot;[t]raditional ... under English law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Hilaire A, ''Introduction to Feminist Jurisprudence'' (London, G.B., U.K.: Cavendish Publishing, 1998 (ISBN 1859412378)), p. 35 and, per p. 35 n. 35, see chap. 3 (author then of Queen Mary &amp; Westfield Coll., Univ. of London).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, studies have shown that, despite egalitarian ideals being common, less than half of respondents viewed their opposite-sex relationships as equal in power, with unequal relationships being more commonly dominated by the male partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sprecher&quot;&gt;Sprecher, Susan; Felmlee, Diane, &quot;The Balance of Power in Romantic Heterosexual Couples Over Time from 'His' and 'Her' Perspectives&quot;, [http://business.highbeam.com/435388/article-1G1-20247079/balance-power-romantic-heterosexual-couples-over-time], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Studies also show that married couples find the highest level of satisfaction in egalitarian relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sprecher&quot; /&gt;  In recent years, egalitarian or [[Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage|Peer Marriages]] have been receiving increasing focus and attention politically, economically and culturally in a number of countries, including the United States.
