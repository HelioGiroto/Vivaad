== Futures Studies and Trans-humanism ==
Under this section it says ...
Quote :
&quot;The Sun's expansion will obviously not lead to the end of the Universe. Its effects will be limited to our Solar System. It will inevitably lead to the disappearance of our planet. Life on Earth will become impossible long before the planet is actually swallowed up by the Sun due to a rise in temperature.&quot;

This is not cited and is incorrect.  Yes the sun will expand to engulf our (CURRENT) planetary orbit, however the earth's orbit will at the same change and become a larger and wider orbit, placing the planet outside the new sun's surface.--[[Special:Contributions/12.31.160.200|12.31.160.200]] ([[User talk:12.31.160.200|talk]]) 19:17, 6 June 2011 (UTC)

== Stunningly, unacceptably short article ==

For example: Philosophy, which was misleadingly titled &quot;Philosophy,&quot; the logical interpretation of which is &quot;the philosophy of eschatology.&quot; I've changed to &quot;Eschatology in Philosophy,&quot; which is what the content, such as it is, requires.

1. Wikipedia devotes a whopping two paragraphs to this subject.

2. Para 1 jumps from Augustine to Ibn al-Nafis to Hegel to Marx, whose philosophy of religion was only &quot;eschatological&quot; in advocating its dissolution, outside the definition of eschatology. Para then ends with a short non-relevant sentence on theodicy -- should be removed.

3. Para 2 is entirely one of the way-too-many-in-Wikipedia citations of transhumanism. It seems that adherents to transhumanism are among the most enthusiastic contributors to Wikipedia. When a critical mass of transhumanist citations populate Wikipedia, Wikipedia will lose its credibility as a resource/source.

Perhaps this article should combine with End Time, and the notion of a useful, annotated (if intellectually repellent) link farm be revisited for this page.

::Dstlascaux: The article is only brief because no one with sufficient knowledge of the area has stepped up to expand it. Are you the one? --[[User:Gmasterman|gdm]] ([[User talk:Gmasterman|talk]]) 00:50, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

== Hindu Theology ==

This article has [[Shiva]] destroying after [[Kalki]] has cleaned house at the end of [[Kali Yuga]] and then creating the next go-round. My understanding is that Shiva's 'job' is to destroy everything so that [[Brahma]] can start creation. I'm not an expert in the Vedas but some clarification should be sought. --[[User:Piepie|Piepie]] ([[User talk:Piepie|talk]]) 08:38, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

== Clean-up ==

I boldly archived the talk, just get things moving forward some.  I am going to put a copy of this article in my userspace (I'll update with a link later), to work on extensive clean-up, re-writing for this article.  Thanks.

== Other non-mainstream belief systems? ==

I for one would like to see this page talk about less well-known eschatology beliefs. For example, the Hopi Indians, the  Magic Bill Community, etc. There is a lot of great info there. What say you people? --[[User:HelsonBeado|HelsonBeado]] ([[User talk:HelsonBeado|talk]]) 11:09, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

:That'd be great, but it'd have to be well sourced. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 13:05, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

:I feel that this page should be left for major world religions, or generalities within spiritual movements, wikipedians looking for further information would do well to research the individual religions themselves. [[User:Anthalamo|Anthalamo]] ([[User talk:Anthalamo|talk]]) 08:51, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

== Duplication of Material ==

The page already has links to eschatology pages for the major religions (and others), so it doesn't make sense to repeat that information on this page. Looking at the various wiki sites on this subject, there already seems to be a lot of duplication. Let's just keep a few introductory comments on this page to whet people's appetites and point them toward the links for the existing pages on the various eschatologies, some of which are very good. --[[User:Gmasterman|gdm]] ([[User talk:Gmasterman|talk]]) 00:43, 24 January 2010 (UTC)


Agreed! I think the topic &quot;End Times&quot; should be kept as a teaser to point to the page on eschatology. There is a definitive segment of evangelical Christianity who will be more familiar with the term &quot;End Times&quot; rather than the more specific term &quot;Eschatology.&quot; The bulk of material should be placed under &quot;Eschatology.&quot; [[User:Coldtangerines|Coldtangerines]] ([[User talk:Coldtangerines|talk]]) 15:37, 19 February 2010 (UTC)

== Merge [[End time]] into Eschatology ==

The &quot;End time&quot; article is basically an article all about comparative eschatology beliefs and this material really belongs in the Eschatology article. If I'm not mistaken, the term &quot;end times&quot; refers to a specific set of apocalyptic beliefs in evangelical Christianity, hence that article should be kept but rewritten to specifically discuss that more narrow topic. 

Opinions? I'll keep this open to discussion for the next month or so, but if there's no consensus against it by then, I plan on merging the material from &quot;End time&quot; into &quot;Eschatology&quot;. [[User:Peter G Werner|Peter G Werner]] ([[User talk:Peter G Werner|talk]]) 07:32, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

:As you say, the only reason for a separate article on &quot;End Times&quot; would be if it had a more specific focus, but with a title like that, it's hard to see how that would be the case. Your proposal to merge the two seems reasonable. Doing it will take a little of your time, though, so we should be grateful for your willingness to take it on. The only thing I'd say is that we need to make sure that the &quot;Eschatology&quot; page does not become more than a general overview, an introduction to the subject. If we start adding too much to the individual sections (&quot;Christian Eschatology&quot; etc.), we'll be duplicating what's on the more specific eschatology pages listed in the box on the top right, which would create the same problem all over again. (Also see comments in &quot;Duplication&quot; section, above.) --[[User:Gmasterman|gdm]] ([[User talk:Gmasterman|talk]]) 18:55, 30 March 2010 (UTC)

::I agree with '''gdm''', we need to be careful about the merge.  And we need someone to do it.  Simply said, I don't have enough time on my hands otherwise I would...

*'''support above position - subjugate'''. &quot;End Times&quot; is a work-horse phrase for Pentecostal Christians - who believe that we should expect today the same tempo of miraculous events as appears in the New Testament - which is described as &quot;the outpouring of the holy spirit&quot; Pentecostals contextualize themselves as being right on the cusp of &quot;the End Time&quot; and every newspaper headline brings the world an inch closer to the events in Revelations - including most notably the rise of religious apartheid in Palestine/Israel. Presumably: &quot;End Times&quot; is properly a section under Christian Eschatology. [[Special:Contributions/24.74.135.68|24.74.135.68]] ([[User talk:24.74.135.68|talk]]) 23:02, 21 November 2010 (UTC)

*'''Oppose merge.''' (Don't know why with all the supports this hasn't been done, so my comment is belated.) &quot;End time,&quot; as noted by Peter G Werner above, is used mainly if not exclusively for the apocalyptic beliefs of evangelical Christianity, which certainly merit elucidation in their own article. Other terms are better suited for the other eschatologies. Biophys is therefore correct in pointing out that [[End time]] should not contain the eschatology of belief systems that don't primarily use the term. If [[End time]] is merged (after having its off-topic material removed), it should be merged into [[Christian eschatology]], not this article. The broader [[eschatology]] is also a concept that can be discussed within some philosophical and religious belief systems in classical antiquity; &quot;end time&quot; would never be used in that context. The most common use of the term is not scientific, and technological singularity is therefore confusing to have at the top. Since each variety of religious eschatology has its own article, each is only summarized here, but the section on [[Jewish eschatology]] seems short compared to that of Islam or Christianity. [[User:Cynwolfe|Cynwolfe]] ([[User talk:Cynwolfe|talk]]) 12:39, 14 April 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose merge with this page''' -- This page should be merged mostly into [[Christian eschatology]] or Jewish, Muslim, etc. as noted above.  There is too much content here to simple merge into [[Eschatology]], as a librarian I can warn you these articles are getting too long already.  Let's go to the Internet's strengths and create more subpages.  [[User:Jsmog|Joel J. Rane]] ([[User talk:Jsmog|talk]]) 22:14, 31 May 2011 (UTC)

== Eschatological Categories: Suggested ==

Inclusion of the End Time article should be delayed until a broader view of eschatology is derived first.

For the most part the article treats eschatology under the category of religion. But what of scientific, social, political, asthetic, and historical eschatology? The knowledge of life after death and related topics has excited the minds of every culture in history because eschatology is one of the primary subjects of science and the arts. If a scientist postulates the origins of life from organic inquiry, he also investigates the causes of the end of that life - perhaps in the form of pandemics. The astrophysicist contemplates an eschatological framework when studying the mass and trajectory of comets and asteroids. Global warming, a dying sun, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics are further illustrations.

Also, religious eschatology needs to be distinguished from futurology and other seemingly related fields.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Leabeater|Leabeater]] ([[User talk:Leabeater|talk]] â€¢ [[Special:Contributions/Leabeater|contribs]]) 10:56, 7 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== HA! ==

&quot;Not to be confused with Scatology.&quot; - current redirect distinction at the top of the page

Pretty easy to confuse the two, I agree. ;)

Still, someone with integrity should probably remove that as it's quite blantantly just the author's opinion as to the pedagogical significance of the topic and does not accord with a neutral presentation of an, apparently, controversial article.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sweetname|Sweetname]] ([[User talk:Sweetname|talk]] â€¢ [[Special:Contributions/Sweetname|contribs]]) 12:43, 8 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Ok, looks like the discussion on the scatology page includes someone claiming that spelling and pronunciation similarities (especially in spanish/portugese) make the redirect appropriate.  But...still.  Perhaps someone should look into this a bit more, just to make sure that the linguistic similarities do exist and that they constitute an important enough problem as to warrant a redirect, especially given that such a redirect can easily be accidentally interpreted as a commentary with respect to the philosophical claims and implications of the article's content.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sweetname|Sweetname]] ([[User talk:Sweetname|talk]] â€¢ [[Special:Contributions/Sweetname|contribs]]) 12:53, 8 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Secular forms of eschatology ==

How about a separate section on modern, secular forms of eschatology? The article mentions Marxism as one form of this, but  elements of eschatology could probably also be found in certain forms of radical anarcho-liberalism. To me, there also seems to be evidence that the ecological movement uses elements of eschatology, most obviouslsy in the debate on global warming, for example. --[[User:Thewolf37|Thewolf37]] ([[User talk:Thewolf37|talk]]) 21:29, 21 October 2012 (UTC)

==Modern eschatologies?==
The introduction has the sentence: &quot;Most modern eschatology and apocalypticism, both religious and secular, involves the violent disruption or destruction of the world, whereas Christian and Jewish eschatologies view the end times as the consummation or perfection of God's creation of the world.&quot; a) What modern religious eschatologies are we referring to? b) The only instance we mention that could be construed to be modern secular eschatology is Marxism (though that's not so modern in my view).
