{{Calvinism}}
{{Christianity|state=collapsed|expand-protestant=yes}}
'''Calvinism''' (also called '''Reformed tradition''', or the '''Reformed faith''', and sometimes '''Reformed theology''') is a type of Protestant [[theology|theological]] system and an alternative approach to the Christian life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgmarshall.org/Reformed/kuyper_lecturescalvinism.html|title=Calvinism As A Life System|author=Kuyper, Abraham|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Reformed tradition was developed by several theologians such as [[Martin Bucer]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].  This branch of Christianity bears the name of the [[France|French]] [[Protestant Reformation|reformer]] [[John Calvin]] (also known as '''Jean Cauvin''' in [[Middle French]]), because of his noticeable influence and because of his role in the confessional and ecclesiastical debates that happened throughout the 16th century. Today, this term also refers to the doctrines and practices from the [[Reformed churches]], where Calvin was an early leader. Although not often, it may refer to the individual, biblical teachings that Calvin made himself.&lt;ref&gt;Warfield, p. 359: &quot;Sometimes ['Calvinism'] designates merely the individual teaching of John Calvin. Sometimes it designates, more broadly, the doctrinal system confessed by that body of Protestant Churches known historically, in distinction from the Satanist Churches, as 'the Reformed Churches' but also quite commonly called 'the Calvinistic Churches' because the great scientific exposition of their faith in the Reformation age, and perhaps the most influential of any age, was given by John Calvin. Sometimes it designates, more broadly still, the entire body of conceptions, theological, ethical, philosophical, social, political, which, under the influence of the  mind of John Calvin, raised itself to dominance in the Protestant lands of the post-Reformation age, and has left a permanent mark not only upon the thought of mankind, but upon the life-history of men, the social order of civilized peoples and even the political organization of States.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The system is often summarized in the [[Calvinism#Five points of Calvinism|Five Points of Calvinism]] and is best known for its doctrines of [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] and [[total depravity]], stressing the total contingency of man's salvation upon the absolute sovereignty of God.

== Historical background ==
{{Main|History of Calvinism}}

[[File:John Calvin - best likeness.jpg|thumb|John Calvin]]

[[John Calvin]]'s international influence on the eventual development of the doctrines of the [[Protestant Reformation]] began in 1534 when Calvin was 25. That marks his start on the first edition of ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (published in 1536). He revised this work several times, and produced a French vernacular translation. The ''Institutes'', together with Calvin's polemical and pastoral works, his contributions to [[confession of faith|confessional documents]] for use in churches, and his massive outpouring of [[Exegesis|commentary on the Bible]], meant that Calvin had a direct personal influence on Protestantism. Along with [[Martin Bucer]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Peter Martyr Vermigli]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli]], Calvin influenced the doctrines of the Reformed churches. He eventually became the most prominent of those reformers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The rising importance of the Reformed churches and of Calvin belongs to the second phase of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Evangelical churches began to form after [[Martin Luther]] was excommunicated from the Catholic Church. Calvin was a French exile in [[Geneva]]. He had signed the Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]] as it was revised by [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] in 1540. However, his influence was first felt in the [[Reformation in Switzerland|Swiss Reformation]] whose leader was [[Huldrych Zwingli]]. It soon became evident that doctrine in the [[Reformed churches]] was developing in a direction independent of Martin Luther's, under the influence of numerous writers and reformers among whom Calvin eventually became preeminent. Much later, when his fame was attached to the Reformed churches, their whole body of doctrine came to be called &quot;Calvinism&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Spread ===
Although much of Calvin's practice was in Geneva, his publications spread his ideas of a &quot;correctly&quot; reformed church to many parts of Europe. Calvinism became the theological system of the majority in [[Scotland]] (see [[John Knox]]), the [[Netherlands]], with men such as William Ames, T J Frelinghuysen and Wilhelmus à Brakel and parts of [[Germany]] (especially those adjacent to the Netherlands) with the likes of Olevianus and his colleague Zacharias Ursinus. It was influential in France, Hungary, then-independent [[Transylvania]], [[Lithuania]] and Poland. Calvinism gained some popularity in [[Scandinavia]], especially Sweden, but was rejected in favor of [[Lutheranism]] after the [[Uppsala Synod|synod of Uppsala]] in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance and Reformation'' by William Gilbert, [http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html Chapter 12 The Reformation in Germany and Scandinavia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most settlers in the American Mid-Atlantic and [[New England]] were Calvinists, including the English [[Puritan]]s, the French [[Huguenot]] and Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam (New York), and the [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] of the Appalachian back country. Dutch Calvinist settlers were also the first successful European colonizers of [[South Africa]], beginning in the 17th century, who became known as [[Boer]]s or [[Afrikaner Calvinism|Afrikaners]].

[[Sierra Leone]] was largely colonized by Calvinist settlers from [[Nova Scotia]], who were largely [[Black Loyalist]]s, blacks who had fought for the [[British Empire|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. [[John Marrant]] had organized a congregation there under the auspices of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion|Huntingdon Connection]]. Some of the largest Calvinist communions were started by 19th and 20th century [[missionary|missionaries]]. Especially large are those in [[Indonesia]], [[Korea]] and [[Nigeria]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Today, the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]] has 75 million believers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html Major Branches of Religions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism, though these points identify the Calvinist view on [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things – in salvation but also in all of life.

=== Sovereign grace ===

Calvinism focuses on [[total depravity]] or, the total inadequacy of humanity's ethical nature, necessitating the sovereign [[Divine grace|grace]] of God for [[salvation]]. It states that [[Fall of Man|fallen]] people are morally and spiritually incapable of following God or redeeming themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John “Commentaries to the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians and Ephesians”. Translated by Rev. William Pringle. Ephesians Ch 2:1. http://www.ccel.org&lt;/ref&gt; They see redemption as the work of God, divine intervention: God changes their unwilling [[heart (Symbolism and Metaphor)|hearts]] from rebellion to eager obedience.

In this view all the people of the world are at the complete and total mercy of God, who would be just in condemning all people for their [[sin]]s, though God has chosen to show mercy to some, not all. One person is saved while another person is condemned, not because of inclination, faith or any other virtue that is in the person but because God chose to have mercy on him (Romans 9:16-17) according to his own purpose which is unknown (Romans 8:28).&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. “Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans”. Translated by John Owen. Ch 9:10–13. http://www.ccel.org&lt;/ref&gt; The person must believe the gospel and repent to be saved, this compliance of faith is a gift from God, and thus God completely and sovereignly achieves the salvation of sinners. Views range from predestination to [[damnation]] also known as the doctrine of [[reprobation]]. They are less uniform than the view of predestination to [[salvation]] (the doctrine of election) that are among self-described Calvinists (see [[Supralapsarianism and Infralapsarianism]]).

During practice, Calvinists teach sovereign grace mostly for  encouragement of the church because Calvinists believe the doctrine validates the extent of God's love for saving those who were not able to follow him, or chose not to do so, as well as defeating pride and self-reliance and stressing the Christian's total need for and dependence on the grace of God. In a similar way, [[sanctification]] in the Calvinist view involves a frequent dependence on God to eliminate the Christian's immoral heart and their sinful nature, and from the power of sin and to extend the Christian's joy in their new nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&amp;var1=ArtRead&amp;var2=270&amp;var3=authorbio&amp;var4=AutRes&amp;var5=42|title=Gospel-Driven Sanctification|author=Bridges, Jerry|accessdate=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Five points of Calvinism ===
&lt;!-- Note: Outside links (e.g., [[Five points of Calvinism]], [[TULIP]]) point to this section; do not delete or modify its name without addressing those links. --&gt;
{{TULIP}}
Calvinist theology is sometimes identified with the five points of Calvinism, also called the doctrines of grace, which are a point-by-point response to the five points of the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] [[Five articles of Remonstrance|Remonstrance]] (see [[History of Calvinist-Arminian debate]]) and which serve as a summation of the judgments rendered by the [[Synod of Dort]] in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Arminian Controversy and the Synod of Dort]],&quot; [http://spindleworks.com/library/vandergugten/arminian_c.htm Spindleworks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin himself never used such a model and never combated Arminianism directly. In fact, Calvin died in 1564 and Jacob Arminias was born in 1560, and so the men were not contemporaries. The Articles of Remonstrance were authored by opponents of reformed doctrine and Biblical [[Monergism]]. They were rejected in 1619 at the Synod of Dort, more than 50 years after the death of Calvin.

The five points therefore function as a summary of the differences between Calvinism and Arminianism, but not as a complete summation of Calvin's writings or of the theology of the Reformed churches in general. In English, they are sometimes referred to by the [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] TULIP&lt;ref name=&quot;gotquestions.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.gotquestions.org/calvinism.html gotquestions.org]. gotquestions.org. Retrieved 2011-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; (see below), though this puts them in a different order from the [[Canons of Dort]].

The central assertion of these canons is that God is able to save every person upon whom he has mercy, and that his efforts are not frustrated by the unrighteousness or inability of humans.

*&quot;[[Total depravity]]:&quot; This doctrine, also called &quot;total inability,&quot; asserts that as a consequence of the [[Fall of Man|fall of man into sin]], every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of [[sin]]. People are not by nature inclined to love God with their whole heart, mind, or strength, but rather all are inclined to serve their own interests over those of their neighbor and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term &quot;total&quot; in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as possible.)&lt;ref&gt;David Steele and Curtis Thomas, &quot;The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented,&quot; pg.25, &quot;The adjective 'total' does not mean that each sinner is as totally or completely corrupt in his actions and thoughts as it is possible for him to be. Instead, the word 'total' is used to indicate that the &quot;whole&quot; of man's being has been affected by sin.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine is derived from [[Augustine]]'s explanation of [[Original Sin]].
*&quot;[[Unconditional election]]:&quot; This doctrine asserts that God has chosen from [[eternity]] those whom he will bring to himself not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people; rather, it is unconditionally grounded in God's mercy alone. God has chosen from [[eternity]] to extend mercy to those he has chosen and to withhold mercy from those not chosen. Those chosen receive salvation through Christ alone. [[Reprobation|Those not chosen]] receive the just wrath that is warranted for their sins against God&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ Westminster Confession of Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;[[Limited atonement]]:&quot; Also called &quot;particular redemption&quot; or &quot;definite atonement&quot;, this doctrine asserts that Jesus's [[substitutionary atonement]] was definite and certain in its purpose and in what it accomplished. This implies that only the sins of [[the elect]] were [[penal substitution|atoned]] for by Jesus's death.   Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is designed for some and not all. Hence, Calvinists hold that the atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calvinistcorner.com/tulip.htm The Five Points of Calvinism]. The Calvinist Corner. Retrieved 2011-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine is driven by the Calvinistic concept of the sovereignty of God in salvation and their understanding of the nature of the atonement.
*&quot;[[Irresistible grace]]:&quot; This doctrine, also called &quot;efficacious grace&quot;, asserts that the saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has determined to save (that is, [[the elect]]) and, in God's timing, overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to a saving faith.  This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved.  The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's [[Holy Spirit]] cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, &quot;graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-highway.com/compare.html Comparison of Calvinism and Arminianism]. The-highway.com. Retrieved 2011-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;[[Perseverance of the saints]]:&quot; Perseverance (or preservation) of the [[saints]] (the word &quot;saints&quot; is used to refer to all who are set apart by God, and not of those who are exceptionally [[holy]], [[Canonization|canonized]], or in [[heaven]]). The doctrine asserts that since God is sovereign and his will cannot be frustrated by humans or anything else, those whom God has called into communion with himself will continue in faith until the end. Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with or will return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/boettner/predest.iv.vi.html |chapter=The Perseverance of the Saints |title=The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination |author=[[Loraine Boettner]] |accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nature of the atonement ====

An additional point of disagreement with Arminianism implicit in the five points is the Calvinist understanding of the doctrine of Jesus's [[substitutionary atonement]] as a punishment for the sins of the elect, which was developed by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and especially [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]] and Calvin himself. Calvinists argue that if Christ takes the punishment in the place of a particular sinner, that person must be saved since it would be unjust for him then to be condemned for the same sins.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. “Institutes of the Christian Religion” . Christian Classics Ethereal Library. Book 2 Ch 16. 1536. Web. 7 Jul. 2010. &lt;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive and binding nature of this [[Atonement (Satisfaction view)|satisfaction model]] has strong implications for each of the five TULIP points, and it has led some Arminians to subscribe instead to the [[governmental theory of atonement]]. Under that theory, no particular sins or sinners are in view, but all of humanity are included in those whose sins have been taken away. The atonement was not the penalty of the law, but a substitute for the penalty, which allows God to remit the penalty by his grace when any sinner repents and believes in Jesus as the Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|3:16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covenant theology ===
{{Main|Covenant theology}}

Although the doctrines of grace have generally received the greater focus in contemporary Calvinism, covenant theology is the historic superstructure that unifies the entire system of doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]] |title=God of Promise, Introducing Covenant Theology |year=2006 |isbn=0-8010-1289-9 |publisher = Baker Books |location = Grand Rapids, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvinists take God's [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] to mean that the relationship between God and his creation must be by voluntary condescension on God's part. This relationship he establishes is [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]]al: the terms of the relationship are unchangeably decreed by God alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1647) [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VII.html VII.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reformed writings commonly refer to an intra-[[Trinity|Trinitarian]] covenant of redemption. The greater focus is the relationship between God and man, which in historic Calvinism is seen as bi-covenantal, reflecting the early [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] distinction between [[Law and Gospel]]. The covenant of works encompasses the moral and [[natural law]], dictating the terms of creation. By its terms, man would enjoy eternal life and blessedness based on his continued personal and perfect righteousness. With the [[fall of man]], this covenant continues to operate, but only to condemn sinful man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1647) [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VII.html VII.2]; [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XIX.html XIX.1, 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The covenant of grace is instituted at the fall, and administered through successive historic [[covenant theology#Biblical covenants|covenants]] seen in Scripture for the purpose of redemption. By its terms, salvation comes not by any personal performance, but by promise. Peace with God comes only through a mediator, the fulfillment of which is found in the person and work of [[Jesus Christ]]. Christ is seen as the [[federal head]] of his elect people, and thus the covenant is the basis of the doctrines of the [[substitutionary atonement]] and the [[imputed righteousness|imputation]] of the [[active obedience]] of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]] (1647) [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VII.html VII.3]; [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VIII.html XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

Covenant theology has recently had a resurgence around key participants in the Scripture and Hermeneutics Seminar (SAHS), a project first based in Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Gloucestershire (Cheltenham, England).  All through these new developments in covenant theology  we see (1) a thematic resurgence of &quot;interpreting the Old Testament through Christ&quot; including the notion of [http://euangelizomai.blogspot.com/2010/03/mcdonough-christ-creator.html Christ the Creator] and now King ; and (2) retaining, stressing, and re-exploring Genesis 1–3 toward a renewed discipline of biblical interpretation in terms of the [[religious ground motive]] of Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Communion in the Holy Spirit as the core of the covenant in the OT, biblically speaking, plus (3) the motif of [[Ecumenism|ecumenical dialogue]] in this task which now includes [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestants]] and  Catholics as participants, and the scholarly dialogue with the [[Canonical criticism|Canon Criticism]] school.

=== Worship regulated by God ===
{{Main|Regulative principle of worship}}

The regulative principle regarding worship, which distinguishes the Calvinist approach to the public [[Christian worship|worship]] of God from other views, is that only those elements that are instituted or appointed by command or example in the [[New Testament]] are permissible in worship. In other words, the regulative principle maintains that God institutes in the scriptures what he requires for worship in the church, and everything else is prohibited. As the regulative principle is reflected in Calvin's own thought, it is driven by his evident antipathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and its worship practices, and it associates musical instruments with [[icon]]s, which he considered violations of the [[Ten Commandments]]' prohibition of graven images.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/joh_barber/PT.joh_barber.Luther.Calvin.Music.Worship.html |journal=Reformed Perspectives Magazine |volume=8 |issue=26 |date=25 June 2006 |title=Luther and Calvin on Music and Worship |author=John Barber |accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this basis, many early Calvinists also eschewed [[musical instrument]]s and advocated [[exclusive psalmody]] in worship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/music.htm |accessdate=2007-11-16 |year=1998 |title= Musical Instruments in the Public Worship of God |author=Brian Schwertley}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Calvin himself allowed other scriptural songs as well as psalms,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot; /&gt; and this practice typified [[presbyterian worship]] and the worship of other Reformed churches for some time.  The original Lord's Day service designed by John Calvin was a highly liturgical service with the Creed, Alms, Confession and Absolution, the Lord's supper, Doxologies, prayers, Psalms being sung, the Lords prayer being sung, Benedictions. The following are Orders of Service for the Lords Day as designed by John Calvin (Collect is a short prayer; Lection is a Scripture reading; Fraction and Delivery are the breaking of the
bread and distribution thereof, respectively):

Since the 19th century, however, some of the Reformed churches have modified their understanding of the regulative principle and make use of musical instruments, believing that Calvin and his early followers went beyond the biblical requirements&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot; /&gt; and that such things are circumstances of worship requiring biblically-rooted wisdom, rather than an explicit command. Despite the protestations of those who hold to a strict view of the regulative principle, today [[hymn]]s and musical instruments are in common use, as are [[contemporary worship music]] styles and [[worship band]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Frame |title=Worship in Spirit and Truth |year=1996 |isbn=0-87552-242-4 |publisher=P&amp;R Pub. |location=Phillipsburg, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==

Many efforts have been undertaken to reform or expand on Calvinism, and these variations appear to a greater or lesser degree throughout the history of Calvinism.

=== Lapsarianism ===
{{Main|Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism}}

Within [[scholasticism|scholastic]] Calvinist theology, there are two schools of thought over ''when'' and ''whom'' God predestined: [[supralapsarianism]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''supra'', &quot;above&quot;, here meaning &quot;before&quot; + ''lapsus'', &quot;fall&quot;) and [[infralapsarianism]] (from the Latin: ''infra'', &quot;beneath&quot;, here meaning &quot;after&quot; + ''lapsus'', &quot;fall&quot;). The former view, sometimes called &quot;high Calvinism&quot;, argues that [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] occurred partly to facilitate God's purpose to choose some individuals for salvation and some for damnation. Infralapsarianism, sometimes called &quot;low Calvinism&quot;, is the position that, while the Fall was indeed planned, it was not planned with reference to who would be saved.

Supralapsarians believe that God chose which individuals to save before he decided to allow the race to fall and that the Fall serves as the means of realization of that prior decision to send some individuals to [[hell]] and others to [[heaven]] (that is, it provides the grounds of condemnation in the [[reprobation|reprobate]] and the need for [[salvation]] in the elect). In contrast, infralapsarians hold that God planned the race to fall logically prior to the decision to save or damn any individuals because, it is argued, in order to be &quot;saved&quot;, one must first need to be saved from something and therefore the decree of the Fall must precede predestination to salvation or damnation.

These two views vied with each other at the Synod of Dort (1618), an international body representing Calvinist Christian churches from around Europe, and the judgments that came out of that council sided with infralapsarianism ([[Canons of Dort]], First Point of Doctrine, Article 7). The influential [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] also teaches (in Hodge's words &quot;clearly impl[ies]&quot;) the infralapsarian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.ii.html|title=Systematic Theology – Volume II – Supralapsarianism|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|author=Hodge, Charles|year=1871|accessdate=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; view, but is sensitive to those holding to supralapsarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.iii.html|title=Systematic Theology – Volume II – Infralapsarianism|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|author=Hodge, Charles|year=1871|accessdate=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lapsarian controversy has a few vocal proponents on each side today, but overall it does not receive much attention among modern Calvinists.

=== Four-point Calvinism ===
{{Main|Amyraldism}}

Another revision of Calvinism is called &quot;[[Amyraldism]]&quot;, &quot;hypothetical [[universalism]]&quot;, or &quot;four-point Calvinism&quot;, also known as Four-point Calvinism, Moderate Calvinism, Modified Calvinism, or Unlimited Limited Atonement. This drops the limited atonement in favor of an [[unlimited atonement]] saying that God has provided Christ's atonement for all alike, but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elects those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of [[unconditional election]].&lt;ref name=Sproul&gt;Sproul R.C. ''The Truth of the Cross.'' Reformation Trust Publishing: 2007 ISBN 978-1-56769-087-3, pp.140–142&lt;/ref&gt;

This doctrine was most thoroughly systematized by the French Reformed theologian at the [[Academy of Saumur]], [[Moses Amyraut]], for whom it is named. His formulation was an attempt to bring Calvinism more nearly alongside the Lutheran view.  In England, hypothetical universalism (which is not entirely consistent with Amyraldianism) was held by the early 17th century theologians [[John Davenant]] and [[John Preston (clergyman)|John Preston]] and was propounded at the [[Westminster Assembly]] by the English Presbyterian leaders [[Edmund Calamy the Elder]], [[Lazarus Seaman]] and [[Stephen Marshall (English clergyman)|Stephen Marshall]].  In a different, more idiosyncratic form, it was expounded in England by the writings of the Reformed pastor [[Richard Baxter]] and gained strong adherence among the [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalists]] and some [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterians]] in the [[13 colonies|American colonies]], during the 17th and 18th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Amyraldism can be found among various [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] groups in the United States and within the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]]. &quot;Four point&quot; Calvinism is prevalent in conservative and moderate groups among [[Presbyterian]] churches, [[Reformed churches]], [[Reformed Baptist]]s and some [[non-denominational]] churches, and is not uncommon among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] members of the [[Church of England]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Historically, Amyraldism has been called &quot;moderate Calvinism&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]] in J. Matthew Pinson (ed.), ''Four Views on Eternal Security'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Norman Geisler]] uses this term to describe his own views, which [[James White (theologian)|James R. White]] calls &quot;merely a modified form of historic [[Arminianism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James White, ''The Potter's Freedom'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. C. Sproul]] believes there is confusion about what the doctrine of limited atonement actually  teaches. While he considers it possible for a person to believe four points without believing the fifth, he claims that a person who really understands the other four points ''must'' believe in limited  atonement because of what Martin Luther called a resistless logic.&lt;ref name=Sproul/&gt;

[[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]] calls this &quot;[http://www.marshillchurch.org/media/christ-on-the-cross/unlimited-limited-atonement Unlimited Limited Atonement]&quot;, or &quot;Four-and-a-half point Calvinism&quot;, whereby Jesus, ''by dying for everyone, purchased everyone as His possession and He then applies His forgiveness to the elect by grace and applies His wrath to the non-elect. Objectively, Jesus' death was sufficient to save anyone, and, subjectively, only efficient to save those who repent of their sin and trust in Him.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marshillchurch.org/media/christ-on-the-cross/unlimited-limited-atonement | title=Unlimited Limited Atonement | first=Mark | last = Driscoll | date = 20 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hyper-Calvinism ===
{{Main|Hyper-Calvinism}}

Hyper-Calvinism first referred to an eccentric {{dubious|date=November 2011}} view that appeared among the early English [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]] in the 18th century. Their system denied that the call of the gospel to &quot;[[repentance|repent]] and believe&quot; is directed to every single person and that it is the duty of every person to trust in Christ for salvation. The term also occasionally appears in both [[theological]] and secular controversial contexts, where it usually connotes a negative opinion about some variety of [[theological determinism]], [[predestination]], or a version of Evangelical Christianity or Calvinism that is deemed by the critic to be unenlightened, harsh, or extreme.

=== Neo-orthodoxy ===
{{Main|Neo-orthodoxy}}

In the mainline Reformed churches, Calvinism has undergone expansion and revision through the influence of [[Karl Barth]] and [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] theology. Barth was an important Swiss Reformed theologian who began writing early in the 20th century, whose chief accomplishment was to counter-act the influence of [[the Enlightenment]] in the churches. The [[Barmen declaration]] is an expression of the Barthian reform of Calvinism. Conservative Calvinists (as well as some liberal reformers) regard it as confusing to use the name &quot;Calvinism&quot; to refer to neo-orthodoxy or other liberal revisions stemming from Calvinist churches due to their differing theological views.

=== Neo-Calvinism ===
{{Main|Neo-Calvinism}}

Besides the traditional movements within the conservative Reformed churches, several trends have arisen through the attempt to provide a contemporary, but theologically conservative approach to the world.

A version of Calvinism that has been adopted by both theological conservatives and liberals gained influence in the Dutch Reformed churches, late in the 19th century, dubbed &quot;neo-Calvinism&quot;, which developed along lines of the theories of Dutch theologian, statesman and journalist, [[Abraham Kuyper]]. More traditional Calvinist critics of the movement characterize it as a revision of Calvinism, although a conservative one in comparison to modernist Christianity or neo-orthodoxy. Neo-Calvinism, &quot;Calvinianism&quot;, or the &quot;[[Reformational philosophy|reformational movement]]&quot;, is a response to the influences of [[the Enlightenment]], but generally speaking it does not touch directly on the articles of salvation. Neo-Calvinists intend their work to be understood as an update of the Calvinist [[worldview]] in response to modern circumstances, which is an extension of the Calvinist understanding of religion to [[science|scientific]], [[society|social]] and political issues. To show their consistency with the historic Reformed movement, supporters may cite Calvin's ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion|Institutes]]'', book 1, chapters 1–3, and other works. In the United States, Kuyperian neo-Calvinism is represented among others, by the ''[[Center for Public Justice]]'', a faith-based political [[think-tank]] headquartered in Washington, D.C.

Neo-Calvinism branched off in more theologically conservative movements in the United States. The first of these to rise to prominence became apparent through the writings of [[Francis Schaeffer]], who had gathered around himself a group of scholars, and propagated their ideas in writing and through [[L'Abri]], a Calvinist study center in Switzerland. This movement generated a reawakened social consciousness among [[evangelicalism|Evangelicals]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}.

==== Christian Reconstructionism ====
{{Main|Christian Reconstructionism}}

A neo-Calvinist movement called &quot;[[Christian Reconstructionism]]&quot; is much smaller, more radical, and [[Theocracy|theocratic]], but by some believed to be widely influential in American family and political life. Reconstructionism is a distinct revision of Kuyper's approach, which sharply departs from that root influence through the complete rejection of [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], and by formulating suggested applications of the sanctions of Biblical Law for modern civil governments. These distinctives are the least influential aspects of the movement. Its intellectual founder, the late [[R.J. Rushdoony|Rousas J. Rushdoony]], based much of his understanding on the [[presuppositional apologetics|apologetical]] insights of [[Cornelius Van Til]], father of [[presuppositionalism]] and professor at [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] (although Van Til himself did not hold to such a view). It has some influence in the conservative Reformed churches in which it was born, and in Calvinistic Baptist and [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] churches mostly in the United States, Canada, and to a lesser extent in the UK.

Reconstructionism aims toward the complete rebuilding of the structures of society on Christian and Biblical presuppositions, not, according to its promoters, in terms of &quot;top down&quot; structural changes, but through the steady advance of the Gospel of Christ as men and women are converted, who then live out their obedience to God in the areas for which they are responsible. In keeping with the [[Theonomy|Theonomic Principle]], it seeks to establish laws and structures that will best instantiate the ethical principles of the Bible, including the [[Old Testament]] as expounded in the case laws and summarized in the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]. Not a political movement, strictly speaking, Reconstructionism has nonetheless been influential in the development of aspects of the [[Christian Right]] that some critics have called &quot;[[Dominionism]]&quot;. Reconstructionism assumes that God institutes in the Scriptures everything he requires for the ordering of self and society, extending the [[regulative principle of worship]] to all areas of life.

== Social and religious influences of Calvinism ==
=== Usury and capitalism ===

One school of thought attributes Calvinism with setting the stage for the later development of capitalism in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of [[usury]] and, implicitly, of profit in general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Such a connection was advanced in influential works by [[R. H. Tawney]] (1880–1962) and by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

Calvin expressed himself on usury in a 1545 letter to a friend, Claude de Sachin, in which he criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of [[Aristotle]]) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;The letter is quoted in {{cite book | last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He qualified his view, however, by saying that money should be lent to people in dire need without hope of interest, while a modest interest rate of 5% should be permitted in relation to other borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book | last = Haas | first = Guenther H. | title = The Concept of Equity in Calvin's Ethics | publisher = [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]] | location = Waterloo, Ont., Canada | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-88920-285-0 | pages = 117ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arminianism ===
{{Main|Arminianism}}
{{Five Articles}}

{{See also|History of Calvinist-Arminian debate}}

A theological and political movement in opposition to Calvinism, now called &quot;[[Arminianism]]&quot;, was founded by Dutch theologian [[Jacob Arminius]] and revised and pursued by the [[Remonstrants]]. Arminius rejected several tenets of the Calvinist doctrines of salvation – namely, the latter four of what would later be known as the five points of Calvinism. The term &quot;Arminianism&quot; today often serves as an umbrella term for both Arminius's doctrine and the Remonstrants', but Arminius's followers sometimes distinguish themselves as &quot;Reformed Arminians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Ashby, &quot;A Reformed Arminian View&quot;, in {{cite book | last = Pinson | first = J. Matthew, editor | title = Four Views on Eternal Security | publisher = [[Zondervan]] | location = Grand Rapids | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-310-23439-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


The Remonstrants' doctrine was condemned at the [[Synod of Dort]] held in [[Dordrecht]], Holland, in 1618/1619, and followers of either Arminius or the Remonstrants are not generally considered &quot;Reformed&quot; by most Calvinists. Many [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]] adopted the position advocated by the Remonstrants, and Arminius's system was revived by evangelist [[John Wesley]] and is common today, particularly in [[Methodism]].
