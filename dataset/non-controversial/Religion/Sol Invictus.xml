{{Ancient Roman religion|259px}}
'''Sol Invictus''' (&quot;Invincible Sun&quot;) was the official [[Solar deity|sun god]] of the later [[Roman Empire]]. In 274 the [[Roman emperor]] [[Aurelian]] made it an official [[cult]] alongside the traditional Roman cults.  Scholars disagree whether the new deity was a refoundation of the ancient [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] cult of [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]],&lt;ref&gt;See S.E.Hijmans, &quot;The sun that did not rise in the east&quot;, Babesch 71 (1996) p.115–150&lt;/ref&gt; a revival of the cult of [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]]&lt;ref&gt;See Gaston Halsberghe, &quot;The cult of Sol Invictus&quot;, Leiden: Brill, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; or completely new.&lt;ref&gt;As Hijmans states (p.115): &quot;Scholars have consistently postulated a clear distinction between the Republican Sol Indiges and the Imperial Sol Invictus.&quot; and p.116 &quot;We should keep in mind, however, that most scholars agree that this cult [Sol Indiges] was never important, and that it had disappeared altogether by the beginning of the second century AD&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The god was favored by emperors after Aurelian and appeared on their coins until [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;Halsberghe, &quot;The cult of Sol Invictus&quot;, p.155: &quot;Up to the conversion of Constantine the Great, the cult of Deus Sol Invictus received the full support of the emperors. The many coins showing the sun god that these emperors struck provide official evidence of this.&quot; and p.169 &quot;the custom of representing Deus Sol Invictus on coins came to an end in AD 323.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The last inscription referring to Sol Invictus dates to 387 AD&lt;ref&gt;Halsberghe, &quot;The cult of Sol Invictus&quot;, p.170 n.3: &quot;CIL VI, 1778, dates from AD 387,&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and there were enough devotees in the 5th century that [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] found it necessary to preach against them.&lt;ref&gt;Halsberghe, p.170, n.4: &quot;Augustine, ''Sermones'', XII; also in ''Ennaratio in Psalmum'' XXV; ''Ennaratio'' II, 3.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is commonly claimed that the date of December 25th for [[Christmas]] was selected in order to correspond with the Roman festival of ''[[Dies Natalis Solis Invicti]]'', or &quot;Birthday of Sol Invictus&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heim, &quot;Solstice d'hiver, solstice d'ete&quot;, Latomus 59 (1999), p.640–660 provides some of the past debates.&lt;/ref&gt; but Pope [[Benedict XVI]] has argued that the December 25 date was determined simply by calculating nine months after March 25, regarded as the day of Jesus’ conception (the [[Feast of the Annunciation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI), ''The Spirit of the Liturgy'', trans. John Saward (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2000), p. 108; cf. p. 100. See also H. Rahner, ''Griechische Mythen in christlicher Deutung''. Darmstadt, 1957. An English translation is available as ''Greek Myths and Christian Mystery'', trans. Brian Battershaw (New York: Harper Row, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was mainly based on a passage of the ''Commentary on the prophet Daniel'' by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], which was written around year 204.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicon.net/chroniconfiles/Hippolytus%20and%20December%2025th.pdf Hippolytus and December 25th as the date of Jesus’ birth]&lt;/ref&gt; However, even Pope Benedict has stated that &quot;Christmas acquired its definitive form in the fourth century when it replaced the Roman Feast of the ''Sol invictus''.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20091223_en.html Benedictus XVI speech at Paul VI Audience Hall, on Wednesday, 23 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;


== Use of the phrase ==
[[File:Disc Sol BM GR1899.12-1.2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Repoussé]] [[silver]] disc of Sol Invictus, Roman, 3rd century, found at [[Pessinus]] ([[British Museum]])]]
''Invictus'' (unconquered) was an [[epithet]] used for various Roman divinities in the Roman Empire. In the [[Roman Calendar]] of the early empire these include ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] Invictus'' and ''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] Invictus''. It was in use from the late Republic and throughout the Imperial period for a range of deities, such as [[Hercules]], [[Apollo]] and [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]],&lt;ref&gt;Hijmans, &quot;The sun which did not rise in the east&quot;, p.124: ''Hercules lnvictus is also mentioned on coins, and on inscriptions he is almost as popular as Sol Invicnts. Other invicti on inscriptions include Jupiter, Mercurius, Satumus and Silvanus.''&lt;/ref&gt; and was therefore a well-established form when applied to [[Mithraic Mysteries#Mithras Sol Invictus|Mithras]] by Roman devotees from the 2nd century onwards. It has a clear association with solar deities and solar monism; as such, it became the preferred epithet of Rome's traditional [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] and the novel, short-lived Roman state cult to [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]], an [[Emesa]]n solar deity who headed Rome's official pantheon under his [[Elagabalus|namesake emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;The Roman cult to Sol is continuous from the &quot;earliest history&quot; of the city to (at the latest) the institution of Christianity as an exclusive Roman State religion. Scholarly assertions that Rome's traditional ''Sol'' and ''Sol Invictus'' as different deities are refuted in {{harvtxt|Hijmans|2009|pp=Chapter 1}} (a reworking of Hijmans, 1996. Matern 2001, Wallraff 2002, and Berrens 2004 all follow Hijmans in rejecting the notion that Sol Invictus was somehow a separate, distinct solar deity. Sol Invictus&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest dated use of ''Sol invictus'' is in a dedication from Rome, AD 158.&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' VI, 715: Soli Invicto deo / ex voto suscepto / accepta missione / honesta ex nume/ro eq(uitum) sing(ularium) Aug(usti) P(ublius) / Aelius Amandus / d(e)d(icavit) Tertullo et / Sacerdoti co(n)s(ulibus)[http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/epigr/uah-bilder.php?bild=PH0008364] (Publius Aelius Amandus dedicated this to the god Sol Invictus in accordance with the vow he had made, upon his honorable discharge from the equestrian guard of the emperor, during the consulship of Tertullus and Sacerdos); see: J. Campbell, ''The Roman army, 31 BC–AD 337: a sourcebook'' (1994), p. 43; Halsberghe 1972, p. 45.[http://books.google.ca/books?id=M1doAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Aelius+Amandus%22&amp;dq=%22Aelius+Amandus%22]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another, stylistically dated to the 2nd century AD, is inscribed on a Roman ''[[phalera (military decoration)|phalera]]'': ''&quot;inventori lucis soli invicto augusto&quot;'' (to the contriver of light, sol invictus augustus ).&lt;ref&gt;Guarducci, M.,  &quot;Sol invictus augustus,&quot; ''Rendiconti della Pont. Accademia Romana di archeologia'', 3rd series '''30/31''' (1957/59) pp 161ff. An illustration is provided in Kantorowicz, E. H., &quot;Gods in Uniform&quot; ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''105'''.4 (August 1961: 368–393) 383, fig. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Here &quot;augustus&quot; is most likely a further epithet of Sol as &quot;august&quot; (an elevated being, divine or close to divinity), though the association of Sol with the Imperial house would have been unmistakable and was already established in iconography and stoic monism.&lt;ref&gt;For &quot;august[us]&quot; as divine epithet, see Hornum, ''Nemesis, the Roman state and the games'' (1993), 36–9. ([http://books.google.ca/books?id=-innYh2yO48C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=augustus+divine+epithet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KvZyIgFEkB&amp;sig=8UTE7X2INYdd4thps3sPLHnkT4k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AzT7SrmjGdK0tgfWtcWfCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=augustus%20divine%20epithet&amp;f=false on-line]) ''Augusta'' is a common epithet for [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] (51 occurrences according to Hornum) but ''augustus'' is quite rare for Sol. Hornum also cites ''august'' as an epithet for the [[Lares]] from 58 BC (Hornum 1993, 37 n. 23), decades before it was granted to Octavian.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the earliest attested examples of Sol as ''invictus'', but in AD 102 a certain [[Anicetus]] restored a shrine of Sol; Hijmans (2009, 486, n. 22) is tempted &quot;to link Anicetus' predilection for Sol with his name, the [[Romanization|Latinized]] form of the Greek word ἀνίκητος, which means ''invictus''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;On that shrine, {{harv|Hijmans|2009|pp=483–508 (chapter 5)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elagabalus ==
The first sun god consistently termed ''invictus'' was the [[Syria (Roman province)|provincial Syrian]] god [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]]. According to the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', the [[Elagabalus|teenaged Severan heir]] adopted the name of his deity and brought his cult image from Emesa to Rome. Once installed as emperor, he neglected Rome's traditional State deities and promoted his own as Rome's most powerful deity. This ended with his murder in 222.

The ''Historia Augusta'' refers to the deity Elagabalus as &quot;also called Jupiter and Sol&quot; (''fuit autem Heliogabali vel Iovis vel Solis'').&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, 1, 5: English translation (Loeb) from Thayer [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#note14] &amp; Latin text [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been seen as an abortive attempt to impose the Syrian sun god on Rome;&lt;ref&gt;See in particular Halsberghe 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; but because it is now clear that the Roman cult of Sol remained firmly established in Rome throughout the Roman period,&lt;ref&gt;Hijmans 1996, Matern 2001, Wallraff 2002, Berrens 2004, {{harvtxt|Hijmans|2009}}).&lt;/ref&gt; this Syrian [[Elagabalus (deity)|Sol Elagabalus]] has become no more relevant to our understanding of the Roman [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] than, for example, the Syrian [[Jupiter Dolichenus]] is for our understanding of the Roman Jupiter.

== Aurelian ==
[[File:Antoninianus-Aurelianus-Palmyra-s3262.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aurelian]] in his radiate crown, on a silvered bronze coin struck at Rome, 274–275]]
The Roman ''[[gens]]'' Aurelia was associated with the cult of Sol.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Richard, “Le culte de Sol et les Aurelii. A propos de Paul Fest. p. 22 L.”, in: ''Mélanges offerts à Jacques Heurgon. L'Italie préromaine et la Rome républicaine'', Rome, 1976, 915–925.&lt;/ref&gt; After his victories in the East, the Emperor [[Aurelian]] thoroughly reformed the Roman cult of Sol, elevating the sun-god to one of the premier divinities of the Empire. Where previously priests of Sol had been simply  ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdotes]]'' and tended to belong to lower ranks of Roman society,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hijmans|2009|pp=504–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were now ''pontifices'' and members of the new [[College of Pontiffs|college of pontifices]] instituted by Aurelian. Every pontifex of Sol was a member of the senatorial elite, indicating that the priesthood of Sol was now highly prestigious. Almost all these senators held other priesthoods as well, however, and some of these other priesthoods take precedence in the inscriptions in which they are listed, suggesting that they were considered more prestigious than the priesthood of Sol.&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of the pontifices of Sol see J. Rupke (ed.), ''Fasti Sacerdotum'' (2005), p. 606. [[Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus]] lists his priesthoods as pontifex of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], one of the [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]], and pontifex of Sol, in that order (''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' vol. 6, 1739–1742). In a list of eight priesthoods, [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] puts ''Pontifex Solis'' in third place ({{CIL|VI|1779}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
Aurelian also built a new temple for Sol, bringing the total number of temples for the god in Rome to (at least) four&lt;ref&gt;The other three were in the Circus Maximus, on the Quirinal, and in Trastevere. {{harv|Hijmans|2009|loc=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also instituted games in honor of the sun god, held every four years from AD 274 onwards.

The confusion surrounding Aurelian's reforms has been significant, much of it rooted in the mistaken opinion that he was introducing a new cult, which, as is now clear, he was not. The following constitute the most common errors of fact attributed to Aurelian and his reforms.

1. Aurelian called his sun god Sol ''Invictus'' to differentiate him from the earlier Roman god Sol.

Actually, Aurelian is twice as likely to call Sol ''Oriens'' on his coins as he is Sol ''Invictus''.&lt;ref&gt;Sol Oriens: Göbl, &quot;Die Muenzpraegung des Kaisers Aurelianus&quot;, ''MIR'' 47 (1995), precise p. numbers to be inserted soon; Sol Invictus, idem. (&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of the fifteen or so pontifices of Sol adds the epithet ''invictus''; all others simply call themselves &quot;pontifex Solis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;We know the names of fourteen pontifices: L. Caesonius Ovinius Manlius Rufinianus Bassus, Virius Lupus Iunius Gallienus, L. Aelius Helvius Dionysius, T. Flavius Postumius Titianus, L. Crepereius Rogatus, M. Iunius Priscillianus Maximus, Iunius Postumianus, Iulius Aurelianus, [[Gaius Ceionius Rufius Volusianus]], [[Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus]] (father-in-law of Symmachus), [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] (one of the leading figures in the pagan Renaissance of the late 4th century), [[Gaius Vettius Cossinius Rufinus]], and Q. Clodius Flavianus. All are listed s.v. in Rupke's ''Fasti Sacerdotum'' with references to the primary sources. Only Iunius Gallienus adds the epithet ''invictus'' to Sol&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Aurelian built his new temple for a Syrian sun god, not the Roman one.

There is no credible evidence to support this, and ample evidence to refute it. The &quot;Syrian Sol-hypothesis&quot; is therefore now rejected by all specialists in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Hijmans 1996, Matern 2001, Wallraff 2002, Berrens 2004, {{harv|Hijmans|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Aurelian inaugurated his new temple dedicated to Sol Invictus and held the first games for Sol on December 25, 274, on the supposed day of the [[winter solstice]] and day of rebirth of the Sun.

This is not only pure conjecture, but goes against the best evidence available.&lt;ref&gt;The best English summary of this issue is {{harv|Hijmans|2009|pp=585–592}}, with ample references to earlier literature (primarily in German).[http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/arts/2009/s.e.hijmans/vol1/09_c9.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of celebrating Sol on December 25 prior to AD 354/362. Hijmans lists the known festivals of Sol as August 8 and/or 9, August 28, and December 11. There are no sources that indicate on which day Aurelian inaugurated his temple and held the first games for Sol, but we do know that these games were held every four years from AD 274 onwards. This means that they were presumably held in AD 354, a year for which perchance a Roman calendar, the [[Chronography of 354]] (or calendar of Filocalus), has survived. This calendar lists a festival for Sol and Luna on August 28, ''[[Ludi]] Solis'' (games for Sol) for October 19–22, and a ''Natalis Invicti'' (birthday of the invincible one) on December 25. While it is widely assumed that the ''invictus'' of December 25 is Sol, the calendar does not state this explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_06_calendar.htm The full text of the calendar is available here]&lt;/ref&gt; The only explicit reference to a celebration of Sol in late December is made by [[Julian the Apostate]] in his hymn to King Helios written immediately afterwards in early AD 363. Julian explicitly differentiates between the one-day, annual celebration of late December 362 and the multi-day quadrennial games of Sol which, of course, had also been held in 362, but clearly at a different time.&lt;ref&gt;See three different sections of the hymn: near the beginning, in c. 3 he exhorts his reader to celebrate the ''annual'' festival of Sol as it is celebrated in the ruling city; in c. 41, he draws a contrast between the ''quadrennial'' games for Sol (tet?aet??????? ????a?) which he characterizes as relatively new, and this annual festival — the two are clearly not the same; in c. 42–3, lastly, he states that this annual festival in honour of the rebirth of the sun takes place immediately after the [[Saturnalia]] (which ended on December 23).&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, the evidence of the Calendar of Filocalus and Julian's hymn to Helios clearly shows, according to Hijmans and others, that the ''ludi'' of October 19–22 were the Solar Games instituted by Aurelian. They presumably coincided with the dedication of his new temple for Sol.&lt;ref&gt;Besides {{harv|Hijmans|2009}}, see (M. R. Salzman, &quot;New Evidence for the Dating of the Calendar at Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome&quot; ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''111''' (1981, pp. 215–227) p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

4. After Aurelian, Sol became supreme deity of the Roman Empire.

{{harv|Hijmans|2009|loc=chapter 9}} raises serious doubts about this contention.

== Constantine ==
[[File:Follis-Constantine-lyons RIC VI 309.jpg|thumb|Coin of Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] depicting Sol Invictus with the legend SOLI INVICTO COMITI, circa 315.]]
[[File:Licinius315 Soli Invicto Comiti.JPG|thumb|Identical reverse as above but with Emperor [[Licinius]] on head]]
Emperors portrayed Sol Invictus on their official coinage, with a wide range of legends, only a few of which incorporated the epithet ''invictus'', such as the legend &lt;small&gt;SOLI INVICTO COMITI&lt;/small&gt;, claiming the Unconquered Sun as a companion to the Emperor, used with particular frequency by Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;A comprehensive discussion of all sol-coinage and sol-legends per emperor from [[Septimius Severus]] to [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] can be found in Berrens&amp;nbsp;(2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Statuettes of Sol Invictus, carried by the standard-bearers, appear in three places in reliefs on the [[Arch of Constantine]]. Constantine's official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/6. A [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] of Constantine as well as a gold medallion from his reign depict the Emperor's bust in profile twinned (&quot;jugate&quot;) with Sol Invictus, with the legend &lt;small&gt;INVICTUS CONSTANTINUS&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The medal is illustrated in Jocelyn M.C. Toynbee, ''Roman Medallions'' (1944, reprinted 1987) plate xvii, no. 11; the solidus is illustrated in J. Maurice, ''Numismatique Constantinienne'' vol. II, p. 236, plate vii, no. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine decreed (March 7, 321) ''dies Solis''&amp;mdash;day of the sun, &quot;[[Sunday]]&quot;&amp;mdash;as the Roman day of rest [CJ3.12.2]:

: On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country however persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits because it often happens that another day is not suitable for grain-sowing or vine planting; lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven should be lost.&lt;ref&gt;Excellent discussion of this decree by Wallraff 2002, 96–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's triumphal arch was carefully positioned to align with the [[Colossus of Nero|colossal statue of Sol]] by the [[Colosseum]], so that Sol formed the dominant backdrop when seen from the direction of the main approach towards the arch.&lt;ref&gt;E. Marlowe, “Framing the sun. The Arch of Constantine and the Roman cityscape”, ''Art Bulletin'' '''88''' (2006) 223–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sol and the other Roman Emperors ==
Berrens&lt;ref&gt;S. Berrens, ''Sonnenkult und Kaisertum von den Severern bis zu Constantin I. (193–337 n. Chr.)'' Stuttgart: Steiner 2004 (Historia-Einzelschriften 185).&lt;/ref&gt; deals with coin-evidence of Imperial connection to the Solar cult. Sol is depicted sporadically on imperial coins in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, then more frequently from [[Septimius Severus]] onwards until AD 325/6. ''Sol invictus'' appears on coin legends from AD 261, well before the reign of Aurelian.&lt;ref&gt;Berrens 2004, precise p. number to follow. The coinage Elagabalus does not use ''invictus'' for Roman Sol, nor the Emesan Solar deity Elagabalus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Connections between the imperial radiate crown and the cult of Sol are postulated. [[Augustus]] was posthumously depicted with radiate crown, as were living emperors from [[Nero]] (after AD 65) to [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Some modern scholarship interprets the imperial radiate crown as a divine, solar association rather than an overt symbol of Sol; Bergmann calls it a pseudo-object designed to disguise the divine and solar connotations that would otherwise be politically controversial&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann 1998, 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Hijmans, “Metaphor, Symbol and Reality: the Polysemy of the Imperial Radiate Crown”, in: C.C. Mattusch (ed.), ''Common ground. Archaeology, art, science, and humanities. Proceedings of the XVIth International Congress of Classical Archaeology, Boston, August 23–26, 2003'', Oxford (2006), 440–443; {{harv|Hijmans|2009|pp=80–84, 509–548}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is broad agreement that coin-images showing the imperial radiate crown are stylistically distinct from those of the solar crown of rays; the imperial radiate crown is depicted as a real object rather than as symbolic light.&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann 1998, 116–117; Hijmans 2009, 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Hijmans argues that the Imperial radiate crown represents the honorary wreath awarded to [[Augustus]], perhaps posthumously, to commemorate his victory at the [[battle of Actium]]; he points out that henceforth, living emperors were depicted with radiate crowns, but state ''divi'' were not. To Hijmans this implies the radiate crown of living emperors as a link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as &quot;saviour of the Republic&quot; through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo-Helios. Wreaths awarded to victors at the Actian Games were radiate.&lt;ref&gt;Hijmans 2009, 509–548.

[[File:ChristAsSol.jpg|thumb|270px|left|Mosaic of Christ as [[Sol]] or [[Helios|Apollo-Helios]] in Mausoleum M in the pre-fourth-century necropolis [http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necropolis/Scavi.htm beneath] [[St Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's in the Vatican]] — interpreted by many as representing Christ]]
The [[Chronography of 354|Philocalian calendar]] of 354 AD gives a festival of &quot;Natalis Invicti&quot; on 25 December. There is limited evidence that this festival was celebrated before the mid 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff 2001: 174–177. Many earlier scholars were so convinced that the winter solstice must have been a longstanding festival of Sol that they see evidence where there was none. Hoey (1939: 480), for instance, writes: &quot;An inscription of unique interest from the reign of Licinius embodies the official prescription for the annual celebration by his army of a festival of Sol Invictus on December 19&quot;. The inscription (Dessau, ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 8940) actually prescribes an annual offering to Sol on ''November'' 18 (die XIV Kal(endis) Decemb(ribus), i.e. on the fourteenth day before the Kalends of December).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Text at [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm#Chronography_of_354] Parts 6 and 12 respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the 'Sol Invictus' festival &quot;has a strong claim on the responsibility for our December date&quot; of [[Christmas]] (as per the 1908 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia: Christmas]: ''Natalis Invicti''&lt;/ref&gt;) or not has been called into question by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope [[Benedict XVI]], who challenged this theory by arguing that a December 25 date was determined simply by calculating nine months after March 25, regarded as the day of Jesus’ conception (the [[Feast of the Annunciation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI), ''The Spirit of the Liturgy'', trans. John Saward (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2000), p. 108; cf. p. 100. He regards the old theories as no longer sustainable. March 25 was also considered to be the day of Jesus’ death (although obviously this has to be considered in relation to the dates of the Jewish passover in possibly relevant years), and the day of creation. See also H. Rahner, ''Griechische Mythen in christlicher Deutung''. Darmstadt, 1957. An English translation is available as ''Greek Myths and Christian Mystery'', trans. Brian Battershaw (New York: Harper Row, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th century, [[Pope Leo I]] (the Great) spoke of how the celebration of Christ's birth coincided with the sun's position increasing in the sky in several sermons on the Feast of the Nativity. Here is an excerpt from his [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/360326.htm 26th sermon]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''But this Nativity which is to be adored in heaven and on earth is suggested to us by no day more than this when, with the early light still shedding its rays on nature, there is borne in upon our senses the brightness of this wondrous mystery.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the 1967 [[New Catholic Encyclopedia]], a standard library reference, in an article on ''Constantine the Great'':
:&quot;Besides, the Sol Invictus had been adopted by the Christians in a Christian sense, as demonstrated in the Christ as [[Helios|Apollo-Helios]] in a [[mausoleum]] (c.&amp;nbsp;250) discovered beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's in the Vatican]].&quot; Indeed &quot;...from the beginning of the 3rd century &quot;Sun of Justice&quot; appears as a title of Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', &quot;Christmas&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider this to be in opposition to Sol Invictus{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Some see an allusion to {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:2|NIV}}.

A scribe annotated a manuscript of a work by Syrian bishop [[Jacob Bar-Salibi]] in the 12th century as follows:

: &quot;It was a custom of the Pagans to celebrate on the same 25 December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and revelries the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;(cited in ''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]]. Yale:1997, p. 155)&lt;/ref&gt;
