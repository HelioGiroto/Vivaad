[[File:Samuel e david.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] anoints David, [[Dura Europos]], [[Syria]], Date: 3rd c. CE.]]

A '''messiah''' is a savior or liberator of a people in the Jewish, Christian, Islamic or other religions.

In the [[Hebrew Bible]] a messiah (or ''[[mashiach]]'') is a king or [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priest]] traditionally [[Anointing|anointed]] with [[holy anointing oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2Exodus|30:22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, messiahs were not exclusively Jewish kings, and the Hebrew Bible refers to [[Cyrus the Great]], king of Persia, as a messiah. Following the death of [[Simon bar Kokhba]], a messiah came to be a Jewish king who would rule at the end of history. In later [[Jewish messiah|Jewish messianic]] tradition and [[Jewish eschatology|eschatology]], a messiah is a leader anointed by God, and in some cases, a future [[monarch|King]] of [[United Monarchy|Israel]], physically descended from the [[Davidic line]], who will rule the [[Israelite#The Twelve Tribes|united tribes of Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;Megillah 17b-18a, Taanit 8b&lt;/ref&gt; and herald the [[Messianic Age]]&lt;ref&gt;Sotah 9a&lt;/ref&gt; of global peace.

The translation of the [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] word  ''{{unicode|Mašíaḥ}}'' as Χριστός (''Khristós'') in the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Septuagint]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EOC_1&quot;&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=messiah Etymology Online]&lt;/ref&gt; became the accepted Christian designation and title of [[Jesus]] of Nazareth. [[Christians]] believe that prophecies in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (especially Isaiah) refer to a spiritual savior and believe Jesus to be that Messiah ([[Christ]]).

[[Islamic]] [[hadith|tradition]] holds the view that [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]], son of [[Islamic views of Mary|Maryam]] (aka Jesus, son of Mary), was the promised ''[[nabi]]'' (Prophet) and ''[[masih]]'' (Messiah) sent to the Israelites, and that he will again return to Earth in the end times, along with ''[[Mahdi|al-Mahdi]]'', and they will defeat ''[[Masih ad-Dajjal]]'' (lit. &quot;false Messiah&quot;; cf. [[antichrist]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;MC_1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muttaqun.com/dajjal.html |title=Muttaqun OnLine - Dajjal (The Anti-Christ): According to Quran and Sunnah |publisher=Muttaqun.com |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Messiah ({{Hebrew Name|מָשִׁיחַ|Mashiaẖ|Māšîăḥ}}; in modern Jewish texts in English sometimes spelled ''Moshiach''; [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: {{lang|arc|משיחא}}, [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|el|Μεσσίας}}, [[Syriac language|Syriac]]: {{lang|arc|ܡܫܺܝܚܳܐ}}, {{transl|arc|Məšîḥā}}, {{lang-ar|المسيح}}, {{transl|ar|al-Masīḥ}}, [[Latin]]: ''Messias'') literally means &quot;[[anoint]]ed [one]&quot;. In standard Hebrew, the Messiah is often referred to as מלך המשיח ({{unicode|Méleḫ ha-Mašíaḥ}} in the [[Tiberian vocalization]], pronounced {{unicode|Méleḵ haMMāšîªḥ}}), literally meaning &quot;the Anointed King.&quot;

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Old Testament]] renders all thirty-nine instances of the [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] word for &quot;anointed&quot; (''{{unicode|Mašíaḥ}}'') as Χριστός (''Khristós'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EOC_1&quot;/&gt; The [[New Testament]] records the Greek transliteration Μεσσίας, ''Messias'' twice in [[Gospel of John|John]].{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:41|}}{{Bibleref2c-nb|John|4:25}}

''Masih'' ({{IPA-ar|ˈmɑsiːħ|pron}}) is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for messiah, and its derived adjective, مَسِيحِيّ, means &quot;Christian&quot;. In modern Arabic, it is used as one of the many titles of [[Jesus]]. Masih is used by [[Arab Christians]] as well as [[Muslim]]s, and is written as ''Yasu' al-Masih'' (يسوع المسيح )by Christian Arabs or ''Isa al-Masih'' (عيسى المسيح) by Muslims. The word ''Masih'' literally means &quot;The anointed one&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and in [[Islam]], ''Isa al-Masih'' is believed to have been anointed from birth by [[Allah|Alläh]] with the specific task of being a prophet and a king.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The [[Israelite]]s, to whom Isa was sent, had a traditional practice of anointing their kings with oil. An [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Imam Bukhari]] [[Hadith]] describes Jesus as having wet hair that looked as if water was dripping from it, possibly meaning he was naturally anointed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/055.sbt.html#004.055.650&lt;/ref&gt;  Muslims believe that this is just one of the many signs that proves that Jesus is the Messiah.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Jewish messianism|Jewish Messiah claimants}}
{{see also|Jewish eschatology}}
The literal translation of the Hebrew word ''moshiach'' (messiah) is “anointed,” which refers to a ritual of [[Consecration|consecrating]] someone or something by putting holy oil upon it.{{Bibleref2c|1Sam|10:1-2||1 Sam. 10:1-2}} It is used throughout the [[Hebrew Bible]] in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, a Jewish king,{{Bibleref2c|1Kings|1:39||1 Kings 1:39}} Jewish priests,{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|4:3}} and  prophets,{{Bibleref2c|Isa.|61:1}} the Jewish Temple and its utensils,{{Bibleref2c|Ex.|40:9-11}} unleavened bread,{{Bibleref2c|Num.|6:15}} and a non-Jewish king ([[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus king of Persia]]).{{Bibleref2c|Isa.|45:1}} 

The [[Torah]] describes the advent of a messiah in the [[Balak (parsha)|Torah portion]] of [[Balak]], couched in poetic prophetic prose: &quot;I see him, but not now. I perceive him, but he is not near. There shall step forth a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel... From Jacob shall issue out and destroy the remnant of the city&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 24:17-19&lt;/ref&gt; which Jewish Biblical scholars expound refers to the king's victory over Israel's enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Rashi to Numbers 24:17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Jewish movements are based on [[Pharisees|Pharisaic Judaism]] was embodied in the [[Talmud]].  The Talmud is replete with references and anecdotes about the Messiah and the Messianic era. It states in ''[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|tractate Sanhedrin]]'' &quot;The Jews are destined to eat [their fill] in the days of the Messiah&quot;,  &quot;The world was created only...for the sake of the Messiah.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud: Sanhedrin 98&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;All the prophets prophesied [all the good things] only in respect of the Messianic era.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud: Sanhedrin 99&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides [[exegesis]] of scriptural verses which illustrate the events that will occur at that time. For example, [[resurrection of the dead]], which is exegetically supported by a verse in Exodus 15: &quot;Az Yashir Moshe...&quot; - &quot;Then [Moses] will sing...&quot;, from which is derived that &quot;then&quot; (in the Messianic Era) Moses will arise and once again sing as he did at the time of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 91a&lt;/ref&gt;  (Some Jewish texts also refer to a &quot;[[Messiah ben Joseph]]&quot; or &quot;Messiah ben Ephraim&quot;, a military leader descended from the biblical [[Ephraim]], who will successfully lead the army of Israel in many battles before being killed by [[Armilus]], when Israel is defeated by [[Gog and Magog]]. His body will subsequently lie unburied in the [[Jerusalem]] streets for forty days, and he will be the first person resurrected by the Messiah descended from [[King David]]).&lt;ref name=Patai1988pp165-166&gt;[[Raphael Patai|Patai, Raphael]] (1988). ''The Messiah Texts''. [[Wayne State University Press]]. pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]. &quot;A New Dead Sea Scroll in Stone?&quot; 8 July 2008 [http://www.bib-arch.org/news/dss-in-stone-news.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish eschatology]], the term came to refer to a future Jewish [[monarch|King]] from the [[Davidic line]], who will be &quot;anointed&quot; with [[holy anointing oil]] and rule the Jewish people during the [[Messianic Age]]. Belief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Judaism]], the Messiah is not considered to be [[God]] or a [[Son of God]].

The [[Messianic Age]] is described as follows by Maimonides:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And at that time there will be no hunger or war, no jealousy or rivalry. For the good will be plentiful, and all delicacies available as dust. The entire occupation of the world will be only to know God... the people Israel will be of great wisdom; they will perceive the esoteric truths and comprehend their Creator's wisdom as is the capacity of man. As it is written (Isaiah 11:9): &quot;For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 12:5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And if a king shall arise from among the House of David, studying Torah and occupied with commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will impel all of Israel to follow it and to strengthen breaches in its observance, and will fight Hashem's [God's] wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded and built the [[Third Temple|Holy Temple]] in its proper place and gathered the dispersed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together, as it is stated: &quot;For then I shall turn for the nations a clear tongue, so that they will all procalim the Name of the Lord, and to worship Him with a united resolve (Zephaniah 3:9).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11:4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A prominent Judaism Web site states:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Belief in the eventual coming of the mashiach is a basic and fundamental part of traditional Judaism. It is part of Rambam's 13 Principles of Faith, the minimum requirements of Jewish belief. In the Shemoneh Esrei prayer, recited three times daily, we pray for all of the elements of the coming of the Moshiach: gathering of the exiles; restoration of the religious courts of justice; an end of wickedness, sin, and heresy; reward to the righteous; rebuilding of Jerusalem; restoration of the line of King David; and restoration of Temple service.&lt;ref name=J101a&gt;Tracey Rich &quot;Moshiach: The Messiah.&quot; The Messianic Idea in Judaism. Judaism 101. Sept. 10, 2009. &lt;http://www.jewfaq.org/moshiach.htm &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A common modern [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] interpretation is that there is a ''potential'' messiah in every generation. The Talmud, which often uses stories to make a moral point (''aggadah''), tells of a highly respected [[rabbi]] who found the Messiah at the gates of [[Rome]] and asked him, &quot;When will you finally come?&quot; He was quite surprised when he was told, &quot;Today.&quot; Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, &quot;You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?&quot; The Messiah replied, &quot;Scripture says, 'Today, 'if you will but hearken to His voice.'&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Ps.|95:7}}

A [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition within Judaism is that the commonly-discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace ([[Jewish messianism|Messiah ben David]]) will be preceded by [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who will die sacrificing himself while uniting all of Israel in preparing the world for the arrival of Messiah ben David.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Rabbi Ari. &quot;The Beauty of Joseph&quot; a lesson within M'oray Ha'Aish http://www.aish.com/tp/i/moha/48909612.html &quot;There will be two messiahs one day -- Messiah Son of Joseph, who prepares the way for the Messiah Son of David, himself a descendent of Judah. According to tradition, the Messiah Son of Joseph will unite all Israel in preparation for the arrival of the Messiah Son of David, but will die in the process [Sukka 52a] in an act of self-sacrifice for his people. Just like his ancestor Rachel, whose self-sacrifice allowed the building of the Second Temple, his self-sacrifice will allow the building of the Third Temple. The spiritual model is Joseph, who chose not to contact his father even though it would have made for a &quot;nicer&quot; life.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Origins of Christianity|Christianity emerged]] early in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century AD]] as a movement among Jews ([[Jewish Christians]]) and their [[Gentile]] converts (sometimes called [[Godfearers]])  who believed that [[Jesus]] is the Christ or Messiah. The Greek translation for 'Messiah' is ''khristos'' (χριστος), anglicized as ''Christ''. Christians commonly refer to Jesus as either the &quot;Christ&quot; or the &quot;Messiah.&quot; In [[Christian theology]] the two words are synonymous.

Christians believe Jesus to be the Messiah that the Jews were expecting: &lt;blockquote&gt;The first thing [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] did was to find his brother [[Saint Peter|Simon]] and tell him, &quot;We have found the Messiah&quot; (that is, the Christ). And he brought him to Jesus.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|1:41-42}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Christian concept of the Christ/Messiah as &quot;the Word made Flesh&quot; (see also [[Logos]]) is fundamentally different from the [[Jewish Messiah|Jewish]] and [[Messiah#Islam|Islamic]]. The majority of historical and mainline Christian theologies, as seen within the [[Nicene creed|Nicene Creed]], consider Jesus to be God or [[God the Son]].

Christians believe that [[Daniel]] (Hebrew: דָּנִיֵּאל, or Daniyyel) was a prophet and gave an indication of when the Messiah, the prince ''mashiyach nagiyd'', would come in the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]].{{Bibleref2c|Dan.|9:25-26}} Daniel's prophecies refer to him as a descendant of King David, a [[Son of Man]], who will rebuild the nation of Israel, destroy the wicked, and ultimately [[Last judgment|judge the whole world]].

In Christian theology, the Christ/Messiah serves a number of roles.  The [[Nicene Creed]] of 325 and 381 A.D. provides a convenient framework:&lt;ref&gt;Ankerberg &amp; Weldon, pp. 218-223&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for examples, {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|52:13-53:12}} and {{Bibleref2|Psalm|22}} which Christianity interprets as referring to Jesus.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He was [[Resurrection of Jesus|raised from the dead]] on the third day after He was crucified to prove that He has defeated death and the power of [[Satan]], thus enabling those that receive Him as their Savior to live under [[Grace in Christianity|God's grace]]. {{Bibleref2c|Galatians|2:16}}
* He [[Ascension of Christ|ascended to heaven]] {{Bibleref2c|Acts|1:9-10}} where [[Session of Christ|He currently reigns]] over the world at [[Right Hand of God|God's right hand]] {{Bibleref2c|Romans|8:34}}{{Bibleref2c|Ephesians|1:20}}{{Bibleref2c|Colossians|3:1}} and from where [[Second Coming of Christ|he will return]] {{Bibleref2c|Acts|1:10}}{{Bibleref2c|1Thessalonians|4:16}}
* He serves as the pioneer and embodiment of the culture and living presence of the [[Kingdom of God]]
* When he returns he will [[Last judgment|judge the world]] {{Bibleref2c|2Corinthians|5:10}} and reign over a new creation{{Bibleref2c|Revelation|21:1}}. Christian believers are invited to spend eternity in this [[World to Come|new world]].{{Bibleref2c|Revelation|21:22-27}} (The exact order of these things differs according to the preferred theological framework of [[Millennialism]] used to interpret the passages)
* He is the God of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and Jacob and [[incarnation|he came to earth as a human]]. {{Bibleref2|John|1:1-2,14a}}: ''In the beginning was the [[Logos|Word]] and the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.'' 14a ''And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.'' {{Bibleref2|John|8:58}}: ''Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.''

In the [[New Testament]], Jesus often referred to himself as '[[Son of Man]]'{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|14:61-62}}  {{Bibleref2c|Lk.|22:66-70}}, a clear reference to the first century apocrophal book of Enoch &lt;ref name=&quot;The Heavenly Messiah&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Messiah| url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah | publisher =  Jewish Encyclopedia (1906)|
quote= in the Book of Enoch (xxxvii.-lxxi.) of the first century B.C. The Messiah is called &quot;the Son of Man,&quot; and is described as an angelic being, his countenance resembling a man's, and as occupying a seat in heaven beside the Ancient of Days (xlvi. 1), or, as it is expressed in ch. xxxix. 7, &quot;under the wings of the Lord of spirits.&quot; In ch. xlviii. 3, 6, xlix. 2b it is stated that &quot;His name was called before the Lord of spirits before the sun and the signs of the zodiac were created, and before the stars of heaven were made&quot;; that &quot;He was chosen and hidden with God before the world was created, and will remain in His presence forevermore&quot; (comp. also lxii. 6); and that &quot;His glory will last from eternity unto eternity and his might from generation unto generation&quot; (that &quot;his name&quot; in xlviii. 3 means really &quot;son of man&quot; is evident from verse 6; comp. the similar use of &quot;Shem Yhwh&quot; for &quot;Yhwh&quot; in Isa. xxx. 27). He is represented as the embodiment of justice and wisdom and as the medium of all God's revelations to men (xlvi. 3; xlix. 1, 2a, 3). At the end of time the Lord will reveal him to the world and will place him on the throne of His glory in order that he may judge all creatures in accordance with the end to which God had chosen him from the beginning. When he rises for the judgment all the world will fall down before him, and adore and extol him, and give praise to the Lord of spirits. The angels in heaven also, and the elect in the Garden of Life, will join in his praise and will glorify the Lord. &quot;He will judge all hidden things, and no one will be able to make vain excuses to him&quot;; he will judge also Azazel, with all his associates and all his hosts. The wicked ones of the earth, especially all kings and potentates, he will give over to damnation, but for the just and chosen ones he will prepare eternal bliss, and he will dwell in their midst for all eternity (xlv. 3, 4; xlvi. 4-6; xlviii. 4-10; xlix. 4; li. 3; lv. 4; lxi. 7-lxii. 14).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{Quote|&quot;&quot;He was chosen and hidden with God before the world was created, and will remain in His presence forevermore ... He will judge all hidden things, and no one will be able to make vain excuses to him&quot;}}

Yet for &quot;son of Man (Ben-Adam), one is also wise to note that HaShem, throughout the Book of &quot;Ezekial,&quot; refers to the prophet himself only by the title &quot;ben-Adam.&quot;

Christianity often interprets the phrase as a reference to {{Bibleref2|Daniel|7:13-14}} (KJV):
{{Quote|&quot;I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the [[Ancient of days]], and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Daniel|7:7,13}}}}

Because Christians believe that Jesus is the Messiah and that he claimed to be the Son of Man referred to by Daniel, Christianity interprets {{Bibleref2|Daniel|7:13-14}} as a statement of the Messiah's authority and that the Messiah will have an everlasting kingdom in the [[Messianic Age]]. Jesus' use of this title is seen as a direct claim to be the Messiah.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Deity of Christ (lecture)&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = The Deity of Christ| url = http://www.truevictories.com/2001/01/recorded-lectures-person-work-of-christ.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some identified Jesus as the Messiah,{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|8:29}} his opponents accused him of such a claim,{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:2}} and he is recorded at least twice as asserting it himself directly.{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|14:60-62}} {{Bibleref2c|Jn.|4:25-26}}

Christianity interprets a wide range of biblical passages in the Old Testament (Hebrew scripture) as predicting the coming of the Messiah (see [[Christianity and Biblical prophecy]] for examples), and believes that they are fulfilled in Jesus' own explicit life and teaching:

* Will be born in Bethlehem {{Bibleref2c|Micah|5:2-5}}
* The root of Jesse ...to whom the Gentiles will seek. {{Bibleref2c|Ia.|11:10}}
* He said to them...&quot;Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he [[Expounding of the Law|expounded]] unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|24:25-27}}
* &quot;Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all [[nations]], beginning at Jerusalem.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|24:45-47}}
* The [[Gospel of Matthew]] repeatedly says, &quot;This was to fulfill the prophecy….&quot;
* Psalm 22 describes the actions of the crucifixion in John 19 {{Bibleref2c|Ps.|22}}{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19}}

Christians believe the Messianic prophecies were fulfilled in the mission, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and seeks to [[Great Commission|spread throughout the world]] its interpretation that the Messiah (Jesus) is the only God, and that Jesus will [[Second coming|return]] to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy.

The [[Qur'an]] states Jesus the Son of Mary (Arabic: ''Isa ibn Maryum'') is the Messiah or &quot;Prophet&quot; sent to the Jews,{{Quran-usc|3|45}} and Muslims believe Jesus is alive in Heaven and will return to Earth to defeat the [[Antichrist]] (''Arabic: [[Masih ad-Dajjal|Dajjal]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;MC_1&quot;/&gt; In Islam, Isa is believed to hold the task of killing the false messiah ([[Dajjal|al-Dajjal]], a figure similar to the [[Antichrist]] in Christianity), who will emerge shortly before him during ''[[Qiyamah]]'' (Armageddon in Islamic belief). After he has destroyed al-Dajjal, his final task will be to become leader of the Muslims. Isa will unify the Muslim [[Ummah]] (the followers of Islam) under the common purpose of worshipping Allah alone in pure Islam, thereby ending divisions and deviations by adherents. Mainstream Muslims believe that at that time Isa will dispel Christian and Jewish claims about him.

A [[hadith]] in [[Abu Dawud]] ({{Hadith-usc|abudawud|37|4310}}) says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayrah]]: The Prophet said: There is no prophet between me and him, that is, Jesus. He will descend (to the earth). When you see him, recognise him: a man of medium height, reddish hair, wearing two light yellow garments, looking as if drops were falling down from his head though it will not be wet. He will fight for the cause of Islam. He will break the cross, kill the swine, and put an end to war (in another Tradition, there is the word [[Jizyah]] instead of ''Harb'' (war), meaning that he will abolish jizyah); God will perish all religions except Islam. He [Jesus] will destroy the Antichrist who will live on the earth for forty days and then he will die. The Muslims will pray behind him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Sunni and Shia Muslims agree{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Mahdi|al-Mahdi]] will arrive first, and after him, Jesus. Jesus will proclaim that the true leader is al-Mahdi. A war, literally Jihad (Jihade Asghar) will be fought—the Dajjal (evil) against al-Mahdi and Jesus (good). This war will mark the approach of the coming of the Last Day. After Jesus slays al-Dajjāl at the Gate of [[Lod|Lud]], he will bear witness and reveal that [[Islam]] is indeed the true and last word from God to humanity as Yusuf Ali's translation reads: &quot;And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment He will be a witness against them.{{Quran-usc-range|4|159}}&quot; He will live for several years, marry, have children and will be buried in Medina{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

A [[hadith]] in [[Sahih Bukhari]] ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|55|658}}) says:
: Allah's Apostle said &quot;How will you be when the son of Mary descends amongst you and your Imam is from amongst you.&quot;

Very few scholars outside of mainstream Islam{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} reject all the quotes (Hadith) attributed to Prophet Muhammad that mention the second return of Jesus, the Dajjal and [[Imam Mahdi]], believing that they have no Qur'anic basis. However, Quran emphatically rejects the implication of termination of Jesus’ life when he was allegedly crucified. Yusuf Ali’s translation reads &quot;That they said (in boast), &quot;We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah&quot;;― but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not.― (157) Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. (158) Verses {{Quran-usc-range|4|157|158}} imply that Jesus was not killed physically but it was made to appear so. Verse {{Quran-usc|19|33}}
&quot;So Peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)&quot;! implies that Jesus will die someday. The unified opinion of Islam maintains that the bodily death of Jesus will happen after his second coming. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Many classical commentators{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} such as Ibn Kathir, At-Tabari, al-Qurtubi, Suyuti, al-Undlusi (Bahr al-Muhit), Abu al-Fadl al-Alusi (Ruh al-Maani) clearly mention that verse {{Quran-usc|43|61}} of the Qur'an refers to the descent of Jesus before the Day of Resurrection, indicating that Jesus would be the Sign that the Hour is close.

: And (Jesus) shall be a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment): therefore have no doubt about the (Hour)... {{Quran-usc|43|61}}

===Ahmadiyya===
[[File:Hadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad2.jpg|thumb|[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of the Ahmadiyya movement, considered by Ahmadis to be the Promised Messiah of the latter days]]
{{refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
{{See also|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}
In [[Ahmadiyya]], the terms &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Mahdi&quot; are synonymous terms for one and the same person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewofreligions.org/1599/my%E2%80%88claim-to-promised-messiahship/ Messiah and Mahdi - Review of Religions]&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Mahdi&quot; means ''guided'' by God, thus implying a direct ordainment by God of a divinely chosen individual.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} According to Ahmadiyya thought, Messiahship is a phenomenon through which a special emphasis is given on the transformation of a people by way of offering suffering for the sake of God instead of giving suffering (i.e. refraining from revenge).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Ahmadis believe that this special emphasis was given through the person of Jesus and [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] (1835–1908).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askislam.org/concepts/prophecy_and_prophethood/question_577.html Ask Islam: What is the different between a messiah and a prophet?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Ahmadis hold that the prophesied eschatological figures of Christianity and Islam, the Messiah and Mahdi, were in fact to be fulfilled in one person who was to represent all previous prophets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=2739&amp;region=E1&amp;CR= |title=The Holy Quran |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prophecies concerning the Mahdi or the [[Second Coming of Jesus]] are seen by Ahmadis as metaphorical and subject to interpretation. It is argued that one was to be born and rise within the dispensation of [[Muhammad]], who by virtue of his similarity and affinity with Jesus, and the similarity in nature, temperament and disposition of the people of Jesus' time and the people of the time of the promised one (the Mahdi) is called by the same name.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Numerous hadith are presented by the Ahmadis in support of their view, such as one from [[Sunan Ibn Majah]] which says, ''There is No Mahdi but Jesus son of Mary''.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Majah, Bab, Shahadatu-Zaman&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadis believe that the prophecies concerning the Mahdi and the second coming of Jesus have been fulfilled in [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] (1835–1908), the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement. Contrary to mainstream Islam, the Ahmadis do not believe that Jesus is alive in heaven, but that he survived the crucifixion and migrated towards the east where he died a natural death and that Ghulam Ahmad was only the promised spiritual second coming and likeness of Jesus, the promised Messiah and Mahdi.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
