[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Artist depiction of ''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 16th century (Blaffer Foundation Collection, [[Houston]], [[Texas]]). Most scholars think Paul actually dictated his letters to a secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 316-320. Harris cites {{bibleverse||Galatians|6:11}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|16:22}}, {{bibleverse||Colossians|4:18}}, {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|3:17}}, {{bibleverse||Philemon|19}}.  [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] in his ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians'' writes: &quot;At this point [{{bibleverse||Galatians|6:11}}] the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:2}}; {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|3:17}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. ''pelikois grammasin''), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Pauline Christianity''' is a term used to refer to the [[Christianity]] associated with the beliefs and doctrines espoused by [[Paul of Tarsus]] through [[Pauline epistles|his writings]]. [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Christianity relies heavily on these teachings and considers them to be amplifications and explanations of the [[Ministry of Jesus|teachings of Jesus]]. Others{{who|reason=&quot;others&quot; possible WP:WEASEL wording|date=May 2012}} perceive in Paul's writings, teachings that are different from the original teachings of Jesus documented in the [[canonical gospels]], early [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] and the rest of the [[New Testament]], such as the [[Epistle of James]]. Proponents of the perceived, distinctive Pauline form of Christianity, include [[Marcion of Sinope]], the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] [[theologian]] and [[excommunicated]] [[heresiarch]], who asserted that Paul was the ''only'' [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] who had rightly understood the new message of [[salvation]] as delivered by Jesus Christ. 

Opponents of the same era include the [[Ebionites]] and [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Jewish Christians]] who rejected Paul for straying from &quot;[[List of events in early Christianity|normative]]&quot; [[Judaism]]. ''Pauline Christianity'', as an expression, first came into use in the 20th century among scholars who proposed different strands of thought within [[Early Christianity]], wherein Paul was a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;Lietzmann, Hans  ''History of the Early Church'' Vol 1 p.206&lt;/ref&gt; It has come into widespread use among non-Christian scholars, and depends on the claim that the form of the faith found in the writings of Paul is different from that found elsewhere in the New Testament, but also that his influence came to predominate. 

Reference is made to the large number of non-canonical texts,&lt;ref&gt;M.R. James ''The Apocryphal New Testament (1924) See also the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and the [[Nag Hammadi]] documents&lt;/ref&gt; some of which have been discovered during the last 100 years, which show the many movements and strands of thought emanating from Jesus' life and teaching or which may be contemporary with them, some of which can be contrasted with Paul's thought. Of the more significant are [[Ebionites|Ebionism]] and [[Gnosticism]]. However, there is no universal agreement as to Gnosticism's relationship either to Christianity in general or the [[Paul and Gnosticism|writings of Paul]]. The expression is used by modern Christian scholars, such as Ziesler&lt;ref&gt;Ziesler John, ''Pauline Christianity'' (OUP 2001) Zielsler comments &quot;Pauline Christianity is the earliest for which we have direct documentary evidence...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and Mount, whose interest is in the recovery of Christian origins and the contribution made by Paul to [[Paleo-orthodoxy|Christian doctrine]], [[Christian Reconstructionism]] and [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]].

== Characteristics of 'Pauline Christianity' ==
The characteristics of the critical use of the term take a number of forms. They are partly political and partly theological.

===Political===
From a political perspective, [[Robert Eisenman]] sees Pauline Christianity as a method of taming a dangerous sect among radical Jews and making it palatable to Roman authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenman|1997|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauline Christianity was essentially based on Rome and made use of the administrative skills which Rome had honed. Its system of organization with a single bishop for each town was, in [[Bart Ehrman]]'s view, the means by which it obtained its hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrmann,Bart: ''Lost Christianities'' (OUP)  p 175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological===
The theological aspect is the claim that Paul transmuted Jesus the [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messiah]] into the universal (in a wider meaning &quot;[[Catholic (Christian terminology)|catholic]]&quot;) [[Soter|Savior]]. Pauline theology is also a term referring to the teaching and doctrines especially espoused by the apostle Paul through his writings. [[Mainstream Christianity]] relies on Paul’s writings as integral to the biblical theology of the New Testament and regards them as amplifications and explanations consistent with the teachings of Jesus and other New Testament writings. Christian scholars generally use the term expressing interest in the recovery of Christian origins and the contribution made by Paul to Christian doctrine. Others, especially non-Christian scholars, claim to see a Pauline distinction different from that found elsewhere in the New Testament, a distinction that unduly influenced later Christianity.

===Other views===
The use of the term by Christian scholars, such as John Ziesler,&lt;ref&gt;Ziesler, John ''Pauline Christianity''&lt;/ref&gt; is altogether different. Pauline Christianity is the development of thinking about Jesus in a gentile missionary context; Christopher Rowlands concludes that Paul did not materially alter the teachings of Jesus. Much of this view turns on the significance of the [[Council of Jerusalem]]. According to this view, James decreed that Christianity was for the Gentiles and not just for the Jews, and quoted the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] in support of this position (the ''Apostolic Decree'' is found in {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19-21}}). He entrusted Paul among others with bringing their decision to Antioch ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:22-31}}).

Christians themselves disagree as to how far there was tension between Paul and the Jerusalem Church. (See [[Paul of Tarsus]]). One difficulty is the tension between Acts and Paul's letters; another is the disparity between his views in different letters. Galatians is reserved about the teaching of the Jerusalem church and is hostile toward Jews (whom he calls &quot;[[Judaizers]]&quot;) who would impose Jewish distinctives, codified in the [[Mosaic Law]], on Gentile converts; in Romans Paul is deeply concerned about the spiritual condition and ultimate destiny of the Jewish people.

==Paul's view of the subject==
{{see also|Paul of Tarsus and Judaism}}

That people saw different disciples of Christ as representing different teachings was addressed by Paul himself, in the 1st letter to the Corinthians: (1 Cor 1:10&amp;ndash;18)

{{Cquote2|I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought. My brothers, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you. What I mean is this: One of you says, &quot;I follow Paul&quot;; another, &quot;I follow Apollos&quot;; another, &quot;I follow Cephas(Peter)&quot;; still another, &quot;I follow Christ.&quot;

Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul? I am thankful that I did not
baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, so no one can say that you were baptized into my name. (Yes,
I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.) For Christ
did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel — not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ
be emptied of its power}}

The [[pejorative]] use of the expression &quot;Pauline Christianity&quot; relies in part upon a thesis that Paul's supporters, as a distinct group, had an undue influence on the formation of the canon of scripture, and also that certain bishops, especially the [[Bishop of Rome]], influenced the debates by which the dogmatic formulations known as the [[Creeds]] came to be produced, thus ensuring a Pauline interpretation of the gospel. The thesis is founded on differences between the views of Paul and the apostles in Jerusalem, and also between the picture of Paul in the Acts of the Apostles and his own writings, such that it is claimed that the essential Jewish or [[Old Testament]] character of the faith was lost (see [[Jewish Christian]]).

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Ammon Hennacy]], believe Paul distorted [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' teachings]]. Tolstoy claims Paul was instrumental in the church's &quot;deviation&quot; from Jesus' teaching and practices, whilst Hennacy believed &quot;Paul spoiled the message of Christ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church and State |last=Tolstoy |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Tolstoy |coauthors= |year=1882 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=This deviation begins from the times of the Apostles and especially from that hankerer after mastership Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of Ammon |last=Hennacy |first=Ammon |authorlink=Ammon Hennacy |coauthors= |year=1970 |publisher=Hennacy |location= |isbn= |page=475 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=Paul and the Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tom O'Golo, the [[Ebionites]] believed Paul was a [[false prophet]] whose task was not to convert Romans to Christians but Christians to Romans.&lt;ref name=Tom&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ? No! Jesus? Yes!: A radical reappraisal of a very important life|author=Tom O'Golo|date=2011|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]], [[bishop of Lyon]], wrote in the latter half of the 2nd century that the Ebionites rejected Paul as an [[Antinomianism|apostate from the law]], using only a version of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, known as the [[Gospel of the Ebionites]].

Tom O'Golo postulates several key elements were added by Paul to [[Christian theology]] that weren't evident in [[Jesuism]]. These included:
#[[Original sin]]
#[[Responsibility for the death of Jesus|Making Jews the villains]]
#[[Divinity of Jesus|Making Jesus divine]]
#[[Transubstantiation]] of bread and wine into actual flesh and blood
#Jesus' death being seen as [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement for human sin]]
#Making Jesus the [[Messiah]]
#Shifting the emphasis from an [[World to Come|earthly]] to a [[Heaven|heavenly kingdom]]
#Enlarging the [[chosen people]] to include anyone who accepted Jesus as [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Saviour]]
#Making salvation a matter of [[belief in Jesus]] almost regardless of the [[Orthopraxy|demands of the Torah]]
#Establishing a hierarchy (literally a holy order) to create and control a [[Christian Church|Church]] and more importantly to create and control the [[Creeds|beliefs]] of its membership.&lt;ref name=Tom /&gt;

The argument made that Christian doctrine (that is, the teachings of Jesus) was subsequently distorted by Paul and the Church of Rome depends on a view as to how the canon of Scripture came to be compiled, about which little is known (for details, see [[Biblical canon]]). The earliest references to Paul's writing are fragmentary: [[Clement of Rome]], writing about AD 95, quotes from Romans; [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (d. AD 115) quotes from 1 Corinthians, Romans,  and from 1 Timothy and Titus as if authoritative, not merely as the opinion of one writer.

As to his influence, there are considerable differences of scholarly opinion concerning how far Paul did in fact influence Christian doctrine. Among the most radical is [[G.A. Wells]], a professor of German rather than of theology or history, whose view is that [[Christ myth theory|Jesus was a mythical figure]] and that Christianity was in good part invented by Paul. More widely influential is the view of the 19th century German theologian [[F.C. Baur]],&lt;ref&gt;''Paulus, der Apostel Jesu Christi'' (Eng trans.1873-5)&lt;/ref&gt; founder of the Tübingen school, that Paul was utterly opposed to the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], based upon his view that Acts was late and unreliable and who contended that Catholic Christianity was a synthesis of the views of Paul and the [[Judaizers|Judaising]] church in Jerusalem. Since [[Harnack]], the Tübingen position has been generally abandoned,&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' ed. F.L. Cross&lt;/ref&gt; though the view that Paul took over the faith and transformed the Jewish teacher to the [[Son of God]] is still widely canvassed.&lt;ref&gt;cf James Tabor ''The Jesus Dynasty'' (Simon &amp; Schuster 2006): Tabor contends that Paul led the church in its decisive break with the Ebionites, whose teaching contained the authentic teachings of Jesus.&lt;/ref&gt; It depends on a comparison between the books of the New Testament which cannot be made here, but see [[Paul of Tarsus]], and the claims of   [[Ultradispensationalism|Ultradispensationalists]] such as [[Ethelbert William Bullinger|E. W. Bullinger]] who view the distinction abhorred by the Ebionites as positive and essential doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://levendwater.org/companion/append192.html The Pauline Epistles. - Appendix to the Companion Bible&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side, the idea that Paul invented Christianity is disputed by numerous Christian writers.&lt;ref&gt;David Wenham, &quot;Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Michael White, &quot;From Jesus to Christianity&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. F. Bruce, &quot;Paul &amp; Jesus&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/paul_invented_christianity.html Did Paul Invent Christianity?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Machen, J. Gresham. &quot;The Origin of Paul's Religion&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Rowlands contends that, &quot;the extent of his influence on Christian thought has been overestimated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands Christopher, ''Christian Origins ''(SPCK 1985) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, though  thirteen letters under his name appear in the New Testament, the great controversies of the 3rd and 4th centuries were about the [[Person of Christ]] and the nature of God - the so-called [[Christological]] and [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] debates -in which St. Paul does not greatly feature; likewise, the [[Nicene Creed]] contains no doctrine of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Moreover, while the influence of the Church of Rome was very important in the credal debates, Greek theologians such as [[Athanasius]], the [[Cappadocian Fathers]], [[Basil the Great]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]] were formidable figures. The resolution of these controversies at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] was not dictated by the Bishop of Rome or Latin [[Christendom]], but was made more difficult by the necessary task of translating technical terms between the two languages of Greek and Latin, and not by arguments over Pauline theology.

As for the New Testament itself, there are evident tensions between the Judaizing party and Paul's views, which are made plain by a comparison between Acts and Paul's letters. How far Paul is to be taken as [[anti-Jewish]] (pro-[[Hellenization]] or [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]]) is a matter of disagreement, but there has been widespread acknowledgement of the view of [[W. D. Davies]] that the essential Jewishness of Paul's Christian perspective has been underplayed.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[New Perspective on Paul]] and [[Ed. Sanders]] ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism''&lt;/ref&gt; In Davies' view, Paul replaced the [[Torah]], the Jewish Law or Mosaic Law, with Christ.&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Supersessionism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, &quot;the problems with which he wrestles in his letters were probably typical of many which were facing the Christian sect during this period&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[Rowlands, Christopher, ibid. p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, by contrast one of the common features of [[Protestant]] churches, certainly in English-speaking countries and those influenced by the reformers [[Martin Luther]]  and [[John Calvin]], is their use of formulations other than the ancient Creeds, such as the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], in which Pauline formulations play a much greater part. Ideas such as [[justification by faith]], which, though not absent from Catholic formulations, play a much more central role in Protestant thinking, where they are considered fundamental Christian truths and essential for defining the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;but see also [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the conclusion that Paul distorted rather than developed the faith, this depends upon a judgment as to wherein lies the right path. Henry Chadwick, former Oxford don, commented about a later controversy: &quot;It was not that the heretics departed from the road; it was that they took a path along which the road was not subsequently built.&quot; [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]], conservative [[Protestantism|Protestants]], and most [[Messianic Jew]]s contend that Paul's writings were a legitimate interpretation of the Gospel. Those who disagree with them either argue that Paul distorted the original and true faith or claim that Christianity is, largely, his invention. The former include such secular commentators &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizanda.com/modules/article/view.article.php/article=52 Articles - People who have understood Paul is Anti-Christ - Oneness - True Faith&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[The Antichrist (book)#Paul and eternal life|whose criticisms]] are based upon their moral objections to Paul's thought; others thinkers, such as [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Alain Badiou]], also agree with this interpretation, but hold much more positive opinions about Paul's theological influence.
