:

A '''metrical psalter''' is a kind of [[Bible translations|Bible translation]]: a book containing a [[Meter (music)|metrical]] translation of all or part of the [[Book of Psalms]] in [[vernacular]] [[poetry]], meant to be sung as [[hymn]]s in a [[church (building)|church]]. Some metrical psalters include melodies or even harmonizations. The composition of metrical psalters was a large enterprise of the [[Protestant Reformation]], especially in its [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] manifestation.

[[Image:Old100.png|thumb|400px|The [[Old 100th]] psalm tune, a famous hymn from the metrical psalters]]

== Biblical basis ==

During the Protestant Reformation, a number of [[Bible]] texts were interpreted as requiring reforms in the [[music]] used in [[worship]].  The Psalms were particularly commended for singing; {{bibleverse||James|5:13|NIV}} asks, &quot;Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise.&quot;  {{bibleverse||Colossians|3:16|NIV}} states &quot;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.&quot;

In the preface to his edition of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[New Testament]], [[Erasmus]] wrote:

:I would have the weakest woman read the [[Gospel]]s and the [[Epistle]]s of St [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. I would have those words translated into all languages, so that not only [[Scotland|Scot]]s and [[Ireland|Irishmen]], but [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Saracen]]s might read them. I long for the ploughboy to sing them to himself as he follows the plow, the weaver to hum them to the tune of his shuttle, the traveler to beguile with them the dullness of his journey.

The Reformers, taking their cue from these Scriptures and from Erasmus, shared a common interest in Scripture that would be singable.  

Various Reformers interpreted these texts as imposing strictures on [[sacred music]].  The psalms, especially, were felt to be commended to be sung by these texts.  A revival of [[Gregorian chant]], or its adaptation to the vernacular, was apparently not considered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  Instead, the need was felt to have metrical vernacular versions of the Psalms and other Scripture texts, suitable to sing to metrical tunes and even popular song forms.

Following the [[regulative principle of worship]], many [[Reformed]] churches adopted the doctrine of [[exclusive psalmody]]: every hymn sung in worship must be an actual translation of a Psalm or some other Biblical passage.  Some Reformed churches, especially the Calvinists, rejected the use of instrumental music and [[organ (music)|organs]] in church, preferring to sing all of the music ''[[a cappella]]''.  Even today, the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America]], the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]], and other Reformed churches of the Scottish tradition maintain this practice.

== The psalters themselves ==

During the pre-reformation days, it was not customary for [[layman|lay]] members of a church's congregation to communally sing hymns.  Singing was done by the [[priest]]s and other [[clergy]]; communal singing of Gregorian chant was the function of professional choirs, or among communities of [[monasticism|monks]] and [[nun]]s.  [[John Calvin]], inspired by Erasmus's comments, desired singable versions of the Psalms and other Christian texts for the communal use of the [[Reformed church]]es.

===The French metrical psalter===

One of the greatest metrical psalters produced during the Reformation, the [[Genevan Psalter]], was authored for the Protestant churches of [[France]] and [[Geneva]] (called the [[Huguenot]]s). It has been in uninterrupted use to the present day by the Huguenot and other French-speaking Protestant churches.

The texts of the French Psalter were brought together from two independent sources: the poet [[Clément Marot]] and the theologian [[Theodore Beza|Théodore de Bèze]]. Marot and Beza's psalms appeared in a number of different collections, published between 1533 and 1543; in the latter year Marot published ''[[Cinquante Pseaumes]]'', a collection of 50 psalms rendered into French verse. The full psalter containing all 150 canonical Psalms, plus the gospel canticle &quot;[[Nunc Dimittis|Cantique de Siméon]]&quot; (&quot;Song of Simeon&quot;), appeared in 1562. 

The French psalms were set to [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] and popular, secular, sometimes unpublished melodies that were harmonized and altered for congregational singing. Music for the [[Genevan psalter]] was furnished by [[Loys Bourgeois]] and others like Guillaume Franc and a certain Maistre Pierre. The composer [[Claude Goudimel]] [[harmony|harmonized]] these melodies with great variation in the complexity of the music. In some cases each part matches note for note, while others are [[contrapuntal]] or even [[motet]]s. Even more elaborate musical arrangements were composed in the seventeenth-century by [[Paschal de l'Estocart]] and [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]].

An example of the Huguenot Psalter is Psalm 24 from the French Psalter:

:La terre au Seigneur appartient
:Tout ce qu'en sa rondeur contient
:Et ceux qui habitent en elle;
:Sur mer fondements lui donna,
:L'enrichit et l'environna
:De mainte rivière très belle.

===The Dutch metrical psalter===

A metrical psalter was also produced for the Calvinist [[Reformed Church]] of the [[Netherlands]] by [[Petrus Datheen]] in 1566.  This Psalter borrowed the [[hymn tune]]s from the Genevan Psalter and consisted of a literal translation of Marot and Beza's French translation. The Dutch psalter was revised on orders of the Dutch legislature in 1773, in a revision which also added non-paraphrase hymns to the collection. This psalter also continues in use among the Reformed community of the Netherlands, and was recently revised in 1985. In 1968 a new metrical psalmbook appeared, which is incorporated in the Dutch hymnbook; ''Liedboek voor de kerken'' of 1973.

===Metrical psalters in German===
The Genevan Psalms were translated into German by [[Ambrosius Lobwasser]] (1515–1585) in 1573 &quot;Psalter des königlichen Propheten Davids&quot; and were sung a capella to Goudimel's harmonies for over two centuries. The Lowasser- psalms are still in use in the [[Amish]] congregations in North America, who took them with the Swiss Hymnbooks to the New World. The music edition of 1576 was reprinted in 2004, which was a result of the International Psalm Symposion in [[Emden]]. In 1798 the German pastor in Den Haag [[Matthias Jorissen]] gave out his: &quot;Neue Bereimung der Psalmen&quot; which replaced the old-fashioned psalm book for nearly 200 years. The present Hymnbook (1996)  of the Evangelical-reformed Churches and the Old Reformed Churches of Germany contains the complete psalter with many psalms of Matthias Jorissen and other authors.  It was an important decision of the synods to retain the psalms in the hymnbook with the Genevan tunes. The need and interest in the complete Jorissen- Psalter led to different new editions in 1931, 1951 and 2006.  The last one was given out for singing of the people and not for scientific use only.  Today, psalms make up a quarter (102) of the Protestant hymn book from 1998 in German Switzerland.

==Metrical psalters in English==
===Robert Crowley===

[[Image:CrowleyMusic.jpg|thumb|Music in Crowley's ''The Psalter of Dauid'' (1549)]]The first complete English metrical psalter and the first to include musical notation was ''The Psalter of Dauid newely translated into Englysh metre in such sort that it maye the more decently, and wyth more delyte of the mynde, be reade and songe of al men''. Printed in 1549, it was the work of [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]] and was printed by him, [[Richard Grafton]] and/or [[Stephen Mierdman]]. Crowley's psalter is a rare example of two-color printing (red and black on the first four leaves) in this era, which makes it visually resemble medieval manuscript psalters. ([[Christopher Tye]] and [[Francis Seager]] later included musical notation in their psalters, and the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter eventually incorporated a basic tune with the Anglo-Genevan edition of 1556. [[John Day (printer)|John Day]]'s ''The Whole Book of Psalmes'' (1562) contained sixty-five psalm tunes.) Crowley also included a calendar for calculating feast days as in the [[Book of Common Prayer]], to which Crowley's psalter appears to be intended as a supplement.

The music provided in Crowley's psalter is similar to the Gregorian tones of the Latin [[Sarum Rite]] psalter, and it can be found in ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians''. A single note is given for each syllable in each verse, in keeping with Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s mandate for the reformed Edwardian [[liturgy]]. The goal was to emphasize simplicity and to encourage attentiveness to what was being sung by omitting complex vocal ornamentation. In addition to the Psalms, Crowley's psalter includes English versions of the [[canticles]] [[Te Deum]], [[Sanctus Benedictus|Benedictus]], [[Magnificat]], [[Nunc Dimittis]], [[Quicumque Vult]], and [[Benedicite]]. These are the ''Cantica Prophetarium'' retained in the Book of Common Prayer from the Sarum psalter — key parts of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]].

Crowley's lyrics are mainly based on [[Leo Jud]]'s ''Biblia Sacrosancta'', which was in turn a fresh translation from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] that maintained fidelity to its lyrical arrangement. Crowley rendered all the psalms in simple [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] [[fourteener (poetry)|fourteener]]s which conform to the single, short, four-part tune that is printed at the beginning of the psalter.

From Crowley's rendition of Psalm 24:

:The earth and al that it holdeth, do to the lorde belonge:
:The world and al that dwel therin as wel the olde as yonge.
:For it is he that aboue al the seas hath it founded:
:And that aboue the freshe waters hathe the same prepared.

For the sake of comparison, here is how the same text is rendered in contemporary English Bibles:

:The earth is the Lord's, and all that therein is: the compass of the world, and they that dwell therein.
:For he hath founded it upon the seas and prepared it upon the floods. (Psalm 24:1-2 [[Great Bible|Coverdale]], 1535)

:The earth is Gods and all that therin is: the worlde, and they that dwell therin.
:For he hath laide the foundation of it vpon the seas: and he hath set it sure vpon the fluddes. (Psalm 24:1-2 [[Bishop's Bible]], 1568)

:The earth is the Lordes, and all that therein is: the worlde and they that dwell therein.
:For he hath founded it vpon the seas: and established it vpon the floods. (Psalm 24:1-2 [[Geneva Bible]], 1587)

:The earth ''is'' the L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;'s, and the fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein.
:For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.  (Psalm 24:1-2 [[King James Version of the Bible|Authorised]], 1611)

===Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter===

[[Thomas Sternhold]] published his first, short collection of nineteen ''Certayn Psalmes'' between mid-1547 and early 1549. In December of 1549, his posthumous ''Al such psalmes of Dauid as Thomas Sternehold ... didde in his life time draw into English Metre'' was printed, containing thirty-seven psalms by Sternhold and, in a separate section at the end, seven psalms by [[John Hopkins (psalmist)|John Hopkins]]. This collection was taken to the Continent with Protestant exiles during the reign of Mary Tudor, and editors in Geneva both revised the original texts and gradually added more over several editions. In 1562, the publisher John Day brought together most of the psalm versions from the Genevan editions and many new psalms by John Hopkins, [[Thomas Norton]], and John Markant to make up ''The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Collected into English Meter'' . In addition to metrical versions of all 150 psalms, the volume included versified versions of the [[Apostles' Creed]], the ''[[Magnificat]]'', and other biblical passages or Christian texts, as well as several non-scriptural versified prayers and a long section of prose prayers largely drawn from the ''English Forme of Prayers'' used in Geneva. 

Sternhold and Hopkins wrote almost all of their Psalms in the &quot;common&quot; or [[ballad]] [[metre in poetry|metre]].  Their versions were quite widely circulated at the time; copies of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter were bound with many editions of the [[Geneva Bible]], and their Psalms were used in many churches.  The Sternhold and Hopkins psalter was also published with music, much of it borrowed from the French Geneva Psalter. One tune from their version that has survived is the tune called [[Old 100th]], often used as a [[doxology]], and associated with words by [[William Kethe]]:

:All people that on earth do dwell,
:sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:
:Him serve with fear, his praise forth tell,
:come ye before him and rejoice.

In 1621, [[Thomas Ravenscroft]] published an expanded edition of the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter; Ravenscroft's edition added many more psalm tunes, some of which were composed since the first publication by leading late Tudor and early Stuart English composers such as [[Thomas Morley]], [[Thomas Tallis]], [[John Dowland]], and [[Thomas Tomkins]]. Another musical contributor to this volume was [[John Milton (composer)|John Milton]], senior, the father of the poet. 

By any objective measure of circulation, Sternhold and Hopkins's psalter were a success.  As a separate volume, they were re-printed more than 200 times between 1550 and 1640; in addition, they were included in most editions of the [[Geneva Bible]], and also most versions of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.  They continued to be in regular use in some congregations until the late eighteenth century.  

Literary opinion after the sixteenth century, on the other hand, was decidedly negative.  In his 1781 ''History of English Poetry'', British [[poet laureate]] [[Thomas Warton]] called the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter &quot;obsolete and contemptible,&quot; &quot;an absolute travesty,&quot; and &quot;entirely destitute of elegance, spirit, and propriety.&quot;  In 1819, [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]] condemned their &quot;worst taste&quot; and &quot;flat and homely phrasing.&quot; Sternhold and Hopkins render the beginning of the 24th Psalm this way:

:The earth is all the Lord's, with all
::her store and furniture;
:Yea, his is all the work, and all
::that therein doth endure:

:For he hath fastly founded it
::above the seas to stand,
:And placed below the liquid floods,
::to flow beneath the land.

===Other versified psalms in English===

During the period of the English Reformation, many other poets besides Sternhold and Hopkins wrote metrical versions of some of the psalms.  The first was Sir [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]], who in around 1540 made verse versions of the six penitential Psalms.  His version of Psalm 130, the famous ''De profundis clamavi'', begins:

:From depth of sin and from a deep despair,
:From depth of death, from depth of heart's sorrow
:From this deep cave, of darkness deep repair,

:To thee have I called, O Lord, to be my borrow.
:Thou in my voice, O Lord, perceive and hear
:My heart, my hope, my plaint, my overthrow. . . .

Sir [[Philip Sidney]] made verse versions of the first 43 psalms. After he died in 1586, his sister, Mary Sidney Herbert, the Countess of Pembroke, completed the translation of the final two-thirds of the psalter. Together they used a dazzling array of stanza forms and rhyme schemes--as many as 145 different forms for the 150 psalms. The Sidney Psalter was not published in its complete form until the twentieth century, but it was widely read in manuscript, and influenced such later poets as John Donne and George Herbert.

===Later English metrical psalters===

Later writers attempted to repair the literary inadequacies of the Sternhold and Hopkins version.  The ''[[Bay Psalm Book]]'' (1640), the first book published in the British colonies in America, was a new metrical psalter. In 1650, the [[Church of Scotland]] produced a [[Scots Metrical Psalter]]; this showed some improvements, but ballad metre remained ubiquitous:

:The earth belongs unto the Lord,
::and all that it contains;
:The world that is inhabited,
::and all that there remains.

:For the foundations thereof
::he on the seas did lay,
:And he hath it established
::upon the floods to stay.

[[Nicholas Brady (poet)|Nicholas Brady]] and [[Nahum Tate]] (who was later named [[poet laureate]]) produced ''[[Tate and Brady|A New Version of the Psalms of David]]'' in 1696; their Augustan version shows somewhat more polish than the 17th century versions:

:This spacious earth is all the Lord's,
::the Lord's her fullness is.
:The world, and they that dwell therein,
::by sov'reign right are his.

:He framed and fixed it on the seas,
::and his Almighty hand
:Upon inconstant floods has made
::the stable fabric stand.

as did [[Isaac Watts]], who at long last breaks out of the ballad metre in his 1719 version, though he takes considerable liberties with the Biblical originals:

:This spacious earth is all the Lord’s,
:And men, and worms, and beasts, and birds:
:He raised the building on the seas,
:And gave it for their dwelling-place.

But by the time better metrical psalms were made in English, the belief that every hymn sung in church had to be a Biblical translation had been repudiated by the [[Church of England]].  A flowering of English hymnody had occurred under writers such as Isaac Watts and [[Charles Wesley]], but their hymns were freed from the stricture that each verse had to be a translation of a scriptural text.  Attitudes towards the Biblical text itself had also changed, with closer emphasis being paid on its exact phrasing.  This new regard for the letter of the Biblical text diminished the appeal of the psalters' previous versions; those who sang them no longer felt they were singing Scripture.  The success of these newer hymns has largely displaced the belief that each hymn must be a direct translation of Scripture.  Now, many hymnals contain Biblical references to the passages that inspired the authors, but few are direct translations of Scripture like the metrical psalters were.

== Metrical psalter in Gaelic ==

The [[Scottish Gaelic]] Psalter was produced by the Synod of Argyll. By 1658, the first fifty psalms had been translated into ballad metre due to the work of Dugald Campbell, John Stewart and Alexander McLaine. A manuscript of the final 100 psalms was produced in 1691 with the entire Gaelic psalter, with revisions to the 'first fifty' being produced in 1694. The Gaelic Metrical Psalms are used to this day in the Scottish Highland Presbyterian Churches where the practice of [[lining out]] is used,in accordance with the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]] Directory for Public Worship. The corpus of tunes has shrunk over the years with only about twenty-four in general use.

==Modern-day metrical psalters==

Many churches continue to use metrical psalters today.  For example, the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America]] (RPCNA) produced psalm books based on the [[Scots Metrical Psalter]], with the intention of making the words more modern and the translation more accurate.  These were produced in 1889 (a [[Split-leaf psalter|split-leaf]] brown book), 1911 (unpopular due to musical complexity), 1920 (a green book) and 1929 (also green, an expanded version of the 1920 one), 1950 (a blue book), and 1973 (a maroon one) called [http://www.crownandcovenant.com/The_Book_of_Psalms_for_Singing_s/35.htm The Book of Psalms for Singing].  A further revision has been undertaken by the [[RPCNA]], again for the purposes of making the words more modern, and also to replace some of the more difficult-to-sing tunes, such as Psalm 62B, with tunes that are easier to sing. The new edition, [http://www.crownandcovenant.com/The_Book_of_Psalms_for_Worship_s/117.htm The Book of Psalms for Worship], was released in 2009.

The [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland]], however, produced a split leaf version of the [[Scots Metrical Psalter]], but with additional &quot;Alternative versions&quot; of the words included as the second half of the book.  These were culled from a number of sources, including the RPCNA books mentioned above.  Whenever a new version was necessary, they merely expanded their old book, without removing any of the old translations.  One of these editions was produced in 1979. They were available in staff or sol-fa. A revised Psalter in more modern idiom was published in 2004 under the title '''The Psalms for Singing'''.

The Melbourne Congregation of the [[Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia]] produced '''The Complete Book of Psalms for Singing with Study Notes''' in 1991. Music in staff format is provided in a variety of meters to mostly established tunes. The texts draw from the best of older versions but providing much new material with an emphasis on accuracy.

The [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] published '''Sing Psalms''' in 2003, being a completely new translation.It is available in words only, and Staff and Sol-fa split leaf formats.
