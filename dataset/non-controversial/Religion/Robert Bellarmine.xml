[[Saint]] '''Robert Bellarmine, [[S.J.]]''' ({{lang-it|Roberto Francesco Romolo Bellarmino}};  4 October 1542 – 17 September 1621) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Jesuit]] and a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. He was one of the most important figures in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. He was [[canonization|canonized]] in 1930 and named a [[Doctor of the Church]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Bellarmine was born at [[Montepulciano]], the son of noble, albeit impoverished, parents, Vincenzo Bellarmino and his wife Cinzia Cervini, who was the sister of [[Pope Marcellus II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFSmith2009|Smith]], ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02411d.htm 2009]).&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy he knew [[Virgil]] by heart and composed a number of poems in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Latin]]. One of his hymns, on [[Mary Magdalene]], is included in the [[Breviary]]. He entered the Roman novitiate in 1560, remaining in Rome three years. He then went to a Jesuit house at [[Mondovì]], in [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], where he learned [[Greek language|Greek]]. While at Mondovì, he came to the attention of [[Francis Adorno|Francesco Adorno]], the local Jesuit [[Provincial Superior]], who sent him to the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rule|first1=William Harris|title=Celebrated Jesuits|volume=2|year=1853|publisher=John Mason|location=London|page=20|chapter=A Jesuit cardinal: Robert Bellarmine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellarmine's systematic study of [[theology]] began at Padua in 1567 and 1568, where his teachers were adherents of [[Thomism]]. In 1569 he was sent to finish it at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] in [[Flanders]]. There he was ordained, and obtained a reputation both as a professor and a preacher. He was the first Jesuit to teach at the university, where the subject of his course was the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of  [[Thomas Aquinas]]. His residence in Leuven lasted seven years. In poor health, in 1576 he made a journey to Italy. Here he remained, commissioned by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] to lecture on [[polemical theology]] in the new [[Roman College]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

{{Jesuit}}

===New duties after 1589===
Until 1589, Bellarmine was occupied as professor of theology. After the murder in that year of [[Henry III of France]], [[Pope Sixtus V]] sent [[Enrico Caetani]] as legate to Paris&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1585-ii.htm#Caetani&lt;/ref&gt; to negotiate with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League of France]], and chose Bellarmine to accompany him as theologian.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1599#Bellarmino&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the city during its siege by [[Henry of Navarre]].

The next pope, [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]], set great store by him. He was made rector of the Roman College in 1592, examiner of [[bishop]]s in 1598, and cardinal in 1599. Immediately after his appointment as Cardinal, Pope Clement made him a [[Inquisition|Cardinal Inquisitor]], in which capacity he served as one of the judges at the trial of [[Giordano Bruno]], and concurred in the decision which condemned Bruno to be [[burned at the stake]] as a heretic. &lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;47&amp;ndash;48)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1602 he was made [[archbishop of Capua]]. He had written against pluralism and non-residence of bishops within their [[diocese]]s. As bishop he put into effect the reforming decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]. He received some votes in the 1605 [[papal election|conclaves]] which elected [[Pope Leo XI]], [[Pope Paul V]], and in 1621 when [[Pope Gregory XV]] was elected, but only in the second conclave of 1605 was he ''[[papabile]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===The Galileo case===
In 1616, on the orders of Paul V, Bellarmine summoned [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], notified him of a forthcoming [[decree]] of the [[Congregation of the Index]] condemning the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] doctrine of the mobility of the Earth and the immobility of the Sun, and ordered him to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, p. 126)]]. &lt;cite id=disputedinjunction&gt;The Vatican archives contain an unsigned copy of a more strongly worded formal injunction purporting to have been served on Galileo shortly after Bellarmine's admonition, ordering him &quot;not to hold, teach, or defend&quot; the condemned doctrine &quot;in any way whatever, either orally or in writing&quot;, and threatening him with imprisonment if he refused to obey.&lt;/cite&gt;  However, whether this injunction was ever properly served on Galileo is a subject of much scholarly disagreement.[[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(Blackwell, 1991, p. 127&amp;ndash;128)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo agreed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|Fantoli (2005, p.119)]]. Some scholars have suggested that Galileo's agreement was only obtained after some initial resistance. Otherwise, the formal injunction purporting to have been served on him during his meeting with Bellarmine [[#disputedinjunction|(see earlier footnote)]] would have been contrary to the Pope's instructions [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|(Fantoli. 2005, pp.121, 124)]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Galileo later complained of rumors to the effect that he had been forced to abjure and do penance, Bellarmine wrote out a certificate denying the rumors, stating that Galileo had merely been notified of the decree and informed that, as a consequence of it, the Copernican doctrine could not be &quot;defended or held&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, p.127)]].  Unlike the previously mentioned formal injunction [[#disputedinjunction|(see earlier footnote)]], this milder restriction would have allowed Galileo to continue using and teaching the mathematical content of Copernicus's theory as a purely theoretical device for predicting the apparent motions of the planets. Maurice Finocchiaro's English translations of the purported [http://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#specinj formal injunction], the [http://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#indexdecree decree] of the Congregation of the Index and Cardinal Bellarmine's [http://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#certificate certificate] are available on-line.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Bellarmine was himself ambiguous about heliocentrism, personally noting that further research had to be done to confirm or condemn it.{{Citation needed|reason=Bellarmine's lengthy letter to Fr. Foscarini, advising him that Copernicanism/heliocentrism is contrary to Scripture, heresy, and render the Holy Scriptures false.|date=August 2011}} (In 1633, Galileo would again be called before the Inquisition in this matter.)

===Last years===
In his old age he was [[bishop of Montepulciano]] for four years, after which he retired to the Jesuit college of St. Andrew in Rome, where he died on 17 September 1621, aged 78.

==Works==
Bellarmine's books bear the stamp of their period; the effort for literary elegance (so-called ''&quot;maraviglia&quot;'') had given place to a desire to pile up as much material as possible, to embrace the whole field of human knowledge, and incorporate it into theology. His controversial works provoked many replies, and were studied for some decades after his death.&lt;ref&gt;''On Laymen or Secular People''; ''On the Temporal Power of the Pope. Against William Barclay''; and ''On the Primary Duty of the Supreme Pontiff'', are included in Bellarmine, ''On Temporal and Spiritual Authority'', Stefania Tutino, trans., Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; At Leuven he made extensive studies in the [[Church Fathers]] and [[scholastic theologian]]s, which gave him the material for his book ''De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis'' (Rome, 1613). It was later revised and enlarged by [[Sirmond]], [[Labbeus]], and [[Casimir Oudin]]. Bellarmine wrote the preface to the new [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Dogmatics===
{{main|Disputationes}}
From his research grew his ''Disputationes de controversiis christianae fidei'' (also called ''[[Disputationes]]''), first published at [[Ingolstadt]] in 1581&amp;ndash;1593. This major work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various religious controversies of the time. Bellarmine devoted eleven years to it while at the Roman College. The first volume of the ''Disputationes'' treats of the [[Word of God (Bible)|Word of God]], of [[Christ]], and of the [[Pope]]; the second of the authority of [[ecumenical council]]s, and of the Church, whether militant, expectant, or triumphant; the third of the [[sacrament]]s; and the fourth of [[Divine grace]], [[free will]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and [[good works]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Venetian Interdict===
{{main|Venetian Interdict}}
Under [[Pope Paul V]] (reigned 1605&amp;ndash;1621), a major conflict arose between [[Venice]] and the [[Papacy]]. [[Paolo Sarpi]], as spokesman for the Republic of Venice, protested against the papal [[interdict]], and reasserted the principles of the [[Council of Constance]] and of the [[Council of Basel]], denying the pope's authority in secular matters. Bellarmine wrote three rejoinders to the Venetian theologians, and may have warned Sarpi of an impending murderous attack. &lt;!-- attack by whom??; please clarify --&gt; {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Allegiance oath controversy and papal authority===
{{details|Oath of Allegiance of James I of England}}
Bellarmine also became involved in controversy with King [[James I of England]]. From a point of principle for English Catholics, this debate drew in figures from much of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Patterson, ''James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (1997), pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt; It raised the profile of both protagonists, King James as a champion of his own restricted Calvinist Protestantism, and Bellarmine for [[Counter-Reformation|Tridentine Catholicism]].

===Devotional works===
During his retirement, he wrote several short books intended to help ordinary people in their spiritual life: ''De ascensione mentis in Deum per scalas rerum creatorum opusculum'' (''The Mind's Ascent to God'') (1614) which was translated into English as ''Jacob's Ladder'' (1638) without acknowledgement by [[Henry Isaacson (theologian)|Henry Isaacson]],&lt;ref&gt;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A08025.0001.001?view=toc&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art of Dying Well'' (1619) (in Latin, English translation under this title by [[Edward Coffin]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Edward Coffin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Seven Words on the Cross''.

==Canonization and final resting place==
Bellarmine was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1930; the following year he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]]. His remains, in a cardinal's red robes, are displayed behind glass under a side altar in the [[Sant'Ignazio|Church of Saint Ignatius]], the chapel of the Roman College, next to the body of his student, [[St. Aloysius Gonzaga]], as he himself had wished. In the [[Roman Catholic calendar of saints]] Saint Robert Bellarmine's [[feast day]] is on 17 September, the day of his death; but some continue to use pre-1969 calendars, in which for 37 years his feast day was on 13 May. The rank attributed to his feast has been &quot;double&quot; (1932&amp;ndash;1959) and its equivalent &quot;third-class feast&quot; (1960&amp;ndash;1968); in 1969 it was downgraded to an &quot;optional memorial&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Legacy==
[[Bellarmine University]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] is named after him, as are [[Bellarmine College Preparatory]] in [[San Jose, California]] and [[Bellarmine Preparatory School]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]].
