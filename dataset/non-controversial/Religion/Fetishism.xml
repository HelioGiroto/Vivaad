[[File:Fetish Image (relates to David Livingstone) by The London Missionary Society cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|Depiction of a fetish in South Africa by the [[London Missionary Society]], circa 1900.]]
A '''fetish''' (derived from the [[French language|French]] ''fétiche''; which comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''feitiço''; and this in turn from [[Latin]] ''facticius'', &quot;artificial&quot; and ''facere'', &quot;to make&quot;) is an object believed to have [[supernatural]] powers, or in particular, a man-made object that has power over others. Essentially, fetishism is the [[emic]] attribution of inherent value or powers to an object.

==History==
Initially, the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] developed the concept of fetishism to refer to the objects used in religious cults by West African natives.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The concept was popularized in Europe circa 1757, when [[Charles de Brosses]] used it in comparing [[West Africa]]n religion to the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al aspects of [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Later, [[Auguste Comte]] employed the concept in his theory of the [[evolution theory|evolution]] of [[religion]], wherein he posited fetishism as the earliest (most primitive) stage, followed by [[polytheism]] and [[monotheism]].

That said, [[ethnography]] and [[anthropology]] would nonetheless classify some artifacts of monotheistic religions as fetishes. For example, the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]] and the [[Sacramental bread|consecrated host]] or tokens of communion found in some forms of [[Christianity]] (a monotheistic religion), are here regarded as examples of fetishism.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Tylor and McLennan, historians of religion, held that the concept of fetishism fostered a shift of attention away from the relationship between people and [[God]], to focus instead on a relationship between people and material objects, and that this, in turn, allowed for the establishment of false models of [[causality]] for natural events. This they saw as a central problem historically and sociologically.

In 1927, Sigmund Freud published his essay on &quot;Fetishism,&quot; in which he writes that the meaning and purpose of the fetish turns out, through analysis, to always be the same: &quot;the fetish is a substitute for the penis...for a particular and quite special penis that had been extremely important in early childhood but had later been lost.&quot; In refusing to see his mother's lack of penis, the boy disavows (German: Verleugnung, not repression: Verdrängung) what he sees, resulting in both a belief and a non-belief in the woman's phallus. This compromise (produced by the conflict between perception and the counter-wish) results in a substitute (the fetish). &quot;It remains a token of triumph over the threat of castration and a protection against it.&quot;

Theoretically, fetishism is present in all religions,{{fact|date=July 2012}} but the use of the concept in the study of religion derives from studies of traditional [[West Africa]]n religious beliefs, as well as from [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]], which in turn derives from those beliefs.

[[Blood ritual|Blood]] is often included{{whom|date=July 2012}} as a particularly powerful fetish or ingredient in fetishes. In addition to blood, other objects and substances, such as [[bone]]s, [[fur]], [[claws]], [[feather]]s, [[gemstone]]s and crystals, [[water]] from certain places, certain types of [[plants]] and [[wood]] are common fetishes in the traditions of cultures worldwide.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

Fetishes were commonly used in [[Native American religion]] and practices.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;&quot;Animals: fact and folklore,&quot; ''[[New Mexico Magazine]]'', August 2008, pp. 56-63, see [http://www.nmmagazine.com/ New Mexico magazine website].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[bear]] represented the [[shaman]], the [[American Bison|buffalo]] was the provider, the [[mountain lion]] was the warrior, and the [[wolf]] was the [[pathfinder]].&lt;ref name=NM /&gt;

==Secular fetishism==
The 19th century saw the introduction of two theories of fetishism outside what was typically considered religion. The first was [[Karl Marx]]'s idea of [[commodity fetishism]], in which objects are imagined to dictate the social activities that produce them. The second was [[Alfred Binet]]'s term [[sexual fetishism]], the sexual attachment to an object in place of a person. Scholars have continued to develop these theories ever since, and they have influenced anthropologists' understanding of fetishism in general.
