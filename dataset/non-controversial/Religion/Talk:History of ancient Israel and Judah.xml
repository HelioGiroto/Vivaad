== Reference to two steles deleted ==

Pico: A line read
&quot;except for the [[Mesha Stele]] and the [[Tel Dan Stele]]&quot; can't show that David, etc. existed. Why did you delete those articles? It seems to me that they tend to refute the idea that the &quot;House of David&quot; never existed. Perhaps not indisputably and forever, but still...[[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 00:12, 7 January 2012 (UTC)
:The two steles can't prove that David existed, just that the royal dynasty in about 850 had this name. The sections &quot;Iron Age II&quot; and &quot;Babylonian Period&quot; do assume that the royal house of Judah did call itself the House of David - I count three mentions. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 10:37, 29 January 2012 (UTC)

::Let's say that 3,000 years from now, a book claims that, under the kingship of Millard Fillmore, the country built skyscrapers and ships to the moon. Later, someone digs up something, several somethings in fact, that indicates that someone named Millard Fillmore actually did run the country or area or tribe, as the case may be. Granted, this proves '''nothing''' about skyscrapers and moon ships, but it tends to indicate '''something''' IMO. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 18:22, 2 February 2012 (UTC)

:::Never really did finish this. It's okay to not believe the bible. It's okay not to believe the steles prove anything. Minimalist and all that. But the steles '''do''' exist. I don't think anyone is calling '''them''' fraudulent. They need to be accounted for and this is one &quot;possible&quot; accounting. It doesn't claim to be absolute proof. [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 13:21, 16 March 2012 (UTC)

::::I don't think the steles, in themselves, are important to our article; what's important is what they can say about ancient Israel. What they say is that a kingdom called Israel existed in the 8th century (they both date from then), and that some entity called the &quot;house of David&quot; existed (royal house of Judah?). The word &quot;david&quot; isn't clearly present in the Mesha stele, by the way - an &quot;altar of David&quot; would be a very strange thing, since altars are always called for the god they're dedicated to, or the type of sacrifice made on them; for this reason it seems more likely that this is a &quot;fire-altar&quot;.

::::[[User:PiCo|PiCo]]
I think we already resolved our dispute, namely what is and what is not important. This is very subjective opinion and we  had arbitration about this issue. Therefore I cant understand why you are keep coming back every year to remove this particular section of the article. I would remind you the current form of article was a CONSENSUS, which was revised by administrator and therefore any further removal will be violation of what was already agreed.[[User:Tritomex|Tritomex]] ([[User talk:Tritomex|talk]]) 20:15, 13 June 2012 (UTC)

== Josephus ==

An editor correctly (IMO) deleted the raw use of Josephus. There has to be a rather lengthy discussion or discussions somewhere about Josephus, specifically. I am sure it is covered by a policy statement as well. I would like to suggest including a statement about the use of &quot;raw&quot; Josephus as a &quot;FAQ&quot; in yellow above, and in any other article discussion pages where the issue pops up. The &quot;FAQ&quot; should be short.

For example: &quot;Q. Why can't I used comments/quotes directly from Josephus? A. Josephus is a [[WP:PRIMARY]] source which has been analyzed by latter academic historians at length. Josephus often fails a [[WP:NPOV]] required by Wikipedia. These analysts have published [[WP:RS]] incorporating the observations by Josephus which can be used in their new context by the modern historian.&quot; [[User:Student7|Student7]] ([[User talk:Student7|talk]]) 00:10, 27 February 2012 (UTC)

== Article's Default Era ==

Currently, within the article, some dates use the christian system, while some use the neutral CE/BCE system. I would suggest going to the BCE/CE system considering it is more neutral, and considering the people to whom this article relates. However, it should be noted that the era first introduced into this article (thus the one that is current considered the default per [[WP:ERA]], unless there was some consensus lost in the archives that I did not see) is the christian system (introduced in the article's initial edit). Can we get a consensus to switch to the CE/BCE system? If not, we need someone to go through and change the dates in the article to conform with each other (I can't do it if remaining with the christian system). Thanks. :) â€” [[User:Imeriki al-Shimoni|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#60d;font-weight:bold;text-shadow:3px 3px 2px #aaa;&quot;&gt;al-Shimoni&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Imeriki al-Shimoni|talk]]) 22:53, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
:I would strongly support the neutral BCE/CE system.  Ancient Israel and Judah is not just of interest to Christian readers, but is also important for Jews and Muslims, so a neutral dating system that does not recognise Jesus and God is useful.[[User:John D. Croft|John D. Croft]] ([[User talk:John D. Croft|talk]]) 12:21, 16 August 2012 (UTC)

== Section &quot;The archaeological record&quot; ==

I think this section is on the wrong track - it's too much a discussion of various archaeological finds - those should be in the various chronological periods, lower down - what's needed here is a discussion of how archaeology is used to understand history, especially a statement that archaeology isn't neutral, but reflects the biases (often unconscious) of the archaeologists - in other words, that archaeology, like the biblical record, is subject to interpretation, and hence to change. But I don't feel like doing it myself - maybe someone else? [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 09:17, 19 September 2012 (UTC)

[[User:PiCo|PiCo]] The current form of this section is the result of long standing consensus and administrative recension, as you know it well. This sections was much longer and as a result of administrator revision it was downsized to its current form. Therefore I do not understand why are you keep coming back every few months, to remove its content. [[User:Tritomex|Tritomex]] ([[User talk:Tritomex|talk]]) 17:21, 26 September 2012 (UTC)</text>
