{{Paganism (contemporary)}}
The '''Wheel of the Year''' is an annual cycle of [[seasonal]] festivals in [[contemporary Paganism]]. It consists primarily of eight festivals based around the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, known as the ''quarter days'', and the midpoints between, known as the ''cross quarter days''.

Within Paganism, many festivals are celebrated. They can vary considerably in name and date amongst specific traditions, however the eight festivals of the Wheel comprise the most adhered and important annual celebrations. They are a unifying feature of modern Paganism. The Wheel has been important to many people, both ancient and modern, and its  festivals are based to varying degrees on [[folk tradition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey_rpe&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|title=The roots of pagan ecology.
|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion
|year=1994
|volume=9
|issue=3
|pages=38-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the context of Witchcraft, the festivals have also commonly been referred to as ''sabbats'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|b|ə|t}} since the [[Middle ages]], when the terminology for [[Jewish]] [[Shabbat]]s was commingled with that of other '[[heretical]]' celebrations. See [[Witches' sabbath]].

==The festivals==
In [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]], [[Everything|all]] [[Existence|things]] are cyclical. The year is no different. It is understood to be a perpetual cycle of growth and retreat tied to the [[Sun]]'s annual  [[Death-rebirth deity|death and rebirth]]. This cycle is also viewed as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|mirco- and macrocosm]] of other life cycles in an immeasurable [[Recursion|series]] of cycles composing the Universe. The days that fall on the landmarks of the yearly cycle traditionally mark the beginnings and middles of the four [[season]]s. They are regarded with significance and host to major communal festivals. These eight festivals are the most common times for community celebrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;zell_ccc_p192&quot;&gt;{{citation

While the major festivals are determined by quarter and cross-quarter days, many minor festivals are also celebrated throughout the year amongst various traditions. Additionally, festivals (major or minor) may not enjoy the same level of significance from one tradition to another.

The festivals, being tied to solar movements, have always been steeped in solar [[mythology]] and [[symbolism]], centred around the life cycles of the [[sun]]. Similarly, the [[esbats]] are traditionally tied to the [[lunar cycle]]s. Together, they represent the most common and important celebrations in modern Paganism, especially in [[Witchcraft (contemporary)|Witchcraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zell_ccc_p192&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=brill-p63/&gt;

===Midwinter===
{{Main|Midwinter}}
Midwinter has been a significant time in the annual cycle since at least the [[neolithic]]. The ancient [[megalith]]ic sites of [[Newgrange]] and [[Stonehenge]], carefully aligned with the Midwinter sunrise and sunset (respectively), exemplify this.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. (Thames &amp; Hudson , 2008) pp. 252–253 &lt;/ref&gt; The reversal of the [[Sun]]'s ebbing presence in the sky was an important turning point weathering the harsh and in infertile time of the year, known for [[famine]].

In most traditions, Midwinter is celebrated as the rebirth of the [[Death-rebirth deity|solar god]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://local.lancasteronline.com/4/213802 |title=Wiccans, pagans ready to celebrate Yule |accessdate=2007-12-21 |author=James Buescher |date=2007-12-15 |publisher=[http://local.lancasteronline.com Lancaster Online]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the Sun newly reborn from the solstice.

The method of gathering for Midwinter vary by group or individual practitioner. Some have private ceremonies at home&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E5DA113FF932A15751C1A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Celebrations; It's Solstice, Hanukkah, Kwannza: Let There Be Light! |accessdate=2007-12-21 |author=Andrea Kannapell |date=1997-12-21 |publisher=[http://www.nytimes.com nytimes.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within [[coven]]s, while others do so publicly with the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E3DD1E3EF930A25751C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Like Magic, Witchcraft Charms Teenagers |accessdate=2007-12-21 |author=Ruth la Ferla |date=2000-12-13 |publisher=[http://www.nytimes.com nytimes.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The celebration of [[Christmas]] on 25 December marks the choice by leaders of the early Catholic Church to adapt [[Sol Invictus|popular pre-Christian festivals]] concerning the [[Winter solstice]] {{cn|date=October 2012}}.

===Imbolc===
{{Main|Imbolc}}
[[Imbolc]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|m|.|b|ɒ|l|k}} {{respell|im|bolk}}), or [[Candlemas]], is one of four &quot;fire festivals&quot; of the Wheel of the Year. Among [[Dianic Wicca]]ns, Imbolc is the traditional time for [[initiation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budapest&quot;&gt;Budapest, Zsuzsanna (1980) ''The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries'' ISBN 0-914728-67-9&lt;/ref&gt; Imbolc is strongly associated with the goddess Brighid. Traditions celebrating this day survive in west as [[Groundhog's Day]].

Among [[Reclaiming (neopaganism)|Reclaiming]]-style Witches, Imbolc is considered a traditional time for rededication and pledges for the coming year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiralDance&quot;&gt;Starhawk (1979, 1989) ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess''. New York, Harper and Row ISBN 0-06-250814-8 pp.&amp;nbsp;186–7,&amp;nbsp;246 (revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vernal Equinox===
{{Main|Vernal equinox}}
The vernal equinox, often called Ostara, is celebrated in the Northern hemisphere around March 21 and in the Southern hemisphere around September 23, depending upon the specific timing of the equinox. Among the Wiccan sabbats, it is preceded by [[Imbolc]] and followed by [[Beltane]].

The name Ostara may be related to the word for &quot;east&quot;. It has been connected to the Anglo-Saxon goddess [[Eostre]] by  [[Jacob Grimm]]  in his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, Jacob (1835). ''Deutsche Mythologie'' (German Mythology); From English released version ''Grimm's Teutonic Mythology'' (1888); Available online by Northvegr © 2004-2007, Chapter 13, page [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/grimmst/013_10.php 10+]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[Wiccan views of divinity|Wiccan ditheism]], this festival is characterized by the rejoining of the [[Mother Goddess]] and her lover-consort-son, who spent the winter months in death.&lt;ref&gt;''Eight Sabbats for Witches'' by [[Janet Farrar|Janet]] and [[Stewart Farrar]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other variations include the young God regaining strength in his youth after being born at [[Yule]], and the Goddess returning to her Maiden aspect.

===Beltane===
{{Main|Beltane}}
Beltane is one of the four &quot;fire festivals&quot; or &quot;greater sabbats&quot;. Although the holiday may use features of the Gaelic Bealtaine, such as the [[bonfire]], it bears more relation to the Germanic [[May Day]] festival, both in its significance (focusing on fertility) and its rituals (such as [[maypole]] dancing). Some Wiccans celebrate 'High Beltaine' by enacting a ritual union of the [[Horned God|May Lord]] and [[Goddess|Lady]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiralDance&quot;&gt;Starhawk (1979, 1989) ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess''. New York, Harper and Row ISBN 0-06-250814-8 pp.181-196 (revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midsummer===
{{Main|Midsummer}}
Midsummer is one of the four solar holidays, and is considered the turning point at which summer reaches its height and the sun shines longest. Among the Wiccan sabbats, Midsummer is preceded by [[Beltane]], and followed by [[Lammas]] or [[Lughnasadh]].

Some traditions call the festival &quot;Litha&quot;, a name occurring in [[Bede]]'s &quot;Reckoning of Time&quot; (''De Temporum Ratione'', 7th century), which preserves a list of the (then-obsolete) Anglo-Saxon names for the twelve months. ''Ærra Liða'' ('first' or 'preceding' ''Liða'') roughly corresponds to June in the [[Gregorian calendar]], and ''Æfterra Liða'' ('following' ''Liða'') to July. Bede writes that &quot;Litha means 'gentle' or 'navigable', because in both these months the calm breezes are gentle and they were wont to sail upon the smooth sea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bede &amp; Wallis, Faith (tr.) (1999) ''Bede, The Reckoning of Time'' Liverpool University Press. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lammas===
{{Main|Lammas}}
Lammas or Lughnasadh ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|n|æ|s|ə}} {{respell|loo|nas-ə}}) is the first of the three pagan autumn [[harvest]] festivals, the other two being the [[Autumn equinox]] (or Mabon) and [[Samhain]]. Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the god in bread and eating it, to symbolize the sanctity and importance of the harvest. Lamas/ Lughnasadh celebrations vary, as not all pagans are Wiccans.  The Celtic name [[Lughnasadh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiralDance&quot;&gt;Starhawk (1979, 1989) ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess''. New York, Harper and Row ISBN 0-06-250814-8 pp.191-2 (revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutton&quot;/&gt; is used in some traditions to designated this holiday. Wiccan celebrations of this holiday are not generally based on Celtic culture nor centered on the Celtic deity [[Lugh]], however.  This name seems to have been a late adoption among Wiccans.  In early versions of Wiccan literature the festival is referred to as &quot;August Eve&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/gbos/gbos10.htm The Gardnerian Book of Shadows online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Lammas'' (contraction of Loaf-mass) implies it is an agrarian-based festival and feast of thanksgiving for grain and bread, which symbolizes the first fruits of the harvest. Pagan / Eclectic Neopagan rituals may incorporate elements from either festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiralDance&quot;/&gt;

===Autumnal Equinox===
{{Main|Autumnal Equinox}}
The holiday of Autumn Equinox, ''Harvest Home'', ''Mabon'', the ''Feast of the Ingathering'', ''Meán Fómhair'' or ''Alban Elfed'' (in [[Neo-Druid]]ic traditions), is a pagan ritual of thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth and a recognition of the need to share them to secure the blessings of the Goddess and the God during the coming winter months. The name ''Mabon'' was coined by [[Aidan Kelly]] around 1970 as a reference to [[Mabon ap Modron]], a character from Welsh mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] &amp; [[Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart]] (2006) ''Creating Circles &amp; Ceremonies: Rituals for All Seasons and Reasons''.  Career Press. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the northern hemisphere this equinox occurs anywhere from September 21 to 24. In the southern hemisphere, the autumn equinox occurs anywhere from March 20–23. Among the sabbats, it is the second of the three pagan harvest festivals, preceded by [[Lammas]] / [[Lughnasadh]] and followed by [[Samhain]].

===Samhain===
{{Main|Samhain}}
Samhain ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|s|ɑː|w|ɪ|n}} {{respell|sow|in}}) is considered by Wiccans to be one of the four &quot;greater Sabbats&quot;. It is generally observed on October 31 in the Northern Hemisphere, starting at sundown.  Samhain is considered by some as a time to celebrate the lives of those who have passed on, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets and other loved ones who have died.  In some rituals the spirits of the departed are invited to attend the festivities.  It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the wheel by the spring festival of [[Beltane]], which is celebrated as a festival of light and fertility.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiralDance&quot;&gt;Starhawk (1979, 1989) ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess''. New York, Harper and Row ISBN 0-06-250814-8 pp.193-6 (revised edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wiccan Samhain doesn't attempt to [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstruct]] a historical Celtic festival{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} . In actuality it was also believed that on October 31, the veil between this world and the afterlife is at its thinnest point of the whole year; however this is not just a Wiccan belief.

===Minor festivals===
In addition to the major eight holidays common to most [[modern pagans]], there are a number of minor holidays set along the along the year to commemorate various events.

[[File:Heathen holidays.png|thumb|The common holidays of Heathenism (black: main names; gray: alternative names; purple: minor common holidays).]]
For example, the minor holidays common in Germanic Paganism:
*'''[[Charming of the Plow]]''' — falls on 2nd February
*'''[[Vali's Blot]]''', celebration dedicated to the god [[Váli]] and to love — falls on 14th February
*'''[[Ancestors' Blot]]''', celebration of one's own ancestry or the common ancestors of a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[ethnicity]] — falls on the 11th of November
*'''[[Yggdrasil Day]]''', celebration of the [[world tree]] [[Yggdrasil]], of the reality world it represents, of [[tree]]s and nature — 22nd April
*'''[[Winterfinding]]''', celebration which marks the beginning of winter, held on a date between Haustblot and Winternights (mid-October)&lt;ref name=&quot;Linzie-holidays&quot;&gt;Bill Linzie. ''[http://www.angelfire.com/nm/seidhman/spirituality.pdf Germanic Spirituality]''. 2003. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Summerfinding]]''', celebration which marks the beginning of summer, held on a date between Ostara and Walpurgisnight (mid-April)&lt;ref name=&quot;Linzie-holidays&quot;/&gt;

==Dates of celebration==
While the Wheel of the Year is based upon predictable, recurring solar events, the precise dates festivals are celebrated are often flexible, varying by tradition and location. Dates may be on the days of the quarter and cross-quarter days proper, the nearest [[full moon]], the nearest [[new moon]], or the nearest weekend for secular convenience.

===Hemispheres===
The Wheel originates from peoples in the [[middle latitudes]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Consequently, the traditional times for celebrations - e.g. [[harvest festival]]s - do not agree with the seasons in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Many Pagans in the South advance these dates six months to coincide with the cycles of the local hemisphere.

The current system is still problematic for Pagans near the [[Equator]] and [[Arctic]].

==Practice==
Celebration commonly takes place outdoors in the form of a communal gathering.

===Sacrifice===

Offerings of food, [[libation|drink]], various objects, the lives of animals, etc have been central in [[ritual]] [[propitiation]] and [[Worship|veneration]] for millennia. The most notorious of these, ritual [[Ritual slaughter|slaughter]] and [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificeing]] of animals has historically been common in any major settings that allowed for it as blood sacrifices were known to be the most potent of all offerings. However, its use has always tenuous. Modern Pagan practice strongly avoids sacrificing animals in favour of grains, herbs, milk, wines, incense, baked goods, minerals, etc. The exception being with ritual feasts including [[ritual slaughter|meat]], where the the inedible parts the animal are often burned as offerings while the community eats the rest.&lt;ref name=&quot;adf_nos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Kirk|title=The Nature of Sacrifice|url=http://www.adf.org/articles/cosmology/nature-of-sacrifice.html|work=Cosmology|publisher=Ár nDraíocht Féin: A Druid Fellowship|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradbury|first=Scott|title=Julian's Pagan Revival and the Decline of Blood Sacrifice|journal=Phoenix|year=1995|volume=49|issue=4 (Winter)|pages=331 - 356|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1088885|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sacrifices are typically offered to gods and [[Ancestor veneration|ancestor]]s by [[Burnt offering|burning]] them. Burying and leaving offerings in the open are also common in certain circumstances. The purpose of offering is to benefit the venerated, show gratitude, and give something back, strengthening the bonds between humans and divine and between members of a community.&lt;ref&gt;Galina Krasskova, Swain Wodening.

==Origins==
[[File:Wheel of the Year.JPG|thumb|Painted Wheel of the Year from the [[Museum of Witchcraft]] , Boscastle.]] 
[[File:Kolomir00.jpg|thumb|''Kołomir'' - the [[Slavs|Slavic]] example of Wheel of the Year indicating seasons of the year. Four-point and eight-point [[swastika]] shaped wheels were more common.]]
The contemporary &quot;Wheel of the Year&quot; is somewhat of a modern innovation. While many historical pagan traditions celebrated various [[equinox]]es, [[solstice]]s, and even cross-quarter days for their seasonal and agricultural significances, none were known to have held ''all eight'' above all other annual, sacred times. The modern understanding of the Wheel is a result of the cross-cultural awareness that began developing by the time of [[Modern history|Modern]] Europe.

Mid-20th century British Paganism had a strong influence on early adoption of an eightfold Wheel. By the late 1950s, the Wiccan [[Bricket Wood Coven]] and [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]] had both adopted eightfold ritual calendars, for balance and more frequent celebrations. This also had the benefit of more closely aligning celebration between the two influential Pagan orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamond_fyw-p16&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Lamond |first=Frederic |title=Fifty Years of Wicca |year=2004 |location=Sutton Mallet, England |publisher=Green Magic |isbn=0-9547230-1-5 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutton&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles |publisher=Oxford, Blackwell |isbn=0-631-18946-7 |pages=337–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to early Wicca's influence on Paganism and their [[syncretic]] adoption of [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] motifs, the most commonly used English festival names for the Wheel of the Year tend to be [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]].

The [[American Ásatrú]] movement has adopted, over time, a calendar in which the Heathen major holidays figure alongside many &quot;Days of Remembrance&quot; which celebrate heroes of the [[Edda]] and the [[Saga]]s, figures of Germanic history, and the [[Viking]] [[Leif Ericson]], who explored and settled [[Vinland]] (North America). These festivals are not, however, as evenly distributed throughout the year as in Wicca and other Heathen denominations.

==Narratives==
===Celtic===
One common solar narrative based in [[Celtic folklore]] is that of the [[Holly King (myth)|Holly King]] and the [[Oak]] King, rulers of the Winter and Summer, respectively.  These two figures battle endlessly with the turning of the seasons.  At [[Midsummer]], the Oak King is at the height of his strength. Having just defeated the Holly King, he enjoys the commencement of his reign. As the year progresses, the Holly King slowly regains his power and with the [[Autumnal Equinox]], the tables finally begin turning in the Holly King's favor. Come [[Midwinter]], he vanquishes the Oak King.  Over the next months, however, the sun again waxes in power and the Oak King slowly regains his strength. At the [[Vernal Equinox]] he begins to triumph until he once again defeats the Holly King at Midsummer. The two are seen ultimately as essential parts of a whole and would not exist without each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrars&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The Holly King is often portrayed as a woodsy figure, similar to the modern [[Santa Claus]], dressed in red with sprigs of holly in his hair and the Oak King as a [[fertility god]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about.com_hollyandoak&quot;/&gt;

===Modern Wicca===
{{Further|Wiccan views of divinity}}
In [[Wicca]], the narrative of the Wheel of the Year traditionally centres on the [[sacred marriage]] of the Great God &amp; Goddess and the [[God (male deity)|god]]/[[goddess]] duality.&lt;ref name=brill&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Contemporary Paganism|year=2009|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=[[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]]|isbn=978-90-04-16373-7|coauthors=Murphy Pizza, James R. Lewis|page=64|chapter=The Modern Magical Revival: Nevill Drury}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this cycle, the God perpetually is born from the Goddess at Yule, grows in power at the [[Vernal Equinox]] (as does the Goddess, now in her ''maiden aspect''), courts and impregnates the Goddess at [[Beltane]], reaches his peak at [[Midsummer]], wanes in power at [[Lammas]], passes into the underworld at [[Samhain]] (taking with him the Earth's/Goddess' fertility, who is now in her ''crone aspect'') until he is once again born from Her mother/crone aspect at Yule. The Goddess, in turn, ages and rejuvenates endlessly with the seasons, being courted by and giving birth to the Horned God.
