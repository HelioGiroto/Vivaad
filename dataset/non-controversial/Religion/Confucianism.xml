{{Confucianism}}
'''Confucianism''' is a Chinese ethical and philosophical system developed from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] (孔夫子 Kǒng Fūzǐ, or K'ung-fu-tzu, lit. &quot;Master Kong&quot;, 551–479 BC). Confucianism originated as an &quot;ethical-sociopolitical teaching&quot; during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], but later developed metaphysical and cosmological elements in the [[Han Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;craig&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|1998|p=550}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the abandonment of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] in China after the [[Qin Dynasty]], Confucianism became the official state ideology of China, until it was replaced by the &quot;[[Three Principles of the People]]&quot; ideology with the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]], and then [[Maoism|Maoist Communism]] after the ROC was replaced by the [[People's Republic of China]] in Mainland China.

The core of Confucianism is [[humanism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;juergensmeyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in global civil society |last= Juergensmeyer|first= Mark|year= 2005|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn=978-0-19-518835-6|page=70|quote=...humanist philosophies such as Confucianism, which do not share a belief in divine law and do not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the belief that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucianism focuses on the cultivation of virtue and maintenance of ethics, the most basic of which are ''ren'', ''yi'', and ''li''.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2&quot;/&gt; ''Ren'' is an obligation of [[altruism]] and humaneness for other individuals within a community, ''yi'' is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good, and ''li'' is a system of norms and [[Appropriate|propriety]] that determines how a person should properly act within a community.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|1998|p=536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism holds that one should give up one's life, if necessary, either passively or actively, for the sake of upholding the cardinal moral values of ''ren'' and ''yi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://arts.hkbu.edu.hk/~pclo/e5.pdf|author=Lo, Ping-cheung|title=Confucian Ethic of Death with Dignity and Its Contemporary Relevance|year=1999|publisher=Society of Christian Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Confucius the man may have been a believer in [[Chinese folk religion]], Confucianism as an ideology is [[humanistic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;juergensmeyer&quot;/&gt; and [[non-theistic]], and does not involve a belief in the supernatural or in a personal god.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Yang|1961|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures and countries strongly influenced by Confucianism include mainland [[Culture of China|China]], [[Culture of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Culture of Korea|Korea]], [[Culture of Japan|Japan]] and [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnam]], as well as various territories settled predominantly by [[Han Chinese|Chinese people]], such as [[Culture of Singapore|Singapore]]. Although Confucian ideas prevail in these areas, few people outside of academia identify themselves as Confucian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford handbook of global religions |last= Juergensmeyer|first= Mark|year= 2006|series=Oxford Handbooks |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn=978-0-19-513798-9|page=116|quote=Few people self-identify as Confucian, yet fewer still will deny the vital importance of promoting filiality and family cohesion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Education About Asia |publisher= Association for Asian Studies  |page=75 |volume= 6-7 |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead see Confucian ethics as a complementary guideline for other ideologies and beliefs, including [[democracy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenco|first1=Leigh |year= 2007|title=A Political Theory for Them: But Not for Us?

==Names and Etymology==
Strictly speaking, there is no term in Chinese which directly corresponds to &quot;Confucianism.&quot; Several different terms are used in different situations, several of which are of modern origin:

* &quot;School of the scholars&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:家|家]]|p=Rújiā}})
* &quot;Teaching of the scholars&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=Rújiào}})
* &quot;Study of the scholars&quot; ({{zh|t=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:學|學]]|s=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:学|学]]|p=Rúxué}})
* &quot;Teaching of Confucius&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:教|教]]|p=Kǒngjiào}})
* &quot;Kong Family's Business&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孔|孔]][[wikt:家|家]][[wikt:店|店]]|p=Kǒngjiādiàn}})&lt;ref&gt;This phrase of a certain negative context became popular after its usage in many Anti-Confucianism movements in China, most notably the [[May Fourth Movement]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]. See [http://guoxue.zynews.com/News/2009/11104.html ] and [http://bbs1.people.com.cn/postDetail.do?boardId=14&amp;treeView=1&amp;view=2&amp;id=91865332 ] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of these use the Chinese character 儒 ''rú,'' meaning &quot;scholar&quot;. These names do not use the name &quot;Confucius&quot; at all, but instead center on the figure or ideal of the Confucian scholar; however, the suffixes of ''jiā, jiào,'' and ''xué'' carry different implications as to the nature of Confucianism itself.

''Rújiā'' contains the character ''jiā,'' which literally means &quot;house&quot; or &quot;family&quot;. In this context, it is more readily construed as meaning &quot;school of thought&quot;, since it is also used to construct the names of philosophical schools contemporary with Confucianism: for example, the Chinese names for [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] end in ''jiā.''

''Rújiào'' and ''Kǒngjiào'' contain the Chinese character jiào, the noun &quot;teach&quot;, used in such as terms as &quot;education&quot;, or &quot;educator&quot;. The term, however, is notably used to construct the names of religions in Chinese: the terms for Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and other religions in Chinese all end with ''jiào.''

''Rúxué'' contains ''xué'' 'study'. The term is parallel to ''-ology'' in English, being used to construct the names of academic fields: the Chinese names of fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, political science, economics, and sociology all end in ''xué.''

==Themes in Confucian thought==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2009}}
===Six books===
Confucius taught six books to followers when he was in state of lu,there were:
*[[Classic of Poetry]]（诗),is a collection of former prophecy
*[[Book of Documents]]（书）,is a collection of history recorded by [[vassals]].
*[[Book of Rites]]（礼）,is a collection of fomer laws.
*[[Book of Music]]（乐）,is a collection about  former rituals.
*[[I Ching]] or [[Classic of Change]](易）,this book is descibed &quot;Classic of all Classics&quot; ,&quot;Primate Classic&quot; by Confucians even today
*[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]（春秋）,annuals of the whole land during that period ,maybe written by Confucius to reveal the [[Classic of Change]].

The six books' name is traditionally written in a sequence &quot;诗书礼乐易春秋&quot;.When the [[Classic of Change]](易）is verbal,it could read as &quot;Poetry,documents,rites,music changed the annals of Spring and Autumn.&quot;

There is also a Chinese idiom &quot;A big dream such like Spring and Autumn&quot;(春秋大梦）.

===Humanism===
Humanism is at the core in Confucianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;juergensmeyer&quot;/&gt; A simple way to appreciate Confucian thought is to consider it as being based on varying levels of honesty, and a simple way to understand Confucian thought is to examine the world by using the logic of humanity. In practice, the primary foundation and function of Confucianism is as an ethical philosophy to be practiced by all the members of a society.&lt;ref name=&quot;bevir1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bevir|2010|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucian ethics is characterized by the promotion of virtues, encompassed by the Five Constants, or the Wuchang (五常), extrapolated by Confucian scholars during the [[Han Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;runes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy|last=Runes|first=Dagobert D. |year=1983|publisher=Philosophical Library|location= |isbn= 978-0-8022-2388-3|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five virtues are:&lt;ref name=&quot;runes&quot;/&gt; 
*[[Ren (Confucianism)|Rén]] (仁, Humaneness)
*[[Yi (Confucianism)|Yì]] (義, Righteousness or Justice)
*[[Li (Confucianism)|Lǐ]] (禮, Propriety or Etiquette)
*Zhì (智, Knowledge)
*Xìn (信, Integrity).

These are accompanied by the classical Sìzì (四字) with four virtues: 
*Zhōng (忠, Loyalty)
*Xiào (孝, Filial piety)
*Jié (節, Continency)
*Yì (義, Righteousness). 

There are still many other elements, such as Chéng (誠, honesty), Shù (恕, kindness and forgiveness), Lián (廉, honesty and cleanness), Chǐ (恥, shame, judge and sense of right and wrong), Yǒng (勇, bravery), Wēn (溫, kind and gentle), Liáng (良, good, kindhearted), Gōng (恭, respectful, reverent), Jiǎn (儉, frugal), Ràng (讓, modestly, self-effacing). Among all elements, Ren and Yi are fundamental.

===Ren===
{{Main|Ren (Confucianism)}}

''Ren'' is one of the basic virtues promoted by Confucius, and is an obligation of [[altruism]] and humaneness for other individuals within a community.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2&quot;/&gt; Confucius' concept of humaneness ({{zh|c=[[wikt:仁|仁]]|p=rén}}) is probably best expressed in the Confucian version of the [[ethic of reciprocity]], or the Golden Rule: &quot;Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you.&quot;

Confucius never stated whether man was born good or evil,&lt;ref&gt;Homer H. Dubs: 'Nature in the Teaching of Confucius', p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; noting that 'By nature men are similar; by practice men are wide apart' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confucius.org/lunyu/cd1702.htm |title=Lun Yu (Yang Huo) 13 May 2009 |publisher=Confucius.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;implying that whether good or bad, Confucius must have perceived all men to be born with intrinsic similarities, but that man is conditioned and inﬂuenced by study and practise. [[Xunzi]]'s opinion is that men originally just want what they instinctively want despite positive or negative results it may bring, so cultivation is needed. In Mencius' view, all men are born to share goodness such as compassion and good heart, although they may become wicked. The [[Three Character Classic]] begins with &quot;People at birth are naturally good (kind-hearted)&quot;, which stems from Mencius' idea. All the views eventually lead to recognize the importance of human education and cultivation.

''Rén'' also has a political dimension. If the ruler lacks ''rén'', Confucianism holds, it will be difficult if not impossible for his subjects to behave humanely. ''Rén'' is the basis of Confucian political theory: it presupposes an autocratic ruler, exhorted to refrain from acting inhumanely towards his subjects. An inhumane ruler runs the risk of losing the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;, the right to rule. A ruler lacking such a mandate need not be obeyed. But a ruler who reigns humanely and takes care of the people is to be obeyed strictly, for the benevolence of his dominion shows that he has been mandated by heaven. Confucius himself had little to say on the will of the people, but his leading follower [[Mencius]] did state on one occasion that the people's opinion on certain weighty matters should be considered.

===Etiquette===
{{Main|Li (Confucianism)}}
In Confucianism, the term &quot;[[Li (Confucianism)|li]]&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:禮|禮]]|p=lǐ}}), sometimes translated into English as rituals, customs, rites, etiquette, or morals, refers to any of the secular social functions of daily life, akin to the Western term for [[culture]]. Confucius considered education and music as various elements of li.  Li were codified and treated as a comprehensive system of norms, guiding the [[Appropriate|propriety]] or politeness which colors everyday life. Confucius himself tried to revive the [[etiquette]] of earlier dynasties.

It is important to note that, although li is sometimes translated as &quot;ritual&quot; or &quot;rites&quot;, it has developed a specialized meaning in Confucianism, as opposed to its usual religious meanings. In Confucianism, the acts of everyday life are considered rituals. Rituals are not necessarily regimented or arbitrary practices, but the routines that people often engage in, knowingly or unknowingly, during the normal course of their lives. Shaping the rituals in a way that leads to a content and healthy society, and to content and healthy people, is one purpose of Confucian philosophy.

===Loyalty===
Loyalty ({{zh|c=[[wikt:忠|忠]]|p=zhōng}}) is the equivalent of filial piety on a different plane. It is particularly relevant for the social class to which most of Confucius' students belonged, because the only way for an ambitious young scholar to make his way in the Confucian Chinese world was to enter a ruler's civil service. Like filial piety, however, loyalty was often subverted by the autocratic regimes of China. Confucius had advocated a sensitivity to the [[realpolitik]] of the class relations in his time; he did not propose that &quot;might makes right&quot;, but that a superior who had received the &quot;[[Mandate of Heaven]]&quot; (see below) should be obeyed because of his moral rectitude.

In later ages, however, emphasis was placed more on the obligations of the ruled to the ruler, and less on the ruler's obligations to the ruled.

Loyalty was also an extension of one's duties to friends, family, and spouse. Loyalty to one's family came first, then to one's spouse, then to one's ruler, and lastly to one's friends. Loyalty was considered one of the greater human virtues.

Confucius also realized that loyalty and filial piety can potentially conflict.

===Filial piety===
{{Main|Filial piety}}
&quot;Filial piety&quot; ({{zh|c=[[wikt:孝|孝]]|p=xiào}}) is considered among the greatest of virtues and must be shown towards both the living and the dead (including even remote ancestors). The term &quot;filial&quot; (meaning &quot;of a child&quot;) characterizes the respect that a child, originally a son, should show to his parents. This relationship was extended by analogy to a series of ''five relationships'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:五|五]][[wikt:倫|倫]]|p=wǔlún}}):&lt;ref&gt;[http://ias.berkeley.edu/orias/summer2004/summer2004Chinalegal.htm Chinese Legal Theories]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Bonds
* Ruler to Ruled
* Father to Son
* Husband to Wife
* Elder Brother to Younger Brother
* Friend to Friend

Specific duties were prescribed to each of the participants in these sets of relationships. Such duties were also extended to the dead, where the living stood as sons to their deceased family. This led to the veneration of ancestors. The only relationship where respect for elders wasn't stressed was the Friend to Friend relationship. In all other relationships, high reverence was held for elders.

The idea of Filial piety influenced the Chinese legal system: a criminal would be punished more harshly if the culprit had committed the crime against a parent, while fathers often exercised enormous power over their children. A similar differentiation was applied to other relationships. Now{{Clarify|pre-text=PROC?|date=May 2011}} filial piety is also built into law. People have the responsibility to provide for their elderly parents according to the law.

The main source of our knowledge of the importance of filial piety is the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', a work attributed to Confucius and his son but almost certainly written in the 3rd century BCE. The Analects, the main source of the Confucianism of Confucius, actually has little to say on the matter of filial piety and some sources believe the concept was focused on by later thinkers as a response to [[Mohism]].

Filial piety has continued to play a central role in Confucian thinking to the present day.

===Relationships===
Relationships are central to Confucianism. Particular duties arise from one's particular situation in relation to others. The individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people: as a junior in relation to parents and elders, and as a senior in relation to younger siblings, students, and others. While juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe their seniors reverence, seniors also have duties of benevolence and concern toward juniors. This theme of mutuality is prevalent in East Asian cultures even to this day.

Social harmony—the great goal of Confucianism—therefore results in part from every individual knowing his or her place in the social order, and playing his or her part well. When Duke Jing of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked about government, by which he meant proper administration so as to bring social harmony, Confucius replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son. (''Analects'' XII, 11, trans. Legge)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mencius says: &quot;When being a child, yearn for and love your parents; when growing mature, yearn for and love your lassie; when having wife and child(ren), yearn for and love your wife and child(ren); when being an official (or a staffer), yearn for and love your sovereign (and/or boss).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;孟子：人少，則慕父母；知好色，則慕少艾；有妻子，則慕妻子；仕則慕君&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cite quote|date=June 2011}}&lt;!--We need an English source: this looks like a very amateur translation--&gt;

===The gentleman===
{{Main|Junzi}}
The term ''jūnzǐ'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:君|君]][[wikt:子|子]]|l=lord's child}}) is crucial to classical Confucianism. Confucianism exhorts all people to strive for the ideal of a &quot;gentleman&quot; or &quot;perfect man&quot;. A succinct description of the &quot;perfect man&quot; is one who &quot;combines the qualities of saint, scholar, and gentleman.&quot; In modern times the masculine translation in English is also traditional and is still frequently used. [[Elitism]] was bound up with the concept, and gentlemen were expected to act as moral guides to the rest of society.

They were to:
* cultivate themselves morally;
* show filial piety and loyalty where these are due;
* cultivate humanity, or benevolence.

The great exemplar of the perfect gentleman is Confucius himself. Perhaps the tragedy of his life was that he was never awarded the high official position which he desired, from which he wished to demonstrate the general well-being that would ensue if humane persons ruled and administered the state.

The opposite of the ''Jūnzǐ'' was the ''Xiǎorén'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:小|小]][[wikt:人|人]]|p=xiǎorén|l=small person}}). The character 小 in this context means petty in mind and heart, narrowly self-interested, greedy, superficial, or materialistic.

===Rectification of names===
{{Main|Rectification of Names}}
Confucius believed that social disorder often stemmed from failure to perceive, understand, and deal with reality. Fundamentally, then, social disorder can stem from the failure to call things by their proper names, and his solution to this was ''Zhèngmíng'' ({{zh|c=[正名]|p=zhèngmíng|l=rectification of terms}}). He gave an explanation of ''zhengming'' to one of his disciples.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zi-lu said, &quot;The vassal of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Master replied, &quot;What is necessary to rectify names.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;So! indeed!&quot; said Zi-lu. &quot;You are wide off the mark! Why must there be such rectification?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The Master said, &quot;How uncultivated you are, Yu! The superior man cannot care about the everything, just as he cannot go to check all himself!&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore if the superior have got everything the a propriate name,he would find it convient to give orders.If he give orders ,it will be always appropriately carried out.Then,he cannot blame you,because you can always appropicately..&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(''Analects'' XIII, 3, tr. Legge)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Xun Zi]] chapter (22) &quot;On the Rectification of Names&quot; claims the ancient sage-kings chose names ({{zh|c=[名]|p=míng}}) that directly corresponded with actualities ({{zh|c=[實]|p=shí}}), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong.

==Governance==
[[Image:Lotusconfuciustemple2.jpg|thumb|Confucian temple in [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]], [[Republic of China]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To govern by virtue, let us compare it to the North Star: it stays in its place, while the myriad stars wait upon it. (''Analects'' II, 1)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another key Confucian concept is that in order to govern others one must first govern oneself. When developed sufficiently, the king's personal virtue spreads beneficent influence throughout the kingdom. This idea is developed further in the [[Great Learning]], and is tightly linked with the [[Taoism|Taoist]] concept of [[wu wei]] ({{zh|t=無為|s=无为|p=wú wéi}}): the less the king does, the more gets done. By being the &quot;calm center&quot; around which the kingdom turns, the king allows everything to function smoothly and avoids having to tamper with the individual parts of the whole.

This idea may be traced back to early Chinese shamanistic beliefs, such as the king being the axle between the sky, human beings, and the Earth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Another complementary view is that this idea may have been used by ministers and counselors to deter aristocratic whims that would otherwise be to the detriment of the state's people.

==Meritocracy==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In teaching, there should be no distinction of classes. (''Analects'' XV, 39)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The main basis of his teachings was to seek knowledge, study, and become a better person.

Although Confucius claimed that he never invented anything but was only transmitting ancient knowledge (see ''Analects'' VII, 1), he did produce a number of new ideas. Many European and American admirers such as [[Voltaire]] and [[H. G. Creel]] point to the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with nobility of virtue. Jūnzǐ (君子, lit. &quot;lord's child&quot;), which originally signified the younger, non-inheriting, offspring of a noble, became, in Confucius' work, an epithet having much the same meaning and evolution as the English &quot;gentleman&quot;. A virtuous plebeian who cultivates his qualities can be a &quot;gentleman&quot;, while a shameless son of the king is only a &quot;small man&quot;. That he admitted students of different classes as disciples is a clear demonstration that he fought against the feudal structures that defined pre-imperial Chinese society.

Another new idea, that of [[meritocracy]], led to the introduction of the [[Imperial examination]] system in China. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position which would bring wealth and honour to the whole family. The Chinese Imperial examination system seems to have been started in 165 BC, when certain candidates for public office were called to the Chinese capital for examination of their moral excellence by the emperor. Over the following centuries the system grew until finally almost anyone who wished to become an official had to prove his worth by passing written government examinations.

His achievement was the setting up of a school that produced statesmen with a strong sense of patriotism and duty, known as Rujia ({{zh|c=[[wikt:儒|儒]][[wikt:家|家]]|p=Rújiā}}). During the [[Warring States Period]] and the early [[Han Dynasty]], China grew greatly and the need arose for a solid and centralized cadre of government officers able to read and write administrative papers. As a result, Confucianism was promoted by the emperor and the men its doctrines produced became an effective counter to the remaining feudal aristocrats who threatened the unity of the imperial state.

During the Han Dynasty, Confucianism developed from an ethical system into a political ideology used to legitimize the rule of the political elites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haynes|2008|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Chinese emperors used a mix of Legalism and Confucianism as their ruling doctrine, often with the latter embellishing the former. The practice of using the Confucian meritocracy to justify political actions continues in countries in the [[Sinosphere]], including post-economic liberalization [[People's Republic of China]], [[Chiang Kai-Shek]]'s [[Republic of China]], and modern [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes&quot;/&gt;

==Influence in 17th-century Europe==
[[Image:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|&quot;Life and works of Confucius, by [[Prospero Intorcetta]], 1687]]
The works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of [[Jesuit]] scholars stationed in China.&lt;ref&gt;The first was [[Michele Ruggieri]] who had returned from China to Italy in 1588, and carried on translating in Latin Chinese classics, while residing in Salerno&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matteo Ricci]] was among the very earliest to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and father [[Prospero Intorcetta]] wrote about the life and works of Confucius in [[Latin]] in 1687.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windows into China&quot;&gt;&quot;Windows into China&quot;, John Parker, p.25, ISBN 0-89073-050-4&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mungello&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mungello|first1=David E. |year= 1971|title=Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.2307/1397760}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[western world|Western civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Windows into China&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation]], John Hobson, pp 194–195, ISBN 0-521-54724-5&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism influenced [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who was attracted to the philosophy because of its perceived similarity to his own. It is postulated that certain elements of Leibniz's philosophy, such as &quot;simple substance&quot; and &quot;preestablished harmony&quot;, were borrowed from his interactions with Confucianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mungello&quot;/&gt; The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] was also influenced by Confucius, seeing the concept of Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma.&lt;ref name=&quot;epc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ezra Pound and Confucianism: remaking humanism in the face of modernity  |last= Lan|first= Feng|year= 2005|publisher= University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-8020-8941-0|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Confucian ethics and politics, portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;epc&quot;/&gt;
{{quote|text=Confucius has no interest in falsehood; he did not pretend to be prophet; he claimed no inspiration; he taught no new religion; he used no delusions; flattered not the emperor under whom he lived...|sign=[[Voltaire]]&lt;ref name=&quot;epc&quot;/&gt;}}

== Influence on Islamic thought ==
From the late 17th century onwards a whole body of literature known as the [[Han Kitab]] developed amongst the Hui Muslims of China who infused Islamic thought with Confucianism. Especially the works of [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] such as ''Tiānfāng Diǎnlǐ''（天方典禮） sought to harmonize Islam with not only Confucianism but Daoism and is considered to be one of the crowning achievements of the Chinese Muslim culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=James|title=Uncontrived Concord: The Eclectic Sources and Syncretic Theories of Liu Zhi, a Chinese Muslim Scholar|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|year=2009|volume=20|pages=46–54|url=http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/1/46.abstract|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in modern times==
Important military and political figures in modern Chinese history continued to be influenced by Confucianism, like the Muslim warlord [[Ma Fuxiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=ma+fuxiang+military+academy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_AadTPPfNIP78AaV-OVR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20fuxiang%20confucianism%20%20northern&amp;f=false|title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication|coauthors=Stéphane A.

Referred to variously as the Confucian hypothesis and as a debated component of the more all-encompassing Asian Development Model, there exists among political scientists and economists a theory that Confucianism plays a large latent role in the ostensibly non-Confucian cultures of modern-day East Asia, in the form of the rigorous work ethic it endowed those cultures with. These scholars have held that, if not for Confucianism's influence on these cultures, many of the people of the East Asia region would not have been able to modernize and industrialize as quickly as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and even [[China]] have done. Most scholars attribute the origins of this idea to futurologist [[Herman Kahn]]'s [[World Economic Development: 1979 and Beyond]].&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, George. 1990. &quot;Explaining the Success of the Four Little Dragons: A Survey.&quot; In Seiji Naya and Akira Takayama, eds.

See Hicks' account of it referenced above for details, or for an alternate and more current explanation, [[Cristobal Kay]]'s &quot;Why East Asia Overtook Latin America: Agrarian Reform, Industrialization, and Development.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;2002.

==Criticism==
For many years since the era of Confucius, various critiques of Confucianism have arisen, including [[Laozi]]'s philosophy and [[Mozi]]'s critique. [[Lu Xun]] also criticised Confucianism heavily for shaping Chinese people into the condition they had reached by the late [[Qing Dynasty]]: his criticisms are well portrayed in two of his works, [[A Madman's Diary]] and [[The True Story of Ah Q]].

In modern times, waves of critique along with vilification against Confucianism arose. The [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[May Fourth Movement]] and [[Cultural Revolution]] are some upsurges of those waves in China. Taiping rebels described many sages in Confucianism as well as gods in [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as mere legends. Marxists during the [[Cultural Revolution]] described Confucius as the general representative of the class of slave owners. Numerous opinions and interpretations of Confucianism (of which many are actually opposed by Confucianism) were invented.

In [[South Korea]], there has been long criticism to Confucianism. Many Koreans believe Confucianism has not contributed to the modernization of Korea. For example, South Korean writer [[Kim-kyong-li]] wrote a criticism named &quot;Must Kill Confucius, This Nation will be Solved&quot; (공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다, ''gongjaga jug-eoya nalaga sanda''). The writer said that filial relationships are one-side and blind. He writes that if these circumstance continue, social problems will continue to be caused by society and the government forcing Confucian filial obligations onto families. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=39088 |title=공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다고? - 시사저널 |publisher=Sisapress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted by 하늘날아 |url=http://zerocdh.tistory.com/97 |title=지식이 물 흐르듯이 :: 공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다 |publisher=Zerocdh.tistory.com |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in Confucian thought===
Confucianism &quot;largely defined the mainstream discourse on gender in China from the [[Han dynasty]] onward,&quot;&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt; and its strict, obligatory gender roles as a cornerstone of family, and thus, societal stability, continue to shape social life throughout East Asia.  Confucians taught that a virtuous woman was supposed to uphold 'three subordinations': be subordinate to her father before marriage, to her husband after marriage, and to her son after her husband died. Men could remarry and have concubines, whereas women were supposed to uphold the virtue of chastity when they lost their husbands.&lt;ref name=Vohra&gt;{{Cite book | last = Vohra | first = Ranbir | title = China's Path to Modernization: A Historical Review from 1800 to the Present 3rd edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]  | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-13-080747-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chaste widows were revered as heroes during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] periods,&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite web  | last = Adler  | first = Joseph A.  | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

The book served as Confucianism's seminal textbook for Chinese women for two millennia, but cementing the &quot;cult of chastity&quot; as an exemplar of Chinese superiority also condemned many widows to lives of &quot;poverty and loneliness.&quot;&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt;

However, recent reexaminations of Chinese gender roles suggest that  many women flourished within Confucianism.&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt;  During the Han dynasty period, the important Confucian text [[Lessons for Women]] (Nüjie), was written by [[Ban Zhao]] (45-114 CE): by a woman, for women.
&lt;blockquote&gt;She wrote the ''Nüjie'' ostensibly for her daughters, instructing them on how to live proper Confucian lives as wives and mothers. Although this is a relatively rare instance of a female Confucian voice, Ban Zhao almost entirely accepts the prevailing views concerning women's proper roles; they should be silent, hard-working, and compliant. She stresses the complementarity and equal importance of the male and female roles according to yin-yang theory, but she clearly accepts the dominance of the yang-male. Her only departure from the standard male versions of this orthodoxy is that she insists on the necessity of educating girls and women. We should not underestimate the significance of this point, as education was the bottom line qualification for being a junzi or &quot;noble person,&quot;...her example suggests that the Confucian prescription for a meaningful life as a woman was apparently not stifling for all women. Even some women of the literate elite, for whom Confucianism was quite explicitly the norm, were able to flourish by living their lives according to that model.&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, for the first time women (and ethnic minorities and people living overseas) were officially recognized as being descendants of Confucius. &lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8275269.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Confucian family tree 'triples' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These additions more than tripled the number of officially recognized descendants of Confucius. &lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

==Debate over classification==
Ever since Europeans first encountered Confucianism, the issue of how Confucianism should be classified has been subject to debate. In the 16th and the 17th centuries, the earliest European arrivals in China, the Christian [[Jesuits]], considered Confucianism to be an ethical system, not a religion, and one that was compatible with Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elman&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Elman|2005|p=112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits, including [[Matteo Ricci]], saw Chinese rituals as &quot;civil rituals&quot; that could co-exist alongside the spiritual rituals of Catholicism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elman&quot;/&gt; By the early 18th century, this initial portrayal was rejected by the [[Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]], creating a dispute among Catholics in East Asia that was known as the &quot;Rites Controversy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunn&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunn|2003|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominicans and Franciscans argued that [[ancestral worship]] was a form of pagan idolatry that was contradictory to the tenets of Christianity. This view was reinforced by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], who ordered a ban on Chinese rituals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunn&quot;/&gt;

This debate continues into the modern era. There is consensus among scholars that, whether or not it is religious, Confucianism is definitively [[non-theistic]]. Confucianism is [[humanism|humanistic]], and does not involve a belief in the supernatural or in a personal god.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang&quot;/&gt; On spirituality, Confucius said to Chi Lu, one of his students, that &quot;You are not yet able to serve men, how can you serve spirits?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinaiko&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sinaiko|1998|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attributes that are seen as religious—such as [[ancestor worship]], [[ritual]], and [[sacrifice]]—were advocated by Confucius as necessary for social harmony; however, these attributes can be traced to the traditional non-Confucian Chinese beliefs of [[Chinese folk religion]], and are also practiced by Daoists and Chinese Buddhists. Scholars recognize that classification ultimately depends on how one defines religion. Using stricter definitions of religion, Confucianism has been described as a moral science or philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~tkang/welcome_files/religion.htm Centre for Confucian Science (Korea)]; [http://urantiabook.org/archive/readers/601_confucianism.htm Introduction to Confucianism]&lt;/ref&gt; But using a broader definition, such as Frederick Streng's characterization of religion as &quot;a means of ultimate transformation&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Streng, Frederick, &quot;Understanding Religious Life,&quot; 3rd ed. (1985), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism could be described as a &quot;sociopolitical doctrine having religious qualities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang&quot;/&gt; With the latter definition, Confucianism is religious, even if non-theistic, in the sense that it &quot;performs some of the basic psycho-social functions of full-fledged religions&quot;, in the same way that non-theistic ideologies like [[Communism]] do.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang&quot;/&gt;
