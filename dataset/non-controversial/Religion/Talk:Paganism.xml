== Illyrian paganism ==

I do not see any information about Illyrian paganism. I am gathering some information from different historians on the issue. Also there are a lot of pagan elements in Albanian folkloric tales and tradition that could be very informative to add. Any comment?

== Let's sort this page out! ==

Right. This page is getting to be a mess. It needs a clean-up, and it needs good referencing for everything, not just from &quot;msn dictionary&quot; but from solid, academic works. I suggest that we start by soprting out the introduction, which is just a mess with bullet points and other junk thrown in at the moment.

This article appears to be quite an entropy-magnet with all the anon edits it is getting. 
We seem to be getting nowhere. Perhaps semiprotetion will help, but then somebody will need to sit down and actually improve it.

I have concerns with the &quot;definition of paganism&quot; by Jones &amp; Pennick (1995).
It is fair enough that these are Neopagan authors. However, [[Nigel Pennick]] isn't exactly what I would call an ''erudite'' Neopagan author (unlike, say, Bonewits). The definition also falls flat on its face as soon as you try it out. It is tailored to suit Wicca, but it will already fail to classify as &quot;pagan&quot; lots of Neopagan movements, not to mention most historical polytheistic religions. By contrast, it will  include as &quot;pagan&quot; Roman Catholicism
(1. plurality of divine beings, with an underlying unity: [[Christian angelology|check]]. 2. Nature as manifesttion of the divine: [[Creation according to Genesis|check]]. 3. female aspect of divinity: [[Marian veneration|check]]). No so in [[Germanic paganism]] which assumes the natural world is just &quot;there&quot; and not any kind of divine manifestation. Nor does Germanic paganism have any kind of capital-G-Goddess, just goddesses.

It is fair enough to state that this is what Jones &amp; Pennick (1995) think &quot;pagan&quot; means, but I have doubts whether it is notable enough to be included here rather than at the [[Nigel Pennick]] article. --[[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|(íÅ≥)]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:34, 1 January 2010 (UTC)

==[[Paganism#Classifications|Paganism - Classifications]]==

The section on ''[[Paganism#Classifications|Paganism - Classifications]]'' focuses on classifications only produced by one person, and appear to be rather subjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps this section should be removed, or expanded to encompass more detailed classifications with a more NPOV.  [[User:Der.Gray|Der.Gray]] ([[User talk:Der.Gray|talk]]) 05:54, 23 

You have a point. I am not comfortable with the section myself. 
Its purpose is to point out the distinction between historical paganism and Neopaganism. The distinction is important, but Bonewits' terms are idiosyncratic. This needs more work. --[[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|(íÅ≥)]]&lt;/small&gt; 14:15, 1 January 2010 (UTC)

Pagan subdivisions coined by [[Isaac Bonewits]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Defs&quot;&gt; [http://www.neopagan.net/PaganDefs.html &quot;Defining Paganism: Paleo-, Meso-, and Neo-&quot;]   
(Version 2.5.1) 1979, 2007 c.e., Isaac Bonewits&lt;/ref&gt;   
*Paleopaganism: A [[retronym]] coined to contrast with &quot;[[Neopaganism]]&quot;, &quot;original polytheistic, nature-centered faiths&quot;, such as the pre-Hellenistic [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and pre-imperial [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], pre-Migration period [[Germanic paganism]] as described by [[Tacitus]], or [[Celtic polytheism]] as described by [[Julius Caesar]]. Among extant &quot;[[major religion]]s&quot;, Bonewits would count as Paleopagan [[Hinduism]] as it stood prior to the [[Islamic invasions of India]], [[Shintoism]] and [[Taoism]].
*Mesopaganism: A group, which is, or has been, significantly influenced by monotheistic, dualistic, or nontheistic worldviews, but has been able to maintain an independence of religious practices. This group includes aboriginal Americans as well as Australian aboriginals, [[Viking Age]] [[Norse paganism]] and [[New Age]] spirituality. Influences include: [[Freemasonry]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.experiencefestival.com/pagan_glossary/page/2&lt;/ref&gt;,[[Rosicrucianism]], [[Theosophy]], [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], and the many Afro-Diasporic faiths like [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Santer√≠a]] and Espiritu religion. [[Isaac Bonewits]] includes [[British Traditional Wicca]] in this subdivision.
*[[Neopaganism]]: A movement by modern people to revive nature-worshipping, pre-Christian religions, or other nature-based spiritual paths. This definition may include anything on a sliding scale from [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Reconstructionism]] at one end to non-reconstructionist groups such as [[Neo-druidism]] and [[Wicca]] at the other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book list in Amazon.com [http://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Meso-and-Neopagan-Druidism/lm/31NVBOL2ZHECS] uses these three terms in describing the books, so that means the terms can be considered standard usage. There is also the [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject Neopaganism]] that justifies the use of that term.
The classifications make important distinctions having to do with their origination and their ingredients.
* Paleopaganism or paleo-paganism, originated historically, not impacted by later developments
* Mesopaganism or meso paganism, originated historically, impacted by later developments, but maintains its distinctiveness
* Neopaganism, originated in modern times, but is the effort to recreate and/or merge elements from paleopaganism and/or mesopaganism.

== Confusing   ??? ==

This whole page is very confusing? What is paganism? Please say it in simple words!  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚ÄîPreceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.138.69.0|69.138.69.0]] ([[User talk:69.138.69.0|talk]]) 04:45, 8 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:The word &quot;pagan&quot; or &quot;paganism&quot; has different meanings in different contexts, and means different things to different people. So there is not one simple definition that fits all situations. The link [http://www.religioustolerance.org/paganism.htm] gives 7 distinct defintions. The words are usually used to classify or characterize the [[beliefs]], [[world view]], [[Meaning of life|meaning of life]], [[lifestyle]], [[religion]], or [[Spiritual Paths|spiritual paths]] of people. What exactly is tossed in the bucket of &quot;pagan&quot; or &quot;paganism&quot; and what is not tossed in varies on who is using the word. One thing that is never tossed in the bucket is the core beliefs of the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism).

I agree. The article seems to have been written by someone who has confused Heathen and Pagan. 'Pagan' as a term to denote non-christian religions is an archaic and ignorant (ie Christian) usage of the word. The few pagans I have met have a set of beliefs, attitudes and practices which mark them out as one distinct group. Pagan is not a catch-all term for non biblical religions.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚ÄîPreceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.104.106.214|88.104.106.214]] ([[User talk:88.104.106.214|talk]]) 07:17, 17 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:There's nothing wrong with using &quot;Pagan&quot; as a technical term for &quot;non-Christian&quot;. The fact that it is a very old usage, doesn't make it incorrect. Nor is it clear why it is &quot;ignorant&quot; to use it (since that is what it meant originally). The fact that some modern groups have picked up the word and used it to label their own religious practices (which they of course have every right to do) doesn't somehow forbid Christians from using the word in its older sense, at least when its clear from context what is meant. The use of the term in Christian discourse is a useful reminder that non-Christians are not the enemy of the Church, but rather non-combatants (&quot;paganus&quot; = civilian in Tertullian's usage). [[User:Francis Davey|Francis Davey]] ([[User talk:Francis Davey|talk]]) 09:53, 31 December 2010 (UTC)
:: Tertullian was writing when the empire was still &quot;pagan&quot; and indeed at this time it was expedient to regard those who were not in the &quot;army of Christ&quot; as civilians. When Christianity gained the political uperhand through the shift introduced by Constantine the sentiment changed rapidly to regarding those who were not in the army of Christ as being in the army of satan, albeit with dispensations for Jews whom they reluctantly accepted as worshipping imperfectly the same god. For the greater part of the history of Christianity paganism meant demon worship and it is only in comparatively recent times that toleration has been extended to non-Abrhamic religions. Many modern pagans quite happily describe themselves as pagans in order to indicate they do not worship the deity described in the bible and some do so because they consider the attributes of that god evil.

== Pagan or pagan? ==

A couple of recent edits here have addressed this problem and I've tried to be very precise in my latest. I have left (or re-inserted) a capital P for Pagan or Paganism when it seems to be referring to an organised religious movement or member thereof. However sometimes pagan is just used as an ordinary adjective, and paganism is being referred to very loosely - eg in the same breath as shamanism and polytheism, which are not capitalised.

This argument is like the one we had at [[Wicca]] over gods and goddesses versus the God and the Goddess: I'd like to think we can agree a way forward collaboratively. What do others think? [[User:Kim Dent-Brown|&lt;font face=&quot;century gothic&quot;  color=&quot;#0E6E2D&quot;&gt;Kim Dent-Brown&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Kim Dent-Brown|&lt;font face=&quot;century gothic&quot; size=&quot;1&quot; color=&quot;#0E6E2D&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(Talk)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:15, 16 May 2011 (UTC)

:Personally, my take is that 'pagan' shouldn't be capitalised.  While I agree that the names of specific religions should always carry a capital (Christianity, Islam, Asatru), broad religious categories shouldn't (monotheism, deism, agnosticism).  I suppose it's debatable whether a 'religious movement' - which I'd view as a looser grouping than 'a religion' - should be capitalised: would you say 'creationism' or 'Creationism'?  Would you say 'Millennialism' or 'millennialism'?  Or 'Dispensationalism' or 'dispensationalism'?
:The general principle seems to be that nouns in general don't carry a capital, unless they're being used to describe a single specific object.  So we say 'a galaxy' but 'the Galaxy' when we're referring specifically to our own.  Many prime ministers have run the UK, but the Prime Minister is David Cameron (as I write, anyway).
:I would say that 'paganism' is more an umbrella term than it is a specific religion: a Wiccan, for example, might consider themselves pagan, but s/he believes completely different things from an adherent of the Roman 'Cultus Deorum' - though the latter is also a pagan religion.  In fact, if you take the broad view, it's difficult to see just what factors all pagans have in common.  Certainly, there is no specific religion called 'Paganism', which would warrant a capital letter, and I think if we use a capital we risk misleading readers into thinking that there is.  My vote would be for lower-case. - [[User:Silvensis|Silvensis]] ([[User talk:Silvensis|talk]]) 10:53, 17 May 2011 (UTC)

We are talking of two different meanings of the same word, one a proper noun, the other not.

When used as an adjective describing a type of religion or a people, rather than a noun labeling a faith, then the lower-case &quot;pagan&quot; is appropriate.

However, I counter Silvensis's above arguments with a comparative analogue: Catholic, Mormon, Episcopalian, and Baptist are all specific faiths with clearly identifiable distinctions between them, but collectively &quot;christianity&quot; is too broad of a term to be capitalized as a proper noun because it is not referencing a specific religious tradition.  None of you would accept that, and I reject the same.  Certainly, Paganism is a broad family of various religions who share similar elements, the term is, in modern usage, equally justified in distinction as Christianity, Islam, or Buddhism.  Wicca, Druidry, Stregheria, and Asatru are all distinct faiths clearly identifiable from one another, but each of them are Pagan traditions in the same vein that Sunni, Shia, and Sufi are each distinct traditions of Islam.

Generally speaking, I would suspect that the older the subject matter, the more likely that &quot;pagan&quot; be the proper term.  If for no other reason than when referencing history in this manner, you'll be describing the subject peoples more specifically than their faiths. As the article turns more modern (late-medieval period and later) the terminology will change because the people, previously described, no longer exist as they had prior to the mass conversions of the Catholic Church.  By this period, any reference to &quot;pagan&quot; would most likely be directly identifying beliefs (or belief systems), rather than an adjective, and thus should be capitalized.

== Abrahamic Religions ==
There seems little here on the discoveries that these religions were formed from polytheism; and indeed Christianity still has the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost for example. It seems to be biased towards the Abrahamic religions as being the right religions. [[Special:Contributions/92.20.126.238|92.20.126.238]] ([[User talk:92.20.126.238|talk]]) 07:03, 1 June 2011 (UTC)
: The theories relating to this indeed may be worthy of note and go back a long time. The Jews of [[Elephantine]] did appear to worship Yahweh and his consorts and I know some scholars regard the &quot;strong&quot; monotheism of scriptures as an attempt by a ruling religious elite to suppress and enforce their version of orthodoxy. As has been pointed out the use of such terms as &quot;monotheism&quot; and &quot;polytheism&quot; is a projecting back into a time categories where strictly they have no place. Many ancient cultures could and did believe in divine unity in plurality and this continues today. To ask the question &quot;Were X polytheists or monotheists?&quot; is like asking &quot;is a photon a particle or a wave?&quot;. Expect article inflation if you do add anything about this as you will have the &quot;orthodox&quot; filling the page with their refutations.

== Derogatory ==

&quot;Paganism is a derogatory term used by certain religions in an attempt to diminish competing religions by grouping those religions under a single believed abstraction. Since it is much simpler to diminish a single abstract religion than a plethora of small complicated religions, the term has been used quite often as a rally and justification for religious wars and in various religious sermons to identify &quot;non-believers&quot;. In other words, there has never been a religion called paganism nor has there ever been a person who calls them self a pagan, there is no pagan bible. It is often used to show a lack of respect for another religions.&quot;

I realize this is a religious page probably run by religious people, but be fair. Paganism is nothing more than a christian construct. What I state above it true, stop deleting it.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚Äî Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/199.197.2.156|199.197.2.156]] ([[User talk:199.197.2.156|talk]]) 17:41, 27 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::Well, maybe it's just me with eyes on the page at the moment! So here's my view (apologies for its bluntness). I think the new paragraph greatly worsens the article, is poorly written, displays a controversial [[WP:POV|point of view]] with no [[WP:RS|sources]] and is out of line with the rest of the article. Most of it comes across as [[WP:OR|original research]] - eg the unsourced assertion that &quot;''nor has there ever been a person who calls them self a pagan''&quot;. There are thousands of people in the UK alone (about 50,000) who described themselves as pagans in the last Census conducted in 2001, and referred to in the published data from that study.

::I quite accept that for early Christians (as the article makes clear) ''pagan'' was used as a derogatory term but we are not living in the period of early Christianity now. The term ''classical paganism'' is well attested as a neutral way of describing Roman and Hellenic religious culture, and modern pagans use the term proudly. 

::As the [[WP:LEAD|manual of style]] for lead paragraphs makes clear, material in the lead paragraph needs to be consistent with the rest of the article and reflect and summarise it fairly. In particular, if any part of the lead is controversial it needs sourcing just as any other part of the article.

::There are some small elements of the paragraph that I don't disagree with: eg &quot;''there has never been a religion called paganism''&quot; and ''&quot;there is no pagan bible&quot;''. But on the whole I can't see this paragraph as an improvement and I'm going to delete it again. While I am not one for edit wars, (and I restrict myself to 1RR except in the case of clear vandalism, which this is not), I can't sit back and watch the article deteriorate in this way. If the IP chooses to restore the paragraph then I won't revert again today, but I will contact other editors who have been active here to try and generate more discussion.

:::I agree with you. There are clearly a number of people who describe themselves as pagans, and I will delete this if it's restored, if for no other reason that it is unsourced and doesn't follow our guidelines for a lead.

== Peasant? ==


&quot;Peasant&quot; is a cognate, via Old French paisent.[12]&quot; seems to contradict what's on the [Peasant] page, and the citation page seems to have gone away.

== Cross-language etymology sourcing ==

The pre-Christian use of the word &quot;pagan&quot; fascinates me from the cross-language point of view. In the Czech language, the pagan is &quot;pohan&quot; and means the same as in English. However, there is a region in southern Moravia called &quot;Pohansko&quot; and also one called &quot;Han√°&quot;. I saw an ancient map, where much larger region of S. Moravia was called &quot;Ganna&quot;. In Norwegian language, &quot;po&quot; could mean location, as PoGanna could be &quot;located on Ganna&quot;. Realizing that most English speaking contributors don't speak Czech, I would like to enhance this dimension. Considering Ganna could be the ancient land of plenty (as the herds of wolly mammoths, aurochs and European bisons and other large game migrated through this region on annual basis), many connotations could be connected to this land. Of course Hana and Ganna I consider interchangeable through the ages. Pohan/pagan could be at first the person living &quot;on Ganna&quot;. Later it could be used by Latin as country dweller. There is another country lying nearby with name starting with Po/pa: Panonia, today largely forgotten land, because it's called Hungary nowadays. Also there are legends of Rihanna, who could be the Queen of Hanna from the way the word is structured (Ri being for Rex). I would love to research this further with someone who knows the other side...  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;‚Äî Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Alarixus|Alarixus]] ([[User talk:Alarixus|talk]] ‚Ä¢ [[Special:Contributions/Alarixus|contribs]]) 12:07, 12 March 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:This really isn't an approriate venue for such research, you need a forum or something. Are you aware of [[WP:VERIFY]], {{WP:RS]] and [[WP:NOR]]? [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 14:39, 12 March 2012 (UTC)

== Should Hinduism/Buddhism be listed into Paganism? ==

According to the context of [[Paganism]], religions other than [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] are considered Pagan. If so, I'd like to propose an article advancement -presenting details on available Non-Abrahamic religions, namely [[Hinduism]] for its [[Idolatry|Idol worship]].

Should we also be focusing into [[Central Asia|Central Asian]] perspective, namely [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] for their [[Devil]] like figure Worshiping, needs a general consensus? If we expert editors agree to it, then it is our duty to advance the article on every pagan considered religion accessible to our understanding.

My concern is not biased, or in opposition to any religion or beliefs. It is a probability, which needs general consent from fellow Wiki Editors and Contributors. I'd also make an adamant point, that the elaboration to be in accordance to in-depth and authentic research, and not to be infiltrating any widely practiced Gods or Religious Beliefs.

Let us all know your feedback??

:Sounds reasonable. Though a line might be drawn between what are &quot;technically&quot; Pagans (Hindu, [[Animism|Animists]], Buddhists), and what are pagans in the &quot;classical&quot; sense of the word.
