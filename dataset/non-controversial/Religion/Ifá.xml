'''Ifá''' refers to the system of [[divination]] and the verses of the literary corpus known as the Odú Ifá. [[Yoruba religion]] identifies [[Orunmila]] as the Grand Priest; as that which revealed Oracle divinity to the world. Such is his association with the Oracle divinity; in some instances, the term &quot;Orunmila&quot; is used interchangeably with Ifá.

Originating in [[West Africa]] in the form of a stringent [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] philosophy; celebrated in [[traditional African medicine]], [[Santería]] (referred to as [[Lucumi religion|Lukumi]]), [[Candomblé]], West African &amp; Diaspora [[West African Vodun|Vodou]], and similarly in [[Orisa]]'Ifa lineages all over the globe.

==Yorùbá canon==

In the [[Yoruba religion]], [[divination]] gives priests unreserved access to the teachings of [[Orunmila]]. [[Eshu|Esu]], is seen as being in charge of justice and order and the transportation of ebos. Esu is the one said to lend authority (''ase'') to the oracle during provision of direction and or clarification of counsel. Esu is also the one that holds the keys to ones [[Ire]] (blessings), thus acts as Oluwinni (ones Creditor), he can grant Ire or remove it [http://www.ogbeogunda.alawoye.com read more about this Yoruba concept of Oluwinni here]. Ifa divination rites are claimed to provide an avenue of communication to the [[Spirit|spiritual realm]] and the intent of ones [[destiny]].

==Togo canon==

In [[Togo]], Ifá is known as '''Afa''', where the Vodou deities come through and speak. In many of their Egbes,  it is ''Alaundje''  who is honored as the first Bokono to have been taught how to divine the destiny of humans using the holy system of Afa.

==International recognition==
The Ifa Divination system was added in 2005 by [[UNESCO]] to its list of the &quot;[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]&quot;.

==Divination==

Performing Ifa divination is called Ifa dida or idafa (ounte ale).&lt;ref&gt;Chief S. Solagbade Popoola, [http://alawoye.com/Ifa_Orunmila_%3A_Alawoye/Ifa_Book_News_%26_Reviews/Entries/2008/6/1_Ifa_Didaa_-_Ifa_Consultation_for_the_Beginner_%26_Professional_.html Ifa Dida Volume One (EjiOgbe - Orangun Meji)], Library, INC  ISBN 978-0-9810013-1-9&lt;/ref&gt; Ifa dida / Idafa is performed by a Babalawo or Iyalawo or iyanifa (an initiated priest or priestess). ''Babalawo'' can be translated as &quot;father of the secrets&quot; while &quot;Iyalawo&quot; {mother of secret}  or sometimes &quot;Iyanifa&quot; means &quot;mother that has Ifa(i.e. its blessing)&quot;. The babalawo or iyanifa provides insights about the current circumstances impacting the life of a person requesting this information and provides any necessary information to aid the individual. Awo is a reference for devotees in Orisa worship. It includes Babalawos, Iyalawo, Iyanifas, Babalorishas, Iyalorishas and even uninitiated devotees. Traditionally, women have not been initiated into Ifa priesthood, according to the teaching which allows them only a single Ikin. In the USA a small sect of worshipers has initiated women into Ifa. These initiations are however only recognized by that group.

===Occasions===

Ifa divination (also called consultation) is performed for many proposes and a host of occasions, the purposes and occasions is what determines the instrument used in the divination sessions. Divination is often performed for lesser reasons such as &quot;regular check up&quot; to life-changing occasions such as marriage or child birthing etc., divination can also be performed for a group (small / large) or community (the first examples are more likely for a person, couple, parents or family). On occasion when it is performed for the community or society it takes on another significance. Below we will list and discuss major occasions divination is performed and give some feedback and examples of each, in application and practice.

* Annual Divination for the New Year - one occasion where a major divination is performed and the ranking Ifa Priest are present to witness and partake. This is called the divination of the new year, which is also sometimes referred to as the First Yam Festival (for ancient annual agricultural cycles). For the current year 2012 / 2013 (the Yoruba year begins early June for a 12 month cycle), is the holy Odu Ifa Ogbe Ogunda (alias Ogbe Iyonu/ OgbeYonu / OgbeYono and Ogbe Suuru etc. each alias has special meaning). The results of such a divination will be discussed and analyzed by the ranking Ifa Priest, shared with the Ooni (the ruling King of Yoruba People), and shared with the extended community. [http://www.oduyear.alawoye.com To read more about the governing Odu for 2012 &amp; 2013, click here].

* Establishing a new town or settlement, is another reason Ifa is cast to know more about that towns living principals and parameters etc. An example can be found in IrosunMeji.

* Mate selection - (or courting) a potential partner, several examples will be posted shortly.

* Esentaye (new born baby rites) - Also called Ikosedaye, is another major occasion to consult Ifa for direction and advice

* Burial rites

* Planning a new business or enterprise etc.

===Etiquette===

Initiation into Ifa requires rigorous study. A Babalawo must learn and understand each of the 256 chapters (Odu) of Ifa. The minimum of four verses will of necessity include ebos and ooguns (medicine) that are embedded and relevant to each of the verses, plus other issues that complement divination. An accomplished Babalawo must know about ten verses of each of the 256 chapters of Ifa (256 Odu Ifa). Regardless of gender, whoever aspires to practice Ifa must have this qualification. In essence, Ifa practice does not preclude a woman provided such woman acquires the required qualification. 
Odu — a special Orisa — can only be received by a Babalawo who decides to perform the special initiation that will allow him access to Odu. In essence, initiation into Ifa is the first step towards initiation into Odu. A woman cannot be initiated into Odu. This is because since she already has a womb, she has no need to receive Odu. It can be said to be redundant.
Character Traits of an Awo: Orunmila demands humility from his priests and priestesses, therefore, a Babalawo should be an embodiment of patience, good character, honesty, and humility.

On the other hand, in Cuba and parts of Nigeria such as Ode Remo, Ijebuland and Ibadan (and Ile Ife up until at least 1992), the position of the Iyanifa as a divining priestess of Ifa is hotly contested on the grounds that in the Ifa Odus Ogunda Ka, Irete Intelu and Oshe Yekun, no one can become a full Awo Ifa without the presence of Odun, and in the Odu Ifa Irete Ntelu (Irete Ogbe), Odun herself says that she would only marry [[Orunmila]] if he promised not to permit women to be in the same room as her. Also, Dr. Ikulomi Djisovi Eason reports that in Ile Ife, widely considered Ifá's capital among traditional Yoruba, did not initiate women as late as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;4. Eason, Ikulomi Djisovi. Historicizing Ifá Culture in Oyotunji African Village. Orisa Devotion. 2008. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; These views appear to be confirmed by books published in Nigeria as far back as the 19th century. For instance, the eminent Yoruba author [[James Johnson (Reverend)|James Johnson]] wrote in one of the most detailed early descriptions of Ifa that &quot;Whenever this should be the case, a woman would receive from a Babalawo only one Ikin or Consecrated Palm nut called Eko, which she would carry about her body for her protection, and whenever divination should recommend and prescribe to her sacrifice to Ifa, she would, for the time being, hand over her Eko either to her husband or to her brother, or any other male relative according to prescription, who would include it in his own Ikins for the purpose of the worship and sacrifice in which she would participate.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, James. ''Yoruba Heathenism''. Exeter: J. Townsend Press, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; William Bascom, the foremost academic authority on Ifa up until the time of his death, also stated that &quot;only men can become babalawo&quot; and that he never encountered a single female Ifa priest acting as a diviner during any of his extensive field studies in the cities of Ife, Igana, Meko, Oyo, Ilesa, Abeokuta, Osogbo, Sagamu, Ilara, Ondo, Ijebu Ode or Ekiti in Yorubaland in 1937-38, 1950–51, in 1960 and 1965, nor did any of his informants mention such a thing.&lt;ref&gt;Bascom, Dr. William. 'Ifa Divination: Communication Between Gods and Men in West Africa''. Bloomington Indiana: Indiana University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Sources from [[Yorubaland]] going back to the mid-19th century clearly state that only men can become Ifa diviners.&lt;ref&gt;Religious Encounter and the Making of the Yoruba, by John Peel. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that any woman's womb is the equivalent of Odu, the force that created the universe, is not a tenable one to traditionalists. This is the theological equivalent to a man who might want to claim to be a Babalawo without initiation due to the virtue of having male genitalia as does the Orisha Orunmila.

Apetebi is a title given to the wife of a Babalawo. Apetebi is the name Orunmila gave to his wife, whom he cured from leprosy before giving birth to his child. This is from the Sacred Odu Ifa Obara Ogunda. 

Iyanifa is the title of an initiated female priestess of IFA, but can mean several other things as well depending on region and tradition.

===Process===
[[File:Jogo de Ikin Orossi.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Tray and palm nuts]]
Special instruments are used to assist in the [[divination]] to transcribe [[Orunmila]]'s wisdom through the diviner. The items used for divination include:
* a group of sixteen [[Oil palm|Ikin]], commonly known as sacred palm nuts, which are used to create ancient [[Binary file|binary]] data
* Dust from the [[Irosun]] tree (Iyerosun)
* a vessel for the seeds (Ajere Ifa)
* a divination tray (''Opon Ifa'').
* a tapper instrument (''Iroke Ifa'')
* a [[fly whisk]] (Irukere Ifa)
* beaded belts for the ''babalawo''/''iyanifa'' to wear (this is not required)
** another form of divination is with the Opele, though Ikin is considered superior
* Ifa dida, meaning Ifa consultation/divination also sometimes mistakenly referred to as Dafa
* Odù (see Odù Ifá below) revelation (one of possible 256 combinations) and the oral recitation - consultation (ese Ifa)
* the &quot;prescription&quot; or advice of what is needed at this particular junction of life. It is believed that ebo (ritual) &amp; bibo (appeasement rites) fit into a category referred to as Ọwọ̀n&lt;ref name=&quot;Owonrin&quot;&gt;[http://ifaspeaks.blogspot.com/2011/01/owonrin-meji-owon-necessity-is-mother.html Ọwọ̀nrín:  Necessity is the mother of Invention]&lt;/ref&gt; (necessity) of Odù Ifá;  Ọwọ̀nrín Méjí,&lt;ref name=&quot;Owonrin&quot;/&gt; this &quot;necessity or void&quot; once filled is what the deities will use in bringing ones prayers into fruition.
* Ifa divination process of &quot;prescription&quot; is organized in three segments in a specific order 1) Ifa Dida (divination) 2) Ebo (ritual rites) 3) Oogun (medicine or healing)

The (opon Ifa) or tray and (iroke Ifa) or tapper are used in Ifa divination, a central ritual within Ifa tradition. This tray, adorned with carved images and dusted with powder, serves as the template on which sacred signs (''odu'') related to the personal concerns of a diviner's client are traced as the point of departure for analysis. In contrast to those transitory signs, the more permanent backdrop of the carved motifs on the tapper and tray constitutes an artistic [[exegesis]] of the forces that shape human experience and the universal needs fulfilled by such quests for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].

To initiate the [[ritual]], the ''[[babalawo]]''/''iyanifa'' places the tray in front of him and taps rhythmically on it with the pointed end of the tapper, invoking the presence of Orunmila, past diviners, and other Orisa. 

There are a variety of Ikin (sacred palm nuts) that are available, but only four &quot;eyes&quot; ikin must be used for ifa divination. The Ikin (sacred palm nuts) are grouped in one hand, then the diviner attempts to shift them all to his/her other hand at once, and counts the remaining Ikin left, hopefully to discover that either one or two remain. (Odu, which are the foundation of the binary data, can only be marked with either one or two palm nuts, remaining in the diviner's original hand. As this process goes on, the diviner marks single or double marks in wood powder spread on his divination tray until he or she has created one of the 256 ''odu'' that are available.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Bascom: ''Ifa Divination: Communication Between Gods and Men in West Africa'' ISBN 0-253-20638-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these ''odu'' is associated with a traditional set of Ese (poetic tutorials), often relating to [[Yoruba religion]], which explain their divinatory meaning. These tutorials represent thousands of years of observation and are filled with predictions, and both mundane and spiritual prescriptions that resolve issues found in that Odu. Within Ifa, Believers find all the knowledge of the world past, present. and future.

After obtaining the Odu that governs a situation or event, the diviner then determines whether the Odu comes with Ire (signifies good outcome; good times; good news; good luck; e.t.c) or Ibi (which could be viewed as obstacles or impediments to success). After this process the diviner now determines appropriate offerings, spiritual disciplines and/or behavioral changes that are Ọwọ̀n - necessary to bring, keep or compel success for the person receiving divinatory counsel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owonrin&quot;/&gt;

==Odù Ifá==

There are sixteen major books in Odu Ifa&lt;ref&gt;[http://alawoye.com/Ifa_Orunmila_%3A_Alawoye/Ifa_Book_News_%26_Reviews/Ifa_Book_News_%26_Reviews.html Sixteen major 'books in Odù Ifá]&lt;/ref&gt; literary corpus. When combined there are total of 256 Odu&lt;ref name=&quot;Iwori&quot;/&gt; (a collection of sixteen, each of which has sixteen alternatives ⇔ 16^2, or 4^4) believed to reference all situations, circumstances, actions and consequences in life based on the uncountable ese (poetic tutorials) relative to the 256 Odu coding. These form the basis of traditional Yoruba spiritual knowledge and are the foundation of all Yoruba divination systems.

Where I is an odd count or a &quot;heads&quot; result, and II is an even count or a &quot;tails&quot; result, the sixteen basic patterns and their Yoruba names are set forth in the sidebar (this is only one way of ordering them, this changes depending on area within Nigeria, or the diaspora.  An alternative order used in Ibadan, and Cuba is: Ejiogbe, Oyekun meji, Iwori Meji, Idi Meji, Irosun Meji, Oworin Meji, Obara Meji, Okanran Meji, Ogunda Meji, Osa Meji, Ika Meji, Oturupon Meji, Otura Meji, Irete Meji, Oshe Meji, Ofun Meji. Heepa Odu!  This is important to note as it changes the outcomes of certain parts of the reading).

The ''babalawo'' recites a series of poems with proverbs and stories from the Ifa poetry that go with that choice. The final interpretation is made by the person seeking guidance, who decides how the verses that the ''babalawo'' has recited should be applied to the problem at hand. (This may be one style, however other schools of thought with Ifa have the Diviner interpreting what Ifa says and not simply chanting and leaving it to the client) Though the number of symbols is different, the [[China|Chinese]] [[I Ching]] divination system also bears some resemblance to Ifa divination. Like the I Ching, Ifa combines a large body of [[wisdom literature]] with a system for selecting the appropriate passages from it. Unlike the I Ching, however, Ifa poetry is not written down but passed down orally from one ''babalawo'' to another. Today, there are many texts that are designed to help Babalawos to learn and retain the huge corpus of knowledge.

==Belief==

Believers deem Ifa as being nothing but the &quot;truth&quot;; functioning to the devoted as not only a system of guidance, but one that fuses way of living with the psychological, providing them with a legitimate course of action that is genuine and unequivocal.

*'''Ayafa'''. this wife is often &quot;married&quot; to the Ifa of a Babalawo and can also be married to another man, or even a female child before marriage age or the girl child of a Babalawo who by &quot;marrying&quot; to Ifa, this is a symbolic ceremony and will convey certain blessing and protection to the female.
*'''Itefa, Itelodu, Elegan''' are different degrees of the [[initiation]] process. It is the ritual of performing one's initiation or [[rite of passage]], to determine one's purpose or [[destiny]]. It is important to note that performing ''Itefa'' alone does not make one a [[Babalawo]] or [[Iyanifa]]; Itefa is one of many steps of apprenticeship to become a Babalawo (a diviner/healer/counsellor). Itefa is the initiation into Ifa generally. ''Itelodu'', which is the complete and most comprehensive, is the Ifa initiation which has the presence of the mysteries of [[Odu]] and also involves the process of stepping of &quot;Oke Ipori&quot; at a specially-prepared space with Opa Osun called &quot;Ojuore&quot;, which represents and re-enacts the boundary between heaven and earth – the location where each person chooses &quot;Ipin&quot; to fine-tune, as a way of being aligned while ''elegan'' (not done everywhere in Nigeria) is a type of  Itefa without the mysteries of Odu and Oju Ore.
*'''Ifá'''. Is the word of [[Olodumare]] encompassing all knowledge of things past, present and future. It is sometimes used interchangeably as the name for the orisha deity [[Orunmila]]. Orunmila is the orisha of wisdom and knowledge, who created the system and method for accessing the knowledge of Ifa; and so during the ritual of divination a &quot;client&quot; is said to &quot;consult Ifà&quot;. *'''D'afa''' or more appropriately ''Ifa dida'', is the name of the divination ritual itself where one accesses specific verses in the Odu Ifá (the Yoruba sacred texts) given to the priest through arrangements of the sacred palm nuts cast in divination.
*'''Igbadun Ifá'''. [[Igbadun Ifa]] &amp; [[Igbadun Olodumare]], are principals within Ifa thought, the importance of showing Gratitude (also sometimes called Itenilorun - Gratefulness). Within each structured ese (stanza) of Ifa, the matter of Igbadun is mentioned. First from client to Diviner, Diviner to Orunmila, Orunmila to Olodumare etc. [http://www.Igbadun.alawoye.com (more on Igbadun/Itenilorun here)]
*'''[[Iwa]]''' (character) is one of or perhaps the most important human endeavor taught within Ifa literary corpus and every Ifa [[stanza]] (or verse) has one portion dedicated to the issue of teaching the Iwa (character or behaviour) that Ifa supports. This Iwa, which Ifa teaches transcends religious doctrine, is central to every human being, and imparts communal, social and civic responsibility that the Creator ([[Olodumare]]) supports. Central to this, is the theme of [[righteousness]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Iwori&quot;&gt;Ifa speaks, [http://ifaspeaks.blogspot.com/2011/02/odu-ifa-iwori-meji-ifa-speaks-on.html Iwòrì Méjì: Righteousness], february, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and practicing good moral behaviour, not seeking for it in the community but becoming an ambassador of Iwa.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;
''Ifá invest with me,''&lt;br /&gt;
''As Éjìwòrì invested interest in his protégée,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Ifá smile upon me,''.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

==Names==
Ifa priests, devotees, celebrants and believers sometimes inherit names related to the divinity; typically, but not necessarily, beginning with the term ‘Ifa’, like Ifadairo, Ifabiyi, Ifadare, Ifabunmi, etc. The first &quot;I&quot; in these names may be omitted to form Fadairo, Fabiyi, Fadare, Fabunmi, Falola, etc. The prefix &quot;Awo&quot; is also used in names ascribing Ifa or the fellowship - Awolalu, Awodele, Awolowo, Awosika, etc. Same applies to Odu, with Odufora, Odutola, Odugbemi etc.
