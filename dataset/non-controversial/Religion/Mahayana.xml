'''Mahāyāna''' ({{lang-sa|महायान}} ''mahāyāna'',  literally the &quot;Great Vehicle&quot;)&lt;!--Please do not insert other languages as the term Mahayana derives from Sanskrit and not any other languages. --&gt; is one of the two main existing branches of [[Buddhism]] and a term for classification of [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosophies]] and practice. Mahāyāna Buddhism originated in [[India]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated38&quot;&gt;Keown, Damien (2003), ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'': p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with the oldest historical sect of Buddhism, the [[Mahāsāṃghika]].&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. ''Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations.'' 1999. p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 65-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Jane, and Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Volume 2.'' 2005. p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mahāyāna tradition is the larger of the two major traditions of Buddhism existing today, the other being that of the [[Theravada|Theravāda]] school. According to the teachings of Mahāyāna traditions, &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; also refers to the path of seeking complete enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings, also called &quot;Bodhisattvayāna&quot;, or the &quot;[[Bodhisattva]] Vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Mahayana, 'Great Vehicle' or 'Great Carriage' (for carrying all beings to nirvana), is also, and perhaps more correctly and accurately, known as the Bodhisattvayana, the bodhisattva's vehicle.&quot; - Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of its history, Mahāyāna Buddhism spread from India to various other Asian countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Mongolia]]. Major traditions of Mahāyāna Buddhism today include [[Zen|Zen/Chán]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], [[Tiantai]], and [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]], as well as the [[Esoteric Buddhism|Esoteric Buddhist]] traditions of [[Shingon]], [[Tendai]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

==Etymology==

According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) was originally an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'' (&quot;[[Bodhisattva]] Vehicle&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174&quot;&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; — the vehicle of a bodhisattva seeking [[buddhahood]] for the benefit of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated38&quot;/&gt; The term ''Mahāyāna'' was therefore formed independently at an early date as a synonym for the path and the teachings of the bodhisattvas. Since it was simply an honorary term for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', the creation of the term ''Mahāyāna'' and its application to Bodhisattvayāna did not represent a significant turning point in the development of a Mahāyāna tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174&quot;/&gt;

The earliest Mahāyāna texts often use the term ''Mahāyāna'' as a synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', but the term ''[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]'' is comparatively rare in the earliest sources. The presumed dichotomy between ''Mahāyāna'' and ''Hīnayāna'' can be deceptive, as the two terms were not actually formed in relation to one another in the same era.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest and most important references to the term ''Mahāyāna'' are those that occur in the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'' (Skt. ''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra'') dating between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Ven. Dr. W. Rahula, [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha125.htm ''Theravada - Mahayana Buddhism'']&lt;/ref&gt; Seishi Karashima has suggested that the term first used in an earlier [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhāri]] [[Prakrit]] version of the ''Lotus Sūtra'' was not the term ''mahāyāna'' but the Prakrit word ''mahājāna'' in the sense of ''mahājñāna'' (great knowing).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3. The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism.'' Routledge. 2004. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later stage when the early Prakrit word was converted into Sanskrit, this ''mahājāna'', being phonetically ambivalent, was mistakenly converted into ''mahāyāna'', possibly due to what may have been a double meaning in the famous [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Parable of the Burning House]], which talks of three vehicles or carts (Skt: ''yāna'').&lt;ref&gt;I have assumed that, in the earliest stage of the transmission of ''the Lotus Sūtra'', the Middle Indic forn ''jāṇa'' or *''jāna'' (= Pkt &lt; Skt ''jñāna'', ''yāna'') had stood in these places ... I have assumed, further, that the Mahāyānist terms ''buddha-yānā'' (&quot;the Buddha-vehicle&quot;), ''mahāyāna'' (&quot;the great vehicle&quot;), ''hīnayāna'' (&quot;the inferior vehicle&quot;) meant originally ''buddha-jñāna'' (&quot;buddha-knowledge&quot;), ''mahājñāna'' (&quot;great knowledge&quot;) and ''hīnajñāna'' (&quot;inferior knowledge&quot;). Karashima, Seishi (2001). Some Features of the Language of the Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra, ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 44: 207-230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3. The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism.'' Routledge. 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Early statue of the Buddha from [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]], 1st&amp;ndash;2nd century CE.]]
===Origins===
Some of the earliest Mahayana sutras, the [[Prajnaparamita Sutras]], were written in response to [[Abhidharma|Abhidharma's]] ultrarealism.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. p.94&lt;/ref&gt; 

The origins of Mahāyāna are still not completely understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 260&quot;&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Western views of Mahāyāna assumed that it existed as a separate school in competition with the so-called &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; schools. Due to the veneration of buddhas and bodhisattvas, Mahāyāna was often interpreted as a more devotional, lay-inspired form of Buddhism, with supposed origins in [[stupa|stūpa]] veneration,&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (1993), ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Sakyamuni to Early Mahayana'': p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; or by making parallels with the history of the European [[Protestant Reformation]]. These views have been largely dismissed in modern times in light of a much broader range of early texts that are now available.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism''&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest Mahāyāna texts often depict strict adherence to the path of a bodhisattva, and engagement in the ascetic ideal of a monastic life in the wilderness, akin to the ideas expressed in the ''[[Rhinoceros Sutra|Rhinoceros Sūtra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As scholars have moved away from this limited corpus, and have begun to explore a wider range of Mahayana sūtras, they have stumbled on, and have started to open up, a literature that is often stridently ascetic and heavily engaged in reinventing the forest ideal, an individualistic, antisocial, ascetic ideal that is encapsulated in the apparently resurrected image of “wandering alone like a rhinoceros.” ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; The old views of Mahāyāna as a separate lay-inspired and devotional sect are now largely dismissed as misguided and wrong on all counts.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One of the most frequent assertions about the Mahayana ... is that it was a lay-influenced, or even lay-inspired and dominated, movement that arose in response to the increasingly closed, cold, and scholastic character of monastic Buddhism. This, however, now appears to be wrong on all counts.&quot; ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest textual evidence of &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; comes from sūtras originating around the beginning of the common era. Jan Nattier has noted that in some of the earliest Mahāyāna texts such as the ''[[Ugrapariprccha Sutra|Ugraparipṛccha Sūtra]]'' use the term &quot;Mahāyāna&quot;, yet there is no doctrinal difference between Mahāyāna in this context and the early schools, and that &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; referred rather to the rigorous emulation of [[Gautama Buddha]] in the path of a bodhisattva seeking to become a fully enlightened buddha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194&quot;&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194&quot;/&gt; Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[Vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the [[early schools of Buddhism]], and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] ordination lineage in East Asia, and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] ordination lineage in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] who visited India in the 7th century CE, distinguishes Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Both adopt one and the same Vinaya, and they have in common the prohibitions of the five offences, and also the practice of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Those who venerate the bodhisattvas and read the Mahayana sūtras are called the Mahāyānists, while those who do not perform these are called the Hīnayānists.}}

Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mahāyāna comes from early Chinese translations of Mahāyāna texts. These Mahāyāna teachings were first propagated into [[China]] by [[Lokaksema|Lokakṣema]], the first translator of Mahāyāna sūtras into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] during the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;China 2004, page 492&quot;&gt;&quot;The most important evidence — in fact the only evidence — for situating the emergence of the Mahayana around the beginning of the common era was not Indian evidence at all, but came from China. Already by the last quarter of the 2nd century CE, there was a small, seemingly idiosyncratic collection of substantial Mahayana sutras translated into what Erik Zürcher calls 'broken Chinese' by an Indoscythian, whose Indian name has been reconstructed as Lokaksema.&quot; ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest Mahāyāna sūtras===

Some scholars{{Who|date=February 2012}} have traditionally considered the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras to include the very first versions of the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] series, along with texts concerning [[Aksobhya|Akṣobhya Buddha]], which were probably written down in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 263&quot;&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 263, 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The south (of India) was then vigorously creative in producing Mahayana Sutras&quot; – Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Some early Mahāyāna sūtras were translated by the [[Kushan|Kuṣāṇa]] monk [[Lokaksema|Lokakṣema]], who came to China from the kingdom of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]. His first translations to Chinese were made in the Chinese capital of [[Luoyang]] between 178 and 189 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;China 2004, page 492&quot;/&gt; Some Mahāyāna sūtras translated during the 2nd century CE include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 248-251&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''{{IAST|[[Infinite Life Sutra|Larger Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra]]}}''

# ''{{IAST|[[Lokānuvartana Sūtra]]}}''

Some of these were probably composed in the north of India in the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Thus scholars generally think that the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras were mainly composed in the south of India, and later the activity of writing additional scriptures was continued in the north.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The sudden appearance of large numbers of (Mahayana) teachers and texts (in North India in the second century AD) would seem to require some previous preparation and development, and this we can look for in the South.&quot; - Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the assumption that the presence of an evolving body of Mahāyāna scriptures implies the contemporaneous existence of distinct religious movement called &quot;Mahāyāna&quot;, may be a serious misstep.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;But even apart from the obvious weaknesses inherent in arguments of this kind there is here the tacit equation of a body of literature with a religious movement, an assumption that evidence for the presence of one proves the existence of the other, and this may be a serious misstep.&quot; - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest inscriptions===

The earliest stone inscription containing a recognizably Mahāyāna formulation and a mention of the Buddha Amitabha was found in the Indian subcontinent in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and dated to around 180 CE. Remains of a statue of a Buddha bear the [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] inscription: &quot;Made in the year 28 of the reign of king [[Huvishka]], ... for the Buddha [[Amitabha]]&quot; (Mathura Museum).

However, this image was in itself extremely marginal and isolated in the overall context of Buddhism in India at the time, and had no lasting or long-term consequences.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In other words, once nontextual evidence is taken into account the picture changes dramatically. Rather than being datable to the beginning of the common era, this strand of Mahayana Buddhism, at least, appeared to have no visible impact on Indian Buddhist cult practice until the 2nd century, and even then what impact it had was extremely isolated and marginal, and had no lasting or long-term consequences — there were no further references to Amitabha in Indian image inscriptions. Almost exactly the same pattern occurs (concerning Mahayana) on an even broader scale when nontextual evidence is considered.&quot; - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of the name &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; in Indian inscriptions in the period before the 5th century is very limited in comparison to the multiplicity of Mahāyāna writings transmitted from [[Central Asia]] to [[China]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Certainly, we have for this period an extensive body of inscriptions from virtually all parts of India. ... But nowhere in this extensive body of material is there any reference, prior to the fifth century, to a named Mahāyāna.&quot;, ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What is particularly disconcerting here is the disconnect between expectation and reality: We know from Chinese translations that large numbers of Mahāyāna sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century. But outside of texts, at least in India, at exactly the same period, very different — in fact seemingly older — ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behavior, and old and established Hinayana groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported.'', ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;

These views of a discrepancy between translated texts and epigraphical evidence assume the presence of Mahāyāna as distinct from the &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; schools. This view has been largely disproved in more recent scholarship{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, as Mahāyāna is now recognized as a tradition working within the context of the early Buddhist schools rather than as a separate movement.

===Early Mahāyāna Buddhism===
During the period of early Mahāyāna Buddhism, four major types of thought developed: [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]], [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], [[Tathagatagarbha|Buddha Nature]] (''Tathāgatagarbha''), and [[Buddhist Logic]] as the last and most recent.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 8,9&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahāyāna were the Mādhyamaka and the later Yogācāra.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1993). ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press: p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
Earlier stage forms of Mahāyāna such as the doctrines of Prajñāpāramitā, Yogācāra, Buddha Nature, and the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] teachings are still popular in East Asia. In some cases these have spawned new developments, while in others they are treated in the more traditional syncretic manner. Paul Williams has noted that in this tradition in the Far East, primacy has always been given to study of the sūtras.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Paul 1989 p.103&quot;&gt;Williams, Paul (1989). ''Mahayana Buddhism'': p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Mahāyāna Buddhism===
Late stage forms of Mahāyāna Buddhism in India are found largely in the schools of [[Esoteric Buddhism]]. These were replaced in India and Central Asia after the early millennium by Islam ([[Sufism]] etc.) and Hinduism, and in south-east Asia by Theravāda Buddhism from [[Sri Lanka]] and Islam. They continue to exist in certain regions of the Himalayas. In contrast to the East Asian traditions, there has been a strong tendency in Tibetan Buddhism and the Himalayan traditions to approach the sūtras indirectly through the medium of exegetical treatises if at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams, Paul 1989 p.103&quot;/&gt;

== Doctrine ==
[[File:Seated Buddha Amitabha statue.jpg|thumb|right|Amitābha Buddha statue from [[Borobodur]], [[Indonesia]].]]
Few things can be said with certainty about Mahāyāna Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There are, it seems, very few things that can be said with certainty about Mahayana Buddhism&quot;, ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; especially its early Indian form, other than that the Buddhism practiced in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, Tibet, and Japan is Mahāyāna Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;But apart from the fact that it can be said with some certainty that the Buddhism embedded in China, Korea, Tibet, and Japan is Mahayana Buddhism, it is no longer clear what else can be said with certainty about Mahayana Buddhism itself, and especially about its earlier, and presumably formative, period in India.&quot;, ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; Mahāyāna can be described as a loosely bound collection of many teachings with large and expansive doctrines that are able to coexist simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It has become increasingly clear that Mahayana Buddhism was never one thing, but rather, it seems, a loosely bound bundle of many, and — like Walt Whitman — was large and could contain, in both senses of the term, contradictions, or at least antipodal elements.&quot; - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahāyāna constitutes an inclusive tradition characterized by plurality and the adoption of new [[Mahayana sutra|Mahāyāna sūtras]] in addition to the earlier [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]] texts. Mahāyāna sees itself as penetrating further and more profoundly into the Buddha's [[Dharma]]. There is a tendency in Mahāyāna sūtras to regard adherence to these sūtras as generating spiritual benefits greater than those that arise from being a follower of the non-Mahāyāna approaches to Dharma. Thus the ''[[Srimala Sutra|Śrīmālādevī Sūtra]]'' claims that the Buddha said that devotion to Mahāyāna is inherently superior in its virtues to the following the [[Sravaka|śravaka]] or [[pratyekabuddha]] paths.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, Dr. Shenpen, trans. (1998). ''The Shrimaladevi Sutra''. Oxford: Longchen Foundation: p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental principles of Mahāyāna doctrine were based on the possibility of universal liberation from [[dukkha|suffering]] for all beings (hence the &quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) and the existence of buddhas and bodhisattvas embodying [[Buddha Nature]]. The Pure Land school of Mahāyāna simplify the expression of faith by allowing salvation to be alternatively obtained through the grace of the [[Amitābha]] Buddha by having faith and devoting oneself to [[nianfo|mindfulness of the Buddha]]. This devotional lifestyle of Buddhism has greatly contributed to the success of Mahāyāna in East Asia, where spiritual elements traditionally relied upon mindfulness of the Buddha, mantras and [[dharani|dhāraṇīs]], and reading of Mahāyāna sūtras. In Chinese Buddhism, most monks, let alone lay people, practice Pure Land, some combining it with [[Zen|Chán]] (Zen).&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1967). ''Practice of Chinese Buddhism''. Harvard: p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Mahāyāna schools believe in supernatural bodhisattvas who devote themselves to the [[paramita|perfections]] (Skt. ''pāramitā''), ultimate knowledge (Skt. ''sarvajñāna''), and the liberation of all sentient beings. In Mahāyāna, the Buddha is seen as the ultimate, highest being, present in all times, in all beings, and in all places, and the bodhisattvas come to represent the universal ideal of altruistic excellence.

===Universalism===
Mahāyāna traditions generally consider that attainment of the level of [[arhat]] is not final. This is based on a subtle doctrinal distinction between the Mahāyāna and some views contained in the [[early Buddhist schools]] concerning the issues of [[Nirvana|Nirvāṇa]] With Remainder and [[Parinirvana|Nirvāṇa Without Remainder]]. The Mahāyāna position here is similar to that of the early school of the [[Mahasanghika|Mahāsāṃghika]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

Some of the early schools considered that Nirvāṇa Without Remainder always follows Nirvāṇa With Remainder (Buddhas first achieve enlightenment and then, at &quot;death&quot;, [[mahaparinirvana|Mahāparinirvāṇa]]) and that Nirvāṇa Without Remainder is final; whereas the Mahāyāna traditions consider that Nirvāṇa Without Remainder is always followed by Nirvāṇa With Remainder{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} — the state of attainment of [[arhat]] is not considered final, and should be succeeded by [[Bodhisattva]]hood{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

This distinction is most evident regarding doctrinal concerns about the capability of a Buddha after [[nirvana|Nirvāṇa]], which is identified by the early schools as being Nirvāṇa Without Remainder. Amongst the early schools, a completely enlightened buddha (Skt. ''samyaksaṃbuddha'') is not able to directly point the way to Nirvāṇa after death. Some{{Who|date=August 2010}} Mahayana schools however, hold that once a [[Buddhahood|completely enlightened Buddha]] (Skt. ''samyaksaṃbuddha'') arises, he or she continues to directly and actively point the way to Nirvāṇa until there are no beings left in [[Samsara (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. Consequently, some Mahāyāna schools talk of a bodhisattva deliberately refraining from Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (1977). ''Hua-Yen Buddhism''. Pennsylvania State University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lotus Sutra]] states that Shakyamuni Buddha's parinirvana is an expedient, and that he actually remains in the world to teach and guide living beings.&lt;ref&gt;Lotus Sutra, Ch. 16, Lifespan of the Thus Come One&lt;/ref&gt; This is why [[Nichiren Buddhism]] regards Shakyamuni as the [[Eternal Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichiren the Buddhist Prophet, MASAHARU ANESAKI, p. 27, CAMBRIDGE
HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS (1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

The early schools held that [[Maitreya]] will be the next Buddha to rediscover the path to Nirvana, when teachings of [[Gautam Buddha]] are forgotten{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. In contrast, some Mahāyāna schools{{Who|date=August 2010}} hold that Maitreya will be the next buddha manifest in this world and will introduce the [[Dharma]] when it no longer exists, but when he dies (or enters ''Mahāparinirvāṇa''), he will likewise continue to teach the Dharma for all time{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. Moreover, some Mahāyāna schools{{Who|date=August 2010}} argue that although it is true that, for this world-system, Maitreya will be the next buddha to manifest, there are an infinite number of world-systems, many of which have currently active buddhas or bodhisattvas manifesting{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

Because the Mahāyāna traditions assert that eventually everyone will achieve [[Buddhahood|complete enlightenment]] (Skt. ''Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi''), the Mahāyāna is labeled universalist, whereas the stance of the early scriptures is that attaining Nirvāṇa depends on effort and is not pre-determined.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1995). ''The Selfless Mind.'' Curzon Press: p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bodhisattva===
The Mahāyāna tradition holds that pursuing only the release from suffering and attainment of Nirvāṇa is too narrow an aspiration, because it lacks the motivation of actively resolving to liberate all other sentient beings from [[samsara|Saṃsāra]]. One who engages in this path is called a bodhisattva.

The defining characteristic of a bodhisattva is [[bodhicitta]], the intention to achieve omniscient Buddhahood ([[Trikaya]]) as fast as possible, so that one may benefit infinite sentient beings. Sometimes the term bodhisattva is used more restrictively to refer to those sentient beings on the [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|grounds]]. As Ananda Coomaraswamy notes, &quot;The most essential part of the Mahayana is its emphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal, which replaces that of the [[arhat]], or ranks before it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism |year=1975 |publisher=University Books, Inc. |location=Boston|page=229 |lccn=64056434}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahāyāna teachings, being a high-level bodhisattva involves possessing a mind of great compassion and [[prajna|transcendent wisdom]] (Skt. ''prajñā'') to realize the  reality of inherent [[shunyata|emptiness]] and [[dependent origination]]. Mahāyāna teaches that the practitioner will finally realize the attainment of [[Buddhahood]].

Six [[paramita|perfections]] (Skt. ''pāramitā'') are traditionally required for bodhisattvas:
#''{{IAST|[[dana (Buddhism)|dāna]]-pāramitā}}'': the perfection of giving
#''{{IAST|[[śīla]]-pāramitā}}'': the perfection on behavior and discipline
#''{{IAST|[[ksanti|kṣānti]]-pāramitā}}'': the perfection of forbearance
#''{{IAST|[[virya|vīrya]]-pāramitā}}'': the perfection of vigor and diligence
#''{{IAST|[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]-pāramitā}}'': the perfection of meditation
#''{{IAST|[[prajna|prajñā]]-pāramitā}}'': the perfection of transcendent wisdom

===Expedient means===
{{Main|Upaya}}

[[upāya|Expedient means]] (Skt. ''upāya'') is found in the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', one of the earliest dated Mahāyāna sūtras, and is accepted in all Mahāyāna schools of thought. It is any effective method that aids awakening. It does not necessarily mean that some particular method is &quot;untrue&quot; but is simply any means or stratagem that is conducive to spiritual growth and leads beings to awakening and [[nirvana]]. Expedient means could thus be certain motivational words for a particular listener or even the noble [[Eightfold Path|eightfold path]] itself. Basic Buddhism (what Mahāyāna would term ''[[sravaka-yana|śravakayāna]]'' or ''[[pratyekabuddha-yana|pratyekabuddhayāna]]'') is an expedient method for helping people begin the noble Buddhist path and advance quite far. But the path is not wholly traversed, according to some Mahāyāna schools, until the practitioner has striven for and attained Buddhahood for the liberation of all other sentient beings from suffering. 

Some scholars have stated that the exercise of expedient means, &quot;the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is also of enormous importance in the Pāli canon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It is true that the term translated 'expounding in means', upaya-kausalya, is post-canonical, but the exercise of expounding to which it refers, the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon.&quot; Gombrich, Richard F. (1997). ''How Buddhism Began''. Munshiram Manoharlal: p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the Pāli term ''upāya-kosalla'' does occur in the Pāli Canon, in the ''Sangiti Sutta'' of the ''Digha Nikāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, M. trans. (1987). ''Thus Have I Heard: the Long Discourses of the Buddha''. Wisdom: p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberation===
“Devotional” Mahāyāna developed a rich cosmography, with various Buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in paradise realms. The concept of [[trikaya|the three bodies]] (''trikāya'') supports these constructions, making the Buddha himself a transcendental figure. Dr. Guang Xing describes the Mahāyāna Buddha as &quot;an omnipotent divinity endowed with numerous supernatural attributes and qualities ...[He] is described almost as an omnipotent and almighty godhead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing (2005). ''The Three Bodies of the Buddha: The Origin and Development of the Trikaya Theory''. Oxford: Routledge Curzon: pp.1 and 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Under various conditions, the realms Buddha presides over could be attained by devotees after their death so, when reborn, they could strive towards buddhahood in the best possible conditions. Depending on the sect, this salvation to “paradise” can be obtained by faith, imaging, or sometimes even by the simple invocation of the Buddha’s name. This approach to salvation is at the origin of the mass appeal of devotional Buddhism, especially represented by the [[Pure Land]] (浄土宗).

This rich cosmography also allowed Mahāyāna to be quite syncretic and accommodating of other faiths or deities. Various origins have been suggested to explain its emergence, such as “popular [[Hindu]] devotional cults (''[[bhakti]]''), and [[Persian culture|Persian]] and [[Greco-Roman]] theologies, which filtered into India from the northwest”.&lt;ref&gt;Lowenstein, Tom. ''The Vision of the Buddha''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddha nature ===

[[File:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|left|thumb|''The Buddhist Goddess Tara'' (9th Century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]

 |title= The Buddhist Goddess Tara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
The teaching of a &quot;[[Buddha Nature|Buddha nature]]&quot; (Skt. ''tathāgatagarbha'') may be based on the &quot;[[luminous mind]]&quot; concept found in the ''[[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]]''. The essential idea, articulated in the Buddha nature sūtras, but not accepted by all Mahāyānists, is that no being is without a concealed but indestructible interior link to the awakening of ''[[bodhi]]'' and that this link is an uncreated element (''dhātu'') or principle deep inside each being, which constitutes the deathless, diamond-like &quot;essence of the self&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Nirvāṇa Sūtra''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' states: &quot;The essence of the Self (''ātman'') is the subtle Buddha nature...&quot; while the later ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Lankāvatāra Sūtra]]'' states that the Buddha nature might be taken to be self (''ātman''), but it is not. In the 'Sagathakam' section of that same sutra, however, the Tathagatagarbha as the Self is not denied, but affirmed: 'The ''Atma'' [Self] characterised with purity is the state of self-realization; this is the Tathagata's Womb (''garbha''), which does not belong to the realm of the theorisers'.&lt;ref&gt;Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, ''The Lankavatara Sutra'', Prajna Press, Boulder, 1978, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddha nature class of sūtras, the word &quot;self&quot; (''ātman'') is used in a way defined by and specific to these sūtras. (See [[Atman (Buddhism)]].)

According to some scholars, the Buddha nature discussed in some Mahāyāna sūtras does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''); rather, it is a positive language and expression of [[sunyata|emptiness]] (''śūnyatā'') and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zencomp.com/greatwisdom/ebud/ebdha191.htm Heng-Ching Shih, ''The Significance Of &quot;Tathagatagarbha&quot;&amp;mdash;A Positive Expression Of &quot;Sunyata&quot;.'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is the &quot;true self&quot; in representing the innate aspect of the individual that makes actualizing the ultimate personality possible.

The actual &quot;seeing and knowing&quot; of this Buddha essence (''Buddha-dhātu'', co-terminous with the ''[[Dharmakaya|Dharmakāya]]'' or self{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} of Buddha) is said to usher in nirvanic liberation. This Buddha essence or &quot;Buddha nature&quot; is stated to be found in every single person, ghost, god and sentient being. In the Buddha nature sūtras, the Buddha is portrayed as describing the Buddha essence as uncreated, deathless and ultimately beyond rational grasping or conceptualisation. Yet, it is this already real and present, hidden internal element of [[bodhi|awakeness]] (''bodhi'') that, according to the Buddha nature sūtras, prompts beings to seek liberation from worldly suffering, and lets them attain the spotless bliss that lies at the heart of their being. Once the veils of negative thoughts, feelings, and unwholesome behaviour (the ''[[Kleśā (Buddhism)|kleśas]]'') are eliminated from the mind and character, the indwelling Buddha principle (''Buddha-dhātu'': Buddha nature) can shine forth unimpededly and transform the seer into a Buddha.

Prior to the period of these sūtras, Mahāyāna [[metaphysics]] was dominated by teachings on [[emptiness]], in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Buddha nature genre of sūtras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] and on the mysterious reality of nirvana using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sūtras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary that described a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;King, Sallie B. [http://www.scribd.com/doc/33827209/Sallie-B-King-The-Doctrine-of-Buddha-Nature-is-Impeccably-Buddhist ''The Doctrine of Buddha-Nature is impeccably Buddhist'']: pp. 174-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Uttaratantra]]'' (an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] treatise on [[Buddha nature]]) sees Buddha nature not as [[samskrta|caused and conditioned]] (''saṃskṛta''), but as eternal, uncaused, unconditioned, and incapable of being destroyed, although temporarily concealed within worldly beings by adventitious defilements.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, Professor C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhist scholar Dr. C. D. Sebastian, the ''Uttaratantra's'' reference to a transcendental self (''[[Ātman (Buddhism)|ātma]]-[[paramita|pāramitā]]'') should be understood as &quot;the unique essence of the universe,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, Professor C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 151; cf. also p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; thus the universal and [[immanent]] essence of Buddha nature is the same throughout time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, Professor C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptures ==

===Āgamas===

{{Main|Mahayana sutras}}
Mahāyāna Buddhism takes the basic teachings of the Buddha as recorded in early scriptures as the starting point of its teachings, such as those concerning karma and rebirth, [[Anatman|anātman]], [[Shunyata|emptiness]], [[dependent origination]], and the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Mahāyāna Buddhists in East Asia have traditionally studied these teachings in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] preserved in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]. &quot;Āgama&quot; is the term used by those traditional Buddhist schools in India who employed Sanskrit for their basic canon. These correspond to the [[Nikāya]]s used by the Theravāda school. The surviving Āgamas in Chinese translation belong to at least two schools, while most of the Āgamas teachings were never translated into Tibetan.

In addition to accepting the essential scriptures of the various [[early Buddhist schools]] as valid, Mahāyāna Buddhism also maintains large additional collections of sūtras that are not used or recognized by the Theravāda school. In the past, these were also not recognized by some individuals within the early Buddhist schools. In other cases, Buddhist communities were divided along these doctrinal lines. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna sūtras]] are often given greater authority than the Āgamas. The first of these Mahāyāna-specific writings were written probably around the 1st century BCE&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 252&quot;&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993). ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; or 1st century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buddhism 2004, page 293&quot;&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turnings of the Dharma Wheel ===

Dating back at least to the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'' is a classification of the corpus of Buddhism into three categories, based on ways of understanding the nature of reality, known as the &quot;[[three turnings of the wheel of dharma|Three Turnings of the Dharma Wheel]]&quot;. According to this view, there were three such &quot;turnings&quot;:&lt;ref name=Kitagawa80&gt;[[Joseph Kitagawa|Kitagawa, Joseph Mitsuo]] (2002). ''The Religious Traditions of Asia: Religion, History, and Culture''. Routledge. ISBN 0-7007-1762-5: p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

#In the first turning, the Buddha taught the [[Four Noble Truths]] at [[Varanasi|Vārāṇasī]] for those in the [[shravaka|śravaka]] vehicle. It is described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana&gt;Keenan, John (2000). ''The Scripture on the Explication of the Underlying Meaning''. Numata Center. ISBN 1-886439-10-9: p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrines of the first turning are exemplified in the ''[[Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta|Dharmacakra Pravartana Sūtra]]''. This turning represents the earliest phase of the Buddhist teachings and the earliest period in the history of Buddhism.
#In the second turning, the Buddha taught the Mahāyāna teachings to the bodhisattvas, teaching that all phenomena have no-essence, no arising, no passing away, are originally quiescent, and essentially in cessation. This turning is also described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana /&gt; Doctrine of the second turning is established in the Prajñāpāramitā teachings, first put into writing around 100 BCE. In Indian philosophical schools, it is exemplified by the Mādhyamaka school of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]].
#In the third turning, the Buddha taught similar teachings to the second turning, but for everyone in the three vehicles, including all the śravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. These were meant to be completely explicit teachings in their entire detail, for which interpretations would not be necessary, and controversy would not occur.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana /&gt; These teachings were established by the ''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra'' as early as the 1st or 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers_1993&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last= Powers|first= John|title= Hermeneutics and tradition in the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra|year= 1970|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=90-04-09826-7|date=1993|pages=4–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian philosophical schools, the third turning is exemplified by the Yogācāra school of [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] and [[Vasubandhu]].

Some traditions of Tibetan Buddhism consider the teachings of Esoteric Buddhism and Vajrayāna to be the third turning of the Dharma Wheel. Tibetan teachers, particularly of the [[Gelug]]pa school, regard the second turning as the highest teaching, due to their particular interpretation of Yogācāra doctrine. The [[Tathagatagarbha|Buddha Nature]] teachings are normally included in the third turning of the wheel. The Chinese tradition has a different scheme.

The Chinese scholar T'ien-T'ai believed the Buddha taught over Five Periods&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;. These are:

# The Flower Garland Period&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;.
# The Agama Period&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;.
# The Correct and Equal Period (provisional Mahayana Sutras, including the Amida, Mahavairochana and Vimalakirti Sutras)&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;.
# The Wisdom Period (Perfection of Wisdom Sutras)&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;.
# The Lotus and Nirvana Period (when Shakyamuni taught from the standpoint of his Enlightenment)&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Early canon===
Scholars have noted that many key Mahāyāna ideas are closely connected to the earliest texts of Buddhism. The seminal work of Mahāyāna philosophy, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'', mentions the canon's ''Katyāyana Sūtra'' (SA 301) by name, and may be an extended commentary on that work.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna systematized the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] school of Mahāyāna philosophy. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the canon. In his eyes the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Mādhyamaka system.&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, Christian (1997). ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing: p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna also referred to a passage in the canon regarding &quot;[[Nirvana#Luminous consciousness|nirvanic consciousness]]&quot; in two different works.&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, Christian (1997). ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing: p. 322. Lindtner says that Nāgārjuna is referencing the DN.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], the other prominent Mahāyāna school in dialectic with the Mādhyamaka school, gave a special significance to the canon's ''Lesser Discourse on Emptiness'' (MA 190).&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin M.; Kawamura, Leslie S., trans. (1991). ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Albany: SUNY Press: p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; A passage there (which the discourse itself emphasizes) is often quoted in later Yogācāra texts as a true definition of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin M.; Kawamura, Leslie S., trans. (1991). ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Albany: SUNY Press: p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the thought presented in the Yogācāra school's ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]'' is undeniably closer to that of the Pali [[Nikayas]] than is that of the Theravadin [[Abhidhamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, page 44, note 5. Lusthaus draws attention to Rahula's ''Zen and the Taming of the Bull.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Mādhyamikas and the Yogācārins saw themselves as preserving the Buddhist Middle Way between the extremes of nihilism (everything as unreal) and substantialism (substantial entities existing). The Yogācārins criticized the Mādhyamikas for tending towards nihilism, while the Mādhyamikas criticized the Yogācārins for tending towards substantialism.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1993). ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key Mahāyāna texts introducing the concepts of [[bodhicitta]] and [[Buddha nature]] also use language parallel to passages in the canon containing the Buddha's description of &quot;[[luminous mind]]&quot; and may have been based on this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1989). Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha. In Werner, Karel ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press: p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravāda school==
===Role of the Bodhisattva===
In the early Buddhist texts, and as taught by the modern Theravada school, the goal of becoming a teaching Buddha in a future life is viewed as the aim of a small group of individuals striving to benefit future generations after the current Buddha's teachings have been lost, but in the current age there is no need for most practitioners to aspire to this goal. Theravada texts do, however, hold that this is a more perfectly virtuous goal.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (2000). ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics''. Cambridge University Press: p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravāda and Hīnayāna===
Although the Theravāda school is usually described as belonging to Hīnayāna,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=uiUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhism&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=ykWVSNfIPIbujgGgrbXqAw#PPA159,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gombrich&gt;Gombrich, Richard Francis (1988).

(2005). ''Rebuilding Buddhism'': P.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swearer, Donald (2006). Theravada Buddhist Societies. In: Juergensmeyer, Mark (ed.) ''The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions'': P.83&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have argued that it should not be considered such from the Mahāyāna perspective. Their view is based on a different understanding of the concept of Hīnayāna. Rather than regarding the term as referring to any school of Buddhism that hasn't accepted the Mahāyāna canon and doctrines, such as those pertaining to the role of the boddhisatva,&lt;ref name=gombrich/&gt;&lt;ref name=gellner/&gt; these authors argue that the classification of a school as &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; should be crucially dependent on the adherence to a specific [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] position. They point out that unlike the now-extinct [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school, which was the primary object of Mahāyāna criticism, the Theravāda does not claim the existence of independent [[Dharma#In Buddhist phenomenology|entities]] (''dharmas''); in this it maintains the attitude of early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Frank J. and Mahinda, Deegalle (1996). ''Pali Buddhism.'' Routledge Press: p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1999). ''Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought.'' Edinburgh University Press: p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika, Nyaponika Thera, Nyanaponika, Bhikkhu Bodhi (1998). ''Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time.'' Wisdom Publications: p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of Mahāyāna Buddhism disagreed with the substantialist thought of the Sarvāstivādins and [[Sautrantika|Sautrāntikas]], and in emphasizing the doctrine of [[sunyata|emptiness]], Kalupahana holds that they endeavored to preserve the early teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravādins too refuted the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrāntikas (and other schools) on the grounds that their theories were in conflict with the non-substantialism of the canon. The Theravāda arguments are preserved in the ''[[Kathavatthu|Kathāvatthu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to this view, no form of real Hīnayāna Buddhism survives today.

Some contemporary Theravādin figures have indicated a sympathetic stance toward the Mahāyāna philosophy found in texts such as the ''[[Heart Sutra|Heart Sūtra]]'' (Skt. ''Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya'') and Nāgārjuna's ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|Fundamental Stanzas on the Middle Way]]'' (Skt. ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. and {{unicode|Dge-ʼdun-chos-ʼphel}} (2006). ''The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chopel.''
