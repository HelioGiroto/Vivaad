This article has a lot more expansion to come. I set it to Start, not C. [[User:JEMead|JEMead]] ([[User talk:JEMead|talk]]) 21:43, 1 January 2012 (UTC)  I expanded items and decided that a C might be ok here now.

Start talk page [[User:JEMead|JEMead]] ([[User talk:JEMead|talk]]) 08:57, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

===Task lists for this article===

: well - really brief and top level:
:#Collecting references to expand on those. I have started on that. others as well I believe. 
:#The eastern theosophies can be tricky. People from all the various schools (some societal, others not) might see if we have good wikipages we can use (there are several), also what to add. 
:#The western theosophies we just keep filing in...  using other pages etc. as well. 
:#societal influences. I think people have ideas for the eastern theosophy's influences. The western side has several, but I have not given it much thought. I can look around some. 
:::[[User:JEMead|JEMead]] ([[User talk:JEMead|talk]]) 22:23, 29 April 2012 (UTC)

More re: tasks
:#Develop comprehensive, clear, sourced paragraphs regarding the basic tenets of Theosophy. As JEMead has mentioned, Theosophy varies regionally, globally. We need to capture that variability.
:#Begin to show what the skeptics and critics say about Theosophy.
:#Include in the preceding task, reliably sourced responses from Theosophy spokespersons.
:#Identify POV wording and replace with NPOV wording; at least move towards NPOV edits.

And more re: tasks
:#Theosophy has varied over time so multiple sources with varied points of view on the history of theosophy are needed. 
:#The revival of theosophy and organized theosophy today should be included. The scholarship labeling Theosophy a new religious movement should be included. 
:#Sources should include the full range of modern scholarship. The modern scholarship should elucidate both earlier source material and differences of opinion among current scholars so that all &quot;significant views that have been published by reliable sources&quot; are presented.  
:#Notable people, places, organizations, and publications related to theosophy should be included and properly sourced. 
:#Controversies associated with theosophy especially regarding race and association with Nazism.  
:#Briefly mention any concepts that aid in explicating theosophy such as esotericism. Also clarify theosophy does not equate with occultism, Gnosticism, mysticism, spiritualism, mystery religions, and pseudoscience. Conversely, discuss ways in which theosophy, theosophers, and theosophical movements did at times incorporate elements of occultism, Gnosticism, mysticism, spiritualism, mystery religions, and pseudoscience.
:#Make clear the difference between theosophy and Theosophy. 
:#Explain theosophical ideas about science in different historical epochs. 
:#Present scholarly views on theosophy as religion, religious thought, religious doctrines. 
:#Present historical linguistics and sociolinguistics of the word theosophy from a variety of modern scholars. 
:#Restate any article text necessary which cites Faivre's ''Theosophy, Imagination, Tradition: Studies in Western Esotericism'' so that it summarizes Faivre's statements with the most accuracy possible. 
:#Earlier section of this talk page titled &quot;Comments from Binsternet&quot; should be incorporated. It's pasted below for easy reference. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 02:34, 30 April 2012 (UTC)

::I accomplished a few of the tasks. I clarified the article and improved its flow. I fixed a direct quotation about Solovyov so it was accurate. I clarified the subject of some sentences; many sentences need more specific subjects rather than &quot;some people&quot; and the like. I tightened the text and fixed punctuation, style, and grammar to some extent. I substituted Faivre and Hanegraaf's definition of theosophy for Western theosophy since there is no source citation to support the terms Western and Eastern Theosophy.

Today, Hanegraaff continues in this vein by saying Godwin wrote a [http://books.google.com/books?id=48Lgg5fa78oC&amp;pg=PA243 &quot;groundbreaking study&quot;] back in the 1990s, writing in ''Esotericism and the Academy: Rejected Knowledge in Western Culture'', Cambridge University Press.

Goodrick-Clarke is known for connecting Nazism and Theosophy, a matter that is completely absent from this article likely for ill-considered reasons. See Goodrick-Clarke's ''Hitler's Priestess: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism'', New York University Press, 1998; ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity'', New York University Press, 2003; and ''The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults And Their Influence on Nazi Ideology'', Tauris Parke, 2004.

Right now there is nothing about utopian groups in the article.
::**Racism in Theosophy is currently absent from the article, an astonishing lapse. The idea that Theosophy is racist [http://books.google.com/books?id=l1bbpK_0NG0C&amp;pg=PA229 &quot;is much disputed&quot;], of course, but Goodrick-Clarke's work with esoteric Nazi beliefs is one cornerstone. Corinna Treitel writes that [http://books.google.com/books?id=VG7e-LnLhEcC&amp;pg=PA103 &quot;Theosophy aimed, after all, to bring the so-called &quot;sixth root race&quot; into existence&quot;], a contrast to Theosophy's otherwise inclusive pan-racial goals (''A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern'', JHU Press, 2004.) Mattias Gardell writes that Theosophy emphasized &quot;elitism, racism and esoteric knowledge&quot; which made it very suitable to German racial thought. (''Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism'', Duke University Press, 2003.) On the other hand, Colin Kidd writes [http://books.google.com/books?id=aNT3q1HjY_MC&amp;pg=PA237 &quot;Theosophy is a form of spirituality founded upon an ecumenical and explicitly anti-racist platform. Indeed, Theosophy proclaims itself a religion of global racial and religious reconciliation.&quot;] (''The Forging of Races: Race And Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600-2000'', Cambridge University Press, 2006.) Besant was one of the prominent Theosphists fighting against racism.&quot;

== Idea for RfC: Ask for help with tentative outline based on WP:NRMMOS but adapted to Theosophy ==

Wikipedia:Manual of Style/New religious movements [[WP:NRMMOS]] has guidelines for articles like [[Theosophy]]. 

I believe one reason this article is hard to write is that it fits both the category NRM and the category history of religious thought. For that reason the specified ''NRM Article content structure'' needs adjustment for the particularities of this topic. 

Theosophy means multiple things: 1) the intellectual history of religious thought prior to HPB 2) the Theosophical Society and 3) both of them after HPB. 

I believe we have concluded that if we were to use separate pages and disambiguate the Theosophical Society and theosophy then we would be violating Wikipedia:Content forking [[WP:CFORK]].  
::I think using [[WP:Summary Style]] is very appropriate here. some NRM's exist as wikipages already, and are large. They are marked NRM's as well. [[User:JEMead|JEMead]] ([[User talk:JEMead|talk]]) 09:36, 9 May 2012 (UTC)
:::Have I read [[WP:Summary Style]] correctly? I think the day may come when we will have to use [[WP:Summary Style]] because the article will be so long. When and if that day comes, we will have to decide which part goes to its own article. That would be a hard call. If we take out Blavatsky's Theosophy, the Theosophical Society and the new religious movements that grew out of it while replacing it with a link and a summary, then the the article would be about historical eras in theosophy, Faivre's typology, and the religious thought and writing of early theosophers. In that case, I wonder if the article would need re-titling to something like ''&quot;History, thought, and typology of theosophy.&quot;'' Of course that title is no good because it sounds bad. I think it would be helpful to ask for guidance in the RfC about how [[WP:Summary Style]] would be implemented if and when the day comes that the article is too long. I'm not advocating an approach here. I just have questions. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 14:47, 9 May 2012 (UTC)
*On a regular NRM the guideline would be to structure the article as below. The topic of Theosophy a different kind of topic since it means more than the NRM part of theosophy. For that reason we need to adjust the article structure below, perhaps drastically. 
:::Maybe I am confused. Most NRM material already exists in their own separate articles in Wikipages [[List of new religious movements]].  Our items like the HPB Theosophy, is [[Helena Blavatsky#Theosophy]]. This section (3.) in the HPB article covers everything in more detail than we would ever try to add here. HPB belongs in a separate article because it is a separate article in its own right. I would expect this article to cover the theosophy as typology of ideas, theory, history etc. My guess is that I am missing what you want to add? [[User:JEMead|JEMead]] ([[User talk:JEMead|talk]]) 01:44, 11 May 2012 (UTC)

::::I am not sure I want to add anything. I just think it's difficult to structure this article since it means Theosophy, the movement, and theosophy, a type of thought. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 23:20, 16 May 2012 (UTC)

'''Wikipedia:Manual of Style/New religious movements [[WP:NRMMOS]]'''

'''Article content structure'''
&lt;br&gt;
'''Articles on movements'''
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The article on a new religious movement should cover at least the following points:
#History of the movement
#Beliefs, teachings or practices of the movement 
#Reception

A movement should have its own article if it has developed social structures and behaviors that have attracted substantial coverage in reliable sources. If there is no substantial coverage of these aspects of the movement in reliable sources, a section in the founder's biography is sufficient to describe the movement.

'''Articles on movement founders'''
&lt;br&gt;
The article on the founder of a religious movement should cover at least the following points:
#Biography, including important events in the movement's history
#Teachings
#Reception of the founder and her or his movement

Where the article on a religious movement redirects to the article on the movement founder, the article on the founder should cover at least the following points:
#Biography, including important events in the movement's history
#Teachings
#Description of the movement
#Reception of the founder and her or his movement&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*Furthermore, we have to consider how prominent each aspect of theosophy needs to be so that these three areas all have due weight: 1) the intellectual history of religious thought prior to HPB 2) the Theosophical Society and 3) both of them after HPB.
&lt;br&gt;

'''Wikipedia:Manual of Style/New religious movements [[WP:NRMMOS]] Further information: [[WP:DUE]]'''
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Due weight'''
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;''Neutrality requires that the article should fairly represent all significant facts and viewpoints that have been published by a reliable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each.''

''Due weight is established by secondary sources.'' [emphasis added] 

Prominent topics in self-published sources (movement and countermovement) may not be prominent in third-party sources (scholarly works, high-quality mainstream media); it is the latter which establish due weight in articles on new religious movements.&quot; [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 21:06, 8 May 2012 (UTC) [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 21:22, 8 May 2012 (UTC) [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 21:29, 8 May 2012 (UTC)

== Requesting feedback on how to phrase the RfC ==

DonaldRichardSands presented and revised proposed questions for RfC. Then I started a new section which proposed a broad way to frame the RfC by asking for help constructing an outline in which the aspect of theosophy as part of the history of esoteric thought is blended with the NRM aspect of Theosophy. Then JEMead indicated the utility of WP:Summary Style and I wrote, &quot;I think it would be helpful to ask for guidance in the RfC about how WP:Summary Style would be implemented if and when the day comes that the article is too long.&quot;

The topics 

My proposal is that we use this for the RfC: 

*The topic of theosophy blends both theosophy as part of the history of esoteric thought and theosophy as a NRM and its influence up to today. We would like help figuring out how to construct an outline which blends both aspects of theosophy. The article structure suggested by the WikiProject on NRMs would not encompass theosophy as an aspect of the history of esotericism. We need something different. Also, we are asking for guidance in thinking ahead to a time when the article may become long enough to need to use WP:Summary Style. Which aspect of theosophy would go to its own article and what would be the correct name of whatever part stayed part of this article since the term [[Theosophy]] includes both types of theosophy: theosophy as part of the history of esoteric thought and the Theosophical movement. 

Please indicate your agreement with the above proposal, disagreement with the above proposal, suggestions for improving the above proposal or suggest an alternative proposal for wording the RfC. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:03, 10 May 2012 (UTC)

If one looks at the Theosophy Banner, [[Hermeticism]] (and banner), [[Esoteric Christianity]] etc. they list many topics which are items we should use for the summary style. If we add a NRM section which refers to the various NRM movements associated to theosophy, then that should cover NRM's. [[User:JEMead|JEMead]] ([[User talk:JEMead|talk]]) 14:06, 11 May 2012 (UTC)
:JEMead, the [[Hermeticism]] banner looks like something we could base an expanded Theosophy banner on. I agree the NRMs need a section separate. I looked at [[Esoteric Christianity]] briefly and see some ways we could list topics. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 23:14, 16 May 2012 (UTC)

;Factseducado, here is a rewording of your paragraph. This is just an attempt to clarify, I am okay with any rewording, [[User:DonaldRichardSands|DonaldRichardSands]] ([[User talk:DonaldRichardSands|talk]]) 21:08, 11 May 2012 (UTC)

===A Proposed RfC:===

;This RfC seeks advice from editors on the following:

;Theosophy includes:
#A history of esoteric thought and 
#A description of a [[New Religious Movement]] ([[NRM]]). 
::Q1, We want this article to include both. What would be the most effective outline?
::Q2, If the article gets too long, would it be appropriate to create two articles, i.e. one on the history of esoteric thought and the other on the NRM? 
::Q3, If the article gets too long, how should the articles be divided, in particular? 
::Q4, How should [[Helena Blavatsky]], now a historical figure, and those who came after her, be included in the article(s)?

:::I am in favor of the wording of this RfC. I would like to move foward with it. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 23:11, 16 May 2012 (UTC)
::::An RfC would be helpful; more input. However, we are being too civil. lol. [[User:DonaldRichardSands|DonaldRichardSands]] ([[User talk:DonaldRichardSands|talk]]) 14:55, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
:::::Yes, civility with an article that is this historically contentious is scary :)
:::::The Main page (here) should cover all aspects. Rather the lead article in a new Theosophy Banner. The religious philosophy, esotericism etc. can be a huge amount of material. The number of NRM's that have sprung up (most post-Blavatsky) is also very large. I have always believed this topic must refer to many other wiki-pages and only summarize many of the major pieces that already have a large amount of material existent within wikipedia. One example is Alice Bailey; She has a large article that we can use (reference). Hermeticism, esoteric christianity, Astrology, Kaballa, Gnostic thought etc. are all traditional theosophies that have been around for a very long time and still continue within their own right. HPB really focused on the ''One Perennial Wisdom Religion'' which opened the flood-gates of religious movements with doctrines and dogmas and that whole realm. Yet, she herself always said that accepting any doctrine was irrelevant to being a Theosophist. 
:::::I guess my point is to proceed with the RFC. However, the question of focus includes the NRM, but a lot more as well. [[User:JEMead|JEMead]] ([[User talk:JEMead|talk]]) 16:05, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::::If I write DonaldRichardSands dresses funny do we qualify for an RfC? Actually, I'd rather get input while things are going well. Theosophy is not the easiest article to write.[[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:01, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::::Yes, theosophy includes the NRM and &quot;a lot more as well.&quot;[[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:01, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::::I agree this main article should include all aspects and that we must refer to other articles because the topic is big. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:01, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::::I need to see sources that tie &quot;Hermeticism, esoteric christianity, Astrology, Kaballa, Gnostic thought&quot; to the umbrella of theosophy. I do wonder if calling all of those part of esotericism is more accurate. I would need to evaluate actual sources to see if those categories are sisters of theosophy, mothers of theosophy, or daughters of theosophy. Each category could be related in all three ways (unlike a human family). Also, each category may relate to theosophy differently. I tend to think Astrology and Kaballa predate theosophy, gave rise to theosophy, and were then used by theosophers. I think Faivre wrote about that but I'd have to look again. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:01, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::::Yes, HPB focused on ''One Perennial Religion.'' Movements with doctrines and dogmas do seem to have resulted and she said doctrine was irrelevant. Then theosophy ties to Alice Bailey and the New Age Movement which often took the form of spirituality and esotericism without doctrines and dogmas. I think our task is to reflect what good sources say on any significant matter. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:01, 17 May 2012 (UTC)

== Flow of Article - Introductory Overview as several books have done ==

I believe the article should follow the normal flow that most introductory books take. We are basically there with a couple changes in format.

shuffle as below: Content shuffle. move typology of traditional theosophy currents before history. This is needed to understand how the history's flow, develop common threads etc. We should add an NRM section after the Blavatsky section. 

1 Etymology

2 Traditional (Hellenistic) Theosophies
:2.1 Theology and Typology

3 History
:3.1 Antiquity and Medieval ending c. 1450 C.E.
:3.2 Theosophy in early modern Europe beginning in the 1500s
::3.2.1 Enlightenment theosophy, 1650-1775
::3.2.2 The nineteenth century
::3.2.3 The twentieth century to present

4 Blavatskyan Theosophy and the Theosophical Society
:4.1 Overview of Blavatsky's teachings
:4.2 Criticisms of Helena Blavatsk and The Theosophical Society
::4.2.1 Helena Blavatsky's skeptics
::4.2.2 Blavatsky's Theosophy connected to antisemitism, racism

5 Post-Blavatsky Theosophy and New Religious Movements

6 See Also

7 References
:7.1 Citations
:7.2 Bibliography
:7.3 Online Sources

8.External links

This will allow the NRM's and also have the History as a meaningful examination of the flow and evolution of theosophical thought.

:JEMead, I would tend to think the history section helps understand the typology section. I would have to think about it more. I can't see any reason for you to not move the typology section now. Any interested person can comment on the talk page. If later the typology section is moved right behind the history section, you would not oppose that would you? All other aspects of your outline seem useful. I'd still like an RfC though. Do you agree on the proposed RfC DonaldRichardSands has constructed? [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 23:09, 16 May 2012 (UTC)

:::ok. I will move the typology section to match the above. I have always thought it would be more useful to have it in mind before reading sections in 3.2 etc. After HPB, many additional currents were created and the typology is harder to see. I need to add a couple lines mentioning other research (or typology, etc) some people prefer for their work. [[User:JEMead|JEMead]] ([[User talk:JEMead|talk]]) 16:49, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::Yes, let's do as JEMead and DonaldRichardSands have suggested. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:10, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::Hopefully in the next 30 or so days we'll get feedback. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:10, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::Maybe we will all learn more about theosophy and Faivre and responses to Faivre. I think Faivre's typology is useful and should be included. Apparently not all reliable sources agreed with Faivre and they should get a sentence or more if we find the actual areas of disagreement. I think Faivre has been well-received by other reliable sources and it is not a problem that some reliable sources disagree with one thing or another.

::::I know we will have to include more of substance that was written by sources besides Faivre because he's not the only significant reliable source. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:10, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
::::JEMead added that external link to the history of theosophy and that journal is good as are the editors and authors there. [[User:Factseducado|Factseducado]] ([[User talk:Factseducado|talk]]) 17:10, 17 May 2012 (UTC)
:::::I rewrote, and added some references, for parts of the Common Characteristics section. It should be easier to read. The extra comments on variants of typologies etc I am still looking at.  ''Christian Theosophy'' has to get in there also. Faivre-dominated references are mostly in the history sections now. Most of the historical development is not contentious.

::::::I think the recent editing by all has been brilliant. If I see anything that could be improved I'll speak up here. I would like to see a Christian Theosophy section also. Multiple reliable sources reference it. I'd like to learn more about when the term started. You probably already know. I don't know yet. Thanks for your work (and Hgilbert and DonaldRichardSands's work, too.)
I just removed an edit (editor unknown) which had added the 21st century into history as below:
::The Twenty-First Century
::In the twenty-first century, Theosophy took to the internet. Esotericist and &quot;Spiritual Seeker&quot; Jordan Duchnycz launches his website and social forum, Spirit Science www.thespiritscience.net, bringing many theosophic ideas and theories to a new audience.
I think the above looks like an advertisement for a web site. If the poster cares to comment, please do so.

::I agree if the editor would like to help us understand a way to include reliably sourced information that would be welcome. I'm sure JEMead or I or someone would be happy to give ideas about how to write something with sources that could help discuss theosophy in the last decade or so.

I am ecstatic about the article. I wonder if it may keep improving and reach eligibility for good article status. Bye.
