==Early comments==
For me a prophet is somebody who asks us to reassess the way we are living our lives, somebody who asks us to look in a new direction (is this not what prophets of all creeds have done), and gives us guidance, or points out possible errors, in the way we have treated both each other and our home. The problem appears to be that a prophet cannot be considered such unless she/he has the weight of history behind them, should a new prophet arrive would they be greeted with open arms by the many, or shunned into hiding and desperation by the many, who expect who knows what but not words from the mouth of an ordinary person.

If I look at a prophet as someone who shows me a new way of living, that is more in tune with the world that I inhabit than a world 2000 years ago, do I dismiss this prophet?? Do I say that although I believe your thoughts to be correct, although I believe your arguments valid, I cannot accept you as a prophet?

The prophets have all one thing in common, they tried to shape the world for the better. Their beliefs were held because of a deep belief not only in a deep understanding of humanity, but also the belief that humanity was here for a purpose.

According to the major religions of the world today, there has not been a moderm prophet for nearly 1700 years, why is this? was there a sudden flurry a couple of thousand years ago??? or have we become too closed off to hear the new prophets??

==Biblical prophets==

Article says &quot;Within this group, many Protestants believe that prophecy ended with the last of the prophets in the portion of the Old Testament included in their canon, leaving a gap of about 400 years between then and the coming of Jesus Christ&quot; -- doesn't  the NT say John the Baptist was a prophet?

And, don't the Epistles speak of prophets or prophecy in the early church? (Which would seem to indicate that it didn't die out until the end of the apostolic age?)

Finally, doesn't the book of Revelations (Rev. 11:3) predict a comeback for prophecy? (The two witnesses who will prophesy for 1260 days?) -- [[User:SJK|SJK]]

: Regarding the Protestant belief, that's what I gathered from growing up in Sunday School in a variety of Protestant settings, but my experience is a very small data point. If you have other experience or data that suggests Protestants view John the Baptist as a prophet, than perhaps &quot;many Protestants&quot; should be downgraded to &quot;some&quot; or &quot;a few&quot;; or delete the reference to Protestants and Orthodox and just say &quot;many Christians think John the Baptist was the last prophet&quot; if my experience turns out to have been an anomaly. That wouldn't terribly surprise me, on something like this.

: The Epistles do speak of prophecy and even prophets, mostly in terms of a gift or role that a person might exercise from time to time. I don't think the NT names specific people as prophets, though I could be mistaken. Historically, the Church has often referred to such people as &quot;saints&quot; rather than prophets, whereas OT holy people are usually called &quot;prophets&quot; rather than &quot;saints&quot;, or it seems based on my limited exposure. I don't think you see specific people identified as prophets until you get down to groups like the Latter Day Saints. As for anything dying out at the end of the apostolic age, prophecy or anything else, I think that belief is only held by some dispensationalist theologians. Certainly the Catholic and Orthodox would affirm that the apostolic age is continuing via [[:apostolic succession|apostolic succession]], and many Pentecostals, Charismatics, and other Protestants would say that the [[:Holy Spirit|Holy Spirit]] continues to be active in the church and in the world in a number of ways, including by bestowing prophecy. Perhaps the difference between OT and NT prophecy is best shown in the Joel passage that's quoted in Acts 2.

: [[book of Revelation|Revelations]] says lots of things, which are interpreted many many different ways. :-) If we were discussing what the Bible actually teaches, we could quote Scripture verses in defense of this or that interpretation, as well as argue that this or that methodology should be used to interpret the verses, or that a particular tradition of interpretation is authoritative and ought to be followed. As we write these encyclopedia articles, I think our job is to document what the major groups of people out there believe that the Bible teaches, both historically and today. With that in mind, do you or any groups you know of believe that Revelation predicts a comeback of prophecy? As for me, I've believed many things about it myself, to the point now of being fairly thoroughly agnostic about it. 

: These are good questions, and I'm glad you raised them. Hope this is dialogue is helpful, and that it results in an improved article. I think it will. --[[User:Wesley|Wesley]]

Muhammad was not the seventh Muslim prophet, although he was the last. He was the last of the &quot;5&quot; prophets who brought with themselves a book (Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad). Muslims have thousands of other prophets, although they did not bring upon their people a religion. [[User:Alireza Hashemi|Alireza Hashemi]]


''Some'' of them did.  E.g., the Persians Zoroaster and Mani. Don't Muslims regard them as prophets?  Some people think the [[Mandaeanism|Mandaean]] religion was founded by John the Baptist, who is considered by Mandaeans the greatest prophet (although they claim their religion antedates him, just as Muslims claim theirs antedates Muhammad).  Since someone asked about Roman Catholic views of John the Baptist, I believe I recall reading in the online Catholic Encyclopedia (I don't recall the URL, but you can find it via Google) that Catholics do consider him a prophet. [[User:Michael Hardy|Michael Hardy]] 21:22 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)

[[User:Alireza Hashemi|In response to your comments:]]There are thousands of prophets, however Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad are of the ololazm.
Zaroaster is considered by some to be a ololazm prophet, although he has never been mentioned. With the many thousand prophets muslims have in virtually every region of the world, even the Buddha might be considered as a prophet.


The &quot;Revelation of Ares&quot; is not really a religion. It is the work of one Frenchman, named Michel Potay, a former Eastern Orthodox Deacon who since 1974 claims to be a new prophet of God. He has been ignored by the masses, and has few followers. His faith isn't even a statistical blip, and it does not (yet?) merit any text within this article.  We can, of course, create a new article on this new spiritual movement.

Deleted material follows:

:Views of The Revelation of Arès ===
:&lt;i&gt;The Revelation of Arès&lt;/i&gt; took place in Arès (France) and made the witness of the supernatural events, Michel POTAY, a prophet. &lt;i&gt;The Revelation of Arès&lt;/i&gt; was given by Jesus in 1974 (40 Apparitions) and God in 1977 (5 Theophanies), it constitutes a recent but major Revelation since the Bible and the [[Qur'an]].
:&lt;i&gt;The Revelation of Arès&lt;/i&gt; recalls the monotheistic roots, in order to recreate and dynamise spiritual life, which is the fundamental task of any prophet. The basic message is that man will not gain happiness by any rigid, dogmatic, legalistic, ideological, political, scientific, financial, nationalistic, theological, etc., system, but by simply recreating himself good, becoming once again the positive image and likeliness of the Creater, thus redeeming himself and recreating Eden, here on earth.
:&lt;i&gt;The Revelation of Arès&lt;/i&gt; refers to former prophets ([[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Isaiah]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]]) in a unique way, inciting the faithful of &lt;i&gt;The Revelation of Arès&lt;/i&gt; to accomplish all their respective messages in a spiritual and virtuous harmony with this recent Revelation. It is giving many insights as to how everybody is to become a prophet himself by delegation, e.g. by living and spreading all the Word of God, as revealed by His prophets.
:The original text of &lt;i&gt;The Revelation of Arès&lt;/i&gt; is edited in a book with the same title. In Arès (France) takes place a pilgrimage every summer, which is destined to give the humble pilgrim coming there the forces to accomplish his intentions of recreating himself and the world good, in order to contribute to change human history to the better, which is the reason why all the prophets are sent.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:RK|RK]] ([[User talk:RK|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/RK|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

==A removal==
I removed the following text, which seems awkward and not really ''à propos'' to this article:

:Readers of this article are encouraged to read the parallel article on [[revelation]], as the term ''[[revelation]]'' itself has a number of meanings and interpretations, even within the same religion. Various forms of revelation have been proposed, including: verbal revelation; Aristotelian rationalism; non-Verbal propositional revelation; and God's will as revealed through a people's historical development of their faith. In the 20th century [[existentialism]] has inspired new ways of understanding revelation.

==Christian concepts of a prophet==

I removed &quot;for the link to the divine is threatened. Questions of self-deception and gullibility arise from those who remain unconvinced.&quot; because:
*The first part seemed like a bit of unnecessary psychoanalysis.  Isn't it enough to state ''what'' without hypothesizing ''why''?
*The second part is about ''skeptics' view'' of the Christian concept of prophecy, not the concept itself.  If this perspective is going to be included, it should be separate from this section, because these &quot;questions of self-deception and gullibility&quot; apply to ''all'' believers in prophecy, not just the Christian variety.
[[User:Tverbeek|Tverbeek]] 01:35, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:Raw censorship. If prophecy is a link to the divine as it is claimed, then doubt threatens the link to the divine. A functional and logical statement, not &quot;unnecessary psychoanalysis.&quot; Questions of self-deception and gullibility do indeed apply to all believers in prophecy, assessed from a skeptical, which is to say a rational and neutral point-of-view. This suppression is too shallow to deceive and too offensive to stand. A mark of dishonor for [[User:Tverbeek]]. I refuse to revert, since reversion has been so compromised by just this kind of &quot;editing.&quot; [[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 04:11, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::I'm not trying to suppress anything (I don't believe in prophecy either), so please tone down the hyperbolic rhetoric. I think the skeptic's take on all this is pretty self-evident, which is why I didn't think it needed to be spelled out, but if you think it does, by all means, include the comments about how skeptics view prophecy, but ''put them in an appropriate context''. The insertion of critical comments in that particular section seems like an attempt to insert your own POV into a description of someone else's.
::P.S. Anyone who believes that his own POV is inherently NPOV should be prepared for questions of self-deception from those who remain unconvinced. :) [[User:Tverbeek|Tverbeek]] 11:57, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)

No educated person could imagine that skepticism is a &quot;take&quot; in a neutral atmosphere. Skepticism is an ''intellectual starting-point.'' It is the neutral starting-ground for the rest of us here at Wikipedia. In fact the lack of skepticism is a symptom of a [[cult]]ist in its most negative connotation. Wikipedians should not all be bullied by a handful of aggressive cultists. &quot;If prophecy is a link to the divine as it is claimed, then doubt threatens the link to the divine.&quot; Where is the illogic of this neutral and axiomatic statement? Why are we to be censored by Tverbeek in this repellant manner? --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 01:11, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Honestly, I don't really understand the point of these sentences. Obviously those who are assured in their own worldview (be they bible-thumper or skeptic) think everyone who thinks differently is gullible and deluded, and this works both ways. It seems too obvious to state. Why do we need to explain ''why'' this is the case in ''this'' article, as opposed to some more general article on [[religion]] or [[skepticism]]?

This is a very poor quality discussion of Chiristian concepts of the prophetic tradition.  It seems to be written from one, fairly narrow perspective of a particular charismatic group.  For instance, what Chrisitan groups are meant by &quot;some Christians?&quot;  The discussion is very vague, and does not seem to reflect the breadth and depth of theological thought on the topic. [[User:131.238.30.195|131.238.30.195]] 16:36, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

&quot;For Christians the authenticity of a prophet is judged as Jesus said that one should judge a prophet, by his fruits (''Gospel of Matthew 7'') and '''by checking whether his predictions come true.'''&quot; I do not know Jesus saying this in the Bible. At least a reference (like the one in italics) should be given? --[[User:Timo M Aho|Timo M Aho]] ([[User talk:Timo M Aho|talk]]) 06:59, 23 April 2008 (UTC)


:Timo, the Old Testament reference is this: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.&quot; {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Deuteronomy|chapter=18|verse=22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
:But in obtaining an understanding of the subject it is a frequent mistake to not consider that which other scriptures, whether oft quoted or obscure, teach and exemplify. For instance:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&quot; {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Revelations|chapter=19|verse=10}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Similarly, Old Testament prophets prophesied, and thereby testified, of a Messiah and His coming, as quoted many times in the Gospels: &quot;..it is written...&quot;. So prophets testifying of Christ is both an Old and a New Testament theme.  
:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And he said unto them,...that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.&quot; {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=24|verse=44}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[User:DanB|DanB]] ([[User talk:DanB|talk]]) 05:26, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

==Merging?==
=== Prophecy with Prophet ===
Why should this article be merged? Prophecy is the act of telling the future, a prophet is the person who does it - they're both long pages, and I'm pretty sure they'd spit out page size warnings if they were merged.&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sheridan|Sheridan]] ([[User talk:Sheridan|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sheridan|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:: Yes, it is not immediately obvious, but the prophet is quite a separate subject from the contents of the prophecy, and needs to be examined separately, particularly as they relate to their particular faiths.--[[User:Mrg3105|Mrg3105]] 01:36, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

=== Prophethood with Prophet ===

Not sure who suggested this merger, but given the similarity of their opening paragraphs, it seems like a good idea. The Prophethood page could easily be turned into a re-direct page to the Prophet page making managing subject edits more easy and consistent. [[User:Daniel De Mol|Daniel De Mol]] ([[User talk:Daniel De Mol|talk]]) 01:11, 20 October 2010 (UTC)

==Notability==

Shouldn't there be some minimal standard of notability for a religion to have a section on this page?  In particular, do the last two - Direct Worship and some splinter sect of Rastafarianism - really merit a whole subsection, particularly when major issues like the Nilotic concept of prophecy remain undiscussed? - [[User:Mustafaa|Mustafaa]] 22:16, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:It's a problem, but the NPOV policy makes it more difficult to exclude marginal stuff like this. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg]] 04:32, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== keyboard ==

Shouldn't we mention the Prophet electronical music keyboard? [[User:Purple Rose|Purple Rose]] 14:25, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

==Zarathushtra?==

Where is Zarathushtra (Zoroaster)?! Is there a ''reason'' why he is not here? Considering the impact his religion had on Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Buddhism (not to mention [[Manichaeism]], [[Mazdakism]], Mithraism and others), I find it a major omission. I just wanted to ask, before I consider endeavoring to distill what I know into a section. Others have mentioned him above, but only as a peripheral matter in regards to Islam or The Revelation of Arès. Zoroastrianism may be the smallest of the great World Religions, but its current size belies its historic notability which is especially apparent in the eschatology, soteriology, dualism, angels, temptation by evil, the three wise men, ''et cetera ad æternum'', of the three largest monotheistic faiths today. In essence (or should I say Essenes!) he's a prophet's prophet and I am mystified why he's not here. I can not varify whether or not Zarathushtra is considered a minor Islamic prophet, but ''Magians'' are only mentioned once in the Qur'&amp;#257;n (22:17) and not spoken well of in the &amp;#7716;ad&amp;#299;th. After the Arab conquest of Persia, Zoroastrians were officially considered as 'people of the book' (which is an interesting footnote considering their scriptures were non-Abrahamic), though in reality they were heavily persecuted and driven into the hills of Iran and to exile in India. [[User:Khirad|Khirad]] 14:55, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

[[User:Aidun|Aidun]] ([[User talk:Aidun|talk]]) 02:19, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

Many followers of Zarathushtra do not consider him a prophet rather a teacher or a philosopher who composed the Gathas or manthras (thought-provokers)consisting of 17 songs.  The concept of a prophet who is considered a miracle worker came years later when organized religion took form and got hold of even Zarathushtra's philosophy of life turning it into a religion which appeals to the masses. 


:An omission. --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 18:59, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Criteria for a Prophet.  My two cents: prophecy is only one &quot;job&quot; that a prophet does.  I think miracle working is another. Intercessory prayer is another. Whether or not a prophet has a mass of followers is not that important.  Daniel and Jonah come to mind.  Sex should not be important either.  I would add Anna, the 84 year old lady in Luke chapter 2, to the list of New Testament Prophets.  For me it comes down to two criteria.  Does the Prophet bring a message from God to a person(s),whether by way of reinforcement, a new teaching, or a prediction? Does the Prophet manifest the works of God?   A prophet must experience God.  A prophet must express the will of God in words and works.

Removed the paragraph on dispensationalism as it was unclear, no reference for the phrase “most of Christianity”, and lumps The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints incorrectly into a Protestant denomination. (If this section was meant to show that the LDS church teach a form of dispensationalism, then it should go under the LDS concept of a prophet) But mainly it seems this section just seems to be placed here and does not flow well. 

I also included Joseph Smith as a false prophet under the Christian concept of a prophet for the following reasons. 1. No mainline Christian denomination (from Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, etc, consider Joseph Smith a prophet. 2. Joseph Smith’s taught different theology about God, Jesus, Salvation than what is taught in the Bible. 3. Very few if any of his prophecies came true. 4. Unlike the Bible there is no historical proof of any of the events or cities mentioned in the Book of Mormon.

I qualified the statements about what &quot;most Christians believe&quot; to &quot;some Christians believe&quot; because it's an unsupported statement.  I also added some qualification and clarification about why some Christians may point to Joseph Smith as a false prophet in a way that introduces the topic without getting into the argument of who's a real prophet and who's not.  Finally, I added some more information about what latter-day saints consider our prophet and ancient prophets to be.  I wanted to add that mormons consider themselves Christians, but it didn't seem like it would flow, and there's probably a better page for it elsewhere.Adambryant 20:12, 19 March 2006 (UTC)adambryant

== discussed &amp; unreferenced passage ==

I rm the subsection titled &quot;The Direct Worship concept of prophet&quot; which stated that: [[Direct Worship]] teaches that God is equally accessible to all mankind, and that God has ordained only one universally common mode of worship for all mankind to follow. As such, any follower of Direct Worship can obtain enlightenment from God provided a certain level of sacrifices is met and that these sacrifices are performed ''directly'' in honor of God only. Consequently, prophets in Direct Worship are accorded a normal human status, but are recognised to have received divine revelation as a reward for performing significant prayers and sacrifices.&quot;.

::In numerous [[religion]]s, including [[Abrahamic religion]]s, [[Jah]] religions, [[Sikhism]], and many forms of [[Paganism]], a '''prophet''' is an intermediary with a [[deity]], particularly someone who speaks for the deity or interprets the deity's will or mind. A prophet usually operates through some means of [[divination]], [[channeling]], or [[extra-sensory perception]], and the prophet's pronouncements in the name of a deity are sometimes called [[revelation]]. Some utterances foretelling the future may be interpreted as having been [[prophecy|prophesies]]. Some &quot;prophecies&quot; seem to have been made after the event; these are given the technical name ''[[vaticinium ex eventu|vaticinia ex eventu]]''.

Your attack on the person here - labling people &quot;vandals&quot; - is inappropriate.  This is not vandalism, it is a difference of opinion.  Wikipedia says &quot;Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Apparent bad-faith edits that do not make their bad-faith nature inarguably explicit are not considered vandalism at Wikipedia. For example, adding a personal opinion once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated.&quot;  [[User:131.238.30.195|131.238.30.195]] 21:03, 24 May 2007 (UTC)


What about going to that mat? Contrast and compare your claims with scripture.
:God said to Moses:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.&quot; {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Exodus|chapter=4|verse=12}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Moses protested, saying he didn't speak to others well. So God called Aaron, via his prophet Moses, to be Moses' spokesman. Then He drew a parallel between the two sets of relationships: God to Moses, and Moses to Aaron.
:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.&quot;{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Exodus|chapter=4|verse=15-16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:God spoke to Moses face to face {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Exodus|chapter=33|verse=11}}, and Isaiah saw God {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Isaiah|chapter=6|verse=5}}, as did others.

:To the prophet Ezekiel, God said:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and ''thou shalt say'' unto them, ''Thus saith the Lord God''...&quot;{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ezekiel|chapter=3|verse=27}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Further, in {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Ezekiel|chapter=33|verse=1-19}}, God teaches Ezekiel the role of a prophet: he is to warn the wicked from sin, comparing Ezekiel to the watchman who, at the peril of his own soul, must blow the trumpet when the enemy appears.

:So the statement: &quot;a prophet is a person who has directly encountered God, of whose intentions he can then speak as if he were God himself&quot; is succinct and accurate. 

:By the way, associating the process of revelation from God with such evil and/or spurious means as divination, channeling or ESP demonstrates a gross and presumptuous lack of understanding of the process of revelation - at the very least.  &quot;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&quot; {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Isaiah|chapter=55|verse=9}}

==POV issues==
In the same vein as the two comments directly above this one, I think the lead is problematic in numerous ways, especially concerning the [[Sibyl|Sybilline oracles]] and the implications of ''&quot;a prophet (or prophetess) is a person who has directly encountered God&quot;''. The Sibylline oracles were primarily pagan and hardly monotheists. I think that there is some very heavy Abrahamic POV in this entry. [[Zoroaster]] is suspiciously absent as well. I think that we should use [[Rudolf Otto]]'s term [[numinous]] in place of &quot;God&quot; in the lead, and some of the material should be redacted for tone and POV. - [[User:WeniWidiWiki|WeniWidiWiki]] 20:29, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

I didn't intend to imply that it was finished - I intended to start off with what I consider a neutral title sentence and then discuss a neutral overview for the lede here on the talk page. Feel free to add NPOV material. I will be adding material on [[Sibyl]] and the [[Voluspa]] to the article directly (which are not Abrahamic or monotheistic) and later [[Zoroaster]] (who is not Abrahamic, but *is* monotheistic) so please keep that in mind. The usage of &quot;God&quot; is not consistent with Jewish usage, and most definitely not consistent with historical pagan usage. This is the lede before I modified it:
:''In [[religion]], a '''prophet''' (or ''' prophetess''') is a [[person]] who has directly encountered [[God]], of whose intentions he or she can then speak as if a formal representative of God. Those who are not prophets are then urged to take seriously the divinely revealed word as an act of faithfulness to God. When a prophet is held to be genuine, new religions may be adopted, based on the prophet's teachings, and on their interpretations. A prophet often operates through some means of [[divination]] or [[channeling]]. The process of receiving a message from God (or 'The [[Gods]]' or '[[angels]] of God') is usually known as [[prophecy]] or [[revelation]], and in this sense, the terms are synonymous.''
Any suggestions or ideas which adhere to [[WP:NPOV]] would be appreciated. - [[User:WeniWidiWiki|WeniWidiWiki]] 18:37, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

Well, this is the version as it now stands. Anyone want to discuss this, or is this acceptable?
:''In [[religion]], a '''prophet''' (or ''' prophetess''') is a [[person]] who has directly encountered the [[numinous]] and serves as an intermediary with man for the [[Divinity|divine]]. Prophets existed in many ancient cultures, including the [[Sibyl|Sybilline]] and [[Oracle_of_Delphi#Oracle|Delphic Oracles]] in [[Ancient Greece]], the [[Völuspá]] in [[Old Norse]], [[Zoroaster]] in [[Persia]], and many others. In [[Abrahamic religion]], a prophet is seen as a person who has encountered, and speaks as a formal representative of, [[God]]; they are seen to found a new religion based on their teachings from God.'' 

I changed &quot;man&quot; to &quot;humanity,&quot; minor point.  I do think the sentence is awkward, and would say &quot;between humanity and the divine,&quot; but did not want to change that as others might think it implied different content.  I did change last line to SOME prophets are seen as founding new religions.  I don't think that is accurate of most prophets in the Abrahamic tradition... the Hebrew prophets are by far the majority and did not found new religoins.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/131.238.201.48|131.238.201.48]] ([[User talk:131.238.201.48|talk]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;

:Hi, I'm the one who introduced the phrase &quot;a prophet is someone who, having encountered God, is able then to speak of His intention.&quot; I had hoped in this to have stated the essential in as few words as possible.   Someone else added to this &quot;as if he were God himself,&quot; which certainly is &quot;nonsense.&quot;
 
:I think there is a confusion here between ecclesiastical efficaciousness and the nature of prophecy. What makes a person a prophet has nothing to do with the extent to which he or she is admitted to being a prophet, able to act as intermediary, formal representative etc. A prophet is someone, simply, who HAS had the relevent encounter (not necessary to say that the person BELIEVES to have had such an encounter), and all the relevent theology is contained in the idea of God, whatever that is, having a knowable intention, generally of a moral or eschatological character. &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Eliotistic|Eliotistic]] ([[User talk:Eliotistic|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Eliotistic|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

==What happened??==

The article in its present form (or rather, before I restored the intro), strongly implies that the term &quot;prophet&quot; originates with Judaism and the Old Testament, an implication which is broadly and specifically inaccurate. For instance, Nabu-Kudu-Reser ([[Nebuchadrezzar]]) means &quot;the prophet guards my territory,&quot; --and he wasn't an Israelite, and the &quot;nabu&quot; in his name isn't referring to an Israelite prophet.  Comparing the article with its form several months ago, it seems as if an apologist for just one faction of one religion or philosophical outlook has co-opted the article as a platform for a personal view about the nature of prophecy, and prophets.  It isn't accurate, for example, to assert that many or most prophets &quot;are unremarkable&quot; except for the &quot;gift&quot; of prophecy: On the contrary, prophets or alleged prophets in every culture and religion and nation and society have been remarkable men and women. [[User:70.242.78.37|70.242.78.37]] 22:55, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

:Is there a source that suggests Nebuchadrezzar predated Moses? The first Nebuchadrezzar is dated from about 1146 BC to 1123 BC, but I know of no record that suggests he was a prophet. Moses expereinced his first revelation in 1314 BCE. The second Nebuchadrezzar II is known from the Book of Daniel, but Daniel was not a prophet and certainly not Nebuchadrezzar II (c 630-562 BC).

*the various churches do not accept prophecy derived from Judaism as messages directed to Christians, - had Christianity accepted the prophecy derived from Judaism as being directed to Christians also, the Christians would be bound to all the commandments in the [[Torah]] and not the ten currently accepted

== Prophets and idolatry ==

Under a header like the one above, I think it should be added a paragraph like the one beneath:

Foreigners to the sect of any particular prophet, may consider worshipping the prophet to be idolatry. Such worshipping includes for instance, naming of children within the sect after the prophet, pilgrimage to the tomb or other connected site, displaying pictures and figures, singing songs or reciting texts glorifying the prophet.

== Schizophrenia Paragraph ==

I would like to clarify that this paragraph was removed in part because in reading the source that particular conclusion is not explicitly drawn, rather merely that the voices are considered omnipotent and omniscient. While this does factually mean that conditions are met, the conclusion drawn is not from the source itself, but rather  [[WP:SYN|improper synthesis]]. 

Furthermore, the unsourced first part of it I removed, as it wasn't part of the original source to begin with, and moreover the language was inappropriately assertive of a subjective nature to prophethood. A neutral approach to this is rather to indicate that there are disputes to the definition and classification of the term and [[WP:CITE|cite sources]], something that we should be doing already. I do think that something on this nature should be included in the introduction, but Wikipedia policy would indicate not this particular content in the manner presented. [[User:Peter Deer|Peter Deer]] ([[User talk:Peter Deer|talk]]) 19:36, 9 November 2009 (UTC)
:While the paragraph currently reflects the web source given, per NPOV the assertion that the label of Prophet is [[subjective]] rather than disputed is contentious.

:::There are several problems with the Schizophrenia paragraph in the lede.  The lede should only contain a summary of information desctibed in greater detail in the article's main body.  This paragraph does not qualify.  Several of the assertions are not supported at all with citations (violations of NPOV and NOR), and the web site appears not to qualify as a reliable source (it is self-published, not peer reviewed, and not subject to external editorial control from a recognized body).  The citation that is a reliable source is concerned specifically with auditory hallucinations and is not immediately concerned with whether or not prophets suffer from Schizophrenia; therefore, its current use is improper synthesis.  If sufficient reliable sources can be cited, there may be a place in the article for a section discussing the hypothetical relationship between prophetic claims and Schizophrenia, but as currently written, this paragraph is far from meeting the standards for encyclopedic content.  Every assertion that might be contentious should be supported with a citation of a reliable source or it should be removed, per Wikipedia policy.

A better wording would be, &quot;According to P Chadwick and M Birchwood, auditory hallucinations are consistent with schizophrenia.&quot;  The wording &quot;being able to communicate with God&quot; is much too broad when the reliable source only considers auditory hallucinations.    If this topic is to be restored to the article, it should be in a neutrally worded, well sourced section separate from the lede, and it should be in accordance with the consensus of the discussion.[[User:Fishgeek|Fishgeek]] ([[User talk:Fishgeek|talk]]) 17:31, 7 December 2009 (UTC)

== what is to come? ==

An editor has twice added text asserting that prophecies (in the sense of the first paragraph of the lead) are generally about what is to come: about the future.  This is not at all true in general, as the article itself makes clear.  Prophets in the Hebrew Scriptures are often not at all about the future, but instead about correct understanding of the present, or delivering a moral message. The sections on Islam and Bahai don't show anything about &quot;what is to come&quot; as being particularly associated with prophets; likewise the LDS conception of a prophet doesn't mention or talk about the future tense.  Being concerned with &quot;what is to come&quot; is part of some prophets in some religions, but is ''not'' generally about &quot;what greater events, changes, or destinies&quot; are to come.

== Largest Christian Group That Believes In Prophecy ==

The article states: &quot;While many Christian sects recognize the existence of a &quot;modern-day&quot; prophet, the largest denomination by far is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or &quot;Mormons&quot;), who claim that God still communicates with mankind through prophecy.[40]&quot;

Putting aside that issue of whether Mormons are &quot;Christians,&quot; this statement is factually incorrect in its major claim. The Seventh-day Adventist Church believes God still communicates through prophecy and has ~2 million more members than the LDS do. I suggest this portion of the article be amended or deleted.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.227.91.5|98.227.91.5]] ([[User talk:98.227.91.5|talk]]) 16:48, 3 June 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: The SDAs believe that God still communicates through prophecy--but then, the same is true quite broadly--but what about the ''existence of a &quot;modern-day&quot; prophet''?  [[User:Tb|Tb]] ([[User talk:Tb|talk]]) 16:53, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

== Is Mormonism Christian As Wikipedia Claims?  (see Wikipedia footnote #39)==

Note: I am Not attacking. There is a difference between Truth and Falsehood. By definition Mormonism doesn't meet the term, &quot;Christian&quot;

James F Robey (Facebook) -  The Mormon Church IS a non-Christian &quot;Cult&quot; because they deny essential Christian teaching that makes Christianity &quot;Christianity&quot; In humility I can say I'm an expert on Mormonism and have demonstrated this before countless Mormon missionaries. Mormons believe that Jesus and Lucifer were &quot;brothers&quot; Mormons believes in three other so-called Holy books besides the Bible, 1) Book of Mormon 2) Doctrine and Covenants 3) Pearl of Great Price. Mormons believe in &quot;Eternal Progression&quot; that when we die we will become God (His equal). Mormons believe that Adam is God (via Brigham Young) Mormons believe that Jesus was married and had many wives (poor Jesus...:/ Friends, let the Mormons start any religion they want too, but when they put the label &quot;Christian&quot; on it, them are fightin words! If Mormonism is Christian then Christianity is lost. But now it's time to &quot;fight for the faith that was once delivered to the saints&quot; (Jude 3)  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.197.81.29|98.197.81.29]] ([[User talk:98.197.81.29|talk]]) 05:27, 28 January 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The footnote is now #46 and reads &quot;Whether or not the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is considered a Christian denomination is subject to dispute, see [[Mormonism and Christianity]].&quot; As the footnote points out there is a dispute over Mormons being Christian and it's not correct to say that Wikipedia claims that the LDS are Christian. Anyway, this is not the article to be disputing that. As the footnote points out, you want the &quot;Mormonism and Christianity&quot; article. By the way I suggest you find a more [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]] than someone on Facebook.

==Move a paragraph to disambiguation==
Quote: &quot;In the late 20th century the appellation of &quot;prophet&quot; has been used to refer to individuals particularly successful at analysis in the field of economics, such as in the derogatory &quot;prophet of greed&quot;. Alternatively, social commentators who suggest escalating crisis are often called &quot;prophets of doom.&quot;
This should be moved to the disambiguation page as it is off topic of &quot;prophet&quot; in the religious sense of the main article.[[User:Zapzooma|Zapzooma]] ([[User talk:Zapzooma|talk]]) 03:20, 12 February 2011 (UTC)

== Order in which religions are discussed ==

Not a big deal either way, but wouldn't it make more sense to list the first four religions discussed here chronologically (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Bahá'í) rather than alphabetically?  By &quot;chronologically&quot;, I mean in the order of each religion's writings about their prophets.  I.e. Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Koran, and the foundation texts of Bahá'í.   The rationale for chronological discussion is that each of these traditions builds on preceding ones.  For example, both New Testament and Koran have interpretations of the stories of the prophets first set forth in the Hebrew Bible. (I haven't considered prophents grouped together in next section of article and express no opinion on order of these, although same logic may apply.) --[[User:Sjsilverman|Sjsilverman]] ([[User talk:Sjsilverman|talk]]) 12:17, 10 January 2012 (UTC)

:: Seems like things in wikipedia shift order back and forth. Is there any kind of general consensus across wikipedia articles about the order of the religions? Otherwise it keeps shifting like the wind. [[User:Smkolins|Smkolins]] ([[User talk:Smkolins|talk]]) 11:53, 19 January 2012 (UTC)
::::Yes, appears from the way most Abrahamic-religion topic articles are structured that there is a general consensus across the WP Religion articles to place the Abrahamic religions in chronological order. Even this discussion is evidence of that, I clicked Talk to add almost verbatim the same comment SJSilverman added.

== Misidentification of Greek oracles, Germanic volvas, etc as &quot;Prophets&quot; ==

The use of oracles and volvas in these pagan religions does not in any way jive with the standard definitiion of prophet (say, the kind that arose among the Jews, Christians, Muslims, etc)-- I am removing them from the introductory paragraph.

It is a fairly common attempt of shamans to attempt to &quot;see&quot; into the world of the gods, and foretell the future.  They had to do all sorts of rituals usually to be able to do this.  Still, an oracle or a volva was considered prescient ''related to that one attempted ritual act of seeing,'' and it is in this way that they were paid attention to.

They were not simply exalted as permanent human representatives that a singular God with One Word of Truth spoke to.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:GlennBecksiPod|GlennBecksiPod]] ([[User talk:GlennBecksiPod|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/GlennBecksiPod|contribs]]) 01:31, 9 July 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
