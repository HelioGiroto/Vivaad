A '''hymn''' is a type of [[song]], usually [[religious]], specifically written for the purpose of praise, adoration or [[prayer]], and typically addressed to a [[deity]] or deities, or to a prominent figure or [[personification]]. The word ''hymn'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}} (''hymnos''), which means &quot;a song of praise.&quot; Collections of hymns are known as [[hymnal]]s or hymnbooks.

==Origins==
Ancient hymns include the [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'', composed by [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]; the ''[[Vedas]]'', a collection of hymns in the tradition of [[Hinduism]]; and the [[Psalms]], a collection of songs from [[Judaism]]. The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the [[Homeric Hymns]], a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC, praising deities of the [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religions]]. Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns ({{lang|grc|''Ὕμνοι''}}) by the [[Alexandria]]n poet [[Callimachus]].

[[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writers began applying the term {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}}, or ''hymnus'' in [[Latin]], to [[Christian]] songs of praise, and frequently used the word as a synonym for &quot;[[Psalms|psalm]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}}, Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 8th edition 1897, 1985 printing), p. 1849; entry on 'hymnus,' Lewis and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1879, 1987 printing), p. 872.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian hymnody ==
Originally modeled on the [[Psalms]] and other poetic passages (commonly referred to as &quot;[[canticle]]s&quot;) in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise  to the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[God]]. Many refer to [[Jesus Christ]] either directly or indirectly.

Since the earliest times, Christians have sung &quot;psalms and hymns and spiritual songs&quot;, both in private devotions and in corporate worship ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:30|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse|1|Cor|14:26|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:19|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Colossians|3:16|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||James|5:13|nrsv}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Revelation|5:8-10|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Revelation|14:1-5|nrsv}}).

One definition of a hymn is &quot;...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper's attitude toward God or God's purposes in human life.  It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes and these are used on holy days such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and the Feast of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]], or during particular seasons such as [[Advent]] and [[Lent]]. Others are used to instill reverence to the [[Holy Bible]] or to celebrate Christian practices such as the [[eucharist]] or [[baptism]]. Some hymns praise or address individual [[saints]], particularly the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]; such hymns are particularly prevalent in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and to some extent &quot;High Church&quot; [[Anglicanism]].

A writer of hymns is known as a ''hymnist'' or ''hymnodist'', and the practice of singing hymns is called ''hymnody''; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period (e.g. &quot;nineteenth century Methodist hymnody&quot; would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the 19th century). A collection of hymns is called a ''[[hymnal]]'' or ''hymnary''. These may or may not include music. A student of hymnody is called a ''hymnologist'', and the scholarly study of hymns, hymnists and hymnody is [[hymnology]]. The music to which a hymn may be sung is a [[hymn tune]].    

In many Evangelical churches, traditional songs are classified as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns.  The reason for this distinction is unclear, but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began with the [[Jesus movement]] and [[Jesus music]].

=== Music and accompaniment ===
In ancient and medieval times, [[stringed instruments]] such as the [[harp]], [[lyre]] and [[lute]] were used with psalms and hymns.

Since there is a lack of [[musical notation]] in early writings,&lt;ref&gt;Entry on &quot;Hymn: 4. Hymn Sources and Transmission,&quot; Warren Anderson, et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/ Grove Music Online] (2007-2009) (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised. During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of [[Gregorian chant]] or plainsong. This type was sung in unison, in one of eight [[church modes]], and most often by monastic choirs. While they were written originally in [[Latin]], many have been translated; a familiar example is the 4th century ''[[Of the Father's Heart Begotten]]'' sung to the 11th century plainsong ''Divinum Mysterium''.

==== Western church ====
Later hymnody in the [[Western church]] introduced four-part vocal [[harmony]] as the norm, adopting major and minor keys, and came to be led by [[organ (music)|organ]] and choir. It shares many elements with [[European classical music|classical music]].

Today, except for choirs, more musically inclined congregations and ''[[a cappella]]'' congregations, hymns are typically sung in unison.  In some cases complementary full settings for organ are also published, in others organists and other accompanists are expected to transcribe the four-part vocal score for their instrument of choice.

To illustrate [[Protestant]] usage, in the traditional services and liturgies of the [[Methodist]] churches, which are based upon [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] practice, hymns are sung (often accompanied by an organ) during the [[processional hymn|processional]] to the altar, during the receiving of the [[Eucharist]], during the [[recessional hymn|recessional]], and sometimes at other points during the service. These hymns can be found in the [[United Methodist Hymnal]]. The [[Doxology]] is also sung after the tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar.

[[Contemporary worship|Contemporary Christian worship]], as often found in [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Pentecostalism]], may include the use of [[contemporary worship music]] played with [[electric guitar]]s and the [[drum kit]], sharing many elements with [[rock music]].

Other groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment, citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence, and adhere to an unaccompanied ''[[a cappella]]'' congregational singing of hymns. These groups include the 'Brethren' (often both 'Open' and 'Exclusive'), the [[Churches of Christ]], [[Mennonites]], [[Primitive Baptists]], and certain Reformed churches, although during the last century or so, several of these, such as the [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] have abandoned this stance.

====Eastern church====
[[Eastern Christianity]] (the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches) have a very rich and ancient hymnographical tradition. 

Eastern chant is almost always [[a cappella]], and instrumental accompaniment is rare. The central form of chant in the Eastern Orthodoxy is [[Byzantine Chant]], which is used to chant all forms of liturgical worship. Exceptions include the [[Coptic Orthodox]] tradition which makes use of the [[sistrum]], and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], which also uses [[drum]]s, [[cymbals]] and other instruments on certain occasions.

=== The development of Christian hymnody ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]], in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms, defined the Christian hymn thus: &quot;''Hymnus est laus Dei cum cantico; canticum autem exultatio mentis de aeternis habita, prorumpens in vocem''.&quot; (&quot;A hymn is the praise of God with song; a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things, bursting forth in the voice.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Protestant Reformation]] resulted in two conflicting attitudes to hymns. One approach, the [[regulative principle of worship]], favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, considered anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were ripped out of churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as [[exclusive psalmody]]. Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the [[Scottish Presbyterian|Presbyterian churches of western Scotland]]. 

The other Reformation approach, the [[normative principle of worship]], produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing. [[Martin Luther]] is notable not only as a reformer, but as the author of many hymns including ''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'' (''[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]''), which is sung today even by Catholics, and ''[[Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ]]'' (''Praise be to You, Jesus Christ'') for Christmas. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the [[Unitas Fratrum]]. Count [[Zinzendorf]], the Lutheran leader of the [[Moravian Church]] in the 18th century wrote some 2,000 hymns. The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly [[Psalm]]s; [[Isaac Watts]] followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Watts (1674–1748), whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus.  His father invited him to see what he could do about it;  the result was Watts' first hymn, &quot;Behold the glories of the Lamb.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Relying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church.  Isaac Watts has been called &quot;the father of English hymnody,&quot;  but Erik Routley sees him more as &quot;the liberator of English hymnody,&quot; because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later writers took even more freedom, some even including  [[allegory]] and [[metaphor]] in their texts.

[[Charles Wesley]]'s hymns spread Methodist [[theology]], not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing one's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. Wesley wrote:
:''Where shall my wondering soul begin?''
:''How shall I all to heaven aspire?''
:''A slave redeemed from death and sin,''
:''A brand plucked from eternal fire,''
:''How shall I equal triumphs raise,''
:''Or sing my great deliverer's praise.''

Wesley's contribution, along with the [[Second Great Awakening]] in [[United States|America]] led to a new style called [[Gospel music|gospel]], and a new explosion of sacred music writing with [[Fanny Crosby]], [[Lina Sandell]], [[Philip Bliss]], [[Ira D. Sankey]], and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp meetings, and evangelistic crusades.  The tune style or form is technically designated &quot;gospel songs&quot; as distinct from hymns.  Gospel songs generally include a refrain (or chorus) and usually (though not always) a faster tempo than the hymns.  As examples of the distinction, &quot;[[Amazing Grace]]&quot; is a hymn (no refrain), but &quot;[[How Great Thou Art (hymn)|How Great Thou Art]]&quot; is a gospel song.  During the 19th century the gospel-song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and, to a lesser but still definite extent, in Roman Catholicism; the gospel-song genre is unknown in the worship ''per se'' by Eastern Orthodox churches, which rely exclusively on traditional chants (a type of hymn).

The [[Methodist Revival]] of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn-writing in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], which continued into the first half of the 19th century. The most prominent names among Welsh hymn-writers are [[William Williams Pantycelyn]] and [[Ann Griffiths]]. The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn tune composition and choir singing in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Wyn James, 'The Evolution of the Welsh Hymn', in ''Dissenting Praise'', ed. I. Rivers &amp; D. L. Wykes (OUP, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Along with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from [[Mozart]] to [[Monteverdi]], the [[Catholic Church]] continued to produce many popular hymns such as [[Lead, Kindly Light]], [[Silent Night]], O Sacrament Divine and Faith of our Fathers. 

Many churches today use [[contemporary worship music]] which includes a range of styles often influenced by [[popular music]]. This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants (see [[contemporary worship]]).  This is not new; the Christian [[Contemporary Christian Music|pop music]] style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.

This long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn (usually describing God), [[contemporary worship music]] (often directed to God) and [[gospel music]] (expressions of one's personal experience of God). This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns. It is a matter of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.

====American developments====
[[African-American]]s developed a rich hymnody from [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s during times of slavery to the modern, lively black gospel style. The first influences of African American Culture into hymns came from Slave Songs of the United States a collection of slave hymns complied by William Francis Allen who had difficulty pinning them down from the oral tradition, and though he succeeded, he points out the awe inspiring effect of the hymns when sung in by their originators.&lt;ref&gt;Music, David. Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996. 179/185-186/192/199/206. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to Thomas Symmes{{who|date=January 2011}} a new idea of how to sing hymns spread throughout the churches in which anyone would sing a hymn any way they felt led to; this was opposed by the views of Symmes colleagues{{who|date=January 2011}} who felt it was &quot;like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time.&quot;{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[William Billings]], a singing school teacher, created the first tune book with only American born compositions.  Within his books, Billings did not put as much emphasis on &quot;common measure&quot;{{clarify|date=January 2011}} which was the typical way hymns were sung, but he attempted &quot;to have a Sufficiency in each measure&quot;{{clarify|date=January 2011}}. Boston's [[Handel and Haydn Society]] aimed at raising the level of church music in America, publishing their &quot;Collection of Church Music&quot;.{{when|date=January 2011}} In the late 19th century [[Ira D. Sankey]] and [[Dwight L. Moody]] developed the relatively new subcategory of [[Gospel hymn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Music, David. ''Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings''. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymn metres===
{{main|Metre (hymn)}}
The ''metre'' indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each [[stanza]] of a hymn. This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate [[hymn tune]] for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of metres (syllable count and stress patterns). Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses on the words in each line. Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.

The metre is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as &quot;87.87.87&quot;, which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The metre can also be described by initials; L.M. indicates long metre, which is 88.88 (four lines, each eight syllables long); S.M. is short metre (66.86); C.M. is common metre (86.86), while D.L.M., D.S.M. and D.C.M. (the &quot;D&quot; stands for double) are similar to their respective single metres except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
