&quot;and unlike Luke, who traces&quot; Yeshua's &quot;ancestry back to Adam, father of the human race, he traces it only to Abraham, father of the Jews&quot;
Abraham was the father of the Hebrews, Jews are the people of Kingdom of Yehuda/Judea the desert-mountain southern part of Eretz Yisra'el.

== Author ==

On what basis, other than tradition, is the author &quot;most likely St. Matthew&quot;? If none can be offered, it should be removed from the lead or changed to ''possibly St. Matthew''.--[[User:Jeffro77|&lt;span style='color:#365F91'&gt;'''Jeffro'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:#FFC000'&gt;''77''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Jeffro77|talk]]) 23:29, 14 October 2011 (UTC)

:The section [[Gospel_of_Matthew#Authorship_and_sources]] says that most scholars doubt Matthew's authorship so I'd tend to agree. [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 23:38, 14 October 2011 (UTC)

== error in article ==

The author stated that the apostles were eventually sent to the Gentiles.  However, the only apostle that was sent to the Gentiles was Paul.  This is stated many times and was clarified in Galatians 2:6-21, that Paul was to go to the Gentiles and Peter and the other 11 apostles were to go to the Jew only.
This is the most glaring error that I see but if anyone cares, I would be happy to clarify a few others.
thanks,
bob

:Are you referring to this sentence: &quot;Matthew's gospel tells how Israel's Messiah is rejected by Israel, withdraws into the circle of his disciples, passes judgment on those who have rejected him so that &quot;Israel&quot; becomes the non-believing &quot;Jews&quot;, and sends the disciples instead to the gentiles.&quot;, or another?  [[User:Carl.bunderson|carl bunderson]] [[User talk:Carl.bunderson|(talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Carl.bunderson|(contributions)]] 20:15, 28 December 2011 (UTC)

Matthew 28:16-20:
''16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. ... 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 '''''Therefore go and make disciples of all nations''''', baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”''

== Another error ==

According to http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/index.php?search=circumc&amp;searchtype=all&amp;version1=48&amp;language1=en&amp;spanbegin=1&amp;spanend=73&amp;startnumber=26 and http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/index.php?search=gentile&amp;searchtype=all&amp;version1=48&amp;language1=en&amp;spanbegin=1&amp;spanend=73&amp;startnumber=26 , the Gospel of Matthew does not mention anything about circumcision nor about being circumcised. Therefore the claim about allowing uncircumcised people in the church seems phony. [[User:Tgeorgescu|Tgeorgescu]] ([[User talk:Tgeorgescu|talk]]) 17:45, 28 May 2012 (UTC)
:I have read the Alison text cited (it is available online at Google Books) and it fully supports the statements preceding. [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 19:07, 28 May 2012 (UTC)

== Matthew's sources ==

Burkett (pp.175-6) says the author drew on three &quot;primary&quot; sources - the article bases on that. I assume by &quot;primary&quot; he means &quot;main&quot; rather than &quot;original&quot; or &quot;first-hand&quot;. Nothing about this being a &quot;majority&quot; view. If you know of any other view, please let us know - but so far as I'm aware there isn't any other. [[User:PiCo|PiCo]] ([[User talk:PiCo|talk]]) 08:02, 13 September 2012 (UTC)</text>
