The church considers itself within the tradition of [[Western Christianity]] and dates its [[History of the Church of England|formal establishment]] principally to the mission to England by [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine of Canterbury]] in AD 597.

As a result of Augustine's mission, the church in England came under the authority of the Pope. Initially prompted by a dispute over the annulment of the marriage of [[Henry VIII]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]], the Church of England [[Schism (religion)|separated]] from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 and became the established church by an Act of Parliament in the [[Act of Supremacy]], beginning a series of events known as the [[English Reformation]].&lt;ref name=KH8-RC-00/&gt; During the reign of Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], the Church was fully [[Second Statute of Repeal|restored under Rome]] in 1555. Papal authority was again explicitly rejected after the accession of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] when the [[Act of Supremacy 1558|Act of Supremacy of 1558]] was passed. Catholic and Reformed factions vied for determining the doctrines and worship of the church. This ended with the 1558 [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Elizabethan settlement]], which developed the understanding that the church was to be both [[Four Marks of the Church|Catholic]] and [[English Reformation|Reformed]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/faith/anglican/ Being an Anglican]. Cofe.anglican.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Catholic''' in that it views itself as a part of the universal church of [[Jesus Christ]] in unbroken continuity with the early [[Apostolic Age|apostolic]] church. This is expressed in its emphasis on the teachings of the early [[Church Fathers]], as formalised in the [[Apostles Creed|Apostles']], [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]], and [[Athanasian creed]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cofe.anglican.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/canons/church.pdf Canons of the Church of England]. Cofe.anglican.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Reformed''' in that it has been shaped by some of the doctrinal principles of the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]], in particular in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] and the [[Book of Common Prayer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cofe.anglican.org&quot;/&gt;

During the 17th century, political and religious disputes raised the [[Puritan]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] faction to control of the church, but this ended with the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]]. The contemporary Church of England still continues to contain several doctrinal strands, now generally known as [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Evangelical]], which reflect the early divisions. In recent times, tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|women's ordination]] and [[Homosexuality and Anglicanism|homosexuality within the church]]. The Church of England has ordained women as priests since 1994 and is in the process of considering the consecration of female bishops.

Since the Reformation, the Church of England has used an English [[liturgy]]. ''The Book of Common Prayer'' was based on original writings and translations from the [[Latin liturgy|Latin services]] by [[Thomas Cranmer]]. This liturgy has been updated and modernised at various times. The church also adopted congregational singing of hymns and psalms.

The governing structure of the church is based on the traditional parishes which are gathered into dioceses presided over by a bishop. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of All England and a focus of unity for the whole Anglican Communion worldwide. The [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] is the legislative body for the church and comprises bishops, clergy and laity. As it is the established church, its measures must be approved of by both [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Houses of Parliament]]. This is done by the General Synod referring measures decided on to the Ecclesiastical Committee of Parliament, which is made up of 15 peers from the [[House of Lords]] selected by the [[Lord Speaker]] and 15 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] selected by the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. This committee then produces a report on the proposed measure. The measure and report are then presented to Parliament. Both houses must agree to pass a resolution passing the measure before it can be presented to the Sovereign for Royal Assent and become law. 

While the Church of England is the established church in England and the [[Crown dependencies]], its territory does not extend to the other [[countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the United Kingdom]], who have their own separate but disestablished [[national church]]es. The [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Church in Wales]] were separated from the English Church in 1869&lt;ref name=irishchurchact&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Church Act 1869|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1869/42/enacted|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 1914&lt;ref name=wales-heritage&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Heritage: Facing Difficulties|url=http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/life/heritage/awi/part7.php|work=Church in Wales website|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, and both are autonomous churches in the Anglican communion; due to different historical origins, Scotland's national church, the [[Church of Scotland]], is [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], but the smaller [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] (itself an offshoot of the Church of Scotland) is in the Anglican communion.&lt;ref name=episcopal-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History: The Revolution|url=http://www.scotland.anglican.org/index.php/about/history_chapter/8_the_revolution/|work=Scottish Episcopal Church website|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
{{Main|History of the Church of England}}

===Early history===
According to tradition, Christianity arrived in Britain in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first]] or [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], during which time southern Britain became part of the [[Roman Empire]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. The earliest historical evidence of Christianity among the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] is found in the writings of such early Christian Fathers as [[Tertullian]] and [[Origen]] in the first years of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]], although the first Christian communities probably were established some decades earlier{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. Three [[Romano-British]] bishops, including [[Restitutus]], are known to have been present at the [[Council of Arles]] in 314{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. Others attended the [[Council of Sardica]] in 347 and that of [[Council of Rimini|Ariminum]] in 360, and a number of references to the church in [[Roman Britain]] are found in the writings of [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]] Christian fathers. Britain was the home of [[Pelagius]], who opposed [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s doctrine of [[original sin]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Anglo-Saxon Christianity===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon Christianity}}
While Christianity was long established as the religion of the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] at the time of the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]], Christian Britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|native paganism]]. Consequently, in 597, [[Pope Gregory I]] sent Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]] from Rome to evangelise the [[Angles]]. This event is known as the [[Gregorian mission]] and is the date the Church of England generally marks the beginning of its formal history. With the help of Christians already residing in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], Augustine established his church in [[Canterbury]], the capital of the Kingdom of [[Kent]], and became the first in the series of [[Archbishops of Canterbury]] in 598. A later archbishop, the Greek [[Theodore of Tarsus]], also contributed to the organisation of Christianity in England.

===Synod of Whitby and papal authority===

While some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the [[Synod of Whitby]], the Church in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Holden and Andrew Pinsent, ''The Catholic Gift to Civilisation'' (London: CTS), p. 13ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Queen [[Bertha of Kent]] was among the Christians in England who recognised papal authority before Augustine arrived&lt;ref&gt;D. Attwater, &quot;Ethelbert of Kent,&quot; in The Penguin Dictionary of Saints (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books), p.118&lt;/ref&gt; and Celtic Christians were carrying out missionary work with papal approval long before the Synod of Whitby.

[[Image:Hereford Cathedral Interior May 2004.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] is one of the church's 43 cathedrals, many with histories stretching back centuries.]]
The Synod of Whitby established the Roman date for Easter and the Roman style of monastic tonsure in Britain. This meeting of the ecclesiastics with Roman customs with local bishops was summoned in 664 at Saint Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Streanæshalch), later called Whitby Abbey. It was presided over by King Oswiu, who did not engage in the debate but made the final ruling.

===Secession from Rome===
In 1534 King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] separated the English Church from Rome.&lt;ref name=KH8-RC-00&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/english_reformation_01.shtml The English Reformation by Professor Andrew Pettegree]. Bbc.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; A theological separation had been foreshadowed by various movements within the English church such as [[Lollardy]], but the [[English Reformation]] gained political support when Henry VIII wanted an [[annulment]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] so he could marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. Pope [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], considering that the earlier marriage had been entered under a papal dispensation and how Catherine's nephew, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], might react to such a move, refused the annulment. Eventually, Henry, although theologically opposed to Protestantism, took the position of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Head of the Church of England]] to ensure the annulment of his marriage. He was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?theme=10026153 King Henry VIII (1491–1547)]. HistoryMole (2010-09-18).&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and, during his reign, Protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of the Church of England. Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw the trial for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics.

Under his son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], a more radical reformation proceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (1549 and 1552). These were based on the older liturgy but influenced by Protestant principles. The confession of the reformed Church of England was set out in the [[Forty-two Articles]] (later revised to thirty-nine). The reformation however was cut short by the death of the king. Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], who succeeded him, returned England again to the authority of the Pope, thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of England. During Mary's reign, many leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith. These are known as the [[Marian martyrs]] and the persecution has led to her nickname of &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;.

[[Image:Rochester cathedral stained glass 2.jpg|left|thumb|Stained glass window in [[Rochester Cathedral]], Kent]]
Mary also died childless and so it was left to the new regime of her half-sister Elizabeth to resolve the direction of the church. The settlement under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (from 1558), known as the [[Elizabethan Settlement]], developed the ''via media'' (middle way) character of the Church of England, a church moderately Reformed in doctrine, as expressed in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], but also emphasising continuity with the Catholic and Apostolic traditions of the [[Church Fathers]]. It was also an established church (constitutionally established by the state with the head of state as its supreme governor). The exact nature of the relationship between church and state would be a source of continued friction into the next century.

===Stuart period===
{{further|Stuart period}}
For the next century, through the reigns of [[James VI and I|James I]], who ordered the creation of what became known as the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=tC1kuaetNqoC&amp;dq=The+Diary+Of+Samuel+Ward,+A+Translator+Of+The+1611+King+James+Bible%E2%80%8E The Diary Of Samuel Ward: A Translator Of The 1611 King James Bible], edited by [[John Wilson Cowart]] and M. M. Knappen&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], culminating in the [[English Civil War]] and the Protectorate of [[Oliver Cromwell]], there were significant swings back and forth between two factions: the [[Puritans]] (and other radicals) who sought more far-reaching Protestant reforms, and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and Catholic practices. The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By Continental standards, the level of violence over religion was not high, but the casualties included King Charles I and Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]]. Under the Commonwealth and the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660, the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed, and [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate. The 39 Articles were replaced by the [[Westminster Confession]], the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship. Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of State Presbyterianism.

With the Restoration of Charles II, Parliament restored the Church of England to a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organization, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with the Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and those Puritans and Protestants who [[English Dissenters|dissented]] from the Anglican establishment, and Roman Catholics, too strong to be suppressed altogether, having to continue their existence outside the National Church rather than controlling it. Continuing official suspicion and legal restrictions continued well into the 19th century.

===19th century===
By the Fifth Article of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union with Ireland 1800]], the Church of England and [[Church of Ireland]] were united into &quot;one protestant episcopal church, to be called, the united church of England and Ireland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Laws of England'', p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Although this union was declared &quot;an essential and fundamental Part of the Union&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rahbarnes.demon.co.uk/Union/ActOfUnion%28Ireland%29.htm Article Fifth of &quot;An Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; 1800]. Rahbarnes.demon.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Irish Church Act 1869]] separated the Irish part of the Church again and disestablished it, the Act coming into effect on 1 January 1871.

===Overseas developments===
{{main|Anglican Communion}}
As the [[British Empire]] expanded, British colonists and colonial administrators took the established church doctrines and practices together with ordained ministry and formed overseas branches of the Church of England. As they developed or, beginning with the United States of America, became sovereign and/or independent states many of their churches became separate organizationally but remained linked to the Church of England through the [[Anglican Communion]].

==Doctrine and practice==
{{See also|Anglicanism|Anglican doctrine}}
[[Image:Canterbury Cathedral - Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the southwest. It houses the [[cathedra]] or throne of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. It is the [[mother church]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]] (east [[Kent]]) and the Church of England and also a focus for the [[Anglican Communion]].]]

Church of England doctrine can be summarised in its [[canon law]] as follows:

&quot;Of the doctrine of the Church of England&quot; (Canon A5):
&quot;The doctrine of the Church of England is grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and in such teachings of the ancient Fathers and Councils of the Church as are agreeable to the said Scriptures. In particular such doctrine is to be found in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, The Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordinal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cofe.anglican.org&quot; /&gt;

As the Church of England bases its teachings on the [[Holy Scriptures]], the ancient Catholic teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] and some of the doctrinal principles of the [[Protestant Reformation]] (as expressed in the [[39 Articles]] and other documents such as the [[Book of Homilies]]), Anglicanism can therefore be described as &quot;Reformed Catholic&quot; in character rather than Protestant. In practice, however, it is more mixed, with some Anglicans who emphasise the Catholic tradition and others who emphasise the Reformed tradition. These three &quot;parties&quot; in the Church of England are sometimes called [[high church]] (or [[Anglo-Catholic]]), [[low church]] (or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]]) and [[broad church]] (or Liberal). There is also a long history of more liberal or [[latitudinarian]] views and more conservative views in both the Anglo-Catholic and Evangelical branches of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/world/europe/archbishop-of-canterbury-rowan-williams-to-resign-at-end-of-year.html?pagewanted=all | work=New York Times | title=Archbishop of Canterbury to Step Down at End of Year | date=2012-03-16 | accessdate=2012-05-17 | first1=John | last1=Burns |first2=Alan |last2=Cowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/19/news/19iht-chur_0.html | work=New York Times | title=Anglican Leader Challenges Vatican Stand on Birth Control | date=1992-05-19 | accessdate=2012-05-17 | first1=Barry | last1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of church government, unlike many of the Protestant denominations it has retained [[episcopal polity|episcopal]] (bishop) leadership.[[File:Hooker-Statue.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] (1554–1600), one of the most influential figures in shaping Anglican theology and self-identity]]The teachings of [[Richard Hooker]], the 16th century divine, summarised the Anglican position well, affirming bishops as ancient, allowable and for the good of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Hooker's ecclesiastical polity: http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/history/hooker/iss_history_hooker_carter-position.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In many people's eyes today{{fix|text=whose?}} the Church of England has, as one of its distinguishing marks, a breadth and &quot;open-mindedness&quot;. This range of belief and practice includes those of the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], who emphasise liturgy and [[sacrament]]s, to the far more preaching-centred and less ritual-based services of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] and gatherings of the [[Charismatic movement|Charismatics]]. But this &quot;broad church&quot; faces various contentious doctrinal and social questions.

===Women's ministry===
Women were appointed as deaconesses from 1861 but they could not function fully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy. Women have been [[lay reader]]s for a long time. During the First World War some women were appointed as lay readers known as &quot;Bishop's Messengers&quot;. After that no more lay readers were appointed until 1969.

Legislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in 1986 and they were first ordained in 1987. The [[ordination of women]] as priests was passed by the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] in 1993 and began in 1994. In July 2005 the synod voted to &quot;set in train&quot; the process of allowing the consecration of women as bishops. In February 2006 the synod voted overwhelmingly for the &quot;further exploration&quot; of possible arrangements for parishes that did not want to be directly under the authority of a woman bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060210women.shtml Church votes overwhelmingly for compromise on women bishops – news from]. Ekklesia.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2008 the Synod voted to approve the ordination of women as bishops and rejected moves for alternative episcopal oversight for those who do not accept women bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Church will ordain women bishops |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7494517.stm |publisher=BBC News |date= 7 July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual ordinations of women to the episcopate will require further legislation which is anticipated to be considered before 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Pigott, Robert. (2009-02-14) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7889946.stm Synod struggles on women bishops]. BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, for the first time in the history of the Church of England, more women than men were ordained as priests (290 women and 273 men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9060296/More-new-women-priests-than-men-for-first-time.html |title=More new women priests than men for first time |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=2012-02-04 accessdate=2012-7-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worship and liturgy===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The Church of England's official book of liturgy as established in English Law is the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP), but there are many examples of local variations throughout the churches of the Anglican Communion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In addition to this book the General Synod has also legislated for a modern [[liturgical book]], ''[[Common Worship]]'', dating from 2000, which can be used as an alternative to the BCP. Like its predecessor, the 1980 ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'', it differs from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' in providing a range of alternative services, mostly in modern language, although it does include some BCP-based forms as well, for example Order Two for Holy Communion. (This is a revision of the BCP service, altering some words and allowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the ''[[Agnus Dei]]'' before communion.) The Order One rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship.

The use of hymns and music in the Church of England has changed dramatically over the centuries. Traditional [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Choral evensong]] is a staple of most cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The style of [[psalm]] chanting harks back to the Church of England's pre-reformation roots. During the 18th century, clergy such as [[Charles Wesley]] introduced their own styles of worship with poetic hymns.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the [[Charismatic Movement]] significantly altered the worship traditions of numerous Church of England parishes, primarily affecting those of [[evangelical]] persuasion. These churches now adopt a [[contemporary worship]] form of service, with minimal liturgical or ritual elements, and incorporating [[contemporary worship music]].

==Membership==
Due to its status as the established church, in general anyone may be married, have their children baptised or their funeral in their local [[Church of England parish church|parish church]], regardless of whether they are baptised or regular churchgoers.&lt;ref&gt;See the pages linked from the [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/lifeevents/ Life Events page on the Church of England website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1890 and 2001 churchgoing in the United Kingdom declined steadily.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler, ''Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain'' (University of Chicago Press, 2001), page 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1968 to 1999, Anglican Sunday church attendances almost halved, from 3.5 per cent of the population to just 1.9 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Gill, ''The Empty Church Revisited'', (Ashgate Publishing, 2003) page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; One study published in 2008 suggested that if current trends were to continue, Sunday attendances could fall to 350,000 in 2030 and just 87,800 in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Research, ''Religious Trends'' (2008), cited in Ruth Gledhill, &quot;Churchgoing on its knees as Christianity falls out of favour&quot;, ''The Times'', 8 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, the Church published statistics showing 1.7 million people taking part in a Church of England service each month, a level maintained since the turn of the millennium; approximately one million participating each Sunday and three million taking part in a Church of England service on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve. The Church also claimed that each year 30% attend regular Sunday worship on at least one occasion; more than 40% attend a wedding in their local church and still more attend a funeral there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/facts-stats.aspx Church of England website]. Churchofengland.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationally the Church of England baptises one child in eight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/media/1333106/2009churchstatistics.pdf Church of England website]. (PDF) .&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Church has 18,000 active ordained clergy and 10,000 licensed lay ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/facts-stats/research-statistics.aspx Church of England Research &amp; Statistics link page]. Churchofengland.org (2012-05-09).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, 491 people were recommended for ordination training, maintaining the level at the turn of the millennium, and 564 new clergy (266 women and 298 men) were ordained.  More than half of those ordained (193 men and 116 women) were appointed to full-time paid ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/facts-stats.aspx Facts and stats]. Churchofengland.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{see also|Anglican ministry|List of Church of England dioceses}}
[[File:Dioceses of Church of England.svg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;center&gt;Dioceses of Church of England&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff3;&quot;&gt;&amp;#9609;&lt;/span&gt; Province of Canterbury&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#f99;&quot;&gt;&amp;#9609;&lt;/span&gt; Province of York&lt;br/&gt;{{nowrap|([http://sharemap.org/public/Dioceses_of_Church_of_England interactive version])}}]]

Article XIX (Of the Church) of the 39 Articles defines the church as follows:

{{quote|The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of [[God]] is preached, and the sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchsociety.org/issues_new/doctrine/39a/iss_doctrine_39A_Arts19-22.asp 39 Articles – 19–22]. Church Society.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the complexities of the structure, the Church of England at its heart views the local parish church as the basic unit.

The British monarch has the constitutional title of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. The canon law of the Church of England states, &quot;We acknowledge that the Queen’s most excellent Majesty, acting according to the laws of the realm, is the highest power under God in this kingdom, and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Canon A 7 &quot;Of the Royal Supremacy&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In practice this power is often exercised through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

In addition to England, the jurisdiction of the Church of England extends to the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Channel Islands]] and a few parishes in [[Flintshire]], [[Monmouthshire]] and [[Radnorshire]] in Wales (the present [[Church in Wales]] was an integral part of the Church of England until 1920).&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L. (ed.) (1957) Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church; p. 1436&lt;/ref&gt; Expatriate congregations on the continent of Europe have become the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]].

The church is structured as follows (from the lowest level upwards):
[[File:TootBaldon StLawrence ParishChurch.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Many English villages have small parish churches such as this in [[Toot Baldon]]]]

* Parish is the most local level, often consisting of one church building and community, although many parishes are joining forces in a variety of ways for financial reasons. The parish is looked after by a parish [[Anglican priest|priest]] who for historical or legal reasons may be called by one of the following offices: [[vicar]], [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], [[priest in charge]], team rector, team vicar. The first, second, and fourth of these may also be known as the 'incumbent'. The running of the parish is the joint responsibility of the incumbent and the [[Parochial Church Council]] (PCC), which consists of the parish clergy and elected representatives from the congregation. The Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe is not formally divided into parishes.
* There are a number of local churches that do not have a parish. In urban areas there are a number of [[proprietary chapel]]s (mostly built in the 19th century to cope with urbanisation and growth in population). Also in more recent years there are increasingly [[church plant]]s and [[Fresh expressions]] of church, whereby new congregations are planted in locations such as schools or pubs in order to spread the Gospel of Christ in fresh and non-traditional ways.
[[File:Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe.PNG|thumb|right|250px|A map showing the diocese of Gibraltar in Europe. The seven archdeaconries are colour-coded.]]
* [[Deanery]], ''e.g.'', Lewisham or Runnymede. This is the area for which a [[Rural Dean|rural dean]] is responsible. It consists of a number of parishes in a particular district. The rural dean is usually the incumbent of one of the constituent parishes. The parishes each elect lay (non-ordained) representatives to the deanery [[synod]]. Deanery synod members each have a vote in the election of representatives to the diocesan synod.
* Archdeaconry, ''e.g.'', the seven in the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]]. This is the area under the jurisdiction of an [[archdeacon]]. It consists of a number of deaneries.
* [[Diocese]], ''e.g.'', [[Diocese of Durham]], [[Diocese of Guildford]], [[Diocese of St Albans]]. This is the area under the jurisdiction of a diocesan bishop, ''e.g.'', the Bishops of Durham, Guildford and St Albans, and will have a cathedral. There may be one or more assisting bishops, usually called [[suffragan bishop]]s, within the diocese who assist the diocesan bishop in his ministry, ''e.g.'', in Guildford diocese, the Bishop of Dorking. In some very large dioceses a legal measure has been enacted to create &quot;episcopal areas&quot;, where the diocesan bishop runs one such area himself and appoints &quot;area bishops&quot; to run the other areas as mini-dioceses, legally delegating many of his powers to the area bishops. Dioceses with episcopal areas include [[Diocese of London|London]], [[Diocese of Chelmsford|Chelmsford]], [[Diocese of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Diocese of Chichester|Chichester]], [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]], and [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]]. The bishops work with an elected body of [[Laity|lay]] and [[ordained]] representatives, known as the [[Diocesan Synod|diocesan synod]], to run the diocese. A diocese is subdivided into a number of archdeaconries.
* [[Ecclesiastical province|Province]], ''i.e.'', Canterbury or York. This is the area under the jurisdiction of an [[archbishop]], ''i.e.'' the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. Decision-making within the province is the responsibility of the [[General Synod]] (see also above). A province is subdivided into dioceses.
* [[Primacy of Canterbury|Primacy]], ''i.e.'', Church of England. In addition to his specific authority in his own province, each archbishop is &quot;Primate of All England&quot; (Canterbury) or &quot;Primate of England&quot; (York) and has powers that extend over the whole country—for example his license to marry without the [[banns]] (marriage licence).
* [[Royal Peculiar]], a small number of churches more closely associated with [[the Crown]], and a very few with the law and are outside the usual church hierarchy though conforming to the rite. These are outside episcopal jurisdiction.

All [[Vicar#Anglican|rectors and vicars]] are [[advowson|appointed by patrons]], who may be private individuals, corporate bodies such as cathedrals, colleges or trusts, or by the bishop or directly by the Crown. No clergy can be instituted and inducted into a parish without swearing the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty, and taking the Oath of Canonical Obedience &quot;in all things lawful and honest&quot; to the bishop. Usually they are instituted to the benefice by the bishop and then inducted by the archdeacon into the possession of the benefice property—church and parsonage. Curates are appointed by rectors and vicars, or if priests-in-charge by the bishop after consultation with the patron. Cathedral clergy (normally a dean and a varying number of residentiary canons who constitute the cathedral chapter) are appointed either by the Crown, the bishop, or by the dean and chapter themselves. Clergy officiate in a diocese either because they hold office as beneficed clergy or are licensed by the bishop when appointed (e.g. curates), or simply with permission.

===Primates===
[[Image:Rowan Williams 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Rowan Williams]].]]
The most senior bishop of the Church of England is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who is the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the southern province of England, the Province of Canterbury. He has the status of [[Primate (religion)|Primate]] of All England. He is the focus of unity for the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] of independent national or regional churches. [[Rowan Williams]] became Archbishop of Canterbury in 2002.

The second most senior bishop is the [[Archbishop of York]], who is the Metropolitan of the northern province of England, the Province of York. For historical reasons (relating to the time of York's control by the [[Danelaw|Danes]]) he is referred to as the Primate of England. [[John Sentamu]] became Archbishop of York in 2005. The Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham and the Bishop of Winchester are ranked in the next three positions.

===Diocesan bishops===
The process of appointing diocesan bishops is complex and is handled by the [[Appointment of Church of England bishops|Crown Nominations Committee]] which submits names to the Prime Minister (acting on behalf of the Crown) for consideration.

===Representative bodies===
{{Main|General Synod of the Church of England}}
The Church of England has a legislative body, the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]]. Synod can create two types of legislation, [[List of Church of England Measures|measures]] and [[canon law|canons]]. Measures have to be approved but cannot be amended by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] before receiving the [[Royal Assent]] and becoming part of the law of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/measures/|title=Summary of Church Assembly and General Synod Measures|year=2007|month=November|work=Church of England website|publisher=Archbishops' council of the Church of England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canons require Royal Licence and Royal Assent, but form the law of the church, rather than the law of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/gensynod/|title=General Synod|work=Church of England website|publisher=Archbishops' council of the Church of England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another assembly is the [[Convocation of the English Clergy]] (older than the General Synod and its predecessor the Church Assembly). There are also [[Diocesan Synod|diocesan synods]] and [[Deanery#Anglican usage|deanery synods]].

===House of Lords===
{{Main|Lords Spiritual}}
Of the 44 diocesan [[archbishop]]s and bishops in the Church of England, 26 are permitted to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. The Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishops of York|York]] automatically have seats, as do the Bishops of [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]. The remaining 21 seats are filled in order of seniority by [[consecration]]. It may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the House of Lords, at which point he becomes a [[Lords Spiritual|Lord Spiritual]]. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] and the [[Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]] are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords as their dioceses lie outside the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/alphabetical_list_of_members.cfm House of Lords: alphabetical list of Members]. Retrieved 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial situation==
{{Main|Properties and finances of the Church of England}}
Although an [[established church]], the Church of England does not receive any direct government support. Donations comprise its largest source of income, and it also relies heavily on the income from its various historic endowments. {{As of|2005}}, the Church of England had estimated total outgoings of around £900&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/funding/ outgoings]. Cofe.anglican.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England manages an [[investment portfolio]] which is worth more than £8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Citing ethics, Anglicans sell stake in News Corp&quot; by Eric Pfanner, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
