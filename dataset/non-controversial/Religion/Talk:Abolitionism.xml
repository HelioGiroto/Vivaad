Should this article be called [[Abolitionism]]? (Or, should it be more specifically re: slavery?) --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

Probably. Please move it![[user:sjc]]
iryftuetyuyreuy;uy;ouyrtuyrutyuerytoeuryoeuytoeuyoeuytouyteoryt
Should also be disambiguated (slavery) in case we need to deal with other forms of the abolitionism (I can think of several). [[user:sjc]]

:I'm willing to consider the slavery issue the ''main'' use of the term for now, with a disambiguation block at the top for death penalty, nukes, etc. Feel free to convince me otherwise. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

::I agree that this disambiguation is needed. --[[User:Daniel C. Boyer|Daniel C. Boyer]]
----
Actually, if you'll look at the [http://www.wikipedia.com/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Abolitionism What links here]] page, you'll see that most of the references are to '''Abolitionist''' in the 19th century American sense of &quot;abolition&quot; of slavery. Maybe just fix the REDIRECT. [[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]

Sorry, I got frisky and removed the redirect already. [[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]
----
Seems that [[abolitionism]] and [[abolitionist]] are 90% identical. I suggest a merge, with one redirecting to the other. --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]
:We still have the [[abolition of slavery]] page to deal with. [[Abolition]] may be needed for disambiguation (or is it?). rmhermen 08:11 Aug 15, 2002 (PDT)
Thanks for the fix, Andre. It makes sense for the ''-ist'' people to redirect to the ''-ism'' idea. Same as [[Communist]] redirecting to [[communism]]. --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]

&quot;Abolition of slavery&quot; is a broader topic than &quot;abolitionism&quot;, and there is much on that topic that is not here.  This page does not mention the act of Parliament of 1772 (if I recall correctly) that abolished slavery in England while allowing English companies headquartered in England to continue trading slaves in other countries, nor the subsequent lawsuit over the question of whether that law applied also to Scotland, nor the history of abolition of slavery in the various European countries and other countries.  When and how was slavery abolished in Spain?  (Later than in the USA, I'm guessing, based on the movie ''Amistad''.)  What about France, Italy, Germany, etc.?  In which countries in slavery legal now?   -- Mike Hardy


If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself! [[User:Vera Cruz|Vera Cruz]]

But I don't know the answers to those questions!   -- Mike Hardy

I agree wholeheartedly, and my solution is this: let the [[abolitionism]] article be based on the abolition of slavery in North America, and have a seperate, more global article at [[abolition of slavery]]. I'll start it as a stub (in place of the current redirect), referencing this page as a &quot;see also&quot;. --[[User:Sam Francis|Sam]] 15:02, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Oh, dear, this is another one of those articles with a lot of history and baggage... a bit of a mess? Question that need answering: 
#Is [[abolitionism]] primarily a North American term, or is it used elsewhere? 
--[[User:Sam Francis|Sam]]

It is my thoughts that part of this post should be separated and put under a topic by the name of Abolition, but still include the dates of abolition in certain places under this topic. I think it would also be easier for searches if slavery was separated into different geographical places, such as America, Egypt, Spain; you might want to create new topics as these and put a redirect link on the page the search &quot;slavery&quot; leads to. This is something very much needed for this topic, and also if anyone could find more pictures to place on this page, or with a link to it, I know that will be greatly appreciated! 
--[[User:LadyFroggie|LadyFroggie]] 18:30, 21 February 2007 (UTC)


The term &quot;abolitionism&quot; goes back to the abolition of slavery (and that is historically still its most important meaning). In due course and discourse the term has, however, been applied to other inhuman social institutions, with more or less sucess, especially to  capital punishment and to prisons. It is kind of strange that Wikipedia does not take note of these &quot;new abolitionists&quot;. --[[User:134.102.139.65|134.102.139.65]] 19:35, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
 
The least one should do is differentiate these different types of abolition --[[User:Johannes Feest|Johannes]]

== Britain vs. England ==

Someone changed England to Britain in the article. Unfortunately, that makes some of the information inaccurate. For example &quot;slavery was never widespread within Britain&quot; is not true; that's only true of England herself. Slavery was not abolished in all Britain in 1772; only in England. Etc. I'm going to change some of the references back because of this. [[User:Quadell|Quadell]] 14:02, May 5, 2004 (UTC)

== Swedish Date ==

Could someone verify the Swedish abolition date?  Seems very early.


From luth.se, can't really confirm the source, but sounds reasonable, local conditions made slavery uneconomic.

: ''Officially the practice of having slaves was abandoned as a law proclaimed by the king Magnus Eriksson when he travelled through the country in the year of 1335. The original texts do not exist any longer but the pieces which survives says that 'every man and women which is born by a christian man and women is to be free in the county of...'.''

: ''The official reason to ban the slavery was the christian faith. In reality other reasons much more powerful than that existed. Economic resaons... It was simply more profitable to have people which could be hired for shorter periods. Instead of having a large workforce which the owner had the responsibility for all year around, even when didn't need them, he could hire them when it was considered necessary.

: ''Instead the farmer could give away a bit of land and let the former slaves pay for cultivating this land with workdays on the his farm. Formally the slaves were free, but in practice the landowner earned money as he didn't have to pay for food during the winter months at the same time as he got his work done any way. A neat arrangement...''

: ''Theoretically the slaves now was members of the community with equal rights but they still didn't own anything. For most of the slaves the situation actually had gone from bad to worse.''

Further investigation (on this site even) refers to the fact that later the swedes bought the island mentioned in 1783, and slavery was used on that island until the second date.

==Slavery in the U.K. ==
The article says the case deciding slavery was &quot;Somerset v. Maughan&quot;.  Surely this can't be right.  Rudyard vs. Kipling maybe?  Ringo vs. Starr...
:DNB; &quot;Somerset v. Stewart&quot; [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] 02:24, 25 May 2005 (UTC)



&quot;Quakers continued to be influential throughout the lifetime of the movement, in many ways leading the campaign.[4]&quot; - suggest change to:

==St. Patrick==

Opposed the slave trade, especially the enslavement of free Christians. This is laudable, but it is not abolition. [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] 02:24, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

The fact remains that slavery ceased in areas under the influence of Celtic Christianity.  Perhaps that makes them unique as Christians (I'm not sure).  But if a society ceases to practice slavery, is that not 'abolitionist'?--[[User:194.125.111.194|194.125.111.194]] 08:33, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

==Lord Mansfield==

Lord Mansfield never said or wrote &quot;The air of England ...&quot; The slave's counsel brought up that line, quoting a 16th century legal decision. [[User:VoX|VoX]]

==Page Structure==
I've just added stuff about UK abolitionism. I've also re-organised the page to make it less US-centric. The national sections should now be chronological, based on final date of abolition. [[User:Gailtb|Gailtb]] 14:31, 8 October 2005 (UTC)


==Political Emancipation==

The wiki page [[Political_emancipation]] could use some attention. Currently it is only a stub. Particularly the explanation of the term 'political emancipation' entailing 'equal status of individual citizens in relation to the state, equality before the law, regardless of religion, property, or other “private” characteristics of individual persons' is construed to be an 'opinion' and 'not delivering a neutral point of view.' Does anyone have more information on the word 'emancipation' also being used in the political context of establishing (or any step moving towards) equality in light of the law? Inserting the [[Voting Rights Act]] as such a step of political emancipation was repeatedly erased. 

When there have been only 3 African-American Senators in modern times (out of more than 1500 Senators in total), would you say that political emancipation has been achieved?
[[User:FredrickS|FredrickS]] 18:23, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

== Abolitionists ==
Could &quot;[[School of Salamanca]]&quot; or the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] be regarded as abolicionist since they pursued the end of  slavement in América?

The end of slavery wasn´t their only goal, but thy could be in a prot-abolitionist seccion or preface or so.

==Latin America==

The information on Latin America is not correct. During the independence wars the &quot;libertad de vientres&quot; was declared, which means that all the slaves' sons were going to be free from then on. But people still possessed slaves legally until the 1850s.--[[User:Rivet138|Rivet138]] ([[User talk:Rivet138|talk]]) 16:31, 6 February 2010 (UTC)Rivet138

==Anti-Catholicism &amp; Nativism==

Have altered the inclusion of anti-Catholicism &amp; nativism together with social reform movements such as temperance, women's suffrage, etc., as these are anti-ethnic movements and not social reform movements.  Also amended the paragraph on university participation in antislavery, which is basically correct but overlooks important contributions from established universities. [[User: jlockard|Joe Lockard]]
::The ant-catholic and nativist movements were as much social reform movements as any. Let's not let out own POV get in the way here. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] 18:08, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

*Which of the following did the Catholic Church oppose? Saying the abolitionists opposed Catholics because they were against modernization is 1) unspecific 2) an omission of many other reassons for opposition - such as anti-Popism.--[[User:JimWae|JimWae]] 18:46, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
**temperance movement - granted the Irish opposed this, but they were not alone
**public schooling - quite possibly
**prison- and asylum-building
**abolition

**The Catholic Church (Pope) was against all modern reforms at the time, and said so quite clearly. In the US the Catholics (esp Irish) opposed prohibition, feminism, and utopianism; fought the public schools, opposed Bible reading in schools and fought abolitionists. They strongly denounced protestant churches and Protestants in general as doomed to hell. They insisted (by 1870) the Pope was infallible. The American Catholics had just defeated a local control movement (&quot;trustees) making their bishops all-powerful.  I don't recall they took any stand on asylums. (this refers to 1840-1870 era), The Protestants were alarmed to see they were growing rapidly and building a huge network of their own parochial schools and colleges [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] 19:19, 22 May 2006 (UTC)


I've reverted this because it is obviously controversial, but not referenced.  If you can come up with a verifiable reference then that is different, but I would humbly suggest that:
1)  evangelical Protestantism (and Roman Catholicism for that matter) is rather too complex for such generalisations;
2) it has nothing to do with abolitionism, which is the point of the article.  
[[User:MAG1|MAG1]] 21:13, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
::Abolitionists thought it was pretty important. See Griffith book, also Filler and especially Osofsky, Gilbert. &quot;Abolitionists, Irish Immigrants, and the Dilemmas of Romantic Nationalism&quot; American Historical Review 1975 80(4): 889-912.  Why is this controversial?? I thought everybody knew the Irish and the abolitionists were at each others throats? [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] 21:28, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

Syllabus of Errors was 1864 and infallibility 1870. The important source for inclusion in the article is the source that the Irish opposed abolition of slavery? --[[User:JimWae|JimWae]] 21:41, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
::Osofsky covers the prewar Irish; also see The War Against Proslavery Religion: Abolitionism and the Northern Churches, 1830-1865 by John R McKivigan. The Syllabus of Errors and Infallivility were of course taught long  before they became official dogma.  Some cites: Irish were &quot;staunch opponents of abolition&quot; p 84 of The Columbia Guide To Irish American History by Timothy J Meagher  (2005); &quot;many Irish, although by no means all, believed that those who supported blacks were precisely their own enemies. That is, they associated abolitionism with anti-Catholicism and nativism.&quot; p 100 of The New York Irish
edited by Ronald H Bayor (1996) [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] 21:53, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

::The Syllabus says nothing on slavery and the arch-conservative [[Pope Gregory XVI]] opposed the slave trade.[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Greg16/g16sup.htm] That said many Catholics, especially Irish, in the US supported slavery for a variety of reasons. Also, I'd presume, Catholics who opposed slavery would've done so for reasons that'd irritate or displease evangelicals. Catholicism of this time was strongly against the Northern industrialist lifestyle and against Protestantism. I know of Medievalist Catholics of today who say indentured servitude and serfdom was preferrable to slavery plus some things Catholics of that era say make me think that when they opposed slavery they did so for that reason. Most Catholic denunciations of slavery involved trading of slaves, internationally or domestically, because the Catholic Church felt it broke up Christian families. If there really were Catholics who opposed slavery in favor of non-racial indentured servitude I think it'd be fair to say they would've been seen, perhaps rightly, as pro-slavery by abolitionists.--[[User:T. Anthony|T. Anthony]] 06:41, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

:::Huh well most &quot;Catholics in good standing&quot; abolitionists I find were of French descent or didn't live in the US. For example [[Charles Lavigerie]], of France, and a few [[Louisiana]]ns. The main Irish Catholic abolitionist was a man named Richard Robert Madden[http://www.aoh.com/history/archive/amistad.htm] who never lived in the US, but was connected to the [[Amistad (case)]].--[[User:T. Anthony|T. Anthony]] 07:19, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

You are completely right that many abolitionists were strongly anti-Catholic, Granville Sharp for one.  However the controversial bit is the reasons for the anti-Catholicism are complex and often theological.  So if you have a good point, then I would suggest you reference it fully within the article then it is much more difficult for people to get rid of it.  However, do bear in mind that this is an article about abolitionism not abolitionists:  how did these arguments affect the cause of abolitionism in the USA?  If the answer is not much, then create a new article about it (which sounds as if it would be interesting).  [[User:MAG1|MAG1]] 21:59, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
::The cause of abolitionism had strong opponents in the North--led by the Irish Catholics who increasingly dominated the Dem party. (Solution involved a Free Soil Dem movement that drew anti-slave people out of the Dem party and eventually into the GOP).  The irish disliked the blacks but they violently hated the abolitionists who they saw as a threat to their religion. This is important as late as the draft riots of 1863. [[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] 22:06, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

::IMHO a contribution explaining this would be great (though what do I know?), and I hope you don't mind me saying, loads better than the broadbrush stuff you started out writing above.  Like I said earlier, though I may be teaching you to suck eggs, I think references are a good way of making sure that contributions last, particularly any that touch subjects such as religion.  [[User:MAG1|MAG1]] 22:30, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

:::Irish Catholics wanted out of public schools because they felt they were too Protestant in approach; the Bible read there was the Protestant rather than the Catholic version, for one thing. They were trying to protect their own culture (as every group seems to). Opposition to blacks and abolition came from the working classes, not the official church.  They did not want to compete with laborers willing to work for low wages, which they assumed freedmen would be willing to do.  They fought with blacks in Philadelphia in the 19th and early 20th c., in one battleground. As one of the first major groups of immigrants in the mid-19th century, Irish were defending their &quot;territory&quot; in NY and other cities.  This strong territoriality over space and jobs (and women, of course) continued into the early 20th century, at least. They were territorial against other ethnic groups in northern cities, but especially against blacks who started to arrive there in the Great Migration.  They were the major players not only in the draft riots of 1863 in NY, but in a late 19th c. riot in Chicago, the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, the Omaha Race Riot of 1919 and lynching of Will Brown, violence in Philadelphia.  They were slugging it out against the blacks in the bottom tier.--[[User:Parkwells|Parkwells]] ([[User talk:Parkwells|talk]]) 11:33, 6 July 2008 (UTC)

== Slavery in Israel? ==

The paragraph on slavery in Israel - 
&quot;Israel is known among those knowledgeable as the world capital of the International slave trade: all three kinds of slavery are rampant there; the police and government, the former incompetent and the both corrupt, do nothing against it: Prostitution is Israel's largest business and foreign labor (Contract slaves) is the foundation of Israel's industry.&quot;
- reads like an antisemitic fantasy, and isn't supported by any references.  I'm surprised that it's lasted this long.  I suggest that either it be properly documented and referenced by somebody, or it should be deleted.  --[[User:JdwNYC|JdwNYC]] 17:58, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

==The Roman Catholics and the Irish==
The present text reads:

:American Catholics (especially the Irish Americans) opposed reforms such as abolition, prohibition, feminism, and utopianism; they opposed Bible reading in schools, and denounced Protestant churches. The abolitionists were alarmed to see Catholics were growing rapidly, especially in the larger cities, where they were becoming politically powerful. As a result many abolitionists embraced nativism as typified by the Know Nothing Movement in the 1850s. In 1849, Garrison wrote that &quot;not a Catholic priest, not a Catholic journal, can be found in this great country, pleading for the liberation of the enslaved; on the contrary, they most heartily stigmatize the abolitionists and all their movements.&quot; Thus abolitionism had strong opponents in the North--led by the Irish Catholics who increasingly dominated the Democratic party in major cities. One option for anti-slavery Democrats was the Free Soil Party that drew anti-slavery people out of the main Democratic party and eventually into the anti-slavery Republican party. The Irish disliked the blacks but they violently hated the abolitionists who they saw as a threat to their religion. This was important as late as the draft riots of 1863

This bears a very tenuous relation to its cited sources, however:

===Dooley===
*[[Daniel O'Connell]] attacked Washington as a slave-holder, and fought a duel with the American ambassador, [[Andrew Stevenson]], over slavery (11)

::::As someone else pointed out above, the Catholic Church in the nineteenth century was explicitly and overwhelmingly conservative, and opposed to any liberalization - a reaction to the violent, antireligious backlash of the [[French revolution]] and subsequent movements like [[Marxism]].  Though it did not have much pull in America, it was heavily criticized in Europe for hanging on to outdated anti-scientific dogma, continued hostility to non-Catholics, and indifference to the plight of the poor and working classes (the Church started to change in the twentieth century, and all three were essentially dropped after [[Vatican II]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]'s time).
::::It should also be noted that politics were heavily polarized in the U.S. along racial lines after the civil war, especially with immigration.  Northern WASPs, Southern WASPs and every minority were essentially at each other's throats, especially in the inner cities where Catholics were well represented (Irish, Italian, Polish and some German immigrants) - which accounts for the racism among many Catholics.  First, the immigrants had to compete with the newly emancipated blacks for jobs, food, living quarters and everything else.  Second, they were being targeted by the piestistic movement popular among northern WASPs - Catholics balked at the idea of imposing a specifically Protestant moralism into the public sphere.  The pietists/Progressives supported strong anti-immigration measures, as well as the [[Social Gospel]], [[Prohibition]] and the abolitionist movement - and thus the Old South was pissed off at them also.
::::So the Catholics aligned with the southern WASPs based on the enemy of my enemy theory - both of them were largely racist for their own reasons, both of them felt victimized by the northern WASPs still dominating the country, and since they lived in different parts of the country, there was little contact between the two to spark outrage at their religious and racial differences.
::::For the record, though, the Catholic Church had condemned the principle of slavery as early as 1435, and that there was little backing in church doctrine for the positions of Catholics in the U.S. [[Special:Contributions/213.181.226.21|213.181.226.21]] ([[User talk:213.181.226.21|talk]]) 09:56, 6 July 2008 (UTC)
===McManus===
Res ipsa loquitur: this section is anti-Catholic, anti-Irish and very biased.  No other religious or ethnic group has been given its own section in this Wikipedia entry.
The leading opponents of Lincoln -- Fernando Wood, August Belmont, James Bennett, and Clement Vallandigham -- weren't Irish and only Bennett, a Scots immigrant was Catholic.  Justice Taney of the infamous Dred Scott decision was Catholic, but not Irish. He regretted, if you read the decision, what he believed the constitution required, but it is unquestionable that in his private life he was an abolitionist.  The most prominent Irish Catholic slaveholder, Charles Carroll, unquestionably opposed slavery and proposed legislation for its abolition in Maryland. James M[a]cMasters is often cited as a prominent Irish Catholic journalist who opposed abolition. In fact, McMasters was a native born American with Scots and Presbyterian roots who was educated at Union college in upstate New York, and was in complete disfavor with the &quot;Archbishop of New York City&quot; by 1860. My great-grandfather knew the &quot;Archbishop of New York&quot; John Hughes.  Hughes was an ally of Lincoln and Seward, who raised the American flag over Old St. Patrick's cathedral.  Hughes opposed extra-political emancipation, but he did not believe in slavery.  What he believed in was gradual, legislated emancipation.  Furthermore, General William Tecumseh Sherman, General Phil Sheridan, General George Gordon Meade or General John Reynolds were all raised by Irish families.  Indeed, Sherman and Sheridan attended the same Catholic Church as children.  The Irish won at least 137 Medals of Honor during the American Civil War, far more than any other ethnic group.  On December 13, 1862, on the eve of Emancipation, New York City's Irish Brigade was worse than decimated in repeated desperate assaults on the stonewall at Fredericksburg.  At Gettysburg on the third day, Pennsylvania's Irish Regiment held the center of the Union position against Pickett's charge.  No Irish, no Union or emancipation.  That this Wikipedia entry singles out Irish Catholics and presents none of the facts I have just mentioned is -- res ipsa loquitur -- evidence that the article is biased in the grand tradition of American and British anti-Catholicism.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Slante9|Slante9]] ([[User talk:Slante9|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Slante9|contribs]]) 21:59, 22 April 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== POV Paragraph ==

I removed the following as poorly written and rather POV:

:Slavery is practiced in the US today primarily by recent immigrants abusing illegal immigrants.  The threat of deportation by the INS is often used to enforce captivity.   See article &quot;Montgomery Woman Sentenced to 7 Years in Domestic Slavery Case&quot;, 19 April 2006  &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/18/AR2006041801520.html&gt;

== Compensation for slave owners ==

Hi all - I don't have the time at the moment to edit the article but thought I'd point this out - the article states that &quot;£20 million was paid in compensation to plantation owners in the Caribbean.&quot; it would appear that is this incorrect - according to ''The Great Trek - C Venter ISBN 090923888X Published by Don Nelson 1985 - Page 17'' - £1 250 000 of this amount was set aside for the payment of slavery owners at the Cape, even though  the slaves there where valued at £3 041 290. On top of this the money was being paid out in London only - and only in British Goverment Stock and not cash.

When I get a chance I can add this to the article, but if someone else wants to in the meantime ...

Slavery was outlawed in the [[British Empire]] in the 1830s, not earlier.  [[User:GhostofSuperslum|GhostofSuperslum]] 18:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

1833, although it wasn't fully implemented in all the British outlying territories until the end of the 1830s. Also, the act to abolish the slave trade was passed in February 1807, but slave trading wasn't to be illegal till january 1808. so the dates aren't as clear as could be! I feel this is symptomatic of the problem with wiki. it's all too generalised!

== Deaths of aboltionists? Were there any? ==

== Serfdom ==

This and several other articles, vide  [[serfdom]], seem to be mixing terms denying them any clear meaning. &quot;(nevertheless, there were native-born Scottish slaves until 1799, when coal miners previously kept in serfdom gained emancipation)&quot; Specifically slavery, serfdom (something that was very different from country to country) and [[villein|Villeinage]]. We also appear to be mixing dates, England abolishes the trade in serfs in [[Somerset%27s_Case|1102]] in one article but continues with serfs to 1600 in another, and to 1500 in yet another. I think we need some clear sense of what we want the terms of mean and then applying it across the articles and agreeing on some dates so the articles are consistent [[User:Alci12|Alci12]] 13:21, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

:I've never heard this story about Scottish coal-miner serfs until 1799 anywhere else - can anyone confirm if it's true? I suspect it should be removed. [[User:MarkThomas|MarkThomas]] 16:46, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

:Referring to Scottish coal miners, slavery (rather than serfdom) seems the more appropriate word. It seems to have been formalized circa 1606 (either by royal edict or by the Scots Parliament, or both); it was nominally banned in 1776 by the Westminster Parliament, to no effect. It was definitively banned in 1799 (using the word &quot;servitude&quot;, the same word used in outlawing US slavery many years later), although it persisted and mutated into a form of serfdom in the 1800's (again, like the situation in the US many years later). The original Scots form had stated that anyone who mined coal (and this applied to other laborers as well, including saltpanners) was condemned to that activity for life. Missing work was consider theft (of the mine owner's labor), and mine labor was bought and sold as part of the purchase and sale of a mine. The Kirk, to its discredit, was a critical part of this shameful institution through a ceremony called &quot;arling&quot;, at which a miner would swear before God that his son would become a coal miner.

== &quot;Modernizing&quot; movements? ==

&quot;In the North most opponents of slavery supported other modernizing reform movements such as the temperance movement, public schooling, and prison- and asylum-building.&quot;
Unless &quot;modernizing&quot; is meant literally (i.e. shaping things to be the way they would be in the future), I think this is a POV statement. The temperance movement lead to the Prohibition, which in turn lead to an unforseen rise in Mafia influence because the Prohibition did not adequately deal with alcoholism or alcohol vendors. Likewise, it could be argued that jail-building deals with surface symptoms and not causes; there may be criminals, but who were these criminals before they turned to crime? And don't forget that a great many in the civil rights movement went to jail for their beliefs.

I think it would be better if it was re-worded and included some context on these movements and trends. What is so modernizing about prison-building? If modernizing is meant in a different context, then that context should be provided. [[User:Kennard2|Kennard2]] 03:28, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

== Growth of the campaign ==

This is badly written, and while I concede that the recent edits by [[Jolayemi]] give more detail which is valuable, there are inaccuracies.

:I agree that the subject of emigration deserves mention, which is why I kept that paragraph as &quot;invisible text&quot;. Unfortunately, the writing wasn't up to encyclopedia standards.

:::I finally found the time to take another look at the paragraph you wrote on '''emigration''', so I could reply to your response.

However -- if you will at least make a real effort to improve on your first draft, I promise that I will carve out some time to do whatever else may be needed in the way of &quot;final editing&quot;, so it can be put back into the article ASAP. There are two large areas in particular that you need to work on: 

:::1) It isn't entirely clear what the &quot;Haytian Union&quot; was, nor what the &quot;national movement of African Americans recruited by the government of Haiti&quot; refers to; and there's ''no mention of what was or wasn't accomplished'' -- especially bothersome, since there is '''no Wikipedia article''' to link to for further info.

:::2) Why does the very next sentence begin with &quot;However, an initial successful operation...&quot;? I have no idea what you were trying to say, since there's no indication that the &quot;Wilberforce Colony in Canada&quot; had any connection with the &quot;Haytian Union&quot;. It's a pretty confusing way to introduce the new subject. Also, that sentence is unbelievably long and rambling -- there's enough text there for 2 (or even 3) sentences.

==Neutrality/Sources/Quality Issues==
In the section &quot;History of American Abolition&quot;, there are a number of questionable unsourced statements, such as one which says how abolitionists such as Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant and Stephen Douglas married into slave-owning families without &quot;any moral qualms.&quot; Although the fact that they married into slave-owning families is true, the moral qualms statement is pretty hard to prove, since we are unaware of the deep inner feelings of these men on personal issues. Here's another: &quot;The majority of northerners rejected the extreme positions of abolitionists.&quot; While this statement could potentially be true, the fact that opinion polling wasn't being used causes me to question the neutrality and validity of this statement... not to mention that the north elected the abolitionist Republican Party to supermajorities throughout the Civil War and Reconstruction. There are actually many statements like this one throughout the passage, beginning with &quot;Most Northerners&quot;. Additionally, the entire section cites only one reference, and this makes me feel that it should be carefully examined and then probably rewritten.

==Racist comment deleted==

I'm giving an explanation to an edit I made here, cause there's not enough room in the editing page + I'm only registered in Wikipedia Israel so you can't contact me regularly to discuss this if you wish to respond:
The first paragraph ended with the sentence &quot;There was no comparable  opposition to slavery within the Muslim world&quot;. I erased that sentence because it's racist:
First of all, slavery was rooted in some Arab countries which have a Muslim majority, but definitely not in the whole Muslim world. And since you didn't state that other non-Muslim areas that didn't have slavery, like the Far East, didn't have such a movement there, I don't see a reason to mention that so-called fact [which I doubt; I think most of the knowledge we have today is based on western prejudices] regarding the Muslim world.
Second of all, I don't even think it's relevant. The Abolitionist movement wasn't acting based on the fact Europe was Christian.
Referring to the Muslim religion automatically gives the impression that the Abolitionists were Christian, as this is the monotheist religion automatically compared to it, and that assumption pushes over the Africans fighting abolition, which didn't have a monotheist religion. 
Ans third of all - I generally think it's very dangerous to refer to cultural\religious elements with out referring to important factors such as social-political conditions [for example, the industrial revolution that took place in Europe at the time didn't have the same influences on Arab counries].

== Abolitionism in the Non-Western World ==

Hi, I'm wondering if there's any interest in a collaborative effort to include information on abolitionism in slave-holding societies outside the West, i.e. in Asia and Africa. 

I can input information on Yu Hyongwon, a seventeenth-century Korean Confucian scholar who wrote extensively against slave-holding in seventeenth-century Korea. Yu's particularly interesting because his abolitionist arguments are entirely based on non-Western, Confucian humanistic concepts, but his words remarkably parallel the tenets of more famous Western abolitionists born hundreds of years after him. For example, Yu argued that slavery violates the fundamental principle that &quot;people are all the same&quot;; he attested that slavery erodes the state's economic capacity because &quot;only if a person is a slave do others make them labor, and only if a person is a slave is he made to labor for others&quot; - in other words, labor becomes a de-valued activity fit only for the bonded class; and finally, hundreds of years before Frederick Douglass, Yu wrote that slavery brutalized not only the slaves, but the masters as well (James Palais, ''Confucian Statecraft and Korean Institutions: Yu Hyongwon and the Late Choson Dynasty'', pp 208-273) 

If we could include info on similar anti-slavery writers and activists in pre-modern and early modern China, Japan, the Middle East, and Africa, we could better highlight that slavery was not simply a Western sin, and that abolitionism was not simply a Western blessing.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Eebumssuk|Eebumssuk]] ([[User talk:Eebumssuk|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Eebumssuk|contribs]]) 02:21, 16 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Abolitionism as a movement in the 18th/19th century is a large topic, while a more global view of the effects of this movement would be useful (and probably less emphasis on the US in this article, as no doubt Abolitionism in the US could be a very large article on its own), I think it should avoid spreading all over the history of slavery and its opponents for all history, which could no doubt be summarised in a yet more general article (and could well already be). Putting an article in its historical/global context can be useful, but you have to equally be aware of the problems of having too large an overlap with other similar/related articles. --[[Special:Contributions/86.161.73.164|86.161.73.164]] ([[User talk:86.161.73.164|talk]]) 02:37, 19 October 2010 (UTC)

:I've tried to reframe the lead in a less western-centric fashion and moved much of the material from there into the  corresponding country sections. Countries/regions are now in alphabetical order. Stub mention of Eastern Europe and Korea has been added to the lead. My hope is that these changes will facilitate adding material on anti-slavery thought and actions from everywhere in the world. If the article grows too large, splitting out the Atlantic slave trade, or US and Great Britain, individually, may be appropriate, in my opinion. I haven't looked at dating inaccuracies yet but may come back to that if time permits. [[User:AbbyKelleyite|Abby Kelleyite]] ([[User talk:AbbyKelleyite|talk]]) 16:28, 31 July 2010 (UTC)
::Thank you! That is already an improvement. What I was meaning about the dating is that also movements from previous centuries (e.g. 14th century in France and Sweden) in Western Europe were not being included. Apologies for any possible confusion. [[User:Munci|Munci]] ([[User talk:Munci|talk]]) 19:45, 31 July 2010 (UTC)
:::Agreed, this is an improvement, and needs more in this direction. E.g., Saudi Arabia did not abolish slavery until 1962. Pockets of traditional slavery still exist in Mauritania and elsewhere. See [[Murray Gordon]], '''Slavery in the Arab world''' (1989 in English), '''L'esclavage dans le monde arabe''' (1987 in French).

: Weren't there criticisms in Europe too dating before the timeline here? [[User:Mnewmanqc|mnewmanqc]] ([[User talk:Mnewmanqc|talk]]) 07:11, 1 June 2012 (UTC)

== Apprenticeship ==
I think the link to the article on apprenticeship should be removed, because the apprenticeship programme for slaves had little to do with our modern idea of the word &quot;apprenticeship&quot;.

== Lack of information on Islamic slaves ==

There is minimal information written on slavery in the Islamic cultures. Thomas Sowell indicates that long after the west abolish slavery, Islamic countries continued their slavery practises. Further Sowell asserts that Arabs enslaved up to 10,000,000more black Africans than the US and South America.[[User:Henryjoseph|Henryjoseph]] ([[User talk:Henryjoseph|talk]]) 16:03, 10 November 2011 (UTC)henryjoseph&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sowell: Conquest and Cultures &lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting point to consider is what happened to the descendants of those slaves. Was Black Slavery a death sentence through extermination or castration in Islamic cultures?

==Tort==
I think that ...183's point that the courts solved the North's problem through the tort system is important. They were not criminal cases as they would be today, but &quot;property-contract&quot; matters. Don't quite know how to work this back in.

==Question re text ==
In the history listing of this article, I saw a change - and the current version compared to the previous has the following:

&quot;Despite the ending of slavery in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], slavery was a strong institution in the [[Stupid Colonies]] of [[British America]] and the [[British West Indies|West Indian colonies]] of the [[British Empire]].&quot; 

But when I tried to edit this vandalism, the offending &quot;Stupid&quot; text was not there to fix! What goes on?? ([[User:Dumarest|Dumarest]] ([[User talk:Dumarest|talk]]) 21:10, 9 February 2012 (UTC))

==Topic is abolition of slavery==
I deleted content added by an editor claiming that a group that was anti-abortion was related to this topic. It's complicated enough to deal with this subject historically and in contemporary societies. It does not include anti-abortion activities.[[User:Parkwells|Parkwells]] ([[User talk:Parkwells|talk]]) 13:18, 27 June 2012 (UTC)

:I agree.  Just because some group chooses to make a metaphoric reference to abolition does not mean their opinions on abortion belong in this article. [[User:North Shoreman|Tom (North Shoreman)]] ([[User talk:North Shoreman|talk]]) 13:44, 27 June 2012 (UTC)

== More discussion of the significance of abolitionism needed ==

There is a well-developed body of writing concerning the reasons why Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807. [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=8918 This review] gives a good outline. Basically, the Trinidadian Marxist historian [[Eric Williams]] argued that the slave trade was abolished due to economic reasons, rather than because of the campaigning of British abolitionists. In the 1970s, Seymour Drescher argued that the slave trade was become more, not less, profitable in the late-C18th/early-19th centuries, and thus Williams's argument doesn't stand up. It would be good if this article could engage with this debate -- I'll do what I can, but I don't have much time to work on it right now.
