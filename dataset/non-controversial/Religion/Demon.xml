This is the demon article, not the daimon article. We already have a daimon article; talk about daimons there.
--&gt;

A '''demon''' is a supernatural, often malevolent being prevalent in [[religion]], [[occultism]], [[literature]], and [[folklore]]. The original Greek word ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]]'' does not carry the negative connotation initially understood by implementation of the [[Koine Greek|Koine]] δαιμόνιον (daimonion),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddaimo%2Fnion |title=δαιμόνιον |author= Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott |work=Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later ascribed to any cognate words sharing the root.

In [[Ancient Near Eastern religions]] as well as in the [[Abrahamic traditions]], including ancient and medieval [[Christian demonology]], a demon is considered an [[unclean spirit]], more specifically an evil [[angel]], which may cause [[demonic possession]], calling for an [[exorcism]]. In Western [[occultism]] and [[Renaissance magic]], which grew out of an amalgamation of [[Greco-Roman magic]], [[Jewish demonology]], and Christian tradition,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the course synopsis and bibliography for &quot;[https://medievalstudies.ceu.hu/courses/20102011/magic-science-religion-the-development-of-the-western-esoteric-traditions &quot;Magic, Science, Religion: The Development of the Western Esoteric Traditions&quot;], at Central European University, Budapest&lt;/ref&gt; a demon is a spiritual entity that may be [[conjuration|conjured]] and controlled.

==Terminology==
{{Further|Daemon|Agathodaemon|Cacodemon|Daimonic|Eudaimonia}}
[[File:Buer.gif|thumb|left|[[Buer (demon)|Buer]], the 10th spirit, who teaches &quot;Moral and Natural Philosophy&quot; (from a 1995 Mathers edition. Illustration by [[Louis Breton]] from ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'').]]

The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc| δαίμων}} ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimōn]]'' denotes a spirit or divine power, much like the [[Latin]] ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' or ''[[numen]]''. ''Daimōn'' most likely came from the Greek verb ''daiesthai'' (to divide, distribute).&lt;ref name=merriam-webster&gt;{{cite web|title=Demon|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demon|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek conception of a ''daimōns'' notably appears in the works of [[Plato]], where it describes the divine inspiration of [[Socrates]]. To distinguish the classical Greek concept from its later Christian interpretation, the former is anglicized as either ''daemon'' or ''daimon'' rather than ''demon''.

The Greek term does not have any connotations of evil or malevolence. In fact, εὐδαιμονία ''[[eudaimonia]]'', (lit. good-spiritedness) means happiness. The term first acquired its negative connotations in the [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], which drew on the mythology of [[ancient Semitic religions]]. This was then inherited by the Koine text of the [[New Testament]]. The Western medieval and neo-medieval conception of a ''demon'' (see the Medieval [[grimoire]] called the ''[[Ars Goetia]]'') derives seamlessly from the ambient popular culture of Late (Roman) Antiquity. The Hellenistic &quot;daemon&quot; eventually came to include many Semitic and Near Eastern gods as evaluated by Christianity.

The supposed existence of demons is an important concept in many modern religions and occultist traditions. Demons are still feared as a popular [[superstition]], largely due to their alleged power to [[demonic possession|possess]] living creatures. In the contemporary Western occultist tradition (perhaps epitomized by the work of [[Aleister Crowley]]), a demon (such as [[Choronzon]], the Demon of the Abyss) is a useful metaphor for certain inner psychological processes (inner demons), though some may also regard it as an objectively real phenomenon. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, 1987; Black and Rowley, 1987; Duchesne-Guillemin, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; believe that large portions of the [[demonology]] (see [[Asmodai]]) of [[Judaism]], a key influence on [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], originated from a later form of [[Zoroastrianism]], and were transferred to Judaism during the Persian era.

==Psychological archetype==
[[File:Japanese demon mask.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|The classic [[Oni (folklore)|Japanese demon]], an ogre-like creature which often has horns.]]
Psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]] remarked that &quot;among the activities attributed by myths all over the world to demons, the harmful predominate, so that in popular belief bad demons are clearly older than good ones.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freud (1950, 65), quoting Wundt (1906, 129).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] developed this idea and claimed that the concept of demons was derived from the important relation of the living to the dead: &quot;The fact that demons are always regarded as the spirits of those who have died ''recently'' shows better than anything the influence of mourning on the origin of the belief in demons.&quot;

[[M. Scott Peck]], an American psychiatrist, wrote two books on the subject, ''People of the Lie: The Hope For Healing Human Evil''&lt;ref&gt;People of the Lie: The Hope For Healing Human Evil (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Glimpses of the Devil: A Psychiatrist's Personal Accounts of Possession, Exorcism, and Redemption''.&lt;ref&gt;Glimpses of the Devil: A Psychiatrist's Personal Accounts of Possession, Exorcism, and Redemption (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Peck describes in some detail several cases involving his patients. In ''People of the Lie'' he provides identifying characteristics of an evil person, whom he classified as having a character disorder. In ''Glimpses of the Devil'' Peck goes into significant detail describing how he became interested in [[exorcism]] in order to debunk the ''myth'' of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by evil spirits – only to be convinced otherwise after encountering two cases which did not fit into any category known to [[psychology]] or [[psychiatry]]. Peck came to the conclusion that possession was a rare phenomenon related to evil, and that possessed people are not actually evil; rather, they are doing battle with the forces of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/01/18/peck/index.html The exorcist], an interview with M. Scott Peck by Rebecca Traister published in [http://www.salon.com/index.html Salon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Peck's earlier work was met with widespread popular acceptance, his work on the topics of evil and possession has generated significant debate and derision. Much was made of his association with (and admiration for) the controversial [[Malachi Martin]], a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and a former [[Jesuit]], despite the fact that Peck consistently called Martin a liar and manipulator.&lt;ref name = &quot;Woods&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/159/story_15928.html The Patient Is the Exorcist], an interview with M. Scott Peck by Laura Sheahen&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Woods, a Roman Catholic priest and theologian, has claimed that Dr. Peck misdiagnosed patients based upon a lack of knowledge regarding [[dissociative identity disorder]] (formerly known as multiple personality disorder), and had apparently transgressed the boundaries of [[professional ethics]] by attempting to persuade his patients into accepting Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woods&quot;&gt;[http://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005b/042905/042905m.htm The devil you know], ''National Catholic Reporter, April 29, 2005, a commentary on ''Glimpses of the Devil'' by Richard Woods&lt;/ref&gt; Father Woods admitted that he has never witnessed a genuine case of demonic possession in all his years.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoodsInfo&quot;&gt;[http://www.dom.edu/newsroom/experts/faculty/faculty_w.html#woods Dominican Newsroom]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoodsBio&quot;&gt;[http://richardwoodsop.net/site/Bio.php RichardWoodsOP.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bustedhalo&quot;&gt;[http://bustedhalo.com/features/the-devil-and-the-details/2 BustedHalo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==By tradition==

===Ancient Near East===

====Mesopotamia====
[[File:Lammasu.jpg|thumb|right|Human-headed winged bull, otherwise known as a ''[[shedu|Šedu]]'']]

According to the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], &quot;In [[Chaldea]]n mythology the seven evil deities were known as ''[[shedu]]'', storm-demons, represented in ox-like form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|year=1906|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13967-spirits-conception-of}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were represented as [[Sacred bull|winged bulls]], derived from the colossal bulls used as protective jinns of royal palaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Delitzsch, ''Assyrisches Handwörterbuch''. pp. 60, 253, 261, 646; Jensen, ''Assyr.-Babyl. Mythen und Epen'', 1900, p. 453; [[Archibald Sayce]], l.c. pp. 441, 450, 463; [[François Lenormant|Lenormant]], l.c. pp. 48-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Chaldea, the term ''shedu'' traveled to the Israelites. The writers of the Tanach applied the word as a [[dialogism]] to Canaanite deities.

There are indications that demons in popular Hebrew mythology were believed to come from the nether world.&lt;ref&gt;compare {{bibleverse||Isaiah|38:11}} with {{bibleverse||Job|14:13}}; {{bibleverse||Psalms|16:10}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalms|49:16}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Psalms|139:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various diseases and ailments were ascribed to them, particularly those affecting the brain and those of internal nature. Examples include the catalepsy, headache, epilepsy, and nightmares. There also existed a demon of blindness, &quot;Shabriri&quot; (lit. &quot;dazzling glare&quot;) who rested on uncovered water at night and blinded those who drank from it.
 
Demons supposedly entered the body and caused the disease while overwhelming or &quot;seizing&quot; the victim. To cure such diseases, it was necessary to draw out the evil demons by certain incantations and talismanic performances, which the [[Essenes]] excelled at. [[Josephus]], who spoke of demons as &quot;spirits of the wicked which enter into men that are alive and kill them&quot;, but which could be driven out by a certain root,&lt;ref&gt;''Bellum Judaeorum'' vii. 6, § 3&lt;/ref&gt; witnessed such a performance in the presence of the Emperor Vespasian&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Antiquities&quot; viii. 2, § 5&lt;/ref&gt; and ascribed its origin to [[King Solomon]]. In mythology, there were few defences against Babylonian demons. The mythical mace [[Sharur (mythological weapon)|Sharur]] had the power to slay demons such as [[Asag]], a legendary [[gallu]] or [[edimmu]] of hideous strength.

====Ancient Arabia====
[[Arabian mythology|Pre-Islamic mythology]] did not differentiate between gods and demons. [[Jinn]]s were considered divinities of inferior rank and had many human abilities, such as eating, drinking, and procreating. While most jinn were considered peaceful and well-disposed towards humans, there also existed evil jinns who contrived to injure people.

====Hebrew Bible====
[[File:Lilith (John Collier painting).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lilith]], by [[John Collier (artist)|John Collier]], 1892]]

Demons in the [[Hebrew Bible]] are of two classes: the ''se'irim'' (&quot;hairy beings&quot;) and the ''[[shedim]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The ''se'irim'', to which some [[Israelite]]s offered sacrifices in the open fields, were [[satyr]]-like creatures, described as dancing in the wilderness ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|13:21}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|34:14}}). &quot;The Israelites also offered sacrifices to the shedim (Deut. xxxii. 17; Ps. cvi. 37)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5085-demonology The Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some benevolent ''shedim'' were used in kabbalistic ceremonies (as with the ''[[golem]]'' of Rabbi Yehuda Loevy), and malevolent ''shedim'' (''mazikin'', from the root meaning &quot;to damage&quot;) were often credited with possession. Similarly, a ''shed'' might inhabit an otherwise inanimate statue.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Aggadah}}
According to some rabbinic sources, demons were believed to be under the dominion of a king or chief, either [[Asmodai]]&lt;ref&gt;Targ. to Eccl. i. 13; Pes. 110a; Yer. Shek. 49b&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the older [[Haggadah]], [[Samael]] (&quot;the angel of death&quot;, also called the &quot;chief of the devils&quot;), who killed via poison. Occasionally a demon was called ''[[satan]]'': &quot;Stand not in the way of an ox when coming from the pasture, for Satan dances between his horns&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pes. 112b; compare B. Ḳ. 21a&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonology never became an essential feature of Jewish theology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} However, the existence of demons was never questioned by the [[Talmudist]]s and late rabbis, nor did most of the medieval thinkers question their reality. Only rationalists like [[Maimonides]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] explicitly denied their existence. Their point of view eventually became mainstream Jewish understanding.

[[Rabbi]]nical demonology has three classes of demons, though they are scarcely separable one from another. There were the ''shedim'', the {{unicode | ''mazziḳim''}} (&quot;harmers&quot;), and the ''{{unicode | ruḥin}}'' (&quot;spirits&quot;). There were also ''lilin'' (&quot;night spirits&quot;), ''{{unicode | ṭelane}}'' (&quot;shade&quot;, or &quot;evening spirits&quot;), ''{{unicode | ṭiharire}}'' (&quot;midday spirits&quot;), and ''{{unicode | ẓafrire}}'' (&quot;morning spirits&quot;), as well as the &quot;demons that bring famine&quot; and &quot;such as cause storm and earthquake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(Targ. Yer. to Deuteronomy xxxii. 24 and Numbers vi. 24; Targ. to Cant. iii. 8, iv. 6; Eccl. ii. 5; Ps. xci. 5, 6.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=245&amp;letter=D |title=Jewish Encyclopedia Demonology|accessdate=2007-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian demonology===
{{Main|Christian demonology}}
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 050 detail 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Death and the Miser]] (detail), a [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painting, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington DC]]]]

In the Gospels, particularly the ''[[Gospel of Mark]]'', Jesus cast out many demons or evil [[angels]] from those afflicted with various ailments. He also lent this power to some of his disciples ({{bibleverse||Luke|10:17}}). The demons were cast out by the utterance of a name, according to {{bibleverse||Matthew|7:22}}, with some groups insisting the [[Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament#Etymology_of_Jesus|original]] pronunciation of the name &quot;Jesus&quot; be used. The demons or unclean spirits themselves were said to often recognize Jesus as the Messiah. In {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:43}}, Jesus taught that when demons were driven from a human, they went through dry places as disembodied spirits seeking respite, although on some occasion he would send them into a herd of swine. Through all accounts, Jesus had never failed in his exorcism of a demon.

By way of contrast, in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], a group of Judaistic exorcists known as the sons of Sceva attempted to cast out a powerful spirit without belief in Jesus, but failed with disastrous consequences.

{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:7-17}} describes a battle between God's army and Satan's followers and the latter's subsequent expulsion from Heaven to Earth in order to persecute humans.{{clarify|date=April 2012}} {{bibleverse||Luke|10:18}} mentions a power granted by Jesus to cast out demons made Satan &quot;fall like lightning from heaven&quot;.

[[Apuleius]], by [[Augustine of Hippo]], is ambiguous as to whether ''daemons'' had become 'demonized' by the early 5th century:

: He [Apulieus] also states that the blessed are called in Greek ''eudaimones'', because they are good souls, that is to say, good demons, confirming his opinion that the souls of men are demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Augustine of Hippo]] |work=City of God'', ch. 11 |title=Of the Opinion of the Platonists, that the Souls of Men Become Demons When Disembodied |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.IX.11.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary Roman Catholic Church unequivocally teaches that angels and demons are real beings rather than just symbolic devices. The Catholic Church has a cadre of officially sanctioned exorcists which perform many [[exorcism]]s each year. The exorcists of the Catholic Church teach that demons attack humans continually but that afflicted persons can be effectively healed and protected either by the formal rite of exorcism, authorized to be performed only by bishops and those they designate, or by prayers of deliverance, which any Christian can offer for themselves or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20040405135007/http://www.fathercorapi.com/articledet.asp?articleID=1928275639 |title=Angels and Demons - Facts not Fiction |publisher=fathercorapi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building upon the few references to ''daemons'' in the New Testament, especially the poetry of the Book of Revelation, Christian writers of [[apocrypha]] from the 2nd century onwards created a more complicated tapestry of beliefs about &quot;demons&quot; that was largely independent of Christian scripture.

At various times in Christian history, attempts have been made to classify demons according to various proposed [[demonic hierarchy|demonic hierarchies]].

According to [[Christian demonology]], demons will be eternally punished and never will reconcile with God. Other theories postulate a [[universal reconciliation]], in which Satan, the fallen angels, and the souls of the dead that were condemned to Hell reconcile with God. This doctrine is today often associated with the [[Unification Church]]. [[Origen]], [[Jerome]], and [[Gregory of Nyssa]] also mentioned this possibility.

===Wicca===
In Wicca there is an act of summoning called Goetic Magick which can include various entities including demons, angels and elementals. The purpose of Goetic Magick summoning varies by the entity being summoned.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Wicca and witchcraft - Page 187&lt;/ref&gt; Demons are however never worshipped, however their existence is acknowledged as powerful yet dangerous. Demons can be controlled by knowledgable Wiccans.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca - Page 95, Rosemary Guiley - 2008 -&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
[[File:Descending into cave.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Majlis al Jinn]] cave in [[Oman]], literally &quot;Meeting place of the [[Jinn]]&quot;.]]
{{See also|Devil (Islam)|Jinn#Jinn in Islam}}

[[Islam]] recognizes the existence of [[jinn]], which are sentient beings with free will that can co-exist with humans (though not the genies of modern lore). In Islam, evil jinns are referred to as the ''shayātīn'', or devils, with [[Devil (Islam)|Iblis]] (Satan) as their chief. Iblis was one of the first jinn; he disobeyed God and did not bow down before Adam refusing to acknowledge a creature made of &quot;clay&quot;. Thus, Iblis was condemned to hell. He asked for respite until the Last day (Judgement Day), when he vowed to make mankind fall and deny the existence of their creator, to which God replied that Iblis would only be able to mislead those who were not righteous believers, warning that Iblis and all who followed him in evil would be punished in Hell.

===Hinduism===
Hinduism includes numerous varieties of spirits that might be classified as demons, including [[Vetala]]s, [[Bhuta]]s and [[Pishacha]]s. [[Rakshasa]]s and [[Asura]]s are often also taken as demons.

====Asuras====
[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|left|thumb|Asura in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], 734, [[Japan]]ese]]
[[File:The Army of Super Creatures.jpg|thumb|The Army of Super Creatures - from The Sougandhika Parinaya Manuscript (1821 CE)]]

Originally, ''Asura'', in the earliest hymns of the [[Rig Veda]], meant any supernatural spirit, either good or bad. Since the /s/ of the Indic linguistic branch is cognate with the /h/ of the Early Iranian languages, the word ''Asura'', representing a category of celestial beings, became the word ''Ahura'' (Mazda), the Supreme God of the monotheistic [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]]. Ancient Hinduism tells that [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s (also called ''suras'') and [[Asura]]s are half-brothers, sons of the same father Kasyapa; although some of the Devas, such as [[Varuna]], are also called Asuras. Later, during [[Puranic]] age, [[Asura]] and [[Rakshasa]] came to exclusively mean any of a race of anthropomorphic, powerful, possibly evil beings. Daitya (lit. sons of the mother &quot;Diti&quot;), Rakshasa (lit. from &quot;harm to be guarded against&quot;), and Asura are incorrectly translated into English as &quot;demon&quot;.

In Hindu mythology, pious, highly enlightened Asuras, such as [[Prahlada]] and [[Vibheeshana]], are not uncommon. The Asura are not fundamentally against the gods, nor do they tempt humans to fall. This is markedly different from the traditional Western notions of demons as a rival army of God but comparable with the concept of the [[jinn]]s in Islam.{{contradiction-inline|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--Section on Islam says Satan, as the main jinn, does tempt humans to fall--&gt; Many people metaphorically interpret the Asura as manifestations of the ignoble passions in the human mind and as a symbolic devices. There were also cases of power-hungry Asuras challenging various aspects of the Gods, but only to be defeated eventually and seek forgiveness—see [[Surapadman]] and [[Narakasura]].

====Evil spirits====
Hinduism advocates the reincarnation and transmigration of souls according to one's [[karma]]. Souls ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) of the dead are adjudged by the [[Yama]] and are accorded various purging punishments before being reborn. Humans that have committed extraordinary wrongs are condemned to roam as lonely, often evil, spirits for a length of time before being reborn. Many kinds of such spirits ([[Vetala]]s, [[Pishacha]]s, [[Bhūta]]) are recognized in the later Hindu texts. These beings, in a limited sense, can be called demons.

===Bahá'í Faith===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], demons are not regarded as independent evil spirits as they are in some faiths. Rather, evil spirits described in various faiths' traditions, such as Satan, fallen angels, demons, and jinns, are metaphors for the base character traits a human being may acquire and manifest when he turns away from God and follows his lower nature. Belief in the existence of ghosts and earthbound spirits is rejected and considered to be the product of superstition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Psmith112&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | isbn=978-0-521-86251-6 | ref = harv | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
