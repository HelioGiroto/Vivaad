Some groups included do not consider themselves a [[Christian denomination|denomination]] (e.g., the [[Roman Catholic Church]] considers itself the [[one true church]] and the [[Apostolic See]], and as pre-denominational).  Regarding the use of the word &quot;church,&quot; the Roman Catholic Church does not consider any groups or denominations to be true &quot;churches&quot; unless they have maintained [[apostolic succession]] and observe the [[seven sacraments]] (by this definition, the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], and a few other churches (PNCC, some Old Catholics, etc.) are, for the most part, the only other Christian groupings considered by the Catholic Church to be true &quot;churches&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups are large (e.g. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] or [[Baptists]]), while others are just a few small churches, and in most cases the relative size is not evident in this list. Also, modern movements such as [[Fundamentalist Christianity]], [[Pietism]], [[Evangelicalism]], [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Holiness movement]] sometimes cross denominational lines, or in some cases create new denominations out of two or more continuing groups, (as is the case for many [[United and uniting churches]], for example). Such subtleties and complexities are not clearly depicted here. Additionally, some groups viewed by non-adherents as denominational actively resist being called a &quot;denomination&quot; and do not have any formal denominational structure, authority, or record-keeping beyond the local congregation; several groups within [[Restoration Movement]] fall into this category.

:''Note: This is not a complete list, but aims to provide a comprehensible overview of the diversity among denominations of Christianity. As there are reported to be approximately 41,000 Christian denominations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://christianity.about.com/od/denominations/p/christiantoday.htm Christianity Today – General Statistics and Facts of Christianity Today&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; many of which cannot be verified to be significant, only those denominations with Wikipedia articles will be listed in order to ensure that all entries on this list are notable and verifiable.

:''Note: Between denominations, theologians, and comparative religionists there are considerable disagreements about which groups can be properly called Christian, disagreements arising primarily from doctrinal differences between groups. For the purpose of simplicity, this list is intended to reflect the self-understanding of each denomination. Explanations of different opinions concerning their status as Christian denominations can be found at their respective articles.

:''Note: There is no official recognition in most parts of the world for religious bodies, and there is no official clearinghouse which could determine the status or respectability of religious bodies.  Often there is considerable disagreement between various churches about whether other churches should be labeled with pejorative terms such as &quot;cult&quot;, or about whether this or that group enjoys some measure of respectability.  Such considerations often vary from place to place, where one religious group may enjoy majority status in one region, but be widely regarded as a &quot;dangerous cult&quot; in another part of the world.  Inclusion on this list does not indicate any judgment about the size, importance, or character of a group or its members.

== Catholicism==
{{main|Catholicism}}

These are the churches which claim continuity (based upon [[Apostolic Succession]]) with the early Church.

===Catholic Church ===
{{main|Catholic Church}}

The Catholic Church is composed of 23 Rites: the Western or [[Latin Rite]] and the 22 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rites]] (i.e., Eastern Catholic Churches).

====The Latin Church====
{{Main|Latin Rite}}
The Latin Rite (not to be confused with the [[Roman Rite]], which is one of the [[Latin liturgical rites]], not a particular Church) is the largest and most widely known of the 23 [[Particular Church#Autonomous particular Churches or Rites|Rites]] that together make up the [[Catholic Church]].

====Eastern Catholic Churches ====
{{main|Eastern Catholic Churches}}

All of the following are [[Particular Church]]es of the Catholic Church. They are all in [[Full communion|communion]] with the [[Bishop of Rome]] and acknowledge his claim of universal jurisdiction and authority. They have some minor distinct theological emphases and expressions (for instance, in the case of those that are of Greek/Byzantine tradition, concerning some non-doctrinal aspects of the Latin view of [[Purgatory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Dragani, ''[http://www.east2west.org/doctrine.htm#Purgatory From East to West]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Catholic churches and the Latin church (which together compose the worldwide Catholic Church) share the same doctrine and sacraments, and thus the same faith.

==Oriental Orthodoxy==
{{main|Oriental Orthodoxy}}
Oriental Orthodoxy comprises those Christians who did not accept the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (AD 451). Other denominations often erroneously label these churches &quot;[[Monophysite]]&quot;, however, as the Oriental Orthodox do not adhere to the teachings of [[Eutyches]], they themselves reject this label, preferring the term [[Miaphysite]].

==Church of the East==
The Church of the East is said to have been formed by [[Thomas (Apostle)|St Thomas]]. The Church did not attend the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (AD 431).  It is incorrectly referred to as the Nestorian Church; Assyrian Christians do not consider themselves Nestorians, and recent Christological agreements with the Catholic and some of the Orthodox churches have resolved this debate permanently, clearing the way for ecumenical relations.

*[[Assyrian Church of the East]] (Mar Dinkha IV)
*[[Ancient Church of the East]] (Mar Addai II)
*[[Eastern Catholic Church]] (Mar Mikhail of Edessa, Metropolitan)

The Church of the East considers itself to be the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church that Christ founded.

==Nontrinitarian groups==

===Latter Day Saints===
{{main|Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism}}
{{see also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
Most Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], established by [[Joseph Smith]] in 1830. The majority of &quot;Prairie Saint&quot; denominations were established after the [[Death of Joseph Smith|death of Smith]] by the remnants of the Saints who did not go west with [[Brigham Young]]. Many of which rejected some or most of the 1840s theological developments in favor of 1830s theological understandings and practices. The Rocky Mountain denominations are [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and various sects who broke from it after its settlement in the Rocky Mountains, many breaking after its abandonment of practicing [[polygamy]] in 1890. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a [[prophet]], or acceptance of the [[Book of Mormon]] as [[religious text|scripture]]. [[Mormonism]] is generally considered [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]], believing that Smith, by inspiration and revelation, restored the original Church of Christ to the earth. Some Latter Day Saint denominations are regarded by other Christians as being nontrinitarian, but generally do not accept that label themselves, in contrast to the groups labeled &quot;nontrinitarian&quot; below.

The churches within the Latter Day Saint movement are not recognized as an orthodox Christian denomination, and with the exception of Community of Christ, which is a member communion of the National Council of Churches, are usually rejected as Christian by many Protestants. Mormons, however, strongly oppose this rejection.

==New Thought ==

The relation of New Thought to Christianity is sometimes murky spiritually; some of its adherents see themselves as practising a true form of Christianity, while adherents of [[Religious Science]] says &quot;yes and no&quot; to the question of whether they consider themselves to be Christian in belief and practice, leaving it up to the individual to define oneself spiritually.
