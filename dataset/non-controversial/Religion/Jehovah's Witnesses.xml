The group emerged from the [[Bible Student movement]]—founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]] with the formation of [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society]]—with significant organizational and doctrinal changes under the leadership of [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Embryonic State of a Religious Sect's Development: The Jehovah's Witnesses|journal=Sociological Yearbook of Religion in Britain|editor=Michael Hill|year=1972|issue=5|pages=11–12|quote=Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded to Russell's position as President of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society, but only at the expense of antagonizing a large proportion of the Watch Towers subscribers.

Jehovah's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching, distributing literature such as ''[[The Watchtower]]'' and ''[[Awake!]]'', and refusing [[military service]] and [[blood transfusion]]s. They consider use of the name ''[[Jehovah]]'' vital for proper worship. They reject [[Trinity|Trinitarianism]], [[Christian conditionalism|inherent immortality]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and [[Hell in Christian beliefs|hellfire]], which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines. They do not observe [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], [[birthday]]s, or other holidays and customs they consider to have [[paganism|pagan]] origins incompatible with Christianity. Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as &quot;the truth&quot; and consider themselves to be &quot;in the truth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Holden | first = Andrew | title = Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | page = 64 | isbn = 0-415-26609-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Singelenberg | first = Richard | title = It Separated the Wheat From the Chaff: The 1975 Prophecy and its Impact Among Dutch Jehovah's Witnesses | journal = Sociological Analysis | volume = 50 | issue = Spring 1989 | pages = 23-40, footnote 8 | date = 1989 |quote='The Truth' is Witnesses' jargon, meaning the Society's belief system.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses consider secular [[society]] to be morally corrupt and under the influence of [[Satan]], and limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses.

[[Church discipline|Congregational disciplinary actions]] include ''[[Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline#Disfellowshipping|disfellowshipping]]'', their term for formal expulsion and [[shunning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chryssides | first = George D.  | title = Exploring New Religions | publisher = Continuum |  | date = 1999 | location = London | pages = 5  | isbn =0-8264-5959-5 | quote= The Jehovah's Witnesses are well known for their practice of 'disfellowshipping' wayward members. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered ''disassociated'' and are also shunned. Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant.

The religion's position regarding [[conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] to military service and refusal to [[salute]] national [[flag]]s has brought it into conflict with some governments. Consequently, Jehovah's Witnesses have been persecuted and their activities are banned or restricted in some countries. Persistent [[Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses by country|legal challenges by Jehovah's Witnesses]] have influenced legislation related to [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] in several countries.

===Background (1870–1916)===
[[File:C.T. Russell.gif|left|thumb|187px|[[Charles Taze Russell]] (1852–1916)]]

In 1870, [[Charles Taze Russell]] and others formed an independent group in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] to study the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rogerson |first = Alan| title = Millions Now Living Will Never Die: A Study of Jehovah's Witnesses | publisher = Constable &amp; Co, London| year = 1969 |pages = 6| isbn = 094559406}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of his ministry Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul, hellfire, predestination, the fleshly return of Jesus Christ, the Trinity, and the burning up of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;beckford1874&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beckford | first = James A.| title = The Trumpet of Prophecy: A Sociological Study of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = Basil Blackwell | year = 1975 | location = Oxford | pages = 2| isbn = 0-631-16310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 Russell met [[Nelson H. Barbour]]; later that year they jointly produced the book ''[[Three Worlds (book)|Three Worlds]]'', which combined restitutionist views with [[end time]] prophecy. The book taught that God's dealings with mankind were divided [[Dispensationalism|dispensationally]], each ending with a &quot;harvest&quot;, that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874&lt;ref name=&quot;beckford1874&quot; /&gt; inaugurating the &quot;harvest of the Gospel age&quot;, and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called &quot;the Gentile Times&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Crompton | first = Robert | title = Counting the Days to Armageddon | publisher = James Clarke &amp; Co | year = 1996 | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-227-67939-3| pages = 37-39}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God's kingdom on earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Bible Examiner'' October, 1876 &quot;Gentile Times: When Do They End?&quot; pp 27–8: &quot;The seven times will end in A.D. 1914; when Jerusalem shall be delivered forever ... when Gentile Governments shall have been dashed to pieces; when God shall have poured out of his fury upon the nations and they acknowledge him King of Kings and Lord of Lords.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in the Scriptures'' volume 4, &quot;The Battle of Armageddon&quot;, 1897, pg xii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Russell, ''The Time is at Hand'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1889, page 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1878 they jointly edited a religious journal, ''Herald of the Morning''. In June&amp;nbsp;1879 the two split over doctrinal differences and in July Russell began publishing the magazine ''[[The Watchtower|Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;contemporary18&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Holden, A.|year=2002|title=Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement|page=18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-585-45314-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that its purpose was to demonstrate the world was in &quot;the last days&quot;, and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the invisible reign of Christ was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower'', July 1, 1879, pg 1: &quot;This is the first number of the first volume of &quot;Zion's Watch Tower,&quot; and it may not be amiss to state the object of its publication. That we are living &quot;in the last days&quot;—&quot;the day of the Lord&quot;—&quot;the end&quot; of the Gospel age, and consequently, in the dawn of a &quot;new&quot; age.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1879 ''Watch Tower'' supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically. Thirty congregations were founded, and during 1879 and 1880 Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings.&lt;ref&gt;''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', Watch Tower, pages 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; As congregations continued to form during Russell's ministry they each remained self-administrative, functioning under the [[Congregational polity|congregationalist style]] of church governance.&lt;ref&gt;''Zion's Watch Tower'', September 1884, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in the Scriptures'' volume 6 &quot;The New Creation&quot; pp. 195-272&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 ''Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society'' was presided over by [[William Henry Conley]] and in 1884 [[Charles Taze Russell]] incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Russell, &quot;A Conspiracy Exposed&quot;, ''Zion's Watch Tower'' Extra edition, April 25, 1894, page 55–60, &quot;This is a business association merely ... it has no creed or confession ... it is merely a business convenience in disseminating the truth.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses'' by [[George D. Chryssides]], Scarecrow Press, 2008, page xxxiv, &quot;Russell wanted to consolidate the movement he had started. ...In 1880, Bible House, a four-story building in Allegheny, was completed, with printing facilities and meeting accommodation, and it became the organization's headquarters. The next stage of institutionalization was legal incorporation. In 1884, Russell formed the Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society, which was incorporated in Pennsylvania... Russell was concerned that his supporters should feel part of a unified movement.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Religion in the Twentieth Century'' by Vergilius Ture Anselm Ferm, Philosophical Library, 1948, page 383, &quot;As the [unincorporated Watch Tower] Society expanded, it became necessary to incorporate it and build a more definite organization. In 1884, a charter was granted recognizing the Society as a religious, non-profit corporation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; By about 1900 Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time [[colporteur]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Holden | first = Andrew | title = Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | page = 18 | isbn = 0-415-26609-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointing foreign [[missionaries]] and establishing branch offices. By the 1910s, Russell's organization maintained nearly a hundred &quot;pilgrims&quot;, or traveling preachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Holden | first = Andrew | title = Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement | publisher = Routledge | year = 2002 | page = 19 | isbn = 0-415-26609-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry,&lt;ref&gt;''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'' Greenwood Press: 1996. pg. 35: &quot;Russell is naturally media literate, and the amount of literature he circulates proves staggering. Books, booklets, and tracts are distributed by the hundreds of millions. This is supplemented by well-publicized speaking tours and a masterful press relations effort, which gives him widespread access to general audiences.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Overland Monthly pg. 130&quot;&gt;''The Overland Monthly'', January 1910 pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 26-29 | isbn = 0-8020-7973-3, 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1912 he was the most distributed Christian author in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Overland Monthly pg. 130&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.T. Ellis, ''The Continent'', McCormick Publishing Company, vol. 43, no. 40, October 3, 1912 pg. 1354&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell moved the Watch Tower Society's headquarters to [[Brooklyn]], New York, in 1909, combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named ''Bethel''. He identified the religious movement as &quot;Bible Students&quot;, and more formally as the [[Bible Students movement#International Bible Students Association|International Bible Students Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Diversity and American Religious History'' by Walter H. Conser, Sumner B. Twiss, University of Georgia Press, 1997, page 136, &quot;The Jehovah's Witnesses...has maintained a very different attitude toward history.

===Reorganization (1917–1942)===
[[File:J.F. Rutherford.gif|thumb|left|187px|[[Joseph Franklin Rutherford|Joseph F. Rutherford]] (1869–1942)]]

In January&amp;nbsp;1917, the Watch Tower Society's legal representative, [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]], was elected as its next president. His [[Watch Tower Society presidency dispute (1917)|election was disputed]], and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 53 | isbn = 0-8020-7973-3, 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Pierson et al, ''Light After Darkness'', 1917, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;crompton101&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Crompton | first = Robert | title = Counting the Days to Armageddon | publisher = James Clarke &amp; Co | year = 1996 | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-227-67939-3| pages = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Penton 1997 61–62&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 58, 61–62 | isbn = 0-8020-7973-3, 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June&amp;nbsp;1917 he released ''The Finished Mystery'' as a seventh volume of Russell's [[Studies in the Scriptures]] series.

Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society.

Some local congregations broke away, forming such groups as the Chicago Bible Students, the Dawn Bible Students, and the Laymen's Home Missionary Movement, all of which continue to this day.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1919 as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society,&lt;ref&gt;''Thirty Years a Watchtower Slave'', William J. Schnell, Baker, Grand Rapids, 1956, as cited by Rogerson, page 52. Rogerson notes that it is not clear exactly how many Bible Students left, but quotes Rutherford (''Jehovah'', 1934, page 277) as saying &quot;only a few&quot; who left other religions were then &quot;in God's organization&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Present Truth and Herald of Christ's Epiphany'', P.S.L. Johnson (April 1927, pg 66). Johnson claimed that between late 1923 and early 1927, &quot;20,000 to 30,000 Truth people the world over have left the Society.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Wills (''A People For His Name'', pg. 167) cites ''The Watch Tower'' (December 1, 1927, pg 355) in which Rutherford states that &quot;the larger percentage&quot; of original Bible Students had by then departed.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July&amp;nbsp;26,&amp;nbsp;1931, at a convention in [[Columbus, Ohio]], Rutherford introduced the new name—''Jehovah's witnesses''—based on Isaiah 43:10: &quot;Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen&quot;—which was adopted by resolution. The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society, as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogerson, Alan|title=Millions Now Living Will Never Die: A Study of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Constable|location=London|year=1969|pages=55–|quote=In 1931 came an important milestone in the history of the organisation.

From 1932 it was taught that the &quot;little flock&quot; of 144,000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon. Rutherford explained that in addition to the 144,000 &quot;anointed&quot; who would be resurrected—or transferred at death—to live in heaven to rule over earth with Christ, a separate class of members, the &quot;great multitude&quot;, would live in a paradise restored on earth; from 1935, new converts to the movement were considered part of that class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beckford | first = James A.| title = The Trumpet of Prophecy: A Sociological Study of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = Basil Blackwell | year = 1975 | location = Oxford | pages = 31| isbn = 0-631-16310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 71-72 | isbn = 0-8020-7973-3, 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s, the timing of the beginning of Christ's presence (Greek: ''parousía''), his enthronement as king, and the start of the &quot;[[end times|last days]]&quot; were each moved to 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Crompton | first = Robert | title = Counting the Days to Armageddon | publisher = James Clarke &amp; Co | year = 1996 | location = Cambridge | isbn = 0-227-67939-3| pages = 109-110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As their interpretations of scripture developed, Witness publications decreed that saluting national flags is a form of idolatry, which led to a new outbreak of mob violence and government opposition in the United States, Canada, Germany, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beckford | first = James A.| title = The Trumpet of Prophecy: A Sociological Study of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = Basil Blackwell | year = 1975 | location = Oxford | pages = 35| isbn = 0-631-16310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Garbe | first = Detlef  | title = Between Resistance and Martyrdom: Jehovah's Witnesses in the Third Reich | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press |  date = 2008 | location = Madison, Wisconsin | pages =145|  isbn =0-299-20794-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without any doubt at all, it was the small body of anointed brothers of Jesus who in 1914 were known as the Bible Students but since 1931 have been identified as Jehovah’s Witnesses.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eschatology===
{{Main|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
A central teaching of Jehovah's Witnesses is that the current world era, or &quot;system of things&quot;, entered the &quot;[[End time|last days]]&quot; in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ, leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hoekema | first = Anthony A. | authorlink = Anthony A.

Eerdmans | year = 1963 | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | pages = 297 | isbn = 0-8028-3117-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consider all other present-day religions to be false, identifying them with &quot;[[Babylon the great#Jehovah's Witnesses|Babylon the Great]]&quot;, or the &quot;harlot&quot;, of Revelation&amp;nbsp;17,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hoekema | first = Anthony A. | authorlink = Anthony A.

This development will mark the beginning of the &quot;[[great tribulation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Apocalypse—When?&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1986, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah's Witnesses, an action that will prompt God to begin the war of [[Armageddon]], during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ's &quot;sheep&quot;, or true followers, will be destroyed. After Armageddon, God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth, which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 180 | isbn = 0-8020-7973-3, 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Armageddon, most of those who had died before God's intervention will gradually be resurrected during &quot;judgment day&quot; lasting for [[Millenarianism|one thousand years]]. This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds. At the end of the thousand years, a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind. The end result will be a fully tested, glorified human race. Christ will then hand all authority back to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hoekema | first = Anthony A. | authorlink = Anthony A. Hoekema| title = The Four Major Cults | publisher = William B.

Watch Tower Society publications teach that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God's kingdom in October&amp;nbsp;1914, and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth, resulting in &quot;woe&quot; to mankind. They believe that Jesus rules invisibly, from heaven, perceived only as a series of &quot;signs&quot;. They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word ''[[Second Coming of Christ|parousia]]''—usually translated as &quot;coming&quot; when referring to Christ—as &quot;presence&quot;. They believe Jesus' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914, and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth. They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the &quot;[[second coming]]&quot; of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 17–19 | isbn = 0-8020-7973-3, 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower 10/1/92 p. 16 par. 6 &quot;The Messiah’s Presence and His Rule&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worship===
[[File:Reunião em Salão do Reino.jpg|thumb|Worship at a Kingdom Hall.]]
Meetings for worship and study are held at [[Kingdom Hall]]s, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols.&lt;ref name=holdenhall /&gt; Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose &quot;territory&quot; they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as &quot;meetings&quot; as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the religion's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide.&lt;ref name=holdenhall&gt;{{Cite book| last = Holden| first = Andrew| title = Jehovah's Witnesses: Portrait of a Contemporary Religious Movement| publisher = Routledge| year = 2002| pages = 64–69| isbn = 0-415-26610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (three meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for &quot;family worship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses: p. 6 Highlights of the Past Year &quot;UPBUILDING AND ENJOYABLE FAMILY WORSHIP&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower  5/15 2011 p. 14 par 13 Christian Families—“Keep Ready” Maintain a Family Worship Evening&lt;/ref&gt; Gatherings are opened and closed with [[kingdom songs]] ([[hymns]]) and brief prayers. Each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a &quot;circuit&quot; gather for one-day, and two-day assemblies. Several circuits meet once a year for a three-day &quot;district convention&quot;, usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums. Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the &quot;Lord's Evening Meal&quot;, or &quot;[[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Memorial of Christ's death|Memorial of Christ's Death]]&quot; on the date of the Jewish [[Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hoekema | first = Anthony A. | authorlink = Anthony A.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
[[File:JWStats1931-2010.png|400px||right]]
Jehovah's Witnesses have an active presence in most countries, but do not form a large part of the population of any country.

As of August&amp;nbsp;2011, Jehovah's Witnesses report an average of 7.39&amp;nbsp;million ''publishers''—the term they use for members actively involved in preaching—in 109,403 congregations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watchtower statistics&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = 2012 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses | publisher = Watchtower Bible and Tract Society | year = 2012| page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, these reports indicated over 1.7&amp;nbsp;billion hours spent in preaching and Bible study activity. Since the mid-1990s, the number of peak publishers has increased from 4.5&amp;nbsp;million to 7.65&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watch Tower Society|date=1996–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 2.4% per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watchtower statistics&quot;/&gt;

The official published membership statistics, such as those mentioned above, include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry; official statistics do not include ''inactive'' and ''disfellowshipped'' individuals or others who might attend their meetings. As a result, only about half of those who self-identified as Jehovah's Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered ''active'' by the faith itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey Religious Affiliation: Diverse and Dynamic | publisher=Pew Forum on Religion &amp;amp; Public Life | month=February | year=2008 | pages=9, 30 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1101.asp The Association of Religion Data Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 US [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life]] survey found a low retention rate among members of the religion: about 37% of people raised in the religion continued to identify themselves as Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1716987,00.html David Van Biema, &quot;America's Unfaithful Faithful,&quot; ''Time'' magazine, February 25, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf PEW Forum on Religion and Public Life. U.S. Religious Landscape Survey: Religious Affiliation: Diverse and Dynamic]. The next lowest retention rates, excluding those raised unaffiliated with any church, were Buddhism at 50% and Catholicism at 68%.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the [[National Council of Churches]] concluded that Jehovah's Witnesses &quot;had the largest growth of any single denomination [in America]&quot; with a 4.7% increase in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Membership of Pentecostal Church, Jehovah's Witnesses Up, Protestant Down |last1=Harris |first1=Dan |last2=Patrick |first2=Maggy |work=[[ABC News]] |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-religion-national-council-churches-reports-pentacostalism-gains/story?id=12931023 |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological analysis==
{{See also|Sociological classifications of religious movements}}
Sociologist [[James A. Beckford]] has classified the organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses as ''Totalizing'', characterized by an assertive leadership, specific and narrow objectives, control over competing demands on members' time and energy, and control over the quality of new members. Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities, reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations, a high rate of membership turnover, a low rate of doctrinal change, and strict uniformity of beliefs among members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beckford | first = James A.| title = The Trumpet of Prophecy: A Sociological Study of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = Basil Blackwell | year = 1975 | location = Oxford | pages = 92, 98–100| isbn = 0-631-16310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckford identified the religion's chief characteristics as ''historicism'' (identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God's purpose), ''absolutism'' (conviction that the Watch Tower Society dispenses absolute truth), ''activism'' (capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks), ''rationalism'' (conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery), ''authoritarianism'' (rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism) and ''world indifference'' (rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beckford | first = James A.| title = The Trumpet of Prophecy: A Sociological Study of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = Basil Blackwell | year = 1975 | location = Oxford | pages = 196–207| isbn = 0-631-16310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Bryan R. Wilson]], in his consideration of five religions including Jehovah's Witnesses, noted that each of the religions:&lt;ref&gt;Bryan R. Wilson, &quot;The Persistence of Sects&quot;, ''Diskus'', Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions, Vol 1, No. 2, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
# &quot;exists in a state of tension with the wider society;&quot;
# &quot;imposes tests of merit on would-be members;&quot;
# &quot;exercises stern discipline, regulating the declared beliefs and the life habits of members and prescribing and operating sanctions for those who deviate, including the possibility of expulsion;&quot;
# &quot;demands sustained and total commitment from its members, and the subordination, and perhaps even the exclusion of all other interests.&quot;

A sociological comparative study by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that Jehovah's Witnesses in the [[United States]] ranked highest in statistics for high school graduation, belief in God, importance of religion in one's life, frequency of religious attendance, frequency of prayers, belief their prayers are answered, belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way, belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life, opposition to abortion, and opposition to homosexuality. In the study, Jehovah's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://religions.pewforum.org/comparisons# |title= Comparisons |author= |date= |work= U.S. Religious Landscape Survey |publisher= Pew Research Center |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The small sample size of JWs (215) in comparison to other groups surveyed - over 9000 Evangelicals, over 8000 Catholics, over 7000 'mainline' churches, etc, total 35556) may skew these results--&gt;

==Opposition==
Controversy surrounding various beliefs, doctrines and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses has led to opposition from local governments, communities, and religious groups. Religious commentator Ken Jubber wrote that &quot;Viewed globally, this persecution has been so persistent and of such an intensity that it would not be inaccurate to regard Jehovah's witnesses as the most persecuted group of Christians of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jubber |first=Ken |title=The Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Southern Africa |journal=Social Compass, |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=121, |year=1977|doi=10.1177/003776867702400108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Purple Triangle.JPG|thumb|right|Jehovah's Witness prisoners were identified by purple triangle badges in Nazi concentration camps.]]
Political and religious animosity against Jehovah's Witnesses has at times led to [[mob action]] and [[government]] oppression in various countries. Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during [[World War II]] and at other times where [[national service]] has been compulsory. In Germany, about 10,000 Witnesses were imprisoned, including 2000 sent to [[concentration camps]], where they were identified by [[purple triangle]]s; as many as 1200 died, including 250 who were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Garbe | first = Detlef  | title = Between Resistance and Martyrdom: Jehovah's Witnesses in the Third Reich | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press |  date = 2008 | location = Madison, Wisconsin | pages =484|  isbn =0-299-20794-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulman&gt;Shulman, William L.

Authors including [[William J. Whalen|William Whalen]], Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses [[Barbara Grizzuti Harrison]], Alan Rogerson and William Schnell, have claimed the religion incited opposition to pursue a course of martyrdom under Rutherford's leadership during the 1930s, in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society, and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the &quot;truth&quot; of their struggle to serve God.&lt;ref&gt;Claims that Jehovah's Witnesses chose a deliberate course of martyrdom are contained in:&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book | last = Peters |first = Shawn Francis| title = Judging Jehovah's Witnesses: Religious Persecution and the Dawn of the Rights Revolution | publisher = University Press of Kansas| year = 2000 |pages = 82, 116-9| isbn = 0-7006-1008-1}}&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, ''Visions of Glory'', 1978, chapter 6.&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite book | last = Whalen | first = William J. | title = Armageddon Around the Corner: A Report on Jehovah's Witnesses | publisher = John Day Company | year = 1962 | location = New York | page = 190}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book | last = Schnell |first = William| title = 30 Years a Watchtower Slave | publisher = Baker Book House, Grand Rapids| year = 1971 |pages = 104–106| isbn = 0-8010-6384-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed Witnesses to &quot;avoid unnecessary opposition or prejudice&quot;, stating that their purpose is not to &quot;get arrested&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Advice for Kingdom Publishers''(1939), Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Brooklyn, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Governing Body member Guy H. Pierce stated, &quot;I don't think our [preaching] work was ever to be confrontational, but it was to draw attention to the message [about God's kingdom]. Confrontation came because we were there, because we were doing the work. But the idea was to draw attention to what the message from the Bible is.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Faith in Action DVD, Part 1 - Out of Darkness, time 30:20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal challenges===
{{Main|Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses by country}}
Several cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses have been heard by Supreme Courts throughout the world. The cases generally relate to their right to practice their religion, displays of patriotism and military service, and blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah’s Witnesses – Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, 1993, pp. 679–701.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, their persistent legal challenges prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;''Judging Jehovah's Witnesses'', Shawn Francis Peters, University Press of Kansas: 2000, pages 12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service, the right of patients to refuse medical treatment, and the right to engage in public discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knocking.org/Jehovahs_Witness_History_Civil_Rights.html |title=Jehovah's Witnesses and civil rights |author= |date= |work= |publisher= Knocking.org |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar cases in their favour have been heard in Canada, Germany, India, Japan, the Philippines and Russia.

Jehovah's Witnesses have successfully brought many cases related to religious freedom before the [[European Court of Human Rights]], affecting legislation related to civil rights in many European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/aboutjw/article12.htm#echr |title=Legal Cases |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Jehovah's Witnesses |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2012, a series of cases related to religious freedom have been pending before Russian courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/rus/index.htm |title=Russia  |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Jehovah's Witnesses |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
Jehovah's Witnesses have attracted criticism over issues surrounding their Bible translation, doctrines, their handling of sexual abuse cases, and what is claimed to be coercion of members. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.

===Suppression of free speech and thought===
Critics have described the religion's leadership as [[autocracy|autocratic]] and [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Rogerson, ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', Constable, 1969, page 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holden 2002 22&quot;/&gt; because of Watch Tower Society requirements for loyalty and obedience by Witnesses,&lt;ref name=&quot;voice&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Following Faithful Shepherds with Life in View&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 1967, page 591, &quot;Make haste to identify the visible theocratic organization of God that represents his king, Jesus Christ.

===New World Translation===
Some Bible scholars including [[Bruce M.

Rowley, How Not To Translate the Bible, ''The Expository Times'', 1953; 65; 41&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in his study on nine of &quot;the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world&quot; Bible scholar [[Jason BeDuhn]], Professor of Religious Studies from [[Northern Arizona University]], claimed that the ''New World Translation'' was not bias free, but that he considered it to be &quot;the most accurate of the translations compared,&quot; and &quot;a remarkably good translation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament | author = Jason BeDuhn | year = 2003 | publisher = University Press of America | isbn = 0-7618-2556-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Metzger stated, &quot;on the whole, one gains a tolerably good impression of the scholarly equipment of the translators&quot;, but goes on to criticize their insertion of the name ''Jehovah'' in the New Testament since it does not appear in the extant Greek manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;G.

In the following pages we will set forth a theory that the divine name, הוהי (and possibly abbreviations of it), was originally written in the NT quotations of and allusions to the O[ld] T[estament] and that in the course of time it was replaced mainly with the surrogate [abbreviation for Ky′ri·os, &quot;Lord&quot;]. This removal of the Tetragram[maton], in our view, created a confusion in the minds of early Gentile Christians about the relationship between the 'Lord God' and the 'Lord Christ' which is reflected in the MS tradition of the NT text itself. | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[R.

===Failed predictions===
{{Main|Watch Tower Society unfulfilled predictions}}
Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah's Witnesses (and formerly, the International Bible Students) to declare his will&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Messengers of Godly Peace Pronounced Happy&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 708.&lt;/ref&gt; and has provided advance knowledge about [[Armageddon]] and the establishment of [[God's kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Execution of the &quot;Great Harlot&quot; Nears&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What Jehovah’s Day Will Reveal&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 2010, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1960, page 444, &quot;In 1942 the faithful and discreet slave guided by Jehovah's unerring spirit made known that the democracies would win World War II and that there would be a United Nations organization set up ... Once again the faithful and discreet slave has been tipped off ahead of time for the guidance of all lovers of God.&quot; (Footnote cites the booklet ''Peace–Can It Last'', 1942, pages 21,22.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Franz]], who became a critic of the religion, has cited publications that claimed that God has used Jehovah's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern-day prophet.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Raymond Franz cites numerous examples. In ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2002, pg. 173, he quotes from &quot;They Shall Know That a Prophet Was Among Them&quot;, (''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1972,) which states that God had raised Jehovah's Witnesses as a prophet &quot;to warn (people) of dangers and declare things to come&quot; He also cites &quot;Identifying the Right Kind of Messenger&quot; (''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 8) which identifies the Witnesses as his &quot;true messengers ... by making the messages he delivers through them come true&quot;, in contrast to &quot;false messengers&quot;, whose predictions fail. In ''In Search of Christian Freedom,'' 2007, he quotes ''The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah – How?'' (1971, pg 70, 292) which describes Witnesses as the modern Ezekiel class, &quot;a genuine prophet within our generation&quot;. The Watch Tower book noted: &quot;Concerning the message faithfully delivered by the Ezekiel class, Jehovah positively states that it 'must come true' ... those who wait undecided until it does 'come true' will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them.&quot; He also cites &quot;Execution of the Great Harlot Nears&quot;, (''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, pg 17) which claims God gives the Witnesses &quot;special knowledge that others do not have ... advance knowledge about this system's end&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible.&lt;ref name=WT59&gt;''The Watchtower'', Jan. 15, 1959, pp. 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Crompton | first = Robert | title = Counting the Days to Armageddon | publisher = James Clarke &amp; Co | year = 1996 | location = Cambridge | pages = 9, 115 | isbn = 0-227-67939-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom,'' Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1993, pages 78, 632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beckford | first = James A.| title = The Trumpet of Prophecy: A Sociological Study of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = Basil Blackwell | year = 1975 | location = Oxford | pages = 219–221| isbn = 0-631-16310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics highlight failed predictions that the Watch Tower Society had claimed were &quot;beyond doubt&quot; or &quot;approved by God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James A.

Chryssides]] has suggested that with the exception of statements about 1914, 1925 and 1975, the changing views and dates of the Jehovah's Witnesses are largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgie&quot;/&gt;
