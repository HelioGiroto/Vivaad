[[File:Isaiah's Lips Anointed with Fire.jpg|thumb|Prophetic inspiration: ''Isaiah's Lips Anointed with Fire'', by [[Benjamin West]]]]

In [[religion]], a '''prophet''' is an individual who is claimed to have been contacted by the [[supernatural]] or the [[Divinity|divine]], and to speak for them, serving as an intermediary with humanity, delivering this newfound knowledge from the supernatural entity to other people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prophet prophet - definition of prophet by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mw1.m-w.com/dictionary/prophet prophet - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The message that the prophet conveys is called a [[prophecy]].

Claims of prophets have existed in many cultures through history, including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], in [[Ancient Greece]], [[Zoroaster]], and many others. Traditionally, prophets are regarded as having a role in society that promotes change due to their messages and actions.

The English word ''[[wiktionary:prophet|prophet]]'' comes from the Greek word ''[[wiktionary:προφήτης|προφήτης]]'' (profétés) meaning [[advocacy|advocate]]. In the late 20th century the appellation of ''prophet'' has been used to refer to individuals particularly successful at analysis in the field of economics, such as in the derogatory ''prophet of greed''. Alternatively, social commentators who suggest escalating crisis are often called ''prophets of doom.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ruff sees more rough times ahead - MarketWatch | accessdate = 2009-04-09 | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/ruff-sees-more-rough-times/story.aspx?guid=%7B0354D5FB%2D2AE2%2D48CB%2DA7F0%2D4B06FBE5EE61%7D&amp;dist=TNMostRead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nouriel Roubini: I fear the worst is yet to come - Times Online | accessdate = 2009-04-09 | url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5014463.ece | quote = ...after making a series of uncannily accurate predictions about the global meltdown, Roubini has become the prophet of his age... | work=The Times | location=London | first=Dominic | last=Rushe | date=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word נְבִיא (''navi''), &quot;spokesperson&quot;, traditionally translates as &quot;prophet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p.1571, Alcalay. A more accepted translation of this Hebrew word is derived from an Akkadian word &quot;nabu,&quot; meaning to call. The Hebrew &quot;navi&quot; has a passive sense and means &quot;the one who has been called&quot; (see HALOT, p.661).&lt;/ref&gt; The second subdivision of the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Tanakh|TaNaKh]] (for &quot;Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim&quot;), is devoted to the Hebrew prophets. The meaning of ''navi'' is perhaps described in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 18:18,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:18|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[God]] said, &quot;...and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.&quot; Thus, the ''navi'' was thought to be the &quot;mouth&quot; of God. The root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|vet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] (&quot;navi&quot;) is based on the two-letter root nun-vet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself &quot;open&quot;. Cf. [[Rashbam]]'s comment to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to writing and speaking messages from God, Hebrew prophets often acted out prophetic parables.&lt;ref&gt;All the Parables of the Bible, Herbert Lockyer, Zondervan, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in order to contrast the people’s disobedience with the obedience of the [[Rechabite]]s, God has [[Jeremiah]] invite the Rechabites to drink wine, in disobedience to their ancestor’s command. The Rechabites refuse, wherefore God commends them.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 35:13-16, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah 35, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Other prophetic parables acted out by Jeremiah include burying a linen belt so that it gets ruined to illustrate how God intends to ruin Judah's pride.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 13, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cj13&quot;&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah 13, Jeremiah, The Anchor Bible, Doubleday, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cj13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah, Lamentations, Tremper Longman, Hendrickson Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Jeremiah buys a clay jar and smashes it in the [[Gehenna|Valley of Ben Hinnom]] in front of elders and priests to illustrate that God will smash the [[Kingdom of Judah|nation of Judah]] and the city of Judah beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 19, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; God instructs Jeremiah to make a yoke from wood and leather straps and to put it on his own neck to demonstrate how God will put the nation under the yoke of [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], king of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 27-28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the prophet [[Isaiah]] had to walk stripped and barefoot for three years to illustrate the coming captivity,&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 20, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and the prophet [[Ezekiel]] had to lie on his side for 390 days and eat measured food to illustrate the coming siege.&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel 4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophetic assignment is not always portrayed as positive in the Hebrew Bible,&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Jeremiah, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Isaiah (Commentary), John Goldingay, Hendrickson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Isaiah 6:8-13, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and prophets were often the target of persecution and opposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;’’Jeremiah (Prophet)’’, The Anchor Bible Dictionary Volume 3, Doubleday, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; God’s personal prediction to Jeremiah, &quot;Attack you they will, overcome you they can't,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 1:19, The Anchor Bible, Doubleday, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; was fulfilled many times in the [[Bible prophecy|biblical narrative]] as Jeremiah warned of destruction of those who continued to refuse repentance and accept more moderate consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’’Jeremiah, Lamentations’’, F.B. Huey, Broadman Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In return for his adherence to God’s discipline and speaking God’s words, Jeremiah was attacked by his own brothers,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 12:6, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; beaten and put into the stocks by a priest and [[false prophet]],&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 20:1-4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The NIV Study Bible, Zondervan, 1995, p. 1501&lt;/ref&gt; imprisoned by the king,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 37:18, Jeremiah 38:28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; threatened with death,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 38:4, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; thrown into a cistern by Judah’s officials,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 38:6, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and opposed by a false prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Isaiah was told by his hearers who rejected his message, &quot;Leave the way! Get off the path! Let us hear no more about the [[Book of Isaiah#&quot;Holy One of Israel&quot;|Holy One of Israel]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 30:11, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The life of Moses being threatened by [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]] is another example.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 2, Exodus 10:28, The Jewish Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to I [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 9:9,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:9|105}}, Hebrew - English Bible&lt;/ref&gt; the old name for navi is ''ro'eh'', ראה, which literally means &quot;Seer&quot;. That could document an ancient shift, from viewing prophets as seers for hire to viewing them as moral teachers. Allen (1971) comments that in the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] Era, there were essentially seer-priests, who formed a guild, [[divination|divined]], performed rituals and sacrifices, and were scribes, and then there were canonical prophets, who did none of these (and were against divination) and had instead a message to deliver.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The seer-priests were usually attached to a local shrine or temple, such as [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]], and initiated others as priests in that priesthood: it was a mystical craft-guild with apprentices and recruitment. Canonical prophets were not organised this way. The similar term ''ben-navi'' (&quot;son of the prophet&quot;) means &quot;member of a seer-priest guild&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some examples of prophets in the Tanakh include [[Abraham]], Moses, [[Miriam]], Isaiah, [[Samuel]], Ezekiel, [[Malachi]], and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]]. In Jewish tradition [[Daniel]] is not counted in the list of prophets.

A Jewish tradition suggests that there were twice as many prophets as the number which left Egypt, which would make 1,200,000 prophets.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfaq&quot;/&gt; The [[Talmud]] recognizes the existence of [[Prophets in Judaism#The 48 Prophets|48 male prophets]] who bequeathed permanent messages to mankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfaq&quot;/&gt; According to the Talmud there were also seven women who are counted as prophets whose message bears relevance for all generations: [[Sarah]], Miriam, [[Deborah|Devorah]], [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] (mother of the prophet Samuel), [[Abigail]] (a wife of [[David|King David]]), [[Huldah]] (from the time of Jeremiah), and [[Esther]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jfaq&quot;/&gt; [[Rashi]] points out that [[Rebecca]], [[Rachel]] and [[Leah]] were also prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Rashi on Genesis 29:34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophets in Judaism are not always Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfaq&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/prophet.htm Prophets and Prophecy]&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Balaam]] in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22,describes a non-Jewish prophet who honors God and refuses to curse Israel and who is generally presented favorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Numbers|24:1-24:18|105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last prophets mentioned in the Hebrew Bible are [[Daniel]], [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]], all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year Babylonian exile. The [[Talmud]] ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a) states that Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi were the last prophets, and nowadays only the &quot;[[Bat Kol]]&quot; (בת קול) exists.

=== Christianity ===
{{Main|Prophets of Christianity}}
In [[Christianity]] a prophet (or seer&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:9|9}}, [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]])&lt;/ref&gt; is one inspired by God through the [[Holy Spirit]] to deliver a message for a specific purpose. In the popular vernacular, it is often associated with predicting future events, but in Christian and biblical terms, its meaning is wider and can include those given the power to preach repentance to those who do not want to hear the message and to warn of [[Divine retribution|God's wrath]] for disobedience. God's calling as a prophet is not considered to elevate an individual for their glory, but for the glory of God and to turn people to him. Some [[Christian]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] would limit that and exclude those who receive a personal message not intended for the body of believers, but in the [[Bible]] on a number of occasions prophets were called to deliver personal messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|14:1-7|9}}, {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|3:11|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of a message is termed [[revelation]] and the delivery of the message is termed prophecy.

The term prophet is applied to those who receive public or private revelation. Public Revelation, in Catholicism, is part of the [[Deposit of faith]], the revelation of which was completed by Jesus; whereas Private Revelation does not add to the Deposit. The term &quot;deposit of faith&quot; refers to the entirety of Jesus Christ's revelation, and is passed to successive generations in two different forms, sacred scripture (the Bible) and sacred tradition.

Anyone who claims to speak God's words or teach in his name and is not a prophet the Bible terms a [[false prophet]]. One test given in the [[Old Testament]] in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:21-22|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a warning of those who prophecy events which do not come to pass and said they should be put to death. Elsewhere a false prophet may be someone who is purposely trying to deceive, is delusional, under the influence of [[Satan]] or is speaking from his own spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|13:3|9}}, &quot;Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TitianStJohn.jpg|thumb|A 1542 painting of [[John the Baptist]] by Titian]]
Some Christians who believe in [[dispensationalism]] believe prophecy ended along with the rest of the sign gifts shortly after the coming of [[Jesus]], who delivered the &quot;fullness of the law.&quot; Within this group, many Protestants believe that prophecy ended with the last of the Hebrew prophets of the Torah of the Hebrew Bible, leaving a gap of about 400 years between then and the life of Jesus. The majority, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], allow an exception for [[John the Baptist]] as a prophet contemporary with Jesus.

[[New Testament]] passages that explicitly discuss prophets existing after the death and resurrection of [[Christ]] include [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 11:10,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Revelation|11:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 10:40-41 and 23:34,&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of Matthew {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|10:40-41|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|23:34|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel of John|John]] 13:20 and 15:20&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of John {{Bibleverse-nb||John|13:20|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||John|15:20|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 11:25-30, 13:1 and 15:32.&lt;ref&gt;Acts of the Apostles {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|11:25-30|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:1|9}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|15:32|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians believe that the Holy Spirit leads people to faith in Jesus and gives them the ability to lead a [[Christian worship|Christian life]] and to give gifts (i.e. abilities) to Christians. These may include the [[charism]]atic gifts such as prophecy, [[Glossolalia|tongues]], healing, and knowledge. Christians holding a view known as [[cessationism]] believe these gifts were given only in New Testament times and ceased after the last [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle died]]. 

The [[Didache]] gives extensive instruction in how to distinguish between true and false prophets, as well as commands regarding tithes to prophets in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html Early Christian Writings: Didache (Chapters 11-15)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]], wrote of 2nd century believers with the gift of prophecy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103506.htm ''Against Heresies'', Book V Chapter 6.1]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Justin Martyr]] argued in his ''Dialogue with Trypho'' that prophets were not found among the Jews in his time, but that the church had prophets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html Early Christian Writings: ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (Chapter LXXXII)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] describes revelation in a vision regarding the proper operation of prophecy in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/shepherd.html Early Christian Writings: Shepherd of Hermas (Eleventh Commandment)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] mentions that [[Quadratus of Athens|Quadratus]] and Ammia of [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]] were both prominent prophets following the age of the Twelve Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book III, Chapter 37.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250105.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book V, Chapter 17.2-4]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]], writing of the church meetings of the [[Montanism|Montanists]] (to whom he belonged), described in detail the practice of prophecy in the 2nd century church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0310.htm ''A Treatise on the Soul'', Chapter 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophetic movements in particular can be traced throughout the Christian Church's history, in expressions such as [[Montanism]], [[Novatianism]], [[Donatism]], [[Franciscan]]ism, [[Anabaptist|Anabaptism]], [[Camisard]] enthusiasm, [[Puritan]]ism, [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]], [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]] and [[Pietism]].

Some Christians also believe that the title &quot;prophet&quot; encompasses others than those who receive visions from God. A more modern definition of prophet is someone who spreads God's truths. These can be revealed in a number of ways not only visions.

Some Christian sects recognize the existence of a &quot;modern-day&quot; prophet, one such denomination is [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (or &quot;[[Mormon]]s&quot;), which teaches that God still communicates with mankind through prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is considered a Christian denomination is subject to dispute, see [[Mormonism and Christianity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Prophets of Islam}}
The [[Qur'an]] identifies a number of men as &quot;[[Prophets of Islam]]&quot; ({{lang-ar|nabiyy نبي}}; pl. anbiyaa' أنبياء). [[Muslim]]s believe such individuals were assigned a special mission by [[God in Islam|God]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''[[Allah]]'') to guide humanity. Besides [[Muhammad]], this includes prophets such as [[Islamic view of Abraham|Ibrahim]] (Abraham), [[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]] (Moses) and [[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]] (Jesus).

In Islam, all Prophetic Messengers are Prophets (such as [Adam], [Noah], [Abraham], [Moses], [Jesus], and [Muhammad]) not all Prophets are Prophetic Messengers.  The primary distinction being that a Prophet is required to demonstrate God's law through his actions character, and behavior without necessarily calling people to follow him, a Prophetic Messenger is required to pronounce God's law (i.e. revelation) and call his people to submit and follow him.  The Prophet Muhammad is distinguished from the rest of the Prophetic Messengers and Prophets in that he was commissioned by God to be the Prophetic Messenger to all of mankind.  Many of these prophets are also found in the texts of Judaism (The Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings; collectively known as the Old Testament to Christians) and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Bible]]; containing both the Old and New Testaments (see [[Biblical narratives and the Qur'an]])&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Islam]] shares the Jewish tradition that the first prophet is [[Islamic view of Adam|Adem]] ([[Adam]]), it differs in that the [[last prophet]] is Muhammad, who in Islam is called [[Seal of the prophets]] or ''[[Khatim an-Nabuwwah]]''. [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] (Jesus) is the result of a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] in Islam as in Christianity, and is regarded as a prophet like the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|45|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, four prophets are believed to have been sent [[Islamic holy books|holy books]]: the [[Tawrat]] (Torah) to Moses, the [[Zabur]] ([[Psalms]]) to David, the [[Injil]] ([[Gospel]]) to Jesus, and the Qur'an to Muhammad; those prophets are considered &quot;messengers&quot; or ''[[Messengers of Islam|rasul]]'' (''Ule al A'zm men al Rusul'' أولي العزم من الرسل). Other main prophets are considered messengers or ''Nabi'', even if they didn't receive a Book from God. Examples include the messenger-prophet [[Aaron]] (''Haroon''), the messenger-prophet [[Ishmael]] (''Isma'eel'') and the messenger-prophet [[Islamic view of Joseph|Yusuf]] ([[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]).

Although it offers many incidents from the lives of many prophets, the Qur'an focuses with special narrative and rhetorical emphasis on the careers of the first four of these five Major Prophets. Of all the figures before Muhammad, Moses is referred to most frequently in the Qur'an. As for the fifth, the Qur'an is frequently addressed directly to Muhammad, and it often discusses situations encountered by him. Direct use of his name in the text, however, is rare. Rarer still is the mention of Muhammad's contemporaries.

Besides the four Holy Books sent by God to the four messengers, Muslims believe that God also had granted Scrolls (''Suhuf'') to Abraham (''[[Scrolls of Abraham (Islam)|Suhuf-e-Ibrahim]]'') and Moses ([[Books of Moses (Islam)|Books of Moses]]).

=== Bahá'í ===
{{Main|Manifestation of God}}
[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moses]] with the tablets of the Ten Commandments, painting by [[Rembrandt]] (1659)]]
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] refers to what are commonly called prophets as &quot;Manifestations of God&quot; who are directly linked with the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]]. Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as &quot;Manifestations of God&quot; or &quot;divine educators&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eor&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed. Lindsay Jones | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion | title = Bahā'īs | edition = 2nd | year = 2005 | publisher = Macmillan Reference USA | volume = 2 | location = Detroit | isbn = 0-02-865733-0 | pages = 737–740}}&lt;/ref&gt; In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world. Thus they are seen as an intermediary between God and humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifestations of God are not seen as incarnations of God, but they are also not seen as ordinary mortals. Instead, the Bahá'í concept of the Manifestation of God emphasizes simultaneously the humanity of that intermediary and the divinity in the way they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; thus they have both human and divine stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot; /&gt;

In addition to the Manifestations of God, there are also Minor Prophets. While the Manifestations of God, or Major Prophets, are compared to the Sun, which produces its own heat and light, Minor Prophets are compared to the Moon which receives its light from the sun. Moses, for example, is taught as having been a Manifestation of God and his brother Aaron a minor prophet. Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 4:14-17).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:14-17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish prophets are considered Minor Prophets, as they are considered to have come in the shadow of the dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion.

== Modern prophetic claims ==
In modern times the term &quot;prophet&quot; can be somewhat controversial. Many Christians with [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic beliefs]] believe in the continuation of the gift of prophecy and the continuation of the role of prophet as taught in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ephesians|4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The content of prophecies can vary widely. Prophecies are often spoken as quotes from God. They may contain quotes from scripture, statements about the past or current situation, or predictions of the future. Prophecies can also 'make manifest the secrets' of the hearts of other people, telling about the details of their lives. Sometimes, more than one person in a congregation will receive the same message in prophecy, with one giving it before another.

Other movements claim to have prophets. In France, Michel Potay says he received a revelation, called ''The Revelation of Arès'', dictated by Jesus in 1974, then by God in 1977. He is considered a prophet by his followers, the [[Pilgrims of Arès]].

=== Latter Day Saint movement ===
{{Main|Prophet, seer, and revelator|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] who established the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] in 1830, is considered a prophet by members of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], of which [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] is the largest denomination. Additionally, many churches within the movement believe in a succession of living prophets (accepted by Latter Day Saints as &quot;[[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]]&quot;) since the time of Joseph Smith. Churches in this movement also sustain their [[Quorum of the Twelve]] as prophets, seers, and revelators. The current prophet of the LDS Church is [[Thomas S. Monson]].

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not consider any single person in their modern-day organization to be a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibletopics.com/biblestudy/images/88f.gif |title=The Watchtower, Number 7, Vol. XCIII |accessdate=2009-09-12 |date=1972-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their literature has referred to their organization collectively as God's &quot;prophet&quot; on earth; this is understood, however, in the sense of declaring their interpretation of God's judgments from the Bible along with God's guidance of His Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;''Keep Yourselves in God's Love'', 2008 Watch Tower, page 209, &quot;Today, prophesying would apply to any Bible-based teaching that a Christian minister does.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Would That All Were Prophets!”, ''Awake!'', Watch Tower, June 8, 1986, page 9, &quot;True Christians are prophets in that they teach others God’s Word&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Their publishing company, [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower]], and official position magazine, ''[[The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower]]'', have asserted: &quot;Ever since ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' began to be published in July 1879 it has looked ahead into the future... No, ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' is no inspired prophet, but it follows and explains a Book of prophecy the predictions in which have proved to be unerring and unfailing till now. ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower'' is therefore under safe guidance. It may be read with confidence, for its statements may be checked against that prophetic Book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower 1 January 1969''&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that they are God's one and only true channel to mankind on earth, and used by God for this purpose.

They have made many [[Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses|eschatological forecasts]], some of which have led people (including followers) to incorrect assumptions. One example is ''The&amp;nbsp;Watchtower's'' assertions that the end of the &quot;[[Gentile#LDS Church usage|Gentile]] times&quot; or &quot;times of the nations&quot; would occur in 1914; even prominent Watch Tower representatives such as [[Alexander Hugh Macmillan#Macmillan's proclamation of 1914|A. H. Macmillan]] incorrectly concluded and overstated their expectations. As a result ''The Watchtower'' has acknowledged that Jehovah's Witnesses &quot;have made mistakes in their understanding of what would occur at the end of certain time periods.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'' p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently with these exceptions, Jehovah's Witnesses in their literature and assemblies have taught their leadership was personally chosen by Jesus Christ in 1919 (a prophetic year in JW eschatology) and that they are &quot;God's sole channel on earth&quot;, and &quot;Jehovah's spirit directed organization&quot;.

=== Seventh-day Adventist ===
{{Main|Inspiration of Ellen G. White}}
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], established in 1863, believes [[Ellen G. White]], one of the church's founders, was given the [[Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)|spiritual gift of prophecy]], and are generally skeptical toward [[Charismatic Adventism|other claims]].

== Tenrikyo ==
[[Tenrikyo]]'s prophet, [[Nakayama Miki]], is believed by Tenrikyoans to have been a messenger of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenrikyo.or.jp/eng/?page_id=104 oyasama]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ifa and other African traditional religions ==
''Main article:'' [[Traditional African religion]], [[Ifa]], [[Religion in Africa]]

[[Divination]] remains an important aspect of the lives of the people of contemporary [[Africa]], especially amongst the usually rural, socially traditionalistic segments of its population. In arguably its most influential manifestation, the system of prophecy practiced by the [[babalawo]]s and [[iyanifa]]s of the historically [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] regions of [[West Africa]] have bequeathed to the world a corpus of [[fortune-telling]] poetic methodologies so intricate that it has been added by [[UNESCO]] to its official ''[[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage of the World list]]''.
