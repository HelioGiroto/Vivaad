{{Eschatology}}
{{Judaism}}

'''Jewish eschatology''' is concerned with events that will happen in the [[End time|end of days]], according to the [[Hebrew Bible]] and Jewish thought. This includes the ingathering of the exiled [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], the coming of [[Jewish messianism|Jewish Messiah]], [[afterlife]], and the [[Resurrection of the dead#Judaism|revival of the dead Tsadikim]]. 

[[Eschatology]], generally is the area of [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] concerned with the final events in the history of the world, the ultimate destiny of humanity, and related concepts.

In Judaism, end times are usually called the &quot;end of days&quot; (aḥarit ha-yamim, אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the [[Tanakh]]. The idea of a [[messianic age]] has a prominent place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of days.

==Overview and textual sources==
In [[Judaism]], the main textual source for the belief in the end of days and accompanying events is the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. In the [[Five Books of Moses]], references are made in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 28-31, that the Jews will not be able to keep the [[Laws of Moses]] in the [[Land of Israel]] and will be subsequently exiled and ultimately redeemed. The books of the [[Hebrew Prophets]] elaborated and prophesied about the end of days.

In [[rabbinic literature]], the Rabbis elaborated and explained the prophecies that were found in the Hebrew Bible along with the [[oral law]] and Rabbinic traditions about its meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Eschatology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Eschatology|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5849-eschatology|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The main tenets of Jewish eschatology are the following, in no particular order, elaborated in the Books of [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]] and [[Ezekiel]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Eschatology&quot;/&gt;:

*God redeems Israel (i.e. the Jewish people) from the captivity that began during the [[Babylonian Exile]], in a new [[The Exodus|Exodus]]
*God returns all the Jews to the [[Land of Israel]] and resettles them in the Land
*God restores the [[Davidic line|House of David]] and the [[The Third Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]]
*God creates a regent from the House of David (i.e. the [[Jewish Messiah]]) to lead the Jewish people and the world and usher in an [[Messianic Age|age of justice and peace]]
*All nations recognize that the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel is the only true God]]
*God [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrects the dead]]
*God creates a [[World to Come#Judaism|new heaven and a new earth]]

It is also believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be reached when all mankind returns to the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Days|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/a/48925077.html|work=End of Days|publisher=Aish|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Messiah==
{{main|Jewish messianism}}
The Hebrew word ''mashiach'' (or ''moshiach'') refers to the [[Judaism|Jewish]] idea of the [[Messiah]]. Like the English word ''messiah'', mashiach means ''anointed''.&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/108400/jewish/The-End-of-Days.htm What is the Jewish Belief About Moshiach?]; web-look-up: 03-10-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Messiah refers to a human leader, physically descended from the [[Davidic line]], who will rule and unite the people [[Israelite|of Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;Megillah 17b-18a, Taanit 8b&lt;/ref&gt; and will usher in the [[Messianic Age]]&lt;ref&gt;Sotah 9a&lt;/ref&gt; of global and universal peace. While the name of Jewish Messiah is considered to be one of the things that precede creation,&lt;ref name=chabad-persmashiach&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/moshiach/article_cdo/aid/101679/jewish/The-Personality-of-Mashiach.htm The Personality of Mashiach]; web-look-up: 18-11-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; he is not considered to be divine nor is he considered to be Jesus, in sharp contrast to Christian belief.

In biblical times the title ''mashiach'' was awarded for somebody in a high position of nobility and greatness. For example, {{unicode|Cohen ha-Mašíaḥ}} means High Priest. In the Talmudic era the title ''mashiach'' or מלך המשיח, {{unicode|Méleḫ ha-Mašíaḥ}} (in the [[Tiberian vocalization]] pronounced {{unicode|Méleḵ haMMāšîªḥ}}), literally meaning &quot;the anointed King&quot;, is referred to the human Jewish leader and king who will redeem Israel in the end of days and who will usher in a messianic era of peace and prosperity for both the living and the deceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;chabad&quot;/&gt;

===In the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)===
Most of the textual requirements concerning the Messiah, what he will do, and what will be done during his reign are located within the [[Book of Isaiah]], although requirements are mentioned in other prophets as well.
*The [[Sanhedrin]] will be re-established (Isaiah 1:26)
*Once he is King, leaders of other nations will look to him for guidance (Isaiah 2:4)
*The whole world will worship the [[God in Judaism|One God of Israel]] (Isaiah 2:17)
*He will be descended from [[David|King David]] (Isaiah 11:1) via [[Solomon|King Solomon]] (1 Chron. 22:8–10)
*The moshiach will be a man of this world, an observant Jew with &quot;fear of God&quot; (Isaiah 11:2)
*Evil and tyranny will not be able to stand before his leadership (Isaiah 11:4)
*Knowledge of God will fill the world (Isaiah 11:9)
*He will include and attract people from all cultures and nations (Isaiah 11:10)
*All [[Israelites]] will be returned to [[Land of Israel|their homeland]] (Isaiah 11:12, Zechariah 10:6)
*Death will be swallowed up forever (Isaiah 25:8)
*There will be no more hunger or illness, and death will cease (Isaiah 25:8)
*[[Resurrection of the dead|All of the dead will rise again]] (Isaiah 26:19)
*The house of David shall be as God (Zechariah 12:8)
*God will seek to destroy all the nations that go against Jerusalem (Zechariah 12:9, Isaiah 60:12)
*Israel and Judah will be made into one nation again (Zechariah 11:12-14, Ezekiel 37:16-22)
*The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness (Isaiah 51:11)
*He will be a messenger of peace (Isaiah 53:7)
*Nations will recognize the wrongs they did Israel (Isaiah 52:13–53:5)
*The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance ([[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 8:23)
*The ruined cities of Israel will be restored ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 16:55)
*[[World peace|Weapons of war will be destroyed]] (Ezekiel 39:9)
*[[The Third Temple|The Temple will be rebuilt]] (Ezekiel 40) resuming many of the suspended ''mitzvot''
*He will then perfect the entire world to serve God together ([[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 3:9)
*He will take the barren land and make it abundant and fruitful (Isaiah 51:3, Amos 9:13–15, Ezekiel 36:29–30, Isaiah 11:6–9)

===In the Talmud===
The [[Babylonian Talmud]], tractate [[Sanhedrin]], contains a long discussion of the events leading to the coming of the Messiah, for example:

{{quote |R. Johanan said: When you see a generation ever dwindling, hope for him [the Messiah], as it is written, and the afflicted people thou wilt save. R. Johanan said: When thou seest a generation overwhelmed by many troubles as by a river, await him, as it is written, when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him; which is followed by, and the Redeemer shall come to Zion.

R. Johanan also said: The son of David will come only in a generation that is either altogether righteous or altogether wicked. 'in a generation that is altogether righteous,' — as it is written, Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever. 'Or altogether wicked,' — as it is written, And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor;31 and it is [elsewhere] written, For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it.&lt;ref name=&quot;B. Talmud Sanhedrin 98a&quot;&gt;B. Talmud Sanhedrin 98a&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout Jewish history Jews have compared these passages (and others) to contemporary events in search of signs of the Messiah's imminent arrival, continuing into present times. For example, many Orthodox Jewish leaders{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} have suggested that the devastation among Jews wrought by the [[Holocaust]] may represent a sign of hope for the Messiah's present imminent arrival.

The Talmud tells many stories about the Messiah, some of which represent famous Talmudic rabbis as receiving personal visitations from [[Elijah|Elijah the Prophet]] and the Messiah. For example:

{{quote |R. Joshua b. Levi met [[Elijah]] standing by the entrance of R. Simeon b. Yohai's tomb. He asked him: 'Have I a portion in the world to come?' He replied, 'if this Master desires it.' R. Joshua b. Levi said, 'I saw two, but heard the voice of a third.' He then asked him, 'When will the Messiah come?' — 'Go and ask him himself,' was his reply. 'Where is he sitting?' — 'At the entrance.' And by what sign may I recognise him?' — 'He is sitting among the poor lepers: all of them untie [them] all at once, and rebandage them together, whereas he unties and rebandages each separately, [before treating the next], thinking, should I be wanted, [it being time for my appearance as the Messiah] I must not be delayed [through having to bandage a number of sores].' So he went to him and greeted him, saying, 'peace upon thee, Master and Teacher.' 'peace upon thee, O son of Levi,' he replied. 'When wilt thou come Master?' asked he, 'To-day', was his answer. On his returning to Elijah, the latter enquired, 'What did he say to thee?' — 'peace Upon thee, O son of Levi,' he answered. Thereupon he [Elijah] observed, 'He thereby assured thee and thy father of [a portion in] the world to come.' 'He spoke falsely to me,' he rejoined, 'stating that he would come to-day, but has not.' He [Elijah] answered him, 'This is what he said to thee, To-day, if ye will hear his voice ([[Psalms 95]]).'&lt;ref name=&quot;B. Talmud Sanhedrin 98a&quot;/&gt;}}

===In Rabbinic commentaries===
The Medieval rabbinic figure [[Maimonides]] (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon), also known as the [[Rambam]], wrote a commentary to tractate [[Sanhedrin]] stressing a relatively naturalistic interpretation of the Messiah and de-emphasizing miraculous elements. His commentary became widely (although not universally) accepted in the non- or less-mystical branches of [[Orthodox Judaism]]:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

{{quote |The Messianic age is when the Jews will regain their independence and all return to the [[land of Israel]]. The Messiah will be a very great king, he will achieve great fame, and his reputation among the gentile nations will be even greater than that of [[Solomon|King Solomon]]. His great righteousness and the wonders that he will bring about will cause all peoples to make peace with him and all lands to serve him…. Nothing will change in the Messianic age, however, except that Jews will regain their independence. Rich and poor, strong and weak, will still exist. However it will be very easy for people to make a living, and with very little effort they will be able to accomplish very much…. it will be a time when the number of wise men will increase…. war shall not exist, and nation shall no longer lift up sword against nation…. The Messianic age will be highlighted by a community of the righteous and dominated by goodness and wisdom. It will be ruled by the Messiah, a righteous and honest king, outstanding in wisdom, and close to God. Do not think that the ways of the world or the laws of nature will change, this is not true. The world will continue as it is. The prophet [[Isaiah]] predicted &quot;The wolf shall live with the sheep; the leopard shall lie down with the kid.&quot; This, however, is merely allegory, meaning that the Jews will live safely, even with the formerly wicked nations. All nations will return to the true religion and will no longer steal or oppress. Note that all prophecies regarding the Messiah are allegorical. Only in the Messianic age will we know the meaning of each allegory and what it comes to teach us. Our [[Rabbinical literature|sages]] and [[Nevi'im|prophets]] did not long for the Messianic age in order that they might rule the world and dominate the gentiles, the only thing they wanted was to be free for Jews to involve themselves with the Torah and its wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Commentary on Mishnah, Sanhedrin 10:1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Advent of the messianic era====
According to the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Rosh Hashana 31a and Sanhedrin 97a&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Midrash]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabbi Eliezer 1981, p. 141&quot;&gt;Pirke De Rabbi Eliezer, Gerald Friedlander, Sepher-Hermon Press, New York, 1981, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kabbalistic work, the [[Zohar]],&lt;ref&gt;Zohar (1:117a) and Zohar Vayera 119a&lt;/ref&gt; the 'deadline' by which the Messiah must appear is 6000 years from creation. A majority of Orthodox and Hasidic Jews believe that the [[Hebrew calendar]] dates back to the time of creation; the year 2009-2010 (the [[Rosh Hashanah|Hebrew New Year]] begins during September or October) of the [[Gregorian calendar]] corresponds to the Hebrew year 5770.

There is a [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] tradition&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, Vayera 119a, Ramban on Genesis 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; that maintains that the seven days of creation in Genesis 1 correspond to seven millennia of the existence of natural creation. The tradition teaches that the seventh day of the week, ''[[Shabbat]]'' or the day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium (Hebrew years 6000 - 7000), the age of universal 'rest' - the Messianic Era.

The [[Talmud]] comments:

:R. Katina said, “Six thousand years the world will exist and one [thousand, the seventh], it shall be desolate (haruv), as it is written, ‘And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day’ (Isa. 2:11)... R. Katina also taught, “Just as the seventh year is the [[Shmita]] year, so too does the world have one thousand years out of seven that are fallow (mushmat), as it is written, ‘And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day’ (Isa. 2:11); and further it is written, ‘A psalm and song for the Shabbat day’ (Ps. 92:1) – meaning the day that is altogether Shabbat – and also it is said, ‘For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past’ (Ps.90:4) (Sanhedrin 97a).”

The [[Midrash]] comments:

&quot;Six eons for going in and coming out, for war and peace. The seventh eon is entirely [[Shabbat]] and rest for life everlasting&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabbi Eliezer 1981, p. 141&quot;/&gt; &quot;.

The [[Zohar]] explains:

:&quot;The redemption of [[Israel]] will come about through the mystic force of the letter “Vav” [which has the numerical value of six], namely, in the sixth millennium…. Happy are those who will be left alive at the end of the sixth millennium to enter the [[Shabbat]], which is the seventh millennium; for that is a day set apart for the Holy One on which to effect the union of new souls with old souls in the world (Zohar, Vayera 119a).&quot;

Elaborating on this theme are numerous early and late Jewish scholars, including the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramban on Genesis (2:3)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Abrabanel]],&lt;ref&gt;Abarbanel on Genesis 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramban quoting Ibn Ezra at Leviticus (25:2)&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbeinu [[Bachya]],&lt;ref&gt;Bachya on Genesis 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vilna Gaon]],&lt;ref&gt;Safra D'Tzniusa, Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]],&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaSichos 5750:254&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ramchal]],&lt;ref&gt;Derech Hashem 4:7:2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aryeh Kaplan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=7vxjgVY33LkC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=aryeh+kaplan+1840&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2_mGLTFniN&amp;sig=6dCWdOjPDl-YAyELmmdj-FBMHg0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GQo0TI6UOZSqcYaq0bsD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Page 318, The Real Messiah, online access]&lt;/ref&gt; and Rebbetzin [[Esther Jungreis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/128104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox Judaism===
The belief in a personal Messiah of the [[Davidic line]] is a universal tenet of faith among Orthodox Jews and one of [[Maimonides]]' thirteen [[Jewish principles of faith#The messianic age|principles of faith]].

Some authorities in Orthodox Judaism believe that this era will lead to supernatural events culminating in a bodily resurrection of the dead. [[Maimonides]], on the other hand, holds that the events of the messianic era are not specifically connected with the resurrection. (See the [[Maimonides]] article.)

===Conservative Judaism===
[[Conservative Judaism]] varies in its teachings. While it retains traditional references to a personal redeemer and prayers for the restoration of the [[Davidic line]] in the liturgy, Conservative Jews are more inclined to accept the idea of a messianic era:

{{quote |We do not know when the Messiah will come, nor whether he will be a charismatic human figure or is a symbol of the redemption of mankind from the evils of the world. Through the doctrine of a Messianic figure, Judaism teaches us that every individual human being must live as if he or she, individually, has the responsibility to bring about the messianic age. Beyond that, we echo the words of Maimonides based on the prophet [[Habakkuk]] (2:3) that though he may tarry, yet do we wait for him each day… (''Emet ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism'')&lt;ref&gt;Emet ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism, The Rabbinical Assembly, NY, pp. 28–32&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reform Judaism===
[[Reform Judaism]] generally concurs with the more liberal Conservative perspective of a future messianic era rather than a personal Messiah.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Reflecting its philosophical position, Reform Judaism, unlike Conservative Judaism, has altered the traditional prayers to refer to &quot;redemption&quot; rather than a &quot;redeemer&quot; and removed petitions for restoration of the House of David.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Reconstructionist Judaism===
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] rejects the ideas of both a personal Messiah and a divinely instituted messianic age. It does teach that human beings can help bring about a better future world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Like Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism has also altered traditional prayers so that they no longer refer to a personal Messiah.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==The days of the Messiah==
{{main|Messianic Age}}
According to Jewish tradition, the messianic era will be one of global harmony, a future era of universal [[peace]] and brotherhood on earth, and one conducive to the furtherment of the knowledge of the Creator. In this context, the earliest meaning of the word &quot;messianic&quot; is derived from notion of ''Yemot HaMashiach'' meaning &quot;the days of the Messiah&quot;, meaning &quot;related to the Jewish Messiah&quot;. The Jewish Messiah ushering in an era of universal peace is given expression in two scriptural passages from the [[Book of Isaiah]]:

{{quote|They shall beat their [[swords to plowshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare. (Isaiah 2:4)}}
{{quote|The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on my entire holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. (Isaiah 11:6-9)}}

According to the [[Book of Jeremiah]], [[Moab]] and [[Biblical Elam]] which were exiled during the [[Babylonian Exile]], will be brought back from their captivity in the end of days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of Jeremiah|pages=Chapters 48 and 49.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Book of Jeremiah]], it is referenced by [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], who, speaking in the days of [[Josiah]] (Jer. 3:16), prophesied a future time, possibly the end of days, when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made again: 

{{quote|&quot;And it shall be that when you multiply and become fruitful in the land, in those days - the word of the LORD - they will no longer say, 'The Ark of the Covenant of the LORD' and it will not come to mind; they will not mention it, and will not recall it, and it will not be used any more.&quot; - Jeremiah 3:16}}

[[Rashi]] comments on this verse that &quot;The entire people will be so imbued with the spirit of sanctity that God's Presence will rest upon them collectively, as if the congregation itself was the Ark of the Covenant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jeremiah 3:16, Tanach|publisher=ArtScroll|location=Brooklyn, New York|pages=1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gog and Magog==
{{main|Gog and Magog}}
According to some commentators, the war of Gog and Magog envisioned in Ezekiel 38 is expected to occur in the end of days. This is described to be a climatic war that is said to occur at the end of the Jewish exile. Persia and other powers from the north are said to attack Israel, where the God of Israel reveals himself and ends the war. [[Radak]] comments on [[Zechariah]] 14, that in the end of days [[Jerusalem]] will be the battle ground of Gog and Magog.

According to other commentators the long exile has already made up for it and it will no longer occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Gog and Magog?|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/227,2272972/What-is-Gog-and-Magog.html|work=What is Gog and Magog?|publisher=Ask Moses|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;The world to come&quot;==
{{main|World to Come}}
Although Judaism concentrates on the importance of the Earthly world (''[[Olam Ha'zeh]]'' — &quot;this world&quot;), all of classical Judaism posits an afterlife. The [[hereafter]] is known as '''olam ha-ba''&lt;ref&gt;Craig L. Blomberg, Sung Wook Chung  ''A case for historic premillennialism'' 2009 &quot;In certain sources, Olam Ha-Ba is uniquely associated with teachings about collective redemption and resurrection, but in other places Olam Ha-Ba is conceived of as an afterlife realm for the individual.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Kiba Ginsburg ''The Sabbath in the classical Kabbalah'' 1989 p145 &quot;More frequently the Rabbis used 'olam ha-ba' with reference to the hereafter:&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (the &quot;world to come&quot;, עולם הבא in [[Hebrew]]), and related to concepts of ''Gan Eden'' (the Heavenly &quot;[[Garden of Eden#In Jewish eschatology|Garden of Eden]]&quot;, or paradise) and ''[[Gehenna|Gehinom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;They are told to live their life on earth to the full as their body will stay there but their soul live on.[http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/jewish-afterlife-beliefs.htm Jewish Afterlife Beliefs at SimpleToRemember.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html Afterlife at JewishVirtualLibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba: The Afterlife at JewFAQ.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to religious Judaism, any non-Jew who lives according to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] is regarded as a [[Ger toshav|righteous gentile]], and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebrew Bible===
The phrase '''olam ha-ba'', (עולם הבא) &quot;world to come&quot;, does not occur in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

===Late Second Temple period===
In the late [[Second Temple period]], beliefs about the ultimate fate of the individual were diverse. Pharisees believed in [[resurrection]], while Essenes believed in the [[immortality of the soul]], and [[Sadducees]], apparently, believed in neither.&lt;ref&gt;ed.

Davies University of Sheffield. &quot;In the late Second Temple Period, beliefs about the ultimate fate of the individual were diverse. It is well-known that Josephus, in his description of the four Jewish &quot;sects&quot; (and supported by Matt. ... in the resurrection while the Pharisees did, and the Essenes subscribed to the doctrine of the immortality of the soul (War 2.154: &quot;...although bodies are corruptible and their matter unstable, souls are immortal and live forever...&quot;)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], Jewish [[Pseudepigrapha]] and [[Jewish magical papyri]] reflect this diversity.

===Talmudic views===
The [[Mishnah]] (c. 200) lists belief in the [[resurrection of the dead]] as one of three essential beliefs necessary for a Jew to participate in it:
{{quote|
All Israel have a portion in the world to come, for it is written: 'Thy people are all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.' But the following have no portion therein: one who maintains that resurrection is not a biblical doctrine, the Torah was not divinely revealed, and an [[Epikoros (Judaism)|Apikoros]] (&quot;heretic&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;sanhedrin&quot;&gt;Mishnah [[Sanhedrin]] 10:1, Talmud Sanhedrin 90a.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Gemara]] (Berachos 18b) relates several stories of people who visited cemeteries and either overheard conversations among dead people or actually conversed with the dead themselves, and received information that was later verified as factually correct.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The ''Shem HaGedolim'' by [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai]], (entry on Rebbe Eliezer bar Nosson&lt;!--Eliezer ben Nathan ?--&gt;), relates and discusses several incidents of dead Sages returning to our world to visit their families and friends.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Medieval rabbinical views===
While all classic rabbinic sources discuss the afterlife, the classic [[Rishonim|Medieval scholars]] dispute the nature of existence in the &quot;End of Days&quot; after the messianic period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} While [[Maimonides]] describes an entirely spiritual existence for souls, which he calls &quot;disembodied intellects,&quot; [[Nahmanides]] discusses an intensely spiritual existence on Earth, where spirituality and physicality are merged.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Both agree that life after death is as Maimonides describes the &quot;End of Days.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This existence entails an extremely heightened understanding of and connection to the Divine Presence. This view is shared by all classic rabbinic scholars.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

There is much rabbinic material on what happens to the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] of the deceased after death, what it experiences, and where it goes. At various points in the afterlife journey, the soul may encounter: ''Hibbut ha-kever'', the pains of the grave; ''Dumah'', the [[angel]] of silence; [[Satan]] as the angel of death; the ''Kaf ha-Kela'', the catapult of the soul; ''Gehinom'' ([[purgatory]]); and ''Gan Eden'' ([[heaven]] or [[paradise]]). All classic rabbinic scholars agree that these concepts are beyond typical human understanding. Therefore, these ideas are expressed throughout rabbinic literature through many varied parables and analogies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

''[[Gehenna|Gehinom]]'' is fairly well defined in rabbinic literature. It is sometimes translated as &quot;hell&quot;, but is much closer to the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] view of ''purgatory'' than to the [[Hell in Christian beliefs|Christian view of hell]], which differs from the classical Jewish view. Rabbinic thought maintains that souls are not tortured in gehinom forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be eleven months, with the exception of heretics, and unobservant Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanhedrin&quot;/&gt; This is the reason that even when in mourning for near relatives, Jews will not recite [[Kaddish#Mourner's kaddish|mourner's kaddish]] for longer than an eleven month period. ''Gehinom'' is considered a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to ''Gan Eden'' (&quot;Garden of Eden&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/ soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Jewish Thought (6/12)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Orthodox Judaism===
[[Orthodox Judaism]] maintains the tenet of the bodily resurrection of the dead, including traditional references to it in the liturgy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  In explaining the Orthodox view of the afterlife, [[Irving Greenberg]], a [[Modern Orthodox]] rabbi, discussed both the &quot;world to come&quot; and the belief in punishment and reward in a ''[[Moment Magazine]]'' &quot;Ask the Rabbis&quot; forum:

{{quote|&quot;Belief in the afterlife - a world to come in which the righteous get their true reward and the wicked get their deserved comeuppance - is a central teaching of traditional Judaism.  This belief stems from the conviction that a loving God would not allow injustice to win.

When the facts of life did not fit the Bible's emphasis on reward and punishment in the here and now, this faith in the afterlife was emphasized.  In the [[Middle Ages]], when Jews suffered so much while enemies ruled the world, the stress on the world to come grew stronger.  Some religious teachers taught that this life is &quot;unimportant,&quot; and that one should live only to be worthy of eternal bliss.  This view spilled over into asceticism and less respect for the body and material activity.

Early modernizers reversed direction.  They validated Judaism and dismissed Christianity by insisting that Judaism is interested only in doing well in earthly life.  Christianity was criticized as otherworldly, repressive and dreaming only of getting to heaven.  It was described as cruel for condemning people to eternal damnation.  This modern one-sided emphasis on mortal life robbed Jews of the profound consolation of eternal life and justice for all who suffered unjustly and innocently.  

What is needed is the classical Jewish ability to hold both sides of the tension.  Such Judaism would inspire people to find God in the secular, to unite body and soul, to work for ''tkkun olam'' (repairing the world) in the here and now.  At the same time, it would uphold the reality of the spirit and the immortality of the soul.  This faith offers the consolation of a final reunion - with those we have loved and lost with the ''El Maleh Rachamim'', the Infinite God of Compassion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rabbi [[Yitz Greenberg]]|journal=[[Moment Magazine]]|url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2011/08/rabbis.html|title=Ask the Rabbis: Do Jews Believe in an Afterlife? – Orthodox|work=Moment Magazine|date=July/August 2011|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In Conservative Judaism===
[[Conservative Judaism]] has generally retained the tenet of the bodily resurrection of the dead, including traditional references to it in the liturgy. However, many Conservative Jews interpret the tenet metaphorically rather than literally.&lt;ref&gt;Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative Judaism both affirms belief in the world beyond (as referenced in the ''[[Amidah]]'' and Maimonides' Thirteen Precepts of Faith) while recognizing that human understanding is limited and we cannot know exactly what the world beyond consists of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rabbi Amy Wallk Katz|journal=[[Moment Magazine]]|url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2011/08/rabbis.html|title=Ask the Rabbis: Do Jews Believe in an Afterlife? – Conservative|work=Moment Magazine|date=July/August 2011|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===
Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism have altered traditional references to the resurrection of the dead (&quot;who gives life to the dead&quot;) to refer to &quot;who gives life to all&quot;.  Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism affirm belief in the afterlife, though they downplay the theological implications in favor of emphasizing the importance of the &quot;here and now,&quot; as opposed to reward and punishment. Rabbi Laura Novak Winer, a member of the [[Union for Reform Judaism]], explains the Reform attitude towards the afterlife by quoting [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;True, this world is only a 'vestibule to the world to come,' where we must prepare ourselves before we enter the 'banquet hall.'  Yet in the eyes of God, the endeavor and the participation are greater than the achievement and perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rabbi Laura Novak Winer|journal=[[Moment Magazine]]|url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2011/08/rabbis.html|title=Ask the Rabbis: Do Jews Believe in an Afterlife? – Reform|work=Moment Magazine|date=July/August 2011|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &quot;this world&quot; orientation is not limited to the Reform and Reconstructionist movements.  Orthodox Rabbi [[Shmuley Boteach]], in expounding the [[Chabad]] view of the afterlife, also affirms the necessity of focusing on one's legacy, along with Chabad's traditional belief in bodily resurrection in the [[Messianic era]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...none would dispute that a man's good acts live on as an eternal legacy after him, which is why Judaism has always emphasized the importance of positive action...just as the Talmud says the patriarch Jacob never died because his children continue the tradition he taught them, the same can be said of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], whose commitment to racial harmony we continue to embrace, or of the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]], whose pioneering work in returning Jews to their heritage continues to influence every strand of world Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Rabbi Shmuley Boteach]]|journal=[[Moment Magazine]]|url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2011/08/rabbis.html|title=Ask the Rabbis: Do Jews Believe in an Afterlife? – Chabad|work=Moment Magazine|date=July/August 2011|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reincarnation==
{{further|Reincarnation|Gilgul|Kabbalah}}
The notion of reincarnation, while held as a mystical belief by some, is not an essential tenet of traditional Judaism. It is not mentioned in traditional classical sources such as the [[Tanakh]] (&quot;Hebrew Bible&quot;), the classical rabbinic works ([[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]), or [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides's 13 Principles of Faith|13 Principles of Faith]].  While one might contend the idea of reincarnation is not outlined in the Tanakh, there exist references to resurrection throughout Isaiah. However, books of [[Kabbalah]] — Jewish mysticism — teach a belief in ''[[gilgul]]'', [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s, and hence the belief is universal in [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative.

Among well-known Rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], [[Yedayah Bedershi]] (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. Among the [[Geonim]], [[Hai Gaon]] argued with Saadia Gaon in favour of ''gilgulim''.

Rabbis who accepted the idea of reincarnation include, from Medieval times: the mystical leaders [[Nahmanides]] (the Ramban) and Rabbenu [[Bahya ben Asher]]; from the 16th-century: [[Levi ibn Habib]] (the Ralbah), and from the mystical school of Safed [[Shelomoh Alkabez]], [[Isaac Luria]] (the Ari) and his exponent [[Hayyim Vital]]; and from the 18th-century: the founder of Hasidism [[Yisrael Baal Shem Tov]], later Hasidic Masters, and the [[Lithuanian Jewish Orthodox]] leader and Kabbalist the [[Vilna Gaon]].

With the 16th-century rational systemisation of [[Cordoveran Kabbalah]] by the Ramak, and the subsequent new paradigm of [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] by the Ari, [[Kabbalah]] replaced &quot;[[Jewish philosophy|Hakirah]]&quot; (Rationalistic Medieval Jewish Philosophy) as the mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. Isaac Luria taught new explanations of the process of ''gilgul'', and identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures, which were copiled by Haim Vital in his [[Shaar HaGilgulim]].

In Kabbalistic understanding of ''gilgul'', which differs from many Eastern-religious views, reincarnation is not fatalistic or automatic, nor is it essentially a punishment of sin, or reward of virtue. In Judaism, the Heavenly realms could fulfill Maimonides' [[Jewish principles of faith|Principle of faith]] in Reward and Punishment. Rather, it is concerned with the process of individual [[Tikkun olam|Tikkun]] (Rectification) of the soul. In Kabbalistic interpretation, each Jewish soul is reincarnated enough times only in order to fulfil each of the [[613 Mitzvot]]. The souls of the righteous among the Nations may be assisted through ''gilgulim'' to fulfil their [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. As such ''gilgul'' is an expression of Divine compassion, and is seen as a Heavenly agreement with the individual soul to descend again. This stress on physical performance and perfection of each Mitzvah is tied to the [[Lurianic]] doctrine of Cosmic Tikkun of Creation. In these new teachings, a cosmic catastrophe occurred at the beginning of creation called the &quot;Shattering of the Vessels&quot; of the [[Sephirot]] in the &quot;World of Tohu (Chaos)&quot;. The vessels of the Sephirot broke and fell down through the spiritual worlds until they were embedded in our physical realm as &quot;sparks of holiness&quot; (Nitzutzot). The reason in Lurianic Kabbalah that almost all Mitzvot involve physical action is that through their performance, they elevate each particular spark of holiness associated with that commandment. Once all the sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the [[Mashiach|Messianic Era]] begins. This metaphysical theology gives cosmic significance to the life of each person, as each individual has particular tasks that only they can fulfil. Therefore, ''gilgulim'' assist the individual soul in this cosmic plan. This also explains the Kabbalistic reason why the future eschatological [[Utopia]] will be in this world, as only in the lowest, physical realm is the purpose of creation fulfilled.

The idea of ''gilgul'' became popular in folk belief, and is found in much [[Yiddish literature]] among Ashkenazi Jews.

==The last judgment==
In [[Judaism]], the day of judgment happens every year on [[Rosh HaShana]], therefore the belief in a last day of judgment for all mankind is disputed. Some Rabbis hold that there will be such a day following the resurrection of the dead. Others hold that there is no need for that because of [[Rosh HaShana]]. While yet others hold that this accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Yet others hold that the last judgment only applies to the [[gentile]] nations and not the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will there be trial and judgment after the Resurrection?|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/215,2097883/Will-there-be-trial-and-judgment-after-the-Resurrection.html|work=Will there be trial and judgment after the Resurrection?|publisher=Askmoses.com|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
