An '''imperial cult''' is a form of [[state religion]] in which an [[emperor]], or a [[dynasty]] of emperors (or rulers of another title), are [[worship]]ped as [[messiah]]s, [[demigod]]s or [[deity|deities]]. &quot;[[Cult (religious practice)|Cult]]&quot; here is used to mean &quot;[[worship]]&quot;, not in the modern pejorative sense. The cult may be one of [[cult of personality|personality]] in the case of a newly arisen [[Euhemerus]] figure or one of national identity (e.g., Egyptian [[Pharaoh]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] or [[Empire of Japan]]) or supranational identity in the case of a [[multi-ethnic]] state (e.g., [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial Era China]], [[Roman Empire]]). A '''divine king''' is a [[monarch]] who is held in a special [[religious]] significance by his subjects, and serves as both head of state and a [[deity]] or head religious figure. This system of government combines [[theocracy]] with an [[absolute monarchy]].{{cn|date=May 2012}}

== Historical ==
{{See|List of imperial cults}}

===Ancient Egypt===
{{Main|Pharaoh}}
The [[Ancient Egypt]]ian Pharaohs were believed (throughout ancient Egyptian history) to be incarnations of the god [[Horus]], derived by being the son of the sun deity, [[Hathor]] (or later, Isis), or the sky deity, [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].

===Ancient China===
{{Main|Chinese sovereign|Religion in China}}
In [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]], an emperor was considered the [[Chinese emperor|Son of Heaven]]. The [[kinship|scion]] and representative of heaven on earth, he was the ruler of [[all under heaven]], the bearer of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], his commands considered sacred edicts. A number of legendary figures preceding the proper [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial era of China]] also hold the honorific title of emperor, such as the [[Yellow Emperor]] and the [[Jade Emperor]].

===Ancient Rome===
{{Main|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}
[[Image:Caligula bust bw blackbg.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Caligula]] referred to himself as a god]]
Even before the rise of the Caesars, there are traces of a &quot;regal spirituality&quot; in Roman society. In earliest Roman times the king was a spiritual and patrician figure and ranked higher than the ''flamines'' (priestly order), while later on in history only a shadow of the primordial condition was left with the sacrificial ''rex sacrorum'' linked closely to the [[plebeian]] orders.

King [[Numitor]] corresponds to the regal-sacred principle in early Roman history. The &quot;founder of Rome&quot; [[Romulus]] was heroized into &quot;Quirinus&quot;, the &quot;undefeated god&quot;, of whom the later Caesars identified with and considered themselves incarnations.

[[Varro]] spoke of the initiatory mystery and power of Roman regality (''adytum et initia regis''), inaccessible to the exoteric communality.

In [[Plutarch]]'s ''Phyrro'', 19.5, the Greek ambassador declared amid the Roman Senate he felt instead like being in the midst of &quot;a whole assembly of Kings&quot;.

As the [[Roman Empire]] developed as the [[dictator]]-[[prince]] [[Julius Caesar]] left his crucial mark on Roman history, the ''Imperial cult'' gradually developed more formally and constituted the worship of the [[Roman emperor]] as a god. This practice began at the start of the Empire under [[Augustus]], and became a prominent element of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].

The cult spread over the whole Empire within a few decades, more strongly in the east than in the west. Emperor [[Diocletian]] further reinforced it when he demanded the ''[[proskynesis]]'' and adopted the adjective ''sacrum'' for all things pertaining to the imperial person.

The deification of emperors was gradually abandoned after the emperor [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine I]] started supporting [[Christianity]]. However, the concept of the imperial person as &quot;sacred&quot; carried over, in a Christianized form, into the [[Byzantine Empire]].

===Ancient Japan===
[[Image:Hirohito in dress uniform.jpg|thumb|100px|Emperor [[Hirohito]] was the last divine Emperor of Japan]]
In ancient Japan, it was customary for every clan to claim descendancy from gods (''[[ujigami]]''), and the royal family or clan tended to define their ancestor as the dominant, or most important ''[[kami]]'' of the time.  Later in history, this was considered common practice by noble families, and the head members of the family, including that of the imperial family, were not seen to be divine.  It was not until the [[Meiji period]], that the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] began to be venerated under a system of [[State Shinto]], along with a growing sense of nationalism.

*[[Arahitogami]] - the concept of ''a god who is a human being'' applied to the  [[Hirohito|Shōwa]] Emperor (Emperor Hirohito as He was known in the Western World), 
up until the end of [[World War II]].
*[[Humanity Declaration|Ningen-sengen]], the declaration with which the Shōwa Emperor, on New Year's Day 1946, (formally) declined claims of divinity, keeping with traditional family values as expressed in the Shinto religion.
Even though the Shōwa Emperor declined his own divinity, it did not change the way people of Japan see their emperor as [[Tenno]], the divine emperor.

===Ancient Southeast Asia===
[[Devaraja]] is the [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] [[cult]] of [[divine|deified]] [[Royal family|royalty]] in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;God and King&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=7306 |title=God and King : The Devaraja Cult in South Asian Art &amp; Architecture |author=Sengupta, Arputha Rani (Ed.) |date=2005 |work= |publisher= |ISBN= 8189233262|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply described as Southeast Asian concept of [[divine king]]. The concept viewed the [[monarch]] (king) as the living god, the [[incarnation]] of the supreme god, often attributed to [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]], on earth. The concept is closely related to [[India|Indian]] concept of [[Chakravartin]] (universal monarch). In politics, it is viewed as the divine justification of a king's rule. The concept gain its elaborate manifestations in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], where monuments such as [[Prambanan]] and [[Angkor Wat]] were erected to celebrate the king's divine rule on earth. 

In the [[Medang]] kingdom, it was customary to erect a ''[[candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temple) to honor the soul of a deceased king. The image inside the [[garbhagriha]] (inner sanctum) of the temple often portrayed the king as a god, since the soul was thought to be united with the god referred to, in [[svarga|svargaloka]]. It is suggested that the cult was the fusion of Hinduism with native [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono,| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973, 5th reprint edition in 1988 | location =Yogyakarta| page =83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Java, the tradition of the divine king extended to the [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], Singhasari and [[Majapahit]] kingdoms in the 15th century. The tradition of public reverence to the [[King of Cambodia]] and [[King of Thailand]] is the continuation of this ancient devaraja cult. The [[Susuhunan]] of [[Surakarta]] and Sultan of [[Yogyakarta]]  are the direct descendants of the [[Mataram Sultanate]] founded in the late 17th century, and was said to be the continuation of the Ancient 8th century [[Mataram kingdom]].

===Tibet===
Tibetan Buddhism use the tulku system, an ancient way of finding the reincarnation of a previous deceased lama: they are usually young boys, sometimes of wealthy and influential families and sometimes of peasant families like the current 14th Dalai Lama, that are found and enthroned as the reincarnation of an enlightened person that has already deceased. Every tulku are still called on the title of [[Rinpoche]] and is given as much respect as his previous reincarnation. Complying with each and every wish of a child- or adult tulku is not unusual. Tulkus lead responsible lives because of their status as a bodhisattva.  While many tulkus are monks, some tulkus choose to lead lay lives with families of their own.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
