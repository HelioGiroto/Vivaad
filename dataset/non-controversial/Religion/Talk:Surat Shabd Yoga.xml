==cult claim==

I'm really curious about this statement: &quot;MasterPath is another contemporary American movement of Surat Shabda Yoga but this one is definitely a cult.&quot;  I'm new here, but this isn't exactly a neutral statement, is it? [[User:Mikeytjb7|Mikeytjb7]] 16:58, 26 September 2007 (UTC)

==intro weirdness==

:(Naad, Akash Bani, Sruti – Vedas; Nada, Udgit – Upanishads; Word, Logos – Bible; Tao – Lao Zi; Music of the Spheres – Pythagoras; Sraosha – Zoraster; Kalma, Kalam-i-Qadim – Qur'an; Naam, Akhand Kirtan, Sacha (True) Shabd – Guru Granth Sahib ) 

What in the heck is this supposed to mean? Please clarify, as it doesn't really make any sense. Thanks. --[[User:Goethean|goethean]] &lt;big&gt;&amp;#2384;&lt;/big&gt; 18:20, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

:This is a list of synonymous terms used for Shabda in various traditions. [[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:10, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

::That's a POV claim. Surely Taoists, Hindus, Zoroastrians, Christians and Muslims do not believe that &quot;Shabda&quot; is equivalent to those key terms in their theologies. The claim must be attributed to SSY adherents. --[[User:Goethean|goethean]] &lt;big&gt;&amp;#2384;&lt;/big&gt; 18:00, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

::I have removed the claim, as Shabd simply means &quot;word&quot; in Urdu, not Sanskrit.  --[[User:Goethean|goethean]] &lt;big&gt;&amp;#2384;&lt;/big&gt; 18:57, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

The following contention needs to be cited and attributed, or deleted:
:''For example, the Sant Mat (Radhasoami) version of Surat Shabda Yoga has been compared variously to spiritual traditions followed by the Pythagoreans, Hermeticists, the Sethians, Theraputae, Essenes (and other mystics within Judaism), the original Jewish Christians, the Gnostic religions, Manichaeans, some Catholic monasteries, monasteries of the Orthodox Church -- including the great mystery school atop Mount Athos in Greece, and the Sufi mystics of Islam who practice Zikar of the Spirit, Light, and Sound.
--[[User:Goethean|goethean]] &lt;big&gt;&amp;#2384;&lt;/big&gt; 18:57, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

I'll add citations when I can get to it.  The K. Singh reference is about just that (names for Shabda).  In the meantime, delete away. [[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:11, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

I didn't write the paragraph above, but I probably can take the list of terms deleted from the intro and work them into a statement about how K. Singh's referenced book interprets those terms from various traditions. [[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:01, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

:I added and attributed terms considered to be similar to &quot;Naam or Word.&quot; [[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:57, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

The neutrality issues have been addressed so I removed the tag. [[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:13, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

== NPOV ==

goethean, I replaced the NPOV tag. Please update your views on this article regarding NPOV. [[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:58, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
:There is nothing wrong with the article with the exception that it reads as &quot;fact&quot; rather than attributed. It will be good if you can provide references and re-edit the article so it reads more along the lines of &quot;According to Master XXX, Surat Shad Yoga is.... &quot; and &quot;In book so and so, the cosmology is explained this and that way&quot;. etc. --[[User:Zappaz|ZappaZ]] [[Image:Yin_yang.svg|12px]] 20:13, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

:Agree with Zappaz; The article is looking better now. --[[User:Goethean|goethean]] &lt;big&gt;&amp;#2384;&lt;/big&gt; 21:49, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

== NPOV ==

I was asked to look into things, but everything appears ok at the moment. Are there any specific problems I should be aware of, or that anyone would like to discuss? [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 16:33, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

:I'm satisfied at this time.  However, in the future and considering ''no one'' ever objected to making any revisions to improve NPOV, I would hope that as a matter of [[Wikipedia:Etiquette|wikiquette]], any further concerns will be discussed and resolved here, ''before'' another NPOV tag is placed on the article.  [[User:RDF|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;mdash; [[User:RDF|RDF]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:RDF|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:04, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

== Factual accuracy ==

I am doing some research about the different Radha Soami lineages and find an extraordinary array of terms that some editors and using as synonymns, such as [[Sant Mat]], [[Radha Soami]] and [[Surat Shabd]], when it seems that each of these are not one and the same. Can anyone help with this? I don't want to start adding factual innacuracy templates to all these articles... [[User:Jossifresco|&amp;asymp; jossi fresco &amp;asymp;]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Jossifresco|t]] &amp;bull; [[Special:Emailuser/Jossifresco|@]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:35, 27 November 2005 (UTC)


In further reading this article, I see a confuison made, probably innocently, between Sant Mat, Shabd and Surat Shabd Yoga. No choice but to add a cleanup tag to this as well.

== Ranked #1 on Google ==

I found this article by searching Google. It was #1 on the list. Congratulations.

== Self-realization ==
I've proposed moving some content about this tradition's view of [[Self-realization]] from that article onto this page. Discussion is on [[Talk:Self-realization|the self-realization article's talk page]]. - [[User:Owlmonkey|Owlmonkey]] ([[User talk:Owlmonkey|talk]]) 19:21, 17 February 2008 (UTC)

Ok, the [[Self-realization]] article was converted to a disambiguation page and content about Shabd Yoga was removed. All that content was already included here though, so that pages just links here now. - [[User:Owlmonkey|Owlmonkey]] ([[User talk:Owlmonkey|talk]]) 21:52, 26 February 2008 (UTC)</text>
