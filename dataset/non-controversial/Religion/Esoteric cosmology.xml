'''Esoteric cosmology''' is [[cosmology]] that is an intrinsic part of an [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Occultism|occult]] system of thought. Esoteric cosmology maps out the universe with [[Plane (cosmology)|planes of existence]] and consciousness according to a specific worldview usually from a doctrine. 

==Overview==

Esoteric cosmology almost always deals with at least some of the following themes: [[emanation]], [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], [[spiritual evolution]], [[epigenesis]], [[Plane (cosmology)|planes of existence]] or higher worlds (and their emanation and the connections between them), hierarchies of [[List of deities|spiritual beings]], cosmic cycles (e.g., [[cosmic year]], [[Yuga]]), [[Yoga|yogic]] or spiritual disciplines and techniques of self-transformation, and references to [[mysticism|mystical]] and [[altered states of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt; S. K. Basu ''Encylopaedic Dictionary of Astrophysics'' 2007, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cosmologies cover many of the same concerns also addressed by [[religious cosmology]] and [[cosmology (metaphysics)|philosophical cosmology]], such as the origin, purpose, and destiny of the universe and of consciousness and the nature of existence. For this reason it is sometimes difficult to distinguish where religion or philosophy end and esotericism or occultism begins. However, esoteric cosmology is distinguished from religion in its more sophisticated construction and reliance on intellectual understanding rather than faith, and from philosophy in its emphasis on techniques of psycho-spiritual transformation.

Examples of esoteric cosmologies can be found in [[Gnosticism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Nagualism]], Nagualism (Carlos Castaneda), [[Tantra]] (especially [[Kashmir Shaivism]]), [[Kabbalah]], [[Sufism]], the teachings of [[Jacob Boehme]], [[The Urantia Book]], the [[Sant Mat]]/[[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] tradition, [[Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], The [[Cosmic Tradition]] of [[Max Theon]] and [[Alma Theon|his wife]], [[Max Heindel]] (''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]''), elements of the teachings of [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[Meher Baba]], the [[Fourth Way]] propounded by Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, [[PaGaian Cosmology]] and many current [[New Age]] teachings, to give only a few examples.&lt;ref&gt; Tim Voigt ''The Grand Fantasy of Einstein: The Search for the Theory of the Universe'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gnosticism ==

[[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] teachings were contemporary with those of Neoplatonism. Gnosticism is an imprecise label, covering monistic as well as dualistic conceptions. Usually the higher worlds of Light, called the [[Pleroma]] or &quot;fullness&quot;, are radically distinct from the lower world of Matter.  The emanation of the Pleroma and its godheads (called ''Aeons'') is described in detail in the various Gnostic tracts, as is the pre-creation crisis (a cosmic equivalent to the &quot;fall&quot; in [[Christianity|Christian]] thought) from which the material world comes about, and the way that the divine spark can attain salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Guiley ''The encyclopedia of saints'' 2001, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kabbalah ==

[[Kabbalah]] combines orthodox Judaic, Neoplatonic, Gnostic, and philosophical (e.g. Aristotlean) themes, to develop an elaborate and highly symbolic cosmology in which [[God]], who is ineffable and unknowable, manifests as ten archetypal [[sephirot]], each with its own Divine attributes, and arranged in a  configuration of interrelated paths called the [[Tree of Life]].  The original Tree gives rise to further trees, until there are four or (in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]]) five worlds or universes (Trees) in all, with the lowest sephira of the lowest world constituting the material cosmos.  

This cosmology proved highly popular with occultists, and formed the basis of Western hermetic thought (e.g. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and subsequent organisations), where it is associated with a form of astral travel called &quot;[[pathworking]]&quot;.

== Neoplatonism ==

Although under [[Plotinus]], [[Neoplatonism]] began as a school of [[philosophy]], the teachings of later Neoplatonists such as [[Iamblichus (philosopher)|Iamblichus]] and [[Proclus]] incorporate additional details of the [[emanation]] process in terms of the dialectical action of the [[Hypostasis (Neoplatonism)|hypostases]] and further subdivisions from Plotinus' original three hypostases.  Each higher hypostasis constitutes a more sublime deific state of existence.  There is also a tendency in later neoplatonic thought towards increasing transcendentalism and dualism.  Although Plotinus saw spiritual ascent as leading ultimately to the One ([[The Absolute]]), in later Neoplatonism the best one can hope for is irridation of the [[Soul]] by the [[Nous]] above.

Neoplatonic ideas were later taken up by Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Christianity ([[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]]), and, in the 19th century, Theosophy.

== Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception ==

[[Max Heindel]] presents in his ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]'' (1909) an evolutionary process of [[human|man]] and the [[universe]], correlating [[science]] with [[religion]]. This work of [[esoteric knowledge]] contains the fundamentals of the Rosicrucian Philosophy and also deals, among other topics, [[metaphysics]] and [[cosmology]]. The second part of the book contains the scheme of Evolution in general and the Evolution of the [[Solar System]] and the [[Earth]] in particular, according to Heindel. In the field of cosmology (Cosmogenisis and Anthropogenesis) it teaches about the Worlds, Globes and Periods, Revolutions and Cosmic Nights related to life waves and human development and also the constitution of our solar system and of the [[Universe]]: The Supreme Being, the Cosmic Planes and [[God]].

==Theosophy &amp; Anthroposophy==

[[H.P. Blavatsky]] in her [[Theosophy|Theosophical]] writings presented a complex cosmology, in terms of a sevenfold series of cosmic planes and subplanes, and a detailed sevenfold system of [[Round (Theosophy)|cycles and sub-cycles]] of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Hanson ''H.P. Blavatsky and the Secret Doctrine'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  These ideas were adapted by later esotericists like [[Rudolf Steiner]] ([[Anthroposophy]]), Max Heindel, [[Alice Bailey]], and [[Ann Ree Colton]], and some of these ideas were included in [[New Age]] thought.

== Max Theon and the &quot;Cosmic Philosophy&quot; ==

The occultist [[Max Theon]] developed a sophisticated [[Cosmic philosophy|cosmology]], incorporating [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic]] [[Kabbalistic]] and other themes.  This describes a number of divine and material worlds, and four or eight &quot;states&quot; (equivalent to the Theosophical Planes), each divided into degrees, each of which are in turn subdivided into sub-degrees.  The details of these various occult worlds, their beings, recognisable colours, and so on, were all laid out, but very little of this material has yet been published.
