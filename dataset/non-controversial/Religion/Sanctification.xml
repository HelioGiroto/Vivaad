      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12832">'''Sanctification''' is the act or process of acquiring sanctity, of being made or becoming [[holy]]. &quot;Sanctity&quot; is an ancient concept widespread among [[religion]]s, a property of a thing or person [[sacred]] or set apart within the religion, from [[temple]] vessels to days of the week, to a [[human]] [[belief|believer]] who achieves this state. To sanctify is [[Literal and figurative language|literally]] &quot;to set apart for special use or purpose,&quot; figuratively &quot;to make holy or sacred,&quot; and [[Etymology|etymologically]] from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] [[verb]] ''[[wiktionary:sanctificare|sanctificare]]'' which in turn is from ''[[sanctus]]'' &quot;holy&quot; and ''[[wiktionary:facere|facere]]'' &quot;to make.&quot;

==Christianity==
In the various branches of [[Christianity]] sanctification usually refers to a ''person'' becoming more holy in some sense, with the details differing in different branches.

===Trinitarian===

====Anglicanism====
Anglicans teach that sanctification is a process of changing to become holy.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Richard Hooker]], one of the founders of Anglican thought, argued that sanctification is based on works while [[Justification (theology)|justification]] is only by faith.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, Lee W. &quot;Richard Hooker's Via Media Doctrine of Justification .&quot; The Harvard Theological Review 74, no. 2 (1981): 211-220. http://www.jstor.org/stable/1509447 (accessed June 10, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calvinism====
Calvinist and Evangelical theologians interpret sanctification as the process of being made holy only through the merits and justification of Jesus Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit. Sanctification cannot be attained by any works based process, but only through the works and power of the divine. Sanctification is seen as a process in Calvinism and not instantaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dane says: |url=http://learntheology.com/sanctification-calvinist.html |title=Sanctification â€“ A Calvinist Viewpoint &amp;#124; Calvinism &amp;#124; Sanctification â€“ A Calvinist Viewpoint |publisher=Learntheology.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the process of sanctification flows, the person becomes, in their essence, a different person/man. When a man is unregenerate, it is their essence that sins and does evil. But when a man is justified through Christ, it is no longer the man (in his essence) that sins, but the man is acting outside of his character. In other words, the man is not being himself, he is not being true to who he is.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard O. Forde, Donald L. Alexander, Sinclair B. Ferguson: &quot;Christian spirituality: five views of sanctification&quot;, InterVarsity Press, 1988. p. 47-76&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
[[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox Christianity]] teaches the doctrine of [[theosis]], whereby humans take on divine properties. A key [[scripture]] supporting this is [[wikisource:2 Peter|2 Peter 1:4]]. In the 4th century, [[Athanasius]] taught that God became [[Christ|Man]] that [[Man (word)|Man]] might become God.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Athanasius&quot;&gt;Athanasius: &quot;On the Incarnation&quot;, Crestwood: Saint Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1989. p.93&lt;/ref&gt;
[[essence|Essentially]], Man does not become divine, but in Christ can partake of divine nature. This [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Church]]'s version of salvation restores God's image in man.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Rakestraw&quot;&gt;Robert V. Rakestraw: &quot;On Becoming God: An Evangelical Doctrine of Theosis,&quot; Journal of Evangelical Theological Society 40/2 (June 1997) 257-269&lt;/ref&gt;
One such theme is release from mortality caused by desires of the world.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Karkkainen&quot;&gt;Veli-Matti Karkkainen: &quot;One With God:  Salvation as Deification and Justification,&quot; Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 2004. p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lutheranism====
[[Martin Luther]], the founder of [[Lutheranism]], taught in his [[Large Catechism]] that Sanctification is only caused by the [[Holy Spirit]] through the powerful [[Bible|Word of God]]. The Holy Spirit uses [[local church|churches]] to gather [[Christian]]s together for the teaching and [[preaching]] of the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;Lutheran Dogmaticians consider this the broad sense of sanctification. See [http://www.bookofconcord.org/largecatechism/4_creed.html Luther's Large Catechism], the Apostle's Creed, paragraph 53 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methodism====
[[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], taught what is known as [[Entire Sanctification|entire sanctification]] in the [[holiness movement]] churches, such as the [[Church of the Nazarene]], [[the Salvation Army]], or [[Christian perfection]] in &quot;[[mainstream]]&quot; Methodist [[religious denomination|denomination]]s, such as the [[United Methodist Church]], the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]]. This is the doctrine that by the power of God's sanctifying grace and attention upon the [[Means of Grace|means of grace]] may cleanse a Christian of the corrupting influence of [[original sin]] in this life. It is explained in depth in the essay, &quot;Entire Sanctification&quot; by Adam Clarke as well as, later, in [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] in the ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline of the Methodist Church]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1650 The United Methodist Church: The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church - Of Sanctification]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Initial salvation&quot; is sometimes seen as an initial step of acknowledging God's holiness, with sanctification as, through the grace and power of God, entering into it.  A key scripture is Hebrews 12:14:  &quot;Follow after...holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord.&quot;

[[United Methodists]] believe that sanctifying grace draws one toward the gift of Christian perfection, which Wesley described as a heart &quot;habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor&quot; and as &quot;having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1813 |title=Distinctive Wesleyan Emphases (Page 2) |publisher=Archives.umc.org |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Catholicism====
According to the [[Catholic encyclopedia]] &quot;sanctity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Sanctity Catholic Encyclopedia: Sanctity]&lt;/ref&gt; differs for God, individual, and [[corporate body]]. For God, it is God's unique [[absolution|absolute]] [[morality|moral]] [[perfection]]. For the individual, it is a close union with God and the resulting moral perfection. It is essentially of God, by a divine [[gift]]. For a society, it is the ability to produce and secure holiness in its members, who display a real, not merely nominal, holiness. The Church's holiness is beyond human power, [[supernatural|beyond natural]] power.

Sanctity is regulated by [[convention (norm)|standard]]s.

====Other Christian denominations and movements====
Beliefs about sanctification vary amongst the [[Christian denomination]]s and movement, influenced by various Christian movements. These beliefs differ from each other on:  whether sanctification is a definitive experience or process, when the process/experience takes place, and if entire sanctification is possible in this life.

Influenced by the [[Holiness movement]] some Pentecostal churches, such as the [[Church of God in Christ]] and the [[Apostolic Faith Church]], believe that sanctification is a definitive act of God’s grace and spiritual experience whereby we are made holy subsequent to salvation and prior to the baptism of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogic.net/cogiccms/default/cogic-history/what-we-believe/ |title=What we believe|author=Church of God in Christ|accessdate=Februar 9. 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apostolicfaith.org/OurFaith/Doctrines.aspx/ |title=Our Faith - Doctrines|author=Apostolic Faith Church|accessdate=May 24. 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sullivan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenos.org/ministries/crossroads/OnlineJournal/issue1/fiveview.htm#Ref38|title=Five Views on Sanctification: An In-Depth Analysis|author=Mike Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformed Churches are amongst denominations that teach about definitive sanctification at the time of conversion, and believers are required to &quot;do good works&quot; which are &quot;… all sanctified by (God’s) grace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcna.org/pages/belgic_articles17_24.cfm |title=The Belgic Confession|author=Christian Reformed Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, non-Wesleysan Pentecostals such as [[Assemblies of God]] teach about definitive sanctification at the time of conversion and progressive sanctification after conversion. Converted believers are expected to &quot;make every effort to live a holy life… Even though Christians may not attain absolute perfection in this life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.org/top/beliefs/topics/gendoct_05_sanctification.cfm|title=Sanctification &amp; Holiness|author=Assemblies of God USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event of entire sanctification occurs when Christ comes back and gives us glorified bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;sullivan&quot; /&gt;

[[Higher Life movement]] and [[Brunstad Christian Church]] believe that sinless perfection is attainable in Christian life. Even though believers still have an inclination to sin after conversion, they must constantly rely on the Holy Spirit to struggle against this tendency, and therefore can attain sinless perfection in this life.&lt;ref&gt;J. Robertson McQuilkin, &quot;The Keswick Perspective,&quot; In Five Views on Sanctification (Grand Rapids: Academic Books, 1987), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher life movement teaches &quot;the secret of complete victory is faith: simply believing that Jesus has done and is doing all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Charles G. Trumbull, Victory in Christ (Fort Washington: Christian Literature Crusade, 1959), 84, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunstad Christian Church focuses on the belief that Jesus was a man during His days on earth. They teach that believers ought to follow him by destroying the sinful nature and thereby increase in divine nature, through the process of &quot;becoming holy as He is holy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunstad.org/en/About-us/Our-faith/#Helliggjorelse|title=Our Faith|author=Brunstad Christian Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Trinitarian===

====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{main|Perfection (Latter Day Saints)}}
In [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] sanctification is a process that makes its members holier. In the scriptural cannon of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sanctification is mentioned in the following scriptures: Docterine &amp; Covenants 20:31 &quot;we know also, that sanctification through the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and true, to all those who love and serve God with all their mights, minds, and strength,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Doctrine and Covenants: Section 20|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.31?lang=eng#30}|work=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Helaman 3:35 &quot;Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helaman 3:35|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.35?lang=eng#34|work=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dallin H. Oaks]], an LDS [[General authority]] and member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] taught that trials and adversities can change who a member is into what God wants them &quot;to become&quot; if they approach them with the right attitude.&lt;ref&gt; {{citation |first= Dallin H. |last= Oaks |author-link= Dallin H. Oaks|title= The Challenge to Become |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |month= November |year= 2000 |page= 32 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/2000/11/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;
