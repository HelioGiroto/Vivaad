'''Consecration''' is the [[ritual|solemn]] dedication to a special purpose or service, usually religious. The word &quot;consecration&quot; literally means &quot;to associate with the [[sacred]]&quot;. Persons, places, or things can be consecrated, and the term is used in various ways by different groups.  A [[synonym]] for to consecrate is to [[sanctify]]; an [[antonym]] is to [[desecrate]].

==Roman Catholic Church==
[[Image:Consécration-de-Déodat.jpg|thumb|''The Consecration of [[Deodatus of Nevers|Deodat]]'' (1620, [[Claude Bassot]]).]]

&quot;Consecration&quot; is used in the Catholic Church as the setting apart for the service of God of both persons and objects.

===Ordination of bishops===
The [[Holy Orders|ordination]] of a new [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] is also called a consecration. While the term &quot;episcopal ordination&quot; is now more common,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} &quot;consecration&quot; was the preferred term in the centuries immediately preceding the [[Second Vatican Council]] (11 October 1962—8 December 1965).

The Vatican II document [[Sacrosanctum Concilium|Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy]] n. 76 states,
:&quot;Both the ceremonies and texts of the ordination rites are to be revised.  The address given by the bishop at the beginning of each ordination or consecration may be in the mother tongue.
:&quot;When a bishop is consecrated, the laying of hands may be done by all the bishops present.&quot;

The English text of [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], Second Edition, 1997, under the heading &quot;Episcopal ordination—fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders&quot;, uses &quot;episcopal consecration&quot; as a synonymous term, using &quot;episcopal ordination&quot; and &quot;episcopal consecration&quot; interchangeably.  (CCC nn. 1556-1558)

The [[Code of Canon Law]] Latin-English Edition, (1983), under &quot;Title VI—Orders&quot; uses the term ''sacrae ordinationis minister'' &quot;minister of sacred ordination&quot; and the term ''consecratione episcopali'' &quot;episcopal consecration&quot;.  (CCL cc. 1012, 1014) 

===Religious institutes===
The life of those who enter [[religious institute]]s and similar institutes is also described as [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|Consecrated Life]].

A rite of [[consecrated virgin|consecration of virgins]] can be traced back at least to the fourth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=O8yr3eoDyVIC The Sacraments (Liturgical Press, 1987, ISBN 0-8146-1365-9, ISBN 978-0-8146-1365-8)], p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the Second Vatican Council, use of this rite was limited to cloistered nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Constitution ''Sponsa Christi'' - AAS 43 (1951), 16&lt;/ref&gt; The Council directed that the then existing rite should be revised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html ''Sacrosanctum Concilium''], 80&lt;/ref&gt; Two similar versions were prepared, one for women living in [[monastic order]]s, another for consecrated virgins living in the world. An [http://www.consecratedvirgins.org/rite.pdf English translation] of the rite for those living in the world is available on the web site of the United States Association of Consecrated Virgins.

===Churches, altars, and other ritual objects===
[[Chrism]], used as anointing oil, is (usually scented) olive oil consecrated by a bishop.

Objects such as [[paten]]s and [[chalice (cup)|chalices]], used for the Sacrament of the Eucharist, also used to be consecrated by a bishop, using [[chrism]]. 

A more solemn rite exists for the consecration of an altar, either of the altar alone or as the central part of the rite of consecration of a church.  Since it would be contradictory to consecrate to the service of God a mortgage-burdened building, the rite of consecration or [[dedication]] of a church is carried out only if the building is debt-free. Otherwise, it is only blessed.

===Eucharist===
A very special act of consecration is that of the bread and wine used in the [[Eucharist (Catholic Church)|Eucharist]], which according to Catholic belief involves their change into the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ|Blood]] of Christ, a change referred to as [[transubstantiation]]. To consecrate the bread and wine, the priest speaks the [[Words of Institution]].

==Eastern churches==
{{Main|Consecrations in Eastern Christianity}}
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the term &quot;consecration&quot; can refer to either the [[Eastern Orthodoxy#Mysteries|Sacred Mystery]] (Sacrament) of ''Cheirotonea'' (Ordination through laying on of hands) of a Bishop, or the sanctification and solemn dedication of a church building. It can also (more rarely) be used to describe the [[Eucharistic theologies contrasted#Eastern Orthodox Church|change]] of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ at the [[Divine Liturgy]]. The [[Chrism#Eastern Christianity|Chrism]] used at [[Chrismation]] and the [[Antimension]] placed on the [[Altar|Holy Table]] are also said to be consecrated.

== Various Christian churches ==
[[Image:1962 consecration of William Evan Sanders - Bishop of Tennessee.jpg|thumb|The consecration of William Evan Sanders, [[ECUSA|Episcopal]] [[Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee|Bishop of Tennessee]] (1962).]]

[[Church building]]s, [[chapel]]s and [[altar]]s are consecrated to the purpose of religious [[worship]], baptismal fonts and vessels are consecrated for the purpose of containing the [[Eucharist]]ic elements, the bread and wine/the body and blood of Christ.  

A person may be consecrated for a specific role within a religious hierarchy, or a person may consecrate his or her life in an act of [[Worship|devotion]].  In particular, the [[Holy Orders|ordination]] of a [[bishop]] is often called a consecration. In churches that follow the doctrine of [[Apostolic Succession]] (the [[historical episcopate]]), the bishops who consecrate a new bishop are known as the consecrators and form an unbroken line of succession back to the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]].  Those who take the [[vows]] of [[Religious institute|religious life]] are said to be living a ''consecrated life''.

Among some religious groups there is a service of &quot;[[deconsecration]]&quot;, to return a formerly consecrated place to secular purpose (for instance, if the building is to be sold or demolished). In the [[Church of England]], an order [[Closed church|closing a church]] may remove the legal effects of consecration.
