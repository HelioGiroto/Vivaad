==Untitled==
&quot;comparative mythology&quot; by jaan puhvel is a useful guide to common motifs in PIE beliefs.
cross-dressing in the hall of an enemy, the thrice-sinning hero born with extra limbs used by feuding gods, the king with the uppity sons and the disguised virgin who must preserve the dynasty, the crippled smith, rescuing stolen cattle from a cave to bring rain, the three wide steps, magical prosthetic limbs, the eagle retrieving mead or soma from a mountain/heroic theft of a life elixir, being chained to a rock and tortured by a bird, the treasure inside the fish, the epic battles in gesta danorum and mahabharata, sacred fire in a pool of water, the flood/cosmic winter, origin of social classes, the weak spot and filicide, the monster that bites off the hand, shamanic journeys, ritual hanging, horse/chariot race, raid for foreign women, the king and his association with a horse, triple goddesses, necromancy, one-eyed gods, the wild hunt, foot fetishes, spitting into a crock and a wise man comes out, a water deity that is the sole survivor of nine births, a blind god tricked into murder at a feast and the return of the slain at a time of need, rowan as the wife of thunder, igneous potential of rocks and trees, the cosmic mill, etc. [[User:Eaglethunder|Eaglethunder]] ([[User talk:Eaglethunder|talk]]) 01:11, 5 September 2008 (UTC)eaglethunder  
==The sumerians?==

I've noticed, several times, that the world tree + slaying of snake/dragon-myth(s) were very common among the sumerians. If people are sure that the axis mundi-myth is protoindoeuropean; doesn't that mean that the sumerians were indoeuropeans too? But the fact, though, is that they weren't at all - rather Dravidian, or something. Another alternative - the indoeuropeans (and the semitic people of akkad) copied the sumerians, and thereafter spread the myth? Or mayby the myth is just fundamental for most pagan people...//Charlotte

-------------------

Considering we have an article on this, and one on Proto-Indo-European (although that is currently part of [[Indo-European languages]]), I think it might be wise to make an [[Wikipedia:Article series|article series]] on the Indo-Europeans: their culture, religion, language, etc. Any thoughts? -[[User:Branddobbe|Branddobbe]] 08:48, Mar 9, 2004 (UTC)

I have made an article on [[Indo-European]] which I have intended to be a neutral article giving links to both the language article and the religion article. What do you think? [[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 10:37, Mars 9, 2004 (UTC)

----

Wiglaf, I've rewritten the first paragraph, splitting it up into a few, trying to provide a sufficiently balanced point of view, indicating both the difficulties in reconstructing such a primeval religion along with the positive evidence for it. I hope you like it. [[User:Martijn faassen|Martijn faassen]] 21:35, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Yes, I like it. [[User:Wiglaf|Wiglaf]] 08:37, Mar 30, 2004 (CET)

We the Indo-Europeans, closely subsequent descendents of the original Takers, created our wheat-goddess that rewarded us with plentiful harvest and our thunder-god that punished us with lightning bolts, thus ensuring our destiny forever battling nature.  We ate from the Apple of Discord and spread our totalitarian agricultural &quot;civilization&quot; to unsuspecting peoples who had previously let the old spirits govern their lives.  Our legacy includes writing, commerce, cities, automobiles, recorded music, wealth, famine, democracy, politics, science, genocide, philosophy, logic and mathematics, which we will one day gladly forsake for the old spirits.--Georgopoulos, 22 June 2004

The articles on [[Danu]](both of them) suggest a relationship.  The same goes for [[Ymir]]/[[Yama]]. - [[User:JeffBobFrank|JeffBobFrank]] 05:44, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

==Missing the thought-process here==
The results are less interesting than the techniques for arriving at them would be, which are scarcely offered. The inclusion of Eos-Auroroa-Eostre (!) shows how easy it is to stray into fantasies in this kind of speculation. Can this entry be improved, or is the idea basically flawed? --[[User:Wetman|Wetman]] 12:35, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:hm, certainly you accept Eos-Aurora? The Eostre connection is tenuous, of course, but not extremely far-fetched, in my view. [[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''&amp;#5839;''')]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:22, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

Why is Zeus, rather than Uranus, associated with Dyaeus Pita?  Uranus and Dyaeus Pita are both gky gods from whom the other gods are descended, and both are married to an earth goddess. - [[User:JeffBobFrank|JeffBobFrank]]
:Presumably the name &quot;Zeus&quot; is related to &quot;Dyeus&quot; and &quot;Uranus&quot; isn't.
::'Strue.  The genitive form of Zeus is &quot;Dios&quot;, that of Ouranos is Ouranou.  BTW, I'm going to remove some of the mythology stuff that belongs to comparative religion rather than Indo-European myth. [[User:The Dogandpony|The Dogandpony]] 21:52, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

==Plthivi Mh2ter (Tkon)?==
Who are Plthivi Mh2ter and Tkon. I've never heard of them, and google searches for Plthivi or Tkon don't shed any light on the matter. I assume that Plthivi is a theoretical Proto-Indo-European name, but the only sources on the web that seems to mention her is this one (or ones that are identical to this one though I'm not sure who copied whom). Tkon gets lots of hits, but none of them seem to have anything to do with an earth goddess. Are there any sources for this page?--[[User:Heathcliff|Heathcliff]] 03:23, 13 May 2005 (UTC)
:yes, they are the reconstructed forms of Sanskrit &quot;prthivi mata&quot; and Sanskrit ksham / Hittite takkan, Greek khthon, respectively. ''tk&amp;#333;n'' should properly be ''dgh'&amp;#333;m'',  a very early (&quot;[[Indo-Hittite]]&quot;) form the more familiar PIE form would be ''gh'ð&amp;#333;m''. You can only find so much specialist information with google, sometimes you have to resort to books :) [[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''&amp;#5839;''')]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:17, 13 May 2005 (UTC)
::Obviously. That is why I ask for a source. You seem to be knowledgeable about these matters; could you please provide sources for this information?--[[User:Heathcliff|Heathcliff]] 22:26, 13 May 2005 (UTC)
:::do you mean the ''gh'ð&amp;#333;m'' or the ''dgh'&amp;#333;m'' form? the former is in [[Indogermanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch]] (or any etymological dictionary of the languages mentioned above). The form before thorn-metathesis will be in any introduction to [[Indo-European studies]]. There is not really much controversy here. Accounts of how the metathesis took place exactly, or whether it should be called a metathesis, will vary, but the basic facts are pretty much universally recognized.

::::I'd just like a source for the information on this page. You seem to know a lot about this subject, you could just let me know where you got the information if you want. If it's universally recognized, I don't see why providing a source should be to much trouble. Could you please provide at least one source on proto-indo-european relgion that supports to information on this page? Thank you for mentioning Indogermanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch, but it's hard to get useful information out of dictionary. I have yet to find anything in it on Plthivi, Dghom, or Tkon. Also the Wilipdeia entry on it says it is outdated, and a review of it on Amazon makes the following claim: 
::::::''In no case can the materials in Pokorny's IEW be taken as raw data. Onomatopoetic words are over-represented, and unfounded etymologies or improbable semantic groupings are not seldom. Using this material for statistical purposes, or browsing it with an interest in general semantics, or picking roots or words in order to compare them with words of other language families, is bound to be very misleading.''

:::::look, exactly which point do you want to have referenced? I'll quote a coupe of works on IE myhtology, but are you interested in a particular point? Do you want information on a particular form, or rather on mythological implications?

::::::A source on the ''dghom'' word would be fine since that is what I've been asking about, but more general information on the infortmation on this page would be useful as well. You say that ''gdhom'' would be discussed in any introduction. That's great, that's exactly what I'm looking for: could you please name just one of these introductions? Also I was interested in your opinion of whether or not Indogermanisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch was reliable. Do you have an opinion on this?

I don't want to sound impatient, but you did realize the IEW article points to the Leiden online version, didn't you? Here is a link for you, [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny&amp;first=1&amp;sort=lemma&amp;text_lemma=&amp;method_lemma=substring&amp;text_meaning=earth&amp;method_meaning=substring&amp;text_ger_mean=&amp;method_ger_mean=substring&amp;text_grammar=&amp;method_grammar=substring&amp;text_comments=&amp;method_comments=substring&amp;text_derivatives=&amp;method_derivatives=substring&amp;text_material=&amp;method_material=substring&amp;text_ref=&amp;method_ref=substring&amp;text_seealso=&amp;method_seealso=substring&amp;text_pages=&amp;method_pages=substring&amp;text_any=&amp;method_any=substring] (I'm sorry, but you'll have to scroll down yourself). Pokorny is quite reliable, and to be taken seriously. He doesn't have much Anatolian material, and doesn't accept laryngeals, so you'll need additional resources to come up with a &quot;contemporary&quot; opinion (e.g. Rix' lexicon of the PIE verb, and Mayrhofer's Indo-Aryan dictionary), but it's a very good place to start. Concerning introductions, there are a couple of good ones, but I'd recommend the one by [[Oswald Szemerényi]] (English translation 1996).

:::Sorry, your reply made it sound like it was a link to IEW, you didn't mention it was a link to the page itself. I have to say at this point I don't see the reasoning to lead to the conclusion that the Proto-Indo-Europeans worshipped an earth goddess who is a fore-runner to various bronze age godesses. It seems a linguistic link between the words for earth as been used to reconstruct a theoretical proto-indo-european word for ''earth'' and that the idea that ''Mother Earth'' was worshiped as a godess just seems to be slapped on at the end. But I don't actually know that this is the case. There may be ample evidence of a proto-indo-european earth goddess. I've just got to find it one way or the other. I've found a couple of books that aren't nearly as outdated as the two you suggested, and I may order them since I haven't found them locally. Perhaps then I'll be able to get some answers to my questions. It may be some time before I can get back to this page, but hopefully I'll be able to add to it and provide some actual sources.--[[User:Heathcliff|Heathcliff]] 13:00, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

btw, &quot;Plthivi&quot; is really an epitheton. it means as much as &quot;She who is flat&quot;, more or less &quot;the wide expanse&quot;, but female. Dghom otoh is the proper word for &quot;Earth&quot;, but not particularly when imagined as a female goddess, just &quot;Earth&quot;. I suppose gods needed to be addressed obliquely, so it would be blasphemous to address a libation to &quot;Dghom&quot; (*speculation alert*) [[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''&amp;#5839;''')]]&lt;/small&gt; 11:03, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

 Plth2vih2 Mh2ter (Dg'hōm) is believed to have been the name of (Mother) Earth, see Prthivi. 
 Another name of the Indo-European Mother-Earth would be *Dheghom Mater, as in Greek Demeter, 
 Albanian Dhe Motë, Avestan Zamyat, Slavic Mat' Zemlija, Lithuanian Žemyna, Latvian Zemes Mate. 
I wonder whether *Plthivi really is a more plausible proto-word than *Dheghom Mater, considering the latter has a lot more attested cognates. [[User:Wakuran|惑乱 分からん]] 15:53, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

::Interesting discussion, but I can't find *tkon in the article. *Plthivi is a lot closer, superficially, to Latona and Pluto than *Dhegom is. Isn't it, 惑乱 分からん? [[User:Hypatea|Hypatea]] ([[User talk:Hypatea|talk]]) 17:09, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

== [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] vs. [[Indo-European religion]] ==

I've noticed that [[Indo-European religion]] diverts to here. Wouldn't it make more sense for these two articles be seperate from each other in the same way [[Indo-European languages]] is a seperate article from [[Proto-Indo-European language]]? This page would continue to deal with the reconstruction of hypothetical common roots between individual attested belief systems, wheras [[Indo-European religion]] would be a more general article on the attested belief systems themselves. Would this be a valid (from a &quot;scholarly&quot; point of view) distinction to make? --[[User:86.135.217.213|86.135.217.213]] 04:04, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
:No - as per [[Indo-European]], &quot;Indo-European&quot; is sometimes used in the meaning of &quot;PIE&quot;, e.g. &quot;the Indo-Europeans domesticated the horse&quot;. There is no such thing as a &quot;Indo European family of religions&quot;, except you mean the various religions of Indo-European speakers, linked to from this article (is [[Celtic Christianity]] or [[Germanic Christianity]] an Indo-European or a Semitic religion??) --  the term &quot;Indo-European religion/mythology&quot; typically refers to the subject of this article, the religion/mythology of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. [[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''&amp;#5839;''')]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:40, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

:: dab is correct. PPIE religion would be some Nostratic thing from 10,000 years ago. It's conceivable, with difficulty. PIE is the same thing as IE in many cases. PIE is a better choice when it comes to reconstructing pantheons and myths. [[User:Hypatea|Hypatea]] ([[User talk:Hypatea|talk]]) 17:22, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

==god vs. God==
Satanael, we have the convention to use uppercase ''[[God]]'' for the monotheistic entity, and lowercase ''god'' for polytheistic male deities. Please use lowercase ''god'' here, since PIE religion was clearly polytheistic. [[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''&amp;#5839;''')]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:54, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

:Did I use God with a capital &quot;G&quot;? If I did, then it wasn't intentional and was an &quot;editorial&quot;(pun intended) oversight, as I'm quite aware of the fact that PIE religion was polytheistic. :) [[User:Satanael|Satanael]] 15:12, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

==Books==
I was wondering, do anyone here know the best books to buy to get a general overview of Indo-European scholarship and studies, its religion in particular, and as well as of the current discussions in the field. Those here who edit this article, as well as the other articles on the Indo-European topic seem pretty knowledgeable in the field, and I'd like to atleast get an overview of the general consensus, especially when it comes to the different gods of the various Indo-European mythologies and the deities within the PIE pantheon from which they originated. It would be nice if, atleast one, contains info that show how various deities and spirits are connected to other Indo-European cognates and counterparts, and if it contains any archaeology(as I'm going to study anthropology, I consider at least some archaeology a must). I'm particulary interested when it comes to deities such as Dyeus, Perkwunos, Paxuson, as well as any info on the god of death, as well as any possible cognate to Celtic Cernunnos. And preferably not any of those heartattack-providing 100$ tomes. I've looked around for a number of books, but I'm not sure what the best ones to get are. I realize that this may be asking to much, but as I'd really like to know more about it, I would appreciate any help. Thanks in advance. [[User:Satanael|Satanael]] 22:30, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
::Marija Gimbutas has a lot to say about IE religion, but most of it is biased and based on circular reasoning. Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins by Colin Renfrew might be a good introduction. [[User:Hypatea|Hypatea]] ([[User talk:Hypatea|talk]]) 16:31, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

== Sources ==

A Tripod site does not constitute adequate referencing, no matter how good it is.  Satanael's question (in Books, above) is a very good one and I would also be interested in having it answered.  I know [[Jared Diamond]]'s '[[The_Third_Chimpanzee:_The_Evolution_and_Future_of_the_Human_Animal|The Third Chimpanzee]]' is where I was first exposed to my basic knowledge of PIE, but that isn't an appropriate resource either--it's a book about evolution.  Placing the request for sources at the head of the document is far more likely to attract someone who knows what they are doing.  Certain editors seem to want to keep it at the bottom of the page, presumably because they view this page as &quot;their own&quot;.  Fine, whatever.  Have fun. [[User:The Dogandpony|The Dogandpony]] 06:31, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

== Precisions about modifications that I have made ==

Beside *Peltawi, I have added her another name *Dheghom *mater (*dhghom) [cf, &quot;Indo-european vocabular&quot; by Xavier Delamarre] and other gods, sun-god and moon-god(dess).

&quot;Poseidon&quot; as the &quot;husband of the earth&quot; or &quot;lord of earth&quot; is absolutely not sure. Another etymology would &quot;master of the waters&quot;. Greek &quot;potis&quot; means &quot;husband, lord, master&quot; and eveng &quot;god&quot; as the feminine form Potnia for goddesses in mycenaean religion. Then &quot;potis-don&quot; is the &quot;potis&quot; of the don. &quot;don&quot; may refer to indo-européen *danu, &quot;river&quot;. Then &quot;potidon/poseidon&quot; would be &quot;the master of the rivers&quot;, &quot;the master of the waters&quot;, become &quot;the god of sea&quot;. As the old Neptune in Roma was not originally a god of sea but the god of the lakes, sources and waters.

:I think you'll find 'Poseidon' was a theonym borrowed by the Greeks. *danu, *san and ne/dne are all IE roots for rivers, but I think this is coincidence of morphemes at work, despite the appearance. Potis is pati, lord, but again, perhaps coincidence. Poseidon and Atlas can be seen as the enemies of/early competitors with the proto Greek tribes, as Solon learned in Egypt. [[User:Hypatea|Hypatea]] ([[User talk:Hypatea|talk]]) 17:16, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

== Merge ==

I started to merge this article 2 [[Aryan religion]], but after realizing how active it is, decided to discuss it 1st. [http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Aryan+religion%22&amp;btnG=Search Aryan religion (970)] gets far more google hits than [http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Proto-Indo-European+religion%22&amp;btnG=Search Proto-Indo-European religion (561)], which is rather a clunky name. [http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22Indo-European+religion%22&amp;btnG=Search Indo-European religion (981)] does slightly better, but I prefer [[Aryan religion]] because it is short and sweet. 

Either which one, they should all go to the same spot. [[User:Sam Spade|Sam Spade]] 16:09, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

Erm... they're clearly different things.  The term [[Proto-Indo-European]] specifies the language and culture of the common ancestor of various languages; Indo-Aryan is a subgroup of this.  The '''Indo-Iranian''' term Aryan is already overloaded in [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Vedic civilization]] and C19-20th definitions of race.  Conflating it with the Proto-Indo-European religion implies a sense of identity that isn't proven or even appropriate to this religion.  Generally, using the term Aryan is outmoded or minority, with similar problems to the romantic use of [[Achaean]] as a Greek dialect.  Read thoroughly the article [[Aryan]], especially the sections on Linguistic Terminology and beyond.

Even if they were the same, I don't think you could make a decision on definition based on a Google war.  Perhaps [[Aryan religion]] could have a more explicit link, to [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] with an explanation of its difficult usage.

--[[User:83.151.246.2|Mark]] 19:46, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

As the above editor said, they are two different things - Aryan religion is a descendent of Proto-Indo-European religion. Suggesting they should be merged is like saying that [[Proto-Indo-European language]] should be merged with [[English language]] because there are 85,900,000 google results for &quot;English Language&quot; but only 15,100 for &quot;Proto-Indo-European language&quot;. --[[User:Krsont|Krsont]] 18:15, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

:there should be no &quot;Aryan religion&quot; article. Either the intended meaning is &quot;Proto-Indo-Iranian religion&quot;, or &quot;Indo-Iranian religion&quot; (including historical descendants). The article fails to show evidence that the term is in use at all.  I'll make it a dab page. [[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|('''&amp;#5839;''')]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:35, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

::agree with dab. Aryan doesn't mean IE or PIE anymore, not since 1945 or so. [[User:Hypatea|Hypatea]] ([[User talk:Hypatea|talk]]) 17:17, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

== How shall I read &quot;Hors and Messiatz&quot; ==

Please, can somebody check and correct this Russianized form of the Proto-Slavic deities, if they really existed (I am a Slavist but have never heard of them, however, it is possible that they were preserved until latest among Eastern Slavs). In the article, the Russianized name of the moon is wrongly put as &quot;messiatz&quot;, whereas it should be *měsęcь. At first, it reminded me of Messiah! Messiatz (mesjac) means 'moon' in modern Russian. The Proto-Slavic form of the word was, *měsęcь. There is a generally accepted &quot;scientific&quot; phonetic transcription for Proto-Slavic language, which is based on the modern Czech and Polish orthographies, including two Cyrillic letters (ъ, ь). This transcription contains no TZ, IA and double SS!!! There is no need to discover America, therefore, because it has already been discovered! I was able to recognize *měsęcь in this MESSIATZ, however, what HORS is and how should it be read I have NO IDEA!

::Hors is not a Slavic name, but probably Sarmatian or Scythian. While Mjesec is simply the name of Moon in (most) Slavic languages, and was not a name of a true diety of Proto-Slavic pantheon, the name of Hors is mentioned amongst gods of [[Primary Chronicle]], and in [[Tale of Igor's Campaign]]. He was probably adopted in East Slavic pantheon from their Iranian speaking neighboors. --[[User:Hier0phant|Hierophant]] 18:34, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

== About the Serpent... ==

Under mythology, there's a large paragraph that lists many of the different god vs. serpent stories. It's followed by this little bit:

&quot;The myth symbolized a clash between forces of order and chaos (represented by the serpent), and the god or hero would always win.[4] '''It is therefore most probable that there existed some kind of dragon or serpent, possibly with multiple heads and likely linked with the god of underworld and/or waters''', as serpentine aspects can be found in many chthonic, aquatic Indo-European deities...&quot;

I might be a bit confused, but this part in bold seems to me a claim that dragons-type serpents actually existed in real life in ancient times! I could be reading this wrong, but that's what it's saying to me. Would anyone like to clarify (and hopefully clear up the meaning of the text as well)?
[[User:Comrade42|T. S. Rice]] 03:12, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

*Well, since more-less the entire article deals with theoretichal reconstruction of hypothetical pantheon, it seems natural to me people reading it would assume the quoted paragraph refers to existance of belief into, not the existance of acctual dragon or serpent. --[[User:Hier0phant|Hierophant]] 06:32, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

**I suppose that makes sense. Text might best be changed itself, though... [[User:Comrade42|T. S. Rice]] 04:59, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

I couldn't avoid reacting on that certain paragraph either - the Axis mundi-myth is, atleast in my eyes, clearly meant to be interpreted as symbolic; and symbolic only (slaying of dragon = creating order/control. Great sea/water = subconsciousness etc.)! Maybe it would be a good idea to change the paragraph, to prevent further misunderstandings? //Charlotte
:::Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and change the wording on this, since it hasn't happened yet, and it managed to completely trip me up even though I thought I knew what it meant.

Could someone please illustrate specifically how the theology and practices of the Greek Orthodox UNIQUELY reflect the Greek interpretatin of PIE religion?

Could someone please illustrate specifically how the theology and practices of the Roman Catholic Church (in, let us say, Boston, Massachussetts) UNIQUELY reflect the &quot;Italic&quot; interpretatin of PIE religion?

Could someone please illustrate specifically how the theology and practices of the Russian Orthodox UNIQUELY reflect the &quot;Slavic&quot; interpretatin of PIE religion?

Were these listings just a matter of mindless inclusion.  Let's see the actual parallels here.
[[User:Dogface|Dogface]] 20:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

:No church is just the official hierarchy, theology and established practice it presents itself to be. Popular Christianity shows extreme variations betwen various nations and/or ethnic groups (those who are Christian, of course); the choice of saints, popular beliefs &amp; prayers, various symbols/practices at established rituals such as baptism/marriage/funeral, etc. Many of these are Christian continuations of rituals and tradions of earlier, pre-Christian religions and mythologies, which survived Christianization and blended in nicely into the symbolism and practice of this new religious system. While I am too tired to give you an example for every question you have asked, just consider the fact that one of the many titles of the Roman Catholich pope is ''pontifex maximus'', which was also the title for the high priests of pagan Rome. If such a syncretism of religions can exist at the very level of the highest priests, then surely much more of it exists at lower levels of popular beliefs and folk religions. Thus, Christianity of various nations in the Old World is as much of a continuation of older pagan mythologies as they temsevles were a continuation of some common PIE religion. --[[User:Hier0phant|Hierophant]] 21:54, 4 October 2006 (UTC)



::&quot;Too tired&quot; to give examples?  That's a spectacularly MISERABLE attitude to bring to an encyclopedia. Yeah, sure, make all kinds of claims, but examples?  Who needs examples in an encyclopedia?  That's SILLY!  Examples and sources in an ENCYCLOPEDIA?  The very IDEA!?  What a silly though--giving specific examples to back up claims made in an encyclopedia.  No, no examples should be given.  Just flat claims.  That's all that's needed.  Yup, that's it.

Christianity is by and large an extension of Judaism. Christian God is the same as Jewish God. The twist is this Jewish God has a Son which is blasphemy for Jews. Moslems still honor Jesus as a prophet but not son of God. New testament is an extension of old testament. The prophets of Old testament are dear to Christians and they praise them. They are certainly the prophets of the Christian God. This proves that Christian God is Jewish God. The prophets of Old testament are also dear to and prophets of Moslem God. Which means Jewish God = Christian God = Moslem God.  The so called mythological Gods of prechristian Europe or Pre islamic Central Asia has no place in christianity or islam. So Hands down. There is no iota of truth that christianity or islam are Indoeuropean or PIE religions. In the initial stages no body took seriously the cock and bull stories of christianity in europe. So church adopted a method called &quot;Camouflage&quot; and made the christianity look like indoeuropean to get all europeans in to christian umbrella. So now my concern is indoeuropeans are either stupid or got bored of their gods to adopt a radically different non indoeuropean God. Anyways its too late to revive indoeuropean religion. It is already lost. If there is truth in indoeuropean religion it will reveal itself.

Oh Yah... I forgot the angels in Judaim, christianity and islam. To start with judaism and its offshoots are polytheistic, just like indoeuropean religions. At some point of time judaism became strictly monothiestic. It may be due to influence of zorastrianism or vice versa. Even though zorastrianism is monothiestic still it put the other gods in their mythology as subordinates to Ahura Mazda. That is common when indoeuropean religions turn monothiestic. The other gods of abrahamic religions became the angels. The angels in christianity and islam are NOT the indoeuropean Gods. They derive from the lesser gods in abrahamic religions when they were polythiestic religions in the past.

All the above points prove that christianity and islam are not indoeuropean by any standard.  -Eudextrous

==Unsure examples==
Hmmm, reading through the article, some names appear to me as uncertain or incorrect:
*Plth2wih2 Mh2ter (Dg'hōm) 
Why *Plth2wih2, the only attested cognate appears to be Sanskrit Prthivi. Are there more cognates found, anywhere else, or is there another reason for *Plth2wih2 to be listed. It just seems as another claim of Sanskrit as the truest mother tongue. *Dhghom Mater seems a lot more probable, with many better examples on widespread cognates.
*Astghik
The [[Astghik]] article claims that the name is derived from a word for star, cognate to PIE *ster, related to Greek aster, Latin stella, English star, etc. (Apparently not related to Greek Eos and Latin Aurora.)
*Njord
Njord from *Neptonos (PG *Nerthuz) also seems a little far-fetched, partly because Njord doesn't even seem to be a true water god to begin with, but rather a fertility god.

On the other hand, when looking through links to corresponding articles, it seems that a lot of these connections are highly speculative, anyway. Apparently the article could need some heavy fixing. The theories could remain, but they'd probably need some elaboration on why they are doubted. [[User:Wakuran|惑乱 分からん * \)/ (\ (&amp;lt; \) (2 /) /)/ *]] 00:50, 5 May 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Fantalov's reduction&quot; ==

Anybody else in favour of deleting this section altogether? A quick google search reveals this &quot;scholar&quot; seems to be primarily an artist of mythological scenes, and imo it's likely the only time he has presented his ideas for peer review were at the event mentioned here. It should either be removed or more sources found. --[[User:Krsont|Krsont]] 11:06, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

* On balance I am inclined to leave this section in. First, because Fantalov's theory may well be right, or nearly so. Second, he appears to be a very serious artist, working on mythological themes. Who better to perceive commonalities among different mythological themes? Third, he is Russian, and almost all of his publications are in Russian.  The fact that his only scholarly writings in English are merely notes for a conference presentation does not mean that they were not backed up with good scholarship. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt for now, and see how his ideas are received. —[[User:Aetheling|Aetheling]] 21:36, 7 October 2007 (UTC)

== changing mythology to religion in topic headings ==

I was looking at the category:Indo-European mythology and I think many of the titles should be changed from myth to religion, ex. Hindu religion instead of Hindu mythology, on that category page and also, further down on this page.  It's no one's fault, it's just because this section developed rather haphazardly.  I realize this would take a lot of work, and I don't want to start changing things, especially since I would probably code it wrong.

**the link that I am removing, along with much other nonsense about St. Gabriel leads to this text:

“Transgression and denying the Lord, and turning away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving in and uttering from the heart lying words. And justice turned back, and righteousness stands far away; for truth has stumbled in the street, and uprightness cannot enter. Yes, truth is lacking and he who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey. Now the Lord saw and it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice. And he saw that there was no man, and was astonished that there was no one to intercede; Then His own Arm brought salvation to Him; and His righteousness upheld Him. And He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head; and He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle. According to their deeds, so He will repay Wrath to His adversaries recompense to His enemies… And a Redeemer will come to Zion… Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For behold darkness will cover the earth, and deep darkness the peoples; but the Lord will rise upon you and His glory will appear upon you. And the nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your rising…And they will call you the city of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel. Whereas you have been forsaken and hated with no one passing through, I will make you an everlasting pride, a joy from generation to generation. You will also suck the milk of nations, and will suck the breast of kings; then you will know that I the Lord am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

== Saint Paraskeva ==

The name of Paraskeva is related to the Greco-Latin word ''Parasceve'', which means &quot;day of preparation&quot;. It was a term used by Hellenized Jews to refer to, inter alia, the day before the Sabbath, i.e. Friday. The notion that 1st Century Jews took the name of their Sabbath preparation from Saint Paraskeva is fanciful, to say the least. It is more than likely that the reverse is true, especially since ''Parasceve'' is mentioned in several places in the Greek and Latin New Testaments. Mention of Paraskeva is out of place in this article; her name clearly has nothing to do with &quot;prixea&quot;.

== Saint Nicolaus ==

The notion that [[Nicolas of Myra|Nicolaus of Myra]] took his name from the same root as Neptunus, Nechtan, Nethuns, Hnikar, nixies or Neckar is equally fanciful. It is obvious to anyone who knows Greek (and certainly was obvious to the parents that named him) that his name is directly related etymologically to [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]. 

Does the editor of this article actually know any Indo-European languages besides English? At any rate, this reference to Nicolaus is off-topic and should be removed from the article. [[User:Rwflammang|Rwflammang]] ([[User talk:Rwflammang|talk]]) 15:45, 29 April 2008 (UTC)

The claim that the PIE religion is the ancestor to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam is highly misleading and should be either removed or highly qualified.

There are undeniable PIE influences, namely in their [[angelology]] and [[demonology]] which were influenced by Iranian religion, and also, perhaps, in monastic celebacy which has paralells in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Ancient Greek Religion]]. But these PIE influences are relatively minor compared to the major semitic doctrines and practices. [[User:Rwflammang|Rwflammang]] ([[User talk:Rwflammang|talk]]) 20:24, 30 April 2008 (UTC)

The first mention of southern Slavic Perun as a friendly goddess is mistaken.

Menuo (dot over first e) is the equivalent of menulis (dot over first e), only the (masculine in both cases) ending (but not stem or root) differ. Veles (dots over both es) are spirits of the dead. Austaras (wings over first s) was a mistake. I have corrected what seemed needing correction and left information in brackets where I wasn't sure.

== vandalism by religious bigots ==

The '''Proto-Indo-European religion''' page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_religion on Wikipedia is still being vandalized by religious bigots, since June 18, 2008.  There's no point in advising [[Wikipedia:Help Desk|Wikipedia]] of the situation, because wikipedia administrators condone religious bigotry (and by the way, if you are a wikipedia administrator, solve the problem yourself, don't whine to me about it, because you have the authority to fix it and I do not).  In the meantime anyone who is interested in the subject can help by copying the current scholarly [[version 101508]] of the page into Wikipedia and you can credit [[David Bigot Bachmann]] for this since he's the one who vandalized the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] page.

== Laryngeals ==

Throughout the article, laryngeals are listed inconsistently. It seems that at some point, looking through the article history, someone began adding and/or changing reconstructions to use laryngeals with capital &lt;H&gt; and subscript vowels (e.g. ''*H&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''*H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''*H&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'',) instead of subscript numbers (as found in the [[Laryngeal theory]] article.)  In my experience, the former usage is very non-standard, mainly due to the disagreement about the exact pronunciation of the laryngeals (see the  [[Laryngeal theory#Pronunciation|Pronunciation]] section of the Laryngeal theory article).

I am proposing that we switch to one consistent laryngeal system. I personally would like to go with the original system used in this article, and the one used on the Laryngeal Theory article, with lowercase &lt;h&gt; and subscript numbers, rather than uppercase &lt;H&gt; and subscript vowels.  While I understand the latter might be more approachable to someone unfamiliar with laryngeal theory, they are, to me, more standard and more &quot;correct.&quot;

Furthermore, there is the complication of figuring out how to match up either system. ''*H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''*H&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' are obviously supposed to be ''*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''*h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', respectively, but ''*H&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a bit confusing. Is it supposed to be ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''? If so, using &lt;e&gt; is probably incorrect, since ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' was most likely a glottal stop ({{IPA-all|ʔ}}), a bit phonetically distant from &lt;e&gt; ({{IPA-all|e}}) (again, see the Pronunciation section ofthe Laryngeal theory article).

Just wanted some opinions before I began changing anything. --[[User:Limetom|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/font&gt;tom]] 04:58, 15 August 2008 (UTC)
:Looks like there's an ''*H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' too.  Now I have no clue what ''*H&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''*H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' are supposed to be. --[[User:Limetom|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/font&gt;tom]] 05:01, 15 August 2008 (UTC)

:: It's not about the pronunciation of laryngeals, but of the ultimate &quot;colouring&quot; phonetic output they induced in Late PIE (and post-PIE if they remained segmental..). This is not supposed to be linguistics article, but religious! :) Yes this is non-standard, but it's quite popular in books/articles that discuss PIE divinities, flora&amp;fauna, i.e. are not centered on reconstructions themselves but on their semantics and distribution. Casual reader would more likely reognize ''*H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' as &quot;laryngeal inducing */a/&quot; than *eh₂. ''*H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' should probably mean as standard ''H'' denoting &quot;unknown laryngeal&quot;. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 14:08, 15 August 2008 (UTC)

:::Again, I understand why it's done, but the scant sources used for the article, especially the one mentioned where the laryngeals are first explained, don't seem to use the system that is in the article. I see no real reason not to use the laryngeals as per the [[Laryngeal theory]] article. Being consistent with the other Proto-Indo-European articles is also a plus in my mind. Besides, if someone is unfamiliar with the system, the article can and should link to the Laryngeal theory article; it seems in line with the [[WP:BUILD]] guideline.  I am going to be [[WP:BOLD|bold]] and go with the &quot;standard&quot; system.  In lieu of other situations with this article, I would suggest some discussion here, especially if people disagree with me on this issue.  --[[User:Limetom|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/font&gt;tom]] 04:37, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

In a massive rewrite which can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proto-Indo-European_religion&amp;oldid=244175969 here], an editor re-introduced errors regarding elves, demons, St. Nick, etc. which are discussed above. In addition to these, the editor charactarized [[Pluto (mythology)]] as being demonized by Christians as a god of the underworld. Actually, it was the ancient Romans who worshipped Pluto precisely as a god of the underworld, as a sort of kinder, gentler version of [[Hades]].

== P.I.E. and Vedic texts ==

I will not claiming to be an expert on this subject, despite holding a B.A. in Anthropology. I think if anyone happens to have any more sources they can contribute to this article as a whole it would be very useful, I have some articles from various journals however the one anthropology journal I think would do the best, The Journal of Indo-European Studies, is not one of them. 

I am a little concerned about the overall conception of Proto-Indo-Europeans as a cultural group with shared religious practices as well as the hypothetical shared language. I will not disagree over the linguistic concept of a shared language within this group, however it is important to recognize that the entire conception of &quot;Indo-Europeans&quot; is as this hypothetical linguistic grouping, not a single cultural unit&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Kenneth. &quot;Have Aryans been identified in the prehistorical skeletal record from South Asia? Biological anthropology and concepts of ancient races.&quot;Indian Philology and South Asian Studies. Volume I. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The only other thing I wanted to bring up was the referencing to Vedic texts as related to the theoretical PIE religion/mythology. Vedic texts cannot be linked Indo-Aryan, and therefore Indo-European peoples&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Kenneth. &quot;Have Aryans been identified in the prehistorical skeletal record from South Asia? Biological anthropology and concepts of ancient races.&quot;Indian Philology and South Asian Studies. Volume I. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;. Vedic texts are known to come from an oral tradition, however no one can specifically pin-point when they developed; it is thought to be no earlier than 1,500 BCE. &lt;ref&gt; Shaffer, Jim G.. &quot;The Indo-Ayran Invasions: Cultural Myth and Archaeological Reality.&quot;Indian Philology and South Asian Studies. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this oral tradition the Vedas were not written down until 100 BCE&lt;ref&gt;For the possibility of written texts during the first century BCE see: Witzel, Michael, &quot;Vedas and Upaniṣads&quot;, in: Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Malden, MA: Blackwell, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;. This accompanied with the fact that there are no group of peoples or cultures that we can look at in prehistoric South Asia, including the Indus, Painted Greyware Period, etc. &lt;ref&gt; this comes from both: Shaffer, Jim G.. &quot;The Indo-Ayran Invasions: Cultural Myth and Archaeological Reality.&quot;Indian Philology and South Asian Studies. 1984. | Possehl, Gregory.

I have read up on the [[Indo-Aryan migration]] article, and it goes through exactly what I was saying, even citing both Kennedy and Shaffer that there is absolutely no archeological evidence to support Indo-Aryan invasion, migration, and specifically pointing out the focus on the Rigveda specifically is irrelevant as it is still subject to the exact time frames I had originally discussed. The simple fact that you claim that the Rigveda is &quot;...one of the main sources on which reconstruction of PIE mythology is based&quot; without even offering a citation to show where that idea comes from (certainly no anthropological study I or any others in my field have heard of) just lends to my conclusion.

: It can all be found in the books in the ==References section==. Just place a {{Tl|fact}} tag for the statements you find particularly dubious, and someone will add a cite. You (as an alleged anthropologist) should be familiarised with the term ''[[symbolic culture]]'' which is inherently non-material and can only be reached by mental efforts such as comparative linguistics/mythology/poetics etc. The only thing that is &quot;hypothetical&quot; about IE is the PIE language itself - it is doubtless that all living and dead IE languages share a common ancestor, a language which in isolation &quot;evolved&quot; for a few thousand years. If you suspect that the ethnolinguistic group speaking it could not and did not exhibit a period of common cultural developments (living obvious traces in e.g. mythology, but also customs, social structure etc.), than you must be ''very'' naïve. --[[User:Ivan Štambuk|Ivan Štambuk]] ([[User talk:Ivan Štambuk|talk]]) 17:51, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

&quot;there is absolutely no archeological evidence to support Indo-Aryan migration&quot; -- if you are determined to dismiss all evidence as inconclusive. Did you know there is no archaeological proof for human evolution? That is, if you believe God planted all the fossils in order to test your faith.

Some, of course, may consider the appearance of the [[Gandhara grave culture]] at precisely the spot and precisely the period predicted by Rigvedic philology rather compelling circumstantial evidence. Oh, and the decline and fall of the IVC, and the appearance of chariots at precisely the period predicted by Rigvedic philology. Philology developed at a time, mind you, when neither the Gandhara grave culture nor the IVC were even discovered, making them ''independent'' circumstantial evidence. Of course you can also wave your hands and dismiss archaeology altogether, because archaeological evidence by definition is mute and won't mind. But if you're looking for archaeological evidence it is hard to imagine what more you could want to expect. --[[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|(𒁳)]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:29, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

you are generally correct dab and of course no one -no serious scholar- doubts a migration into India but the decline and 'fall' of the indus valley civilisation is not necessarily connected to the indoaryans [[Special:Contributions/85.74.216.79|85.74.216.79]] ([[User talk:85.74.216.79|talk]]) 10:46, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

well, the causality is open to speculation. Did the Roman empire decline because of the Germanic incursions, or were the Germanic incursions made possible because of the decline of the Roman empire? Declining civilizations and barbarian invasions are two aspects that mutually cause one another. It is difficult to say anything about this in the case of the Roman empire, and it is completely idle speculation in prehistoric instances such as the Kassites or the early Indo-Aryans. --[[User:Dbachmann|dab]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Dbachmann|(𒁳)]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:01, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

== Varuna, Heos, Arun, Ouranos, Dyaeus... ==

Interesting the method of the authors of using linguistic ie ethimologic correspondences among the God names. It is easy to imagine that while some names have continued to indicate the same divine concept as in the case of Dyaeus, Zeus, Jupiter, sometimes there may have been changes in the nature of the God so named and the original position-function may have been taken by another God-name. Varuna-Ouranos may be a case in point. The Greeks considered Ouranos the father of the universe using the same ethimos of Varuna which in their language had come to mean Heaven. On the other hand Varuna is the God of the Sky at dawn and this a different ethimos for the same concept as Eos. These are shifts in meaning by the structure remains (almost) the same. Esiod's &quot;Theogony&quot; gives a detailed account of the 'history' of the changes in the Greek pantheon through the succession Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus.[[User:Zanzan1|Zanzan1]] ([[User talk:Zanzan1|talk]]) 12:42, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

==PIE polytheism?==
I am sorry,but the whole chapter about PIE deities is a rubbish. According to a therory which alone satisfying me, Proto-Indo-European were not polytheists, simply because - in opposition to popular belief - polytheism is not common, it forms only in a high level of civilization. A neolythic culture could create only polydoxy, more primitive form of cult without concept of gods, or - at best - with one sky god, anthropomorphic sky, who was Dyēus/Deiwos (these are two forms of the same root).What's more, the polydoxy was still atested in some primitive IE peoples,like Germans in the times of Julius Caesar, Thracians or Celtiberians. The similarities between other gods' names are effect of the origin from the same roots (like *Perkwunas, &quot;thunder&quot; - some peoples devinized thunder aspect of the sky god). Of course, I do not want to delete that chapter, but in the name of neutrality the other theory must be mentioned too.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/83.19.91.30|83.19.91.30]] ([[User talk:83.19.91.30|talk]]) 13:18, 9 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Freyr/Freyja not related to *PriHeh2; Frigg, however, is==
The association of Scandinavian deity names ''Freyr'' and ''Freyja'' with with a PIE *''PriHeh2'' is linguistically unsustainable. These names are from PGmc *''fraw(j)ōn'' (m) and *''frawjōn'' (f) respectively; the latter just a feminine form of the former. These names/terms (with the senses &quot;lord&quot; and &quot;lady&quot;) are related to PIE *''pro''- &quot;forward; first&quot; (&gt; PGmc *''fra''-); the Gmc form suggests a PIE *''prou̯io''-, though there is no particular reason to believe in such a term in the PIE period as opposed to the Gmc form(s) being a later creation. None of this has anything to do with PIE *''PriHeh2'' -- although, in contrast, ON ''Frigg'' (&lt; *PGmc *''Frijjō'') is from PIE *''PriHeh2''.

I believe this is covered satisfactorily at the [[Fraujaz]] and [[Frijjo]] articles.
Or at least it would be, if efforts to clarify this point were not constantly torn down by people for some inscrutable reason of ideology or personal belief.

==Why was chronological information about Chariots removed?==
Chariots were a significant part of some secondary Indo-European expansions, and came to have symbolic importance in some Indo-European speaking societies, but they were invented too late to exist during the &quot;period of Indo-European unity&quot; or the first expansions (when the only wheeled or horse-drawn vehicles that existed were simple basic wooden carts with wheels made of three planks fastened side-by-side).

Why is he listed under the &quot;Dragon or Serpent&quot; portion of mythology?

== Manu and Yemu ==

Has any research been done to try to connect this to the coexistence of humans and Neanderthals? PIE may have been old enough to retain artifacts of their existence. They did share something of a proximity to each other, and doubtlessly the ancestors of the PIE peoples had interacted with the Neanderthals. This must have left traces in legend for quite some time.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/136.223.177.1|136.223.177.1]] ([[User talk:136.223.177.1|talk]]) 15:20, 26 March 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:We can't really trace Indo-European back further than southern Russia of about 5,500 or 6,000 years ago, while current best evidence is that the last Neanderthals lived around Gibraltar or Portugal about 25,000 years ago, so it would appear to be quite a stretch.  People can sometimes retain purely oral folk-memories of things that happened thousands of years ago, but such memories tend to be heavily-genericized and assimilated to common motifs or archetypes.  Considering that Germanic folk-memory transformed Attila the Hun from an oppressive and sinister foreign conqueror to a noble king (Atli/Etzel) in less than a thousand years, I doubt that there's much possibility for accurate or specific folk-memories of Neanderthals over more than 20,000 years...

==Sanskrit/Indic==
They are late derivatives, why are they mentioned in the etymologies? No European language is derived from Sanskrit. It is more of a long-lost descendant of a relative than part of the actual core family. Tocharian should be at its place.[[Special:Contributions/92.252.127.105|92.252.127.105]] ([[User talk:92.252.127.105|talk]]) 18:05, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

:Not too sure what you mean by that -- Sanskrit is not a direct ancestor of any non-Indic language, but the Rig-Veda is often considered to reflect the situation of ca. 1500 B.C., long before most other Indo-European branches are textually attested.  Tocharian is interesting in its own way, but I'm not sure that it has any great light to shed on Proto-Indo-European religion, considering that Tocharian speakers were heavily influenced by Manichaeism and Buddhism by the time that attested Tocharian-language texts were written...

== Correspondence between Greek and PIE Deities ==

The name for &quot;god&quot; in Greek is &quot;theos&quot; or &quot;thea&quot; resp., also derived from PIE *deiwos.
It is possible that the PIE &quot;Goddess of Plenty&quot;, as described in this article, has a Greek equivalent in Ploutos, the god of plenty, son of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture (i. e. fields = wide, flat lands; and harvest = plenty, riches).
