'''Sukkot''' ({{lang-he|סוכות}} or {{Hebrew|סֻכּוֹת}} ''{{transl|he|sukkōt}}'' or ''{{transl|he|sukkos}}'', '''Feast of Booths''', '''Feast of Tabernacles''') is a [[Bible|biblical]] [[holiday]] celebrated on the 15th day of the month of [[Tishrei]] (variously from late September to late October). It is one of the three biblically mandated festivals [[Shalosh regalim]] on which Hebrews were commanded to make a pilgrimage to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. It follows the solemn holiday of [[Yom Kippur]], or the Day of Atonement.

The holiday lasts seven days (eight in the [[diaspora]]). The first day (and second in the [[diaspora]]) is a sabbath-like yom tov when work is forbidden, followed by the intermediate [[Chol Hamoed]] and [[Shemini Atzeret]]. The Hebrew word ''sukkōt'' is the plural of ''[[sukkah]]'', &quot;[[:wikt:booth|booth]] or [[:wikt:tabernacle|tabernacle]]&quot;, which is a walled structure covered with ''skhakh'' (plant material such as leafy tree overgrowth or palm leaves).

The sukkah is intended as a reminiscence of the type of fragile dwellings in which the [[Israelites]] dwelt during their 40 years of travel in the desert after the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Throughout the holiday, meals are eaten inside the sukkah and some people sleep there as well. On each day of the holiday, members of the household recite a blessing over the [[lulav]] and [[etrog]] ([[Four species]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle A. Berlinger (2008) Ritual Interpretation: The Sukkah as Jewish Vernacular Architecture. M.A. Thesis, Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology, Indiana University Bloomington.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the prophet [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], in the [[messianic era]] Sukkot will become a universal festival and all nations will make pilgrimages annually to [[Jerusalem]] to celebrate the feast there.&lt;ref&gt;Zech. {{bibleverse-nb||Zech|14:16-19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sukkah Roofs.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Sukkah]] booths where Jewish families eat their meals throughout the Sukkot holiday]]
Sukkot is agricultural in origin. This is evident from the biblical name &quot;The Feast of Ingathering,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Ex.]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ex|23:16|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ex|34:22|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the ceremonies accompanying it, from the season – &quot;The festival of the seventh month&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezek.]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ezek|45:25|HE}}; [[Book of Nehemiah|Neh.]] {{bibleverse-nb||Neh|8:14|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – and occasion of its celebration: &quot;At the end of the year when you gather in your labors out of the field&quot; (Ex. 23:16);by its designation as &quot;the Feast of the Lord&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lev. {{bibleverse-nb||Lev|23:39|HE}}; [[Book of Judges|Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|21:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply &quot;the Feast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|8:2|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|8:65|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|12:32|HE}}; 2 Chron. {{bibleverse-nb|2|Chron|5:3|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb|2|Chron|7:8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because of its wide attendance, Sukkot became the appropriate time for important state ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Gitlitz &amp; Linda Kay Davidson ''Pilgrimage and the Jews'' (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006), 20-35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses]] instructed the children of Israel to gather for a reading of the Law during Sukkot every seventh year (Deut. 31:10-11). [[Solomon|King Solomon]] dedicated the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on Sukkot (1 Kings 8; 2 Chron. 7). And Sukkot was the first sacred occasion observed after the resumption of sacrifices in Jerusalem following the [[Babylonian captivity]] (Ezra 3:2-4).

In [[Leviticus]], God told Moses to command the people: &quot;On the first day you shall take the product of hadar trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and [[willow]]s of the brook&quot; (Lev. 23:40), and &quot;You shall live in booths seven days; all citizens in Israel shall live in booths, in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelite people live in booths when I brought them out of the land of [[Egypt]]&quot; (Lev. 23:42-43).

==Laws and customs==
Sukkot is a seven day holiday, with the first day celebrated as a full festival with special prayer services and holiday meals. The remaining days are known as [[Chol HaMoed]] (&quot;festival weekdays&quot;). The seventh day of Sukkot is called [[Hoshana Rabbah]] (&quot;Great Hoshana&quot;, referring to the tradition that worshippers in the [[synagogue]] walk around the perimeter of the sanctuary during morning services) and has a special observance of its own. Outside Israel, the first two days are celebrated as full festivals. Throughout the week of Sukkot, meals are eaten in the sukkah and Orthodox Jewish families sleep there, although the requirement is waived in case of rain. Every day, a blessing is recited over the [[Lulav]] and the [[Etrog]]. Observance of Sukkot is detailed in the Book of [[Nehemiah]] and [[Leviticus]] 23:34-44 in the [[Bible]], the [[Mishnah]] (Sukkah 1:1–5:8); the [[Tosefta]] (Sukkah 1:1–4:28); and the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Sukkah 1a–) and Babylonian [[Talmud]] ([[Sukkah (Talmud)|Sukkah]] 2a–56b).

==Building a sukkah==
The sukkah walls can be constructed of any material (wood, canvas, aluminum siding, sheets). The walls can be free-standing or include the sides of a building or porch. The roof must be of organic material, known as [[S'chach]], such as leafy tree overgrowth or palm fronds. It is customary to decorate the interior of the sukkah with hanging decorations, the [[Seven Species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajudaica.com/judaica101/jewish-holidays/sukkot/ |title=Judaica 101: Sukkot |publisher=Ajudaica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==Special prayers==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 14882 Western Wall in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|300px|Sukkot prayers at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]]]]

Prayers during Sukkot include the reading of the Torah every day, reciting the [[Jewish services|Mussaf]] (additional) service after morning prayers, reciting [[Hallel]], and adding special additions to the [[Amidah]] and [[Birkat HaMazon|Grace after Meals]]. In addition, the service includes rituals involving the Four Species. The lulav and etrog are not brought to the synagogue on Shabbat.

;''Hoshanot''
On each day of the festival, worshippers walk around the synagogue carrying their Four species while reciting Psalm 118:25 and special prayers known as ''Hoshanot''. This takes place either after the morning's Torah reading or at the end of Mussaf. This ceremony commemorates the [[Aravah (Sukkot)|willow]] ceremony at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], in which willow branches were piled beside the altar with worshipers parading around the altar reciting prayers.

;''Ushpizin''
During the holiday, some Jews recite the ''ushpizin'' prayer which symbolises the welcoming of seven &quot;exalted guests&quot; into the sukkah. These ''ushpizin'' ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|he|אושפיזין}} 'guests'), represent the seven shepherds of Israel: [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], [[Moses]], [[Aaron]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[David]]. According to tradition, each night a different guest enters the sukkah followed by the other six. Each of the ''ushpizin'' has a unique lesson which teaches the parallels of the spiritual focus of the day on which they visit. A new tradition has arisen among some Jews to invite seven female counterparts to the above shepherds. A number of different lists exist which may include any of the following: [[Sarah]], [[Rebecca]], [[Rachel]], [[Leah]], [[Miriam]], [[Deborah]], [[Esther]], [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]], and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] among others.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Chol HaMoed==
[[File:He wiki sucot.jpg|thumb|250px|Decorations in an Israeli sukkah]]
The second through seventh days of Sukkot (third through seventh days outside Israel) are called [[Chol HaMoed]] ({{lang|he|חול המועד}} - lit. &quot;festival weekdays&quot;). These days are considered by [[halakha]] to be more than regular weekdays but less than festival days. In practice, this means that all activities that are needed for the holiday&amp;mdash;such as buying and preparing food, cleaning the house in honor of the holiday, or traveling to visit other people's sukkot or on family outings&amp;mdash;are permitted by Jewish law. Activities that will interfere with relaxation and enjoyment of the holiday&amp;mdash;such as laundering, mending clothes, engaging in labor-intensive activities&amp;mdash;are not permitted. Observant Jews typically treat Chol HaMoed as a vacation period, eating nicer than usual meals in their sukkah, entertaining guests, visiting other families in their sukkot, and taking family outings. Many synagogues and Jewish centers also offer events and meals in their sukkot during this time to foster community and goodwill.

On the [[Shabbat]] which falls during the week of Sukkot (or in the event when the first day of Sukkot is on Shabbat), the [[Ecclesiastes|Book of Ecclesiastes]] is read during morning [[synagogue]] services in Israel. (Diaspora communities read it the following Shabbat). This Book's emphasis on the ephemeralness of life (&quot;Vanity of vanities, all is vanity...&quot;) echoes the theme of the sukkah, while its emphasis on death reflects the time of year in which Sukkot occurs (the &quot;autumn&quot; of life). The second-to-last verse reinforces the message that adherence to God and His [[Torah]] is the only worthwhile pursuit. [[Ecclesiastes|Ecclesiastes 12:13,14]]

==Hakhel==
{{Main|Hakhel}}
In the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], all Jewish men, women, and children on pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]] for the festival would gather in the Temple courtyard on the first day of Chol HaMoed Sukkot to hear the Jewish king read selections from the [[Torah]]. This ceremony, which was mandated in [[Deuteronomy]] 31:10-13, was held every seven years, in the year following the [[Shmita]] (Sabbatical) year. This ceremony was discontinued after the destruction of the Temple, but it has been revived in Israel on a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=18388 |title=Hakhel Ceremony To Be Held in Jerusalem on 10/4 |publisher=Jewishfederations.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simchat Beit HaShoevah==
During the Intermediate days of Sukkot, gatherings of music and dance, known as ''[[Simchat Beit HaShoeivah]]'', take place. This commemorates the Water Libation Ceremony in which water was carried up the [[Jerusalem pilgrim road]] from the [[Pool of Siloam]] to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

==Hoshana Rabbah==
The seventh day of Sukkot is known as [[Hoshana Rabbah]], meaning the &quot;Great Supplication&quot;. This day is marked by a special service in which seven circuits are made by worshippers holding their Four species, reciting [[Psalms|Psalm]] 118:25 with additional prayers. In addition, a bundle of five [[Aravah (Sukkot)|willow branches]] are beaten on the ground.

==Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah==
The holiday immediately following Sukkot is known as [[Shemini Atzeret]] (lit. &quot;Eighth [Day] of Assembly&quot;). Shemini Atzeret is viewed as a separate holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Cf [[Talmud]], [[Rosh Hashanah (Talmud)|Tractate Rosh Hashanah]] 4b, for rare cases where it is viewed as one.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Diaspora]] a second additional holiday, [[Simchat Torah]] (lit. &quot;Joy of the Torah&quot;) is celebrated. In the [[Land of Israel]], Simchat Torah is celebrated on Shemini Atzeret. On Shemini Atzeret the sukkah is left and meals are eaten inside the house. Outside of Israel, many eat in the sukkah without making the blessing. The sukkah is not used on Simchat Torah. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
