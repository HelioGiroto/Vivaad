Ayyavazhi is centered on the life and preachings of [[Ayya Vaikundar]]; its ideas and philosophy are based on the holy texts ''[[Akilattirattu Ammanai]]'' and ''[[Arul Nool]]''. Accordingly, Vaikundar was the [[Avatar|Purna avatar]] of [[Narayana]]. Ayyavazhi shares many ideas with Hinduism in its mythology and practice, but differs considerably in its concepts of [[good and evil]] and [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', pp. 111–113,&lt;/ref&gt; Ayyavazhi is classified as a dharmic belief because of its central focus on dharma.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi first came to public attention in the 19th century as a Hindu sect.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. R. Ponnu, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Vaikundar's activities and the growing number of followers caused a reformation and revolution in 19th century [[Travancore]]an&lt;ref&gt;Dr. R. Ponnu, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and Struggle for Social Equality in South India, p. 63, ''&quot;The religious reform of Sri Vaikunda Swamigal left an everlasting influence on South Travancorean society.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tamil people|Tamil society]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; surprising the feudal social system of South India.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. R. Ponnu, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and Struggle for Social Equality in South India, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; It also triggers a number of reform movements including those of [[Narayana Guru]],&lt;ref name= &quot;Selvister:First Reform Movement&quot; /&gt; [[Vallalar]]&lt;ref name= &quot;Ponnu:First Reform Movement&quot; /&gt; etc.

Though Ayyavazhi followers are spread across India,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dina Malar]]''(Leading Tamil News paper), ''Nagercoil Edition'', 4/3/2005 p. 12: &quot;எனேவ இன்று அய்யா வைகுண்டசாமி வழிபாட்டு ஆலயங்கள் இந்தியா முழுவதும் வேராயிரம் பெற்ற விழுதுகளாய் படந்து ஆறாயிரத்துக்கு மேல் தோன்றி வளர்ந்து வருகிறது&quot; Translated to &quot;So today these worship centers of Vaikunda Sami is spread ''across India'' and growing with more than 6000 of them&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Poulose:Spread of Ayyavazhi&quot;&gt;C.

''[[Ayya]]{{disambiguation needed|date=June 2012}}'' in Tamil means 'Father'&lt;ref&gt;Pon.T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and ''vazhi'', 'the pathway' ; The simple derivative in the sense is '' 'The Pathway of (or) towards Father' ''. Apart, due to the diverse [[synonymous]] versions for the phrase in Tamil, it also leads to various other theories.&lt;ref name= &quot;Ayyavazhi belief system&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

Ayyavazhi began to be noticed initially by the large number of people gathering to worship Vaikundar (known historically as &quot;Mudisoodum Perumal&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sociology of Ayyavazhi&quot; /&gt; (1809 [[Common Era|CE]]&amp;nbsp;–  1851 CE)&lt;ref&gt;[[Vaikundar]] is a historical as well as mythical figure. The historical Vaikundar ''(often referred to as 'Vaikunta Swami')'' refers to a person who lived between 1809 CE&amp;nbsp;–  1851 CE The [[Akilam]] myth says that Vaikundar was the God incarnate who incarnates in the body of ' ''[[Sampooranathevan]]'' ' alias '' 'Muthukutty' '' in 1833 CE and lived to 1851 CE So Akilam, [[Sampooranathevan]] lived between 1809 CE and 1833 CE and Vaikundar then incarnated in the body of Mudisoodum Perumal ([[Sampooranathevan]]), living from 1833 CE to 1851 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Swamithoppe|Poovandanthoppe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By the middle of 19th century, Ayyavazhi had come to be recognised as a separate religion with deep roots in the regions of South [[Travancore]] and South [[Tirunelveli]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' Chapter 5, p. 91: ''&quot;By the middle of the nineteenth century, AV (abbreviation of Ayyavazhi) had expanded into a recognisable religious phenomenon, making its presence felt in South Tiruvitankur (Travancore) and in the southern parts of Tirunelveli.

While the original text is damaged, the daughter versions such as the  ''Swamithope'' version, the ''Kottangadu'' version as well as the ''Panchalankurichi'' versions, are the earliest existing palm-leaf versions of Akilam.&lt;ref name = &quot;Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum: Akilam versions&quot;/&gt; Other released versions includes the [[Sentratisai Ventraperumal version|Sentrathisai Ventraperumal]], the [[Kalai Ilakkiya Peravai version|Kalai Ilakkiya Peravai]], the [[Vivekanandan Version|Vivekanandan]], the highly criticised [[Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam Version|VTV]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum: Akilam versions&quot;&gt;''N.

It is written in poetic [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in a [[ballad]] form, and is composed with a unique literal-style with two sub-genres, ''Viruttam'' and ''Natai'' throughout.

[[File:Location of Pancha Pathi.png|thumb|left|[[Pancha pathi]] – Location map]]
To the Ayyavazhi devotees, there are seven holy places, called [[Pathi]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;''Nadar Kulatthil Narayanar Avatara&quot;&gt;R.Shanmugam, ''Nadar Kulatthil Narayanar Avataram'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Pancha pathi]]s being the most important.&lt;ref&gt;G.

The five Pancha pathi are:
1. the [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope Pathi]], the venue of the great [[Tavam of Vaikundar|Tavam]] and the religion's headquarters.
2. [[Ambala Pathi]], where Vaikundar joined six of the Seven Deities unto himself.
3. [[Mutta Pathi]], the venue of the Second and Third [[Vinchai]]s.
4. [[Thamaraikulam Pathi]], where the [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] was written down.
5. [[Poo Pathi]], where Ayya unified the Earth goddess [[Bhuma Devi|Poomadanthai]] to himself by symbolic marriage.

[[Vakaippathi]], though not included in the [[Pancha pathi]]s by the headquarters, is still considered as a Pathi but with lesser importance.&lt;ref&gt;N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, ''Ayya Vaikuntar the light of the world'', Chapter 6 (Thuvayal Panthy), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, p. 117 ''&quot; However, there is also another list which includes Vakaipati in tuvaiyal tavacu's place &quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; There is disagreement among followers of Ayyavazhi regarding the holiness of some other Pathis, such as [[Marunthuvazh Malai|Vaikunda Pathi]] and [[Avatharappathi|Avathara Pathi]]. The list of Pathis announced by the headquarters of Ayyavazhi does not include these Pathis.&lt;ref&gt;N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, ''Ayya Vaikuntar the light of the world'', Chapter 8, p. 41 (Panchappathi)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
{{Main|Ayyavazhi symbolism}}
[[File:Ayyavazhi Sahasrara.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sahasrara]], symbolised in Ayyavazhi as '' 'Lotus carrying Namam' '']]
The symbol of Ayyavazhi is a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] carrying a flame-shaped white ''[[Namam]]''.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lotus with Namam&quot;&gt;Tha. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled ''[[Sahasrara]]'' (in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], ''Ladam''), while the Namam represents the ''Aanma Jyothi'' or ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]''.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lotus with Namam&quot; /&gt; Both of the Ayyavazhi scriptures&lt;ref&gt;Akilam15:39 &quot;Petti ceelai Uduthu Periya ''Thirunama'' Pottumittu&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram, First Act. Source: N. Vivekanandan's Arul Nool – Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; refer to [[Thirunamam]] (the &quot;flame shaped symbol&quot; present in the top of the Lotus in the Ayyavazhi symbol), but not to the lotus directly. The symbol is the ideological summary of Akilam-based philosophy. This symbol has been in use since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;In the abcense of written references, there is a painting at the residence of Bala Prajapathi Adikalar which was considered older, but is not less than 50 years. There are also oral traditions which suggests the same age for this symbol.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythical narration in akilam about the eight [[yuga]]s is often viewed philosophically as a reference to eight [[chakra]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yugas as Chakras&quot;&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. (Additional) XII–XIII &quot; Athara thana vilakka attavanai &quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Neetiya Yukam]], is [[Bindu]] and the final state, [[Dharma Yukam]], is Sahasrara, or absolute bliss. In this series, the energy of [[consciousness]] (Namam) of oneself is invoked, rising from Bindu ([[Neetiya Yukam]]) to the final Sahasrara (Dharma Yukam). This lotus, the highest spiritual center of enlightenment is for experiencing the absolute &quot;bliss&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam (Sahasrara) is [[Ekam]], which is a part of Vaikundar a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception, or a manifestation of the supreme absolute.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lotus with Namam&quot; /&gt; Thus Ayyavazhi's symbol is derived from Akilam. The symbol, &quot;Lotus with Thirunamam&quot;, shows &quot;Vaikundar's experienced in Sahasrara.&quot;
[[File:Thiru Nizhal Thangal of Attoor.jpg|thumb|right| A [[Nizhal Thangal (Attoor)|Nizhal Thangal]] near [[Thiruvattar]] built with [[Sahasrara]] architecture]]
In certain [[Hindu]] texts the Sahasrara chakra has 1000 petals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/Sahasrara.htm www.kheper.net |title= [[Sahasrara]] [[Chakra]]|accessdate=3 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in [[Ayyavazhi symbolism]], Saharara has 1008 petals. In Ayyavazhi, there is no scriptural authority indicating the importance of 1000, but the number 1008 is commonly mentioned. Also, the incarnation year of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. (Malayalam Era). Backing these scriptural identities, the 1008-petal lotus is followed in [[Ayyavazhi symbolism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yugas as Chakras&quot; /&gt; ''Sahasrara'' is symbolised as a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] without a stem.

Ayyavazhi architecture was developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals, where the inverted lotus flower of ''Sahasrara'' is used to cover the roof.&lt;ref&gt;See this Image[[:Image:Nelli Nintra Vilai Thangal.png]], a Nizhal Thangal constructed in this architectural manner near Marthandam, [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;/ref&gt; The lotus may also represent the [[Human heart|heart]] and the flame shape (Thirunamam), the divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Pulavar. R. Shanmugam's, (2000), ''Nadar Kulathil Narayanar Avatharam'', Nadar Kulatheebam Publications, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;
Ayyavazhi has used other symbols including [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] ' ''Triple Namam'' '(not used currently), and [[Conch]].

==Teachings and impact==
{{Main|Teachings and impacts of Ayyavazhi}}
The majority of Ayyavazhi's key teachings can be found in the book Akilattirattu Ammanai and other teachings are collated from various books written by unknown authors, whose works feature in the Arul Nool.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Arul Nool Moolamum Uraiyum'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Like Dharma, the other teachings of Ayyavazhi are twofold, sociological and mystical. The [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings are devoted to revealing divine knowledge, while social teachings are primarily concerned with eliminating inequality and discrimination in society. The teachings encourage a positive relationship with God, as opposed to one based on fear. Followers are encouraged to refer to God as ''Ayya'', &quot;dear father&quot;, to strengthen their intimacy and affection towards God.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. R. Ponnu, ''Ayya Vaikundar Ore Avatharam'', pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ekam JPEG.jpg|thumb|left|Evolution of [[Ekam]], the source of whole [[existence]] (till [[Kali Yuga]])]]
Ayyavazhi mystics focus on supreme oneness.&lt;ref&gt;''A. Ari Sundara Mani'', ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; Among its variations, the theology always maintains this focus on oneness. The [[Kali (demon)|evil of Kali]] blocks the ultimate or supreme [[henosis|oneness]] prevailing between individual souls and the universe, creating among them a false sense of [[Self (spirituality)|individuality]] and of [[Ego (spirituality)|extreme pride]]. This erroneous view causes the apparent sense of separation from the oneness and motivates against it.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Ekam—the &quot;over-soul&quot; or the supreme soul—is identified as the whole of existence, changeless in nature and ubiquity. This is &quot;one which undergoes different changes with respect to [[space and time]]&quot; because of the evil force [[Maya (illusion)|maya]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Ari Sundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', pp. 103–121&lt;/ref&gt;

All of creation evolved from this Ekam, the supreme consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; All the qualities of Ekam are within each soul, and evolve from it. Each and every individual soul is a reflection or mirror of the absolute Supreme, Ekam,&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides the textual basis and metaphor for the [[Ayyavazhi_rituals#Worship_in_front_of_a_mirror|mirror's role in Ayyavazhi worship]]. Human and all other souls are restricted and limited by the evil of Kali. This is why individual souls are not able to attain supreme bliss, and so are secondary to Ekam. Once a soul overcomes the influence of maya, it becomes one with Ekam. Its individuality is gone, and thereby it is Ekam.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, this supreme consciousness is personified as [[Paramatma]] (over-soul) by which, God is the &quot;Husband&quot;, while all other souls are his &quot;consorts&quot;,&lt;ref name= &quot;Unifying souls as Thirukkalyana Ikanai&quot; &gt;Ari Sundara Mani, Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayan Urai, p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; symbolised by [[Thirukkalyana Ekanai]], where Vaikundar marries the individual souls.&lt;ref name= &quot;Unifying souls as Thirukkalyana Ikanai&quot; /&gt; Also, the Ayyavazhi philosophy applies a common formula for the [[Creation myth|creation]] of [[human beings]] and the rest of the universe. Thus whatever exists externally to human beings exists also internally.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnumani, ''Ucchippadippu'', pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi clearly and explicitly condemns the caste based inequalities in its social teachings.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', Chapter 5, p. 114 ''&quot; Other verses from Akilattirattu like, 'throw the eighteen castes and the demons into the mountain and the sea', 'do not discriminate between the powerful and powerless', 'the caste would disappear by itself', etc., point to the fact of a considerable indoctrination against the inequalities of Castes.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; It heavily criticises the caste discrimination rather than the 'Caste system' itself.
From its inception, Ayyavazhi has also served as an engine of social reform, particularly in the area of Travancore, which was previously noted for its unusually strong caste system.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ward and Conner, Geographical and Statistical Memoir, p. 133; V. Nagam Aiya, The Travancore State Manual, Volume-2, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In this contest, the mingling of castes in Ayyavazhi centers was a vital element in the transformation of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Cf. Ponneelan'', ''Vaikunta Cuvamiyum Avar Kalamum'', Mimeograph note, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna Nathan's, ''Ayyaa vaikuNdarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum'' (Tamil), Chapter 4, p. 83: &quot;இதற்கு ஆதாரமாக அய்யா வைகுண்டரைத் தெய்வமாக ஏற்றுக்கொண்ட சுமார் 8000 – க்கும் மேற்பட்ட அய்யாவழிப் பதிகள் தமிழ்நாடு மற்றும் கேரளப்பகுதிகளில் இயங்குவதைக் கூறலாம்.&quot; (This citation is from a Tamil Wikipedia article)&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) of the mid-19th century also speak of ''Nizhal Thangals''.&lt;ref&gt;From the following reports: ''James Town Mission District'' for 1863, ''Neyoor Mission District'' for 1869, ''Santhapuram Mission District'' for 1858, ''Nagercoil Mission District'' for 1864, from the ARTDC for the respective years.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ayyavazhi is not centrally organised, ''Swamithope pathi'' serves as the religious headquarters for all. The ''Pathi''s earn more importance among the worship centers.&lt;ref name =&quot;Worship Centers&quot; /&gt;

The seven ''[[Pathi]]''s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dr. Poulose's book&quot; /&gt; obtain their significance from the fact that Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centers of worship.&lt;ref name =&quot;Worship Centers&quot; /&gt; The ''Swamithope pathi'', though considered the religion's headquarters, does not officially control the rest of the religious centers. All ''Pathis'', except itself, are managed by independent committees.&lt;ref&gt;N. Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, ''Ayya Vaikuntar – The Light of the World'', pp. 41–44&lt;/ref&gt; The five ''Pathis'' known as [[Pancha pathi]] are considered foremost among Pathis.

[[Nizhal Thangal]]s, compared with ''Pathis'', are simple small structures built for worship and for learning the teachings of Vaikundar. They also served as centers of school education during the early days.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikundacuvamikal Valvum Valikattalum'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Food and shelter are offered to the needy in these centres.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sarvesvaran, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamikal – A Forgotten Social Reformer'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were established when Vaikundar was alive. Among them Arul Nool, specifies seven Thangals,&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' Chapter 5, p. 118. Vaikuntacami is said to have established seven of these nilaltankalkal at Chettykudiyirrupu, Agastisvaram, Palur, Chundavilai, Vadalivilai, Kadampankulam and Pampankulam.&lt;/ref&gt; and these are considered primary over the others. Today, charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'' Chapter 5, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

These centers emerged as the abode of Dharma.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Dharma'' (1985), Published by 'Center for the Study of World Religions', Dharmaram College, Bangalore.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizhal Thangals form an important institution in the socio-religious life of the people of Ayyavazhi. Panividai may be conducted up to three times daily, but all worship centers provide [[Panividai]] at least once daily.

==Ethics==
[[File:Flag mast of Swamithoppe.jpg|170px|thumb|right|The flag mast of [[Swamithoppe]] with Ayyavazhi symbol at the top]]
{{Main|Ayyavazhi ethics}}
The ethics of Ayyavazhi, integrated with the meta-narrative mythology, are found throughout the primary scripture, ''Akilattirattu Ammanai''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayyavazhi ethics&quot;&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', Chapter 5, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as &quot;told by God&quot; at several places at different situations to lesser god-heads, [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], [[saint]]s, etc. when ever asked by them.

[[Neetham]] is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, [[Vinchai to Vaikundar|Vinchai]] is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first ''Vinchai of Tiruchendur'' forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayyavazhi ethics&quot; /&gt;

To an extent, the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi]] are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and &quot;attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness&quot; in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] also.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dharma for devas&quot; &gt;Mani Bharathi, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Vilakka Urai (Part – 2)''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dharma for devas&quot; /&gt; Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force [[kalimayai]] with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] rules the minds of people.

Arul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The [[Sivakanta Athikarappatthiram|Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram]] here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially [[circumambulation]]s, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed related to immoral thinking.

==Religious studies==
{{Main|Ayyavazhi religious studies}}
[[File:Tamarai-Namam glossy.png|thumb|left|The Holy [[Symbol of Ayyavazhi]]]]
It is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the [[Hindu scriptures]]. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.&lt;ref name=&quot;G. Patrick, p.119&quot;&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Religious Phenomenon of Ayya Vali', p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.

The philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on [[Ayyavazhi theology]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Sundaram Swamigal and K. Ponnu Mani, ''Ayya Vaikunta Nathar Jeevacharithram'', pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref name= &quot;Hindu keys to Akilam&quot;&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanaiyil Vaikunda Suvami Sampooranathevana?'', pp.10–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the 96 [[tatvas]] are understood, then the [[Kaliyan]] is understood. Therefore theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the [[Hindu]] ideas and concepts.&lt;ref name= &quot;Hindu keys to Akilam&quot; /&gt; Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.

On [[myth]]ical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main [[Hindu mythology|mythology of Hinduism]], including [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], Kantha Purana and [[Vishnu Purana]], but with limited details.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate [[Hindu scriptures]] that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.151.&lt;/ref&gt; Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; some are regenerated,&lt;ref name=&quot;G. Patrick, p.119&quot;/&gt; while others are rejected.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'', 'The Social Discourse of Ayya Vali', pp.130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures&quot; /&gt; But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayyavazhi and Hindu scriptures&quot;&gt;''Arisundara Mani'', Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, p. (additional) v. ''(To be noted, Whole contents of this book is written including the heavy details to 'mere noted' Akilam concepts from Hindu scriptures.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==God==
[[File:The Evolution of Ekam.png|thumb|right|The Evolution – [[Ekam]] to [[Vaikundar]]]]
{{Main|Ayyavazhi theology}}
The theology of Ayyavazhi differs considerably from other [[monism|monistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;V.T. Chellam, Thamizaka Varalarum Panpadum, Chapter 12, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matters as an [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, [[Infinity|infinite]], genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;absolute&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;M. Winslow (1869), ''A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary'', American Mission Press ([[Madras]]), ISBN 81-206-0001-0, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the whole which exists&quot;&lt;ref&gt;V.T. Ramasupramaniyam, ''Thirumagal Thamizhagarathi'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the incomparable&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''Narmadavin Thamizh Agarathi'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.

Narrating through mythology, The ''Sivam'' and the ''Sakthi'' are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The ''Natham''(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from [[Akilam thirteen]] says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is [[Creation myth|created]] by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more [[monotheism|monotheistic]] rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar. Vaikundar is a [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|turine power]] who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.

In Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation, was fragmented into six and each fragments took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu roles throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called ''Kalimayai'' (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a way&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 36, &quot;Kroni is nothing but a subtle revelation of spiritual ignorance.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that contrasts the [[Dualism|dualistic]] view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] definition to Ayyavazhi theology.

==Festivals and rituals==
[[File:Kodiyetru Thirunal.jpg|thumb|left|The flag hoisting fest during [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in [[Swamithope pathi]].]]
{{Main|Ayyavazhi festivals|Ayyavazhi rituals}}
There are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi. The [[Ayya Vaikunda Avataram]] is celebrated on the twentieth day of the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil]] month ''Masi'' (March – April). This is the only Ayyavazhi festival to be celebrated as per the [[Solar calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Tha. Krishna Nathan, ''Ayyaa vaikundarin vaazvum sinthanaiyum'', Chapter 4, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass procession conducted on this day from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithoppe]] is a popular one in this part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dinamalar.com/2007mar05/district/kanyakumari.asp#3%20(Dinamalar)|title= Dina Malar|accessdate=5 March 2007 |format= Kanyakumari District|work=Ayya Vaikundar Avathara Dina Vizha}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thiru Edu-Vasippu]] is a festival of seventeen days celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November–December).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ayyavazhi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=30|title= www.ayyavazhi.org|accessdate=11 November 2007 |format= Festivals|work=Thiru Edu Vasippu

Apart from this, there is a tri-yearly celebration of [[Kodiyettru Thirunal]] in Swamithope. Another unique feature is the celebration of every day as a festival in Swamithope,(exclusive to Swamithope) called as '' 'Nitham Thirunal' ''.&lt;ref&gt;Tha. Krishna Nathan, ''Ayyaa vaikundarin vazhvum sinthanaiyum'', Chapter 4, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the philosophical concepts and mythology, the rituals of Ayyavazhi evolved in their own way. Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the caste-based inequalities prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as '' 'Anna Dharmam' '', physical as well as spiritual [[cleanliness]] through Thuvayal Thavasu,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=zBa2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sami+thope&amp;dq=Sami+thope&amp;pgis=1 The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society]'' (1986), Published by 'Mythic Society', Bangalore, India, v.77 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; eliminating untouchability through Thottunamam, self-respect and courage through headgear,&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishnanathan's Ayyavazhi practices&quot; &gt;''T. Krishnanathan'', ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and unifying various castes through Muthirikkinaru.&lt;ref&gt;Akilathirattu p. 252: &quot;the eighteen castes gathered in one place and bathed from the same well.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Churul.jpg|thumb|right|A '' 'churul' '' prepared to be offered for Panividai]]
But they too reveal, however, high philosophical ideas preached in a ritual language. The [[Muthirikkinaru]] and Thirunamam are treated religiously as if the ''Patham'' and ''Namam'' of them have the power to heal all sorts of mental&lt;ref&gt;''N. Amalan'', ''Ayya Vaikundar Punitha Varalaru'', Akilam Publications, 86–87: &quot;முத்திரிபுகளை (மும்மலம்) போக்க முத்திரிக்கிணற்றில் பதம் விட்டுக்கொள்ள வேண்டும்&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as physical illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishnanathan's Ayyavazhi practices&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[London Missionary Society|LMS]] Report for the year ''1847'', pp. 88–89: ''&quot;They take no medicine; but rub ashes on the forehead and drink cold water as the cure for all their diseases.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; Thuvayal thavasu is suggested as a training to reach the ultimate aim of Dharma Yukam.&lt;ref&gt;''A. Ari Sundaramani'', ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayana Urai'', p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ayyavazhi religious practices#Wearing of headgear during worship|use of the crown]] reveals that &quot;all are kings&quot;, visualising an ideology similar to ''advaita''. Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the [[Ayyavazhi rituals#A distinct language|alternative phrases]] religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.

==Inclusiveness and exclusivity==
{{Main|Inclusiveness and exclusivity in Ayyavazhi}}
The formula of [[Inclusivism|inclusiveness]] and [[exclusivity]], as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.
[[File:Ten Incarnation door.jpg|thumb|left|The door of [[Swamithoppe]] [[Palliyarai]] with the [[Dashavatara|ten avatars of Vishnu]] carved on it]]
Ayyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of [[Allah]] and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gods in Ayyavazhi&quot;&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp. 61–65.&lt;/ref&gt; It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gods in Ayyavazhi&quot; /&gt; But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|cruel nature of his boons]], for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar, and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scriptures&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Chapter 3, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda [[Avatar]], Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in [[Akilam thirteen]] which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana,&lt;ref name = &quot;Gods in Ayyavazhi&quot; /&gt; but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the [[Books of the Bible|Bible composition]]. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is &quot;it was created with the intention of man and not that of God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;He created a Veda (scripture) of his own intention&quot;. – Akilam5:571&lt;/ref&gt; In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like '' 'Accept God; Reject religion' ''.&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'' p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyavazhi accepts various [[incarnation]]s in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' ''Hindu'' ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam 12:151 – &quot;Poorana Vetha Purana mun akamangkal&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|boon]] they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only '' 'Book of Perfection' ''. By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only [[Ayyavazhi scriptures|its own]]. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost ''Kali mayai'' (evil of Kali).&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp. 114 -116.&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.&lt;ref name= &quot;Ayyavazhi belief system&quot; /&gt;

==Mythology==
[[File:Ayyavali Vishnu.PNG|thumb|right|[[Narayana]], [[Ayyavazhi Trinity#The Spirit|The Father]]]]
{{Main|Ayyavazhi mythology}}
The mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present and a future – meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'' Chapter 6, p. 151, &quot;A reading of the mythography of AV makes explicit the fact that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present, and a future – constructed by weaving together of empirical facts as well as mythical accounts.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely [[The Santror|Santror]], Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with [[Hindu mythology]]. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern agency'' Chapter 6, p. 151, &quot;It is fitting to analyse and see how these basic concepts have been woven together to give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

It is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of [[Kroni]] through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Introduction, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, [[Kaliyan]], is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam8:Thiru Nadana Ula −6th&amp;11th Venpaas (a species of verse).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of [[Kroni]]. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Zecharia (1826–1906), one of the prominent pastors of the London Mission Society, testifies to the existence of this well in his book titled ''The London Missionary Society in South Travancore 1805–1855, Nagercoil: LMS Press, 1897, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing of Headgear during worship,&lt;ref&gt;M.S.S. Pandiyan, ''Meanings of 'Colonialism and 'Nationalism'' p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Thuvayal Thavasu&lt;ref&gt;LMS Report for 1838, p. 71 says &quot;About 70 families of this sect, having subsequently established a community of goods, removed under the guidance of a man of some influence to a part of the seashore of Tinnevelly, where they erected huts, performed frequent ablutions, and often assembled to hear the dreams and vision of their leader and to witness the miracles he was said to perform.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; all were noted in history.

Though there are quotes in Arul Nool to accredit the ten [[Avatars of Vishnu]], it seems that they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations ''(as in the table)''. It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only [[Narasimha]], Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.

==Santror and Dharma yukam==
[[File:Borassus shape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borassus|Palmyra]], the tree cursed to provide celestial [[nectar]] in the form of Palm-juice for [[The Santror|Santror]] until the closure of [[Kaliyuga]].]]
{{Main|The Santror|Dharma Yukam}}
[[The Santror]] is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 151 &quot;Canror (Santror) is a name that stands for a people who are the subject of the religious vision of AV (Ayyavazhi)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; There is both a religious and a social category in its connotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chanar&quot;&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; In the social sense, it is believed that the term Santror fits rightly to the early &quot;Chanars&quot;, who were called by the Arabs as &quot;Al Hind&quot;, and known in biblical times as the &quot;People of Five Rivers&quot;; they are now scattered with more than 250 branches throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nadar.kuttyjapan.com/nadar-who-are-they.asp|title= Nadar Community – Who Are they

Ponnu, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Socil Equality in South India'', p. 23, line 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and supreme knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 3, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; giving an inclusive character and universal reach. Historians account that in ancient dravidian cultures, zealous devotees of God were called as 'Chanars'.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, ''Akilathirattu'', Chapter 3, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; A quote from Akilam too reads, &quot;Chanars (Santror) are those who have the ability to see 'the invisible' constantly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chanar&quot; /&gt;

The Santror are given a historical background in Ayyavazhi mythology as seven boys who were made to born in the mythical garden [[Ayotha Amirtha Gangai|Ayodha Amirtha Vanam]] ''(supposed to be between present-day [[Srirangam]], Tamil Nadu and Triconamalee, [[Srilanka]])'' by using the seven seeds from seven upper worlds, by [[Thirumal]], to the seven virgins. Theologians interpret that these 'Seven boys' refer to the ancestors of the whole human race, and hence the term &quot;Santror&quot; refers to the entire [[human race]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 3, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage started at the end phase of [[Dvapara Yuga|Dvapara Yukam]] and continued through the Kali Yukam into the Dharma Yukam. It is believed that Kali is being destroyed continuously by the activities of the Santror in the Path of Vaikundar, and so the Dharma Yukam unfolds eventually. In this sense they have a considerable roll in the destruction of Kali, the foremost evil.

The Ayyavazhi proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of [[Dharma Yukam]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, &quot;AV, having emerged in a context of distress, proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of tarmayukam.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the belief is that [[Ayya Vaikundar]] had come to establish and rule as the everlasting king&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, p. 109 says, &quot;Akilattirattu begins its narration by stating that the account contained in it is the story of God coming into this kaliyukam to transform it into tarmayukam and to rule over it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; over the Dharma Yukam in the place of [[Kali Yukam]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick's Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 159 says, &quot;The core of the proposal was that Vaikuntacami had come to establish and rule over a tarmayukam in the place of the kaliyukam.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; after sentencing Kroni to hell by a final judgment from the Lion-throne of ''Dwaraka pathi'', the rising mythical landmass (which was sunken at the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]] by [[Krishna]]) located south east of present-day Kanyakumari.&lt;ref&gt;Sm. Ramasamy, Geomatics in Tsunami, p. 04, &quot;Also in Ayyavazhi mythology the 'Akilathirattu Ammanai'  tells about a sunken land at about 152 miles sout or south-east to kanyakumari with 16008 streets.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharma Yukam is narrated as beyond the limits of time and space.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 6, p. 161, &quot;Yet another point to be taken note of in the symbolic vision of AV is its conception of time. AV gives a list of seven aeons, and, at the end of it, postulates a tarmayukam that is to exist eternally&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to [[Moksha]]—the personal liberation, and to the state of 'Oneness' too.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Sundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, pp. 657–658&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mani Bharathi, Akilathirattu Vilakka Urai (Part 2), pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with Hinduism==
[[File:Kailash Tibet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Kailash|Kailash]], where the [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|boons]] were offered to [[Kaliyan]] by [[Shiva|Siva]]]]
{{Main|Ayyavazhi and Hinduism}}
The Hindu and Ayyavazhi ideologies are closely tied to each other. The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other [[Hindu scriptures]] remain with divinity. Each of the [[Hindu gods|gods]] referred to in scriptures (Hindu) also remain with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Kaliyan was a part of the mundane primordial manifestation who spread [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] or illusion upon the existing scriptures and Devas.&lt;ref&gt;T. Kirushnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] and are unhelpful.

The reason, as stated in [[Akilam]] for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of [[Dwapara Yuga]] there in [[Mount Kailash|Kailash]], Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, he who had the responsibility to destroy the Kaliyan as per the previous deeds.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundar Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; So [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Brahma]] surrendered all their powers to Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to [[Shaivism]], where Siva is supreme to all. Now onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Here the ideology changes similar to that of [[Vaishnavism]]. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of [[Kali Yuga]] until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.
[[File:Kumbas is Swamithope.PNG|thumb|right|The '' 'Tri-Kumbas' '' over the [[Swamithope pathi|Swamithope]] [[Palliyarai]], symbolizing the presence of [[Hindu trinity|Trinity]] within [[Ayya Vaikundar|Ayya]], revealing his supremacy.]]
During the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had [[Boons offered to Kaliyan|bought as boon]] the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by [[Lakshmi]] and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt;

And from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and [[Brahma]] therefore form a part within Vaikundar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar&quot; &gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology about [[Trimurthi]] (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through [[Vinchai]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arisundara mani Supremacy of Vaikundar&quot; /&gt; After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal power&lt;ref&gt;A. Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammani Parayan Urai'', pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akilathirattu parts&quot; &gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akilathirattu parts&quot; /&gt; So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;N. Vivekanandan, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Moolamum Uraiyum'', Part 1, p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; and so the [[Ayyavazhi Dharma|Dharma]] was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.

==Phenomenology==
{{Main|Ayyavazhi phenomenology}}

''[[Akilam]]'' points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Akilam8:Thiruvasakam – 1 (As per Akilam this Thiruvasakam is written down by Sarasvathi because the previous religious ideas and scripture were destroyed by Kaliyan.)&lt;/ref&gt; But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called ''Narayana Swami Pathi'' or ''Narayana Swami Temple'', similar to Hindu [[Vaishnavism]]. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as [[Kali]], [[Hanuman]] and other folk deities in spite of the anti-[[polytheistic]] ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture.&lt;ref name= &quot;Nizal Thangal activities&quot;&gt;Vaikundar Seva Sangham's,''Ayya Vaikundar 170th Avathar-Special Edition'', The activities of Nizhal Thangals, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten [[Avatar]]s of Vishnu as [[Kalki]], while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the [[Ayyavazhi Trinity|Trinity]] conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power.&lt;ref&gt;Arisundara Mani, ''Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai'', Chapter 1, p. 1, ''&quot;Sreehari who is known as Athi Narayana is praised as Ayya.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today.&lt;ref name= &quot;Nizal Thangal activities&quot; /&gt; Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides ''panividais'' for other lesser gods too.&lt;ref name= &quot;Nizal Thangal activities&quot; /&gt;

The spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of [[Shamanism]]. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead).&lt;ref name= &quot;Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai&quot;&gt;R. Shunmugam, ''Nadar Kulathi Narayanar Avataram'', pp. 189–191&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the [[Palliyarai]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Shunmugam's Ayyavazhi Palliyarai&quot; /&gt; Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Samithopu Ayya Vaikunda Suvami 172-vathu avathara thina vizha, Thina Malar vazangkum Avathara Thina vizha Sirappu Malar, p. 3, &quot; ... but it is questionable that how many people know that. Every one who came to know newly about Ayya wonders and&amp;nbsp;...&quot; Bala Prajapathi Adikalar writes about Vaikundar.&lt;/ref&gt; Not even the [[Payyan dynasty|Payyans]] from the headquarters able to portray the Akilam-based ideology clearly.&lt;ref&gt;'''Court Judgement''', District Court, Nagercoil, Case: O.S. No.80/1110, '' &quot;The doctrines and the philosophic basis of this cult are not clearly known. Not even the 2nd defendant who is one of the hereditary high priests in the temple (Swamithope Pathi) and who enjoys the Gurusthanam of the community is able to throw much light on the question, whether there are any essential or fundamental differences between the Narayanaswamy margom (Ayyavazhi) and the Popular Hinduism&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi make them hard to be identified and differentiated [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a religion|as a separate belief]] and instead taken as [[Structure of Ayyavazhi#As a Hindu sect|a Hindu sect]].

==Social structure==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Swamithoppe pathi .jpg|thumb|right|[[Swamithoppe]] [[Pathi]], religious headquarters of Ayyavazhi]] --&gt;
{{Main|Structure of Ayyavazhi}}
Ayyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the [[Pathi]]s and [[Nizhal Thangal]]s, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The [[Ayyavazhi rituals|rituals]] are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;G. Patrick, ''Religion and Subaltern Agency'', &quot;Rituals&quot;, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scriptures cover basic elements and ideas throughout Hinduism. They refer to [[Shastras]], [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]], [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;Akilattirattu Ammanai (T. Palaramachandran Nadar), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; But address them all to be gone awry by the Advent of Vaikundar,&lt;ref name=&quot;All previous gone awry after Vaikundar&quot; /&gt; from where Ayyavazhi scriptures forms negative ideas over all other traditions. Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a ''Hindu renaissance''.&lt;ref&gt;T. Krishnanathan, ''Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum'', pp.62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too,&lt;ref&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram'', pp.163–178.&lt;/ref&gt; as it brought many social changes there in the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Kerala|keralite]] society during the 19th century.

The religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as ''&quot;Path of God&quot;'' with the phrase ''&quot;Ayya Vazhi&quot;''. On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that [[Vaikundar]] unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.&lt;ref name=&quot;All previous gone awry after Vaikundar&quot;&gt;G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, '' &quot;Ayya Vali – A New and Singular Religious Phenomenon&quot; '', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this, Ayyavazhi has separate [[Ayyavazhi theology|theology]], [[Ayyavazhi mythology|mythology]], [[Ayyavazhi holy sites|holy places]], [[Worship centers of Ayyavazhi|worship centres]], and ethics of its own. [[File:Avatara oorvalam.jpg|thumb|right|'' 'The Great Masi Procession' '' from [[Nagercoil]] to [[Swamithope]]]]
Though many new papers, academic researchers&lt;ref name= &quot;Historical Dictionary of Shamanism&quot; /&gt; and some of its followers consider it as a separate religion, many of the followers are even of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last = Bagavathikan |first = M. Raj |title = Ayya Vaikuntar|date = 10 February 1999|url = http://www.vaikunt.org/AyyaVaikuntar/index.htm| accessdate =13 January 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080214072150/http://www.vaikunt.org/AyyaVaikuntar/index.htm| archivedate= 14 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They indulge in the mystic practices of possessions and divinations similar to the tribal religions of Tamil Nadu. Also, many of its core beliefs are similar to some Hindu sects such as Advaita and Smartism.

Regarding demographics, Ayyavazhi followers are highly concentrated in South India though found across [[India]], comparatively in less numbers. In Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts of [[Tamil Nadu]], it is very hard to find a village without a [[Worship centers of Ayyavazhi|worship centre of Ayyavazhi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ponnu Ayyavazhi followers&quot; /&gt; Apart from the listings from the religious headquarters (though it is evident that Ayyavazhi followers are spread across the India from university papers)&lt;ref name= &quot;Poulose:Spread of Ayyavazhi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ponnu Ayyavazhi followers&quot;&gt;R. Ponnu, ''Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; there are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi because they are considered [[Hindu]]s in the census.
