{{Latter Day Saint biography/Brigham Young | format=Infobox Latter Day Saint biography}}
'''Brigham Young''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|ɡ|əm}}; June 1, 1801 – August 29, 1877) was an American leader in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and a [[settler]] of the [[Western United States]]. He was the [[President of the Church|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877, he founded [[Salt Lake City]], and he served as the first [[Governor of Utah|governor]] of the [[Utah Territory]], [[United States]]. Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the [[University of Utah]] and [[Brigham Young University]].

Young had a variety of nicknames, among the most popular being &quot;American [[Moses]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/newsroom/showpackage/0%2C15367%2C3899-31--34-2-190%2C00.html Newsroom&amp;nbsp;— The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (alternatively the &quot;Modern Moses&quot; or the &quot;Mormon Moses&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://overlandtrails.byu.edu/mapsessay.html Trails of Hope: Overland Diaries and Letters, 1846–1869 — Maps: Their Use by Overlanders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; because, like the [[Bible|biblical]] figure, Young led his followers, the [[Mormon pioneers]], in an [[Emigration|exodus]] through a [[desert]], to what they saw as a promised land.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell M. Nelson]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1999/07/the-exodus-repeated &quot;The Exodus Repeated&quot;,] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', July 1999: &quot;Many instructive parallels exist between the exodus from Egypt of the Israelites under Moses and the exodus from the United States of the Latter-day Saint pioneers under Brigham Young. We can learn much from these stalwarts of ancient and modern Israel.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Young was dubbed by his followers the &quot;Lion of the Lord&quot; for his bold personality, and was also commonly called &quot;Brother Brigham&quot; by [[Latter-day Saint]]s. Young was a [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|polygamist]] and was involved in controversies regarding [[Black people and the Latter Day Saint movement|black people and the Priesthood]], the [[Utah War]], and the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]].

==Early life and succession to Joseph Smith==
[[File:Brigham Young and his brothers.jpg|225px|thumb|left|The five sons of John and Nabby Young&lt;br&gt;From left to right: Lorenzo Dow, Brigham, [[Phineas Young|Phineas H.]], [[Joseph Young|Joseph]], and John.]]

Young was born to John and Abigail &quot;Nabby&quot; Young (née Howe), a farming family in [[Whitingham]], [[Vermont]], and worked as a travelling [[carpenter]] and [[blacksmith]], among other trades.&lt;ref&gt;Sheret, John G.: [http://crookedlakereview.com/articles/136_167/141fall2006winter2007/141sheret.html Brigham Young: Carpenter and Cabinet Maker]&lt;/ref&gt; Young first married in 1824 to Miriam Angeline Works. Though he had converted to the [[Methodist]] faith in 1823, Young was drawn to [[Mormonism]] after reading the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' shortly after its publication in 1830. He officially joined the new church in 1832 and traveled to [[Upper Canada]] as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]]. After his first wife died in 1832, Young joined many Mormons in establishing a community in [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]], [[Ohio]]. Young was ordained a member of the original [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] in 1835, and he assumed a leadership role within that organization in taking Mormonism to the United Kingdom and organizing the exodus of Latter Day Saints from Missouri in 1838.

While in jail awaiting trial for alleged treason charges, [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]], [[President of the Church|president of the church]], was [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed by an armed mob]] in 1844. Several claimants to the role of church President emerged during the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] that ensued. Before a large meeting convened to discuss the succession in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], [[Sidney Rigdon]], the senior surviving member of the church's [[First Presidency]], argued there could be no successor to the deceased prophet and that he should be made the &quot;Protector&quot; of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Roberts|Roberts, B. H.]] (ed.) ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 7, ch. XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; Young opposed this reasoning and motion. Smith had earlier recorded a [[revelation]] which stated the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were &quot;equal in authority and power&quot; to the First Presidency,&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/107/23-24#23 107:23–24].&lt;/ref&gt; so Young claimed that the leadership of the church fell to the Twelve Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Roberts|Roberts, B. H.]] (ed.) ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 7, ch. XIX.&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority in attendance were persuaded that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was to lead the church with Young as the Quorum's President. Many of Young's followers would later reminisce that while Young spoke to the congregation, he looked or sounded exactly like Joseph Smith, to which they attributed the power of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Quinn |first= D.

However, historians have come to different conclusions on whether the occurrence of such events is supported by contemporary records. Van Wagoner observed of contemporary accounts that &quot;none of these references an explicit transfiguration, a physical metamorphosis of Brigham Young into the form and voice of Joseph Smith,&quot; and &quot;[w]hen 8 August 1844 is stripped of emotional overlay, there is not a shred of irrefutable contemporary evidence to support the occurrence of a mystical event either in the morning or afternoon gatherings of that day.&quot;: {{cite journal |last= Van Wagoner |first= Richard S. |year= 1995 |month= Winter |title= The Making of a Mormon Myth: The 1844 Transfiguration of Brigham Young |journal= Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |volume= 28 |issue= 4 |pages= 1–24 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jorgenson |first=Lynne W. |year= 1996–97 |title= The Mantle of the Prophet Joseph Passes to Brother Brigham: A Collective Spiritual Witness |journal= BYU Studies |volume= 36 |issue= 4 |pages= 125–204 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arrington |first=Leonard J. |title=Brigham Young: American Moses |publisher=University of Illinois Press |pages=114–115 |year=1986 |isbn=0-252-01296-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young was ordained President of the Church in December 1847, more than two and a half years after Smith's death. Rigdon became the president of a separate [[Rigdonite|church organization]] based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and other potential successors emerged to lead what became other denominations of the movement.

==Governor of Utah Territory==
As colonizer and founder of [[Salt Lake City]], Young was appointed the territory's first governor and superintendent of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] affairs by [[Millard Fillmore|President Millard Fillmore]]. During his time as governor, Young directed the establishment of settlements throughout Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, and parts of southern Colorado and northern Mexico. Under his direction the pioneers built roads and bridges, forts, irrigation projects, and established public welfare, organized a militia, and pacified the Native Americans. Young organized the first legislature and established Fillmore as the territory's first capital.

Young organized a Board of Regents to establish a university in the Salt Lake Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/thebeginningsoftheuniversityofutah.html |title=The Beginnings of the University of Utah |author=Yvette D. Ison |date = January 1995|accessdate=October 5, 2011 |work= |publisher=[[State of Utah]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established on February 28, 1850, as the ''University of Deseret'', the precursor to the [[University of Utah]].

In 1856 he organized an efficient mail service. In 1858 he stepped down to his successor [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]].

==Church Presidency==
Brigham Young was the longest serving President of the LDS Church in history, having served for 29 years.

===Migration west===
{{See also|Mormon pioneers}}
After three years of leading the church as the President of the Quorum of the Twelve, in 1847 Young reorganized a new [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and was declared president of the church on December 27, 1847. Repeated conflict led Young to relocate his group of Latter-day Saints to a territory in what is now [[Utah]], then part of [[Mexico]]. Young organized the journey that would take the faithful to [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska]], in 1846, then to the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Young arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847, a date now recognized as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]] in Utah. Young organized the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] just 29 days after arriving for a conference of the church on August 22, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mormontabernaclechoir.org/faq |title=Choir faq |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] |accessdate=October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational endeavors===
Having previously established the [[University of Deseret]] (the precursor to the [[University of Utah]]) during his tenure as governor, on October 16, 1875, Young personally purchased land in [[Provo, Utah]], to possibly extend the reach of the University of Deseret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=BYU: The &quot;almost&quot; college of Draper, Utah| url=http://www.russpage.net/byu-the-almost-college-of-draper-utah/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young said, &quot;I hope to see an Academy established in Provo... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dusenberry&quot;/&gt; The school broke off from the University of Deseret and became ''Brigham Young Academy'',&lt;ref name=&quot;dusenberry&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first = Sarah |last = Bills |url = http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/43900 |title = Warren Dusenberry (1875–1876) |work = BYU NewsNet |date= April 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the precursor to [[Brigham Young University]].

Within the church, Young reorganized the [[Relief Society]] for women (1867), and he created organizations for [[Young Women (organization)|young women]] (1869) and [[Young Men (organization)|young men]] (1875).

===Temple building===
Young was involved in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] building throughout his membership in the LDS Church and made temple building a priority of his presidency. Under Joseph Smith's leadership, Young participated in the building of the [[Kirtland Temple|Kirtland (Ohio)]] and [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo (Illinois) Temples]]. Just four days after arriving in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], Young, who was now church president, designated the location for the [[Salt Lake Temple]] and presided over its groundbreaking on April 6, 1853.&lt;ref name=&quot;lightplanet.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/temples/salt_lake_temple_history.html]&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, Young oversaw construction of the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]], and he announced plans to build the [[St. George Utah Temple|St. George]] (1871), [[Manti Utah Temple|Manti]] (1875), and [[Logan Utah Temple|Logan Temples]] (1877) — all in Utah. He also provisioned the building of a &quot;temporary temple&quot; called the ''[[Endowment House]]'', which began use in 1855 to provide temple ordinances to church members while the Salt Lake Temple was under construction.

===Controversial teachings===
{{LDSpolygamy}}
Though [[polygamy]] was practiced by Young's predecessor [[Joseph Smith]], the practice is often associated with Brigham Young. Some denominations, such as the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], consider Young the &quot;Father of Mormon Polygamy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard and Pamela Price, ''Joseph Smith Fought Polygamy: How Men Nearest the Prophet Attached Polygamy to His Name in Order to Justify Their Own Polygamous Crimes'' (Precision Publishing, 2000), [http://restorationbookstore.org/articles/nopoligamy/jsfp-vol1/chp4.htm vol. 1, ch.3: &quot;Brigham Young: The Father of Mormon Polygamy&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, Young made the church's first official statement on the subject after the church had arrived in Utah. He spoke about the issue nine years after the purported original revelation of Joseph Smith, and five years after the [[Mormon Exodus]] to [[Utah]] following Smith's death in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Illinois]].

Brigham Young is generally credited with having been responsible for revoking the priesthood and temple blessings from [[Black people and Mormonism|black members of the LDS Church]], who had been treated equally in this respect under Joseph Smith's presidency.&lt;ref name=Bush&gt;{{cite book | last = Bush, Jr | first = Lester E | coauthors = Armand L. Mauss | title = Neither White nor Black: Mormon Scholars Confront the Race Issue in a Universal Church | publisher = Signature Books | year = 1984 | location = Midvale, Utah | pages = 54–65, 70 | url = http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/neither/neither3.htm#Chapter3 | isbn = 978-0-941214-22-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, Young reported that he said, &quot;Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is [[death on the spot]]. This will always be so.&quot; (''Journal of Discourses'', vol. 10, p.&amp;nbsp;110)&lt;ref&gt;http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=4266&amp;filename=100504_171800_ep110_Va_M230_J82_v10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; After settling in Utah in 1848, Brigham Young announced a priesthood ban which prohibited all men of black African descent from holding the priesthood.&lt;ref name=Bush/&gt; In connection, Mormons of African descent could not participate in Mormon temple rites such as the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment]] or [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]]. These racial restrictions remained in place until 1978, when the policy was rescinded by [[President of the Church]] [[Spencer W. Kimball]].&lt;ref&gt;http://scriptures.lds.org/od/2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts===
Shortly after the arrival of Young's pioneers, the new Mormon colonies were incorporated into the [[United States]] through [[Mexican Cession]], Young petitioned the [[U.S. Congress]] to create the [[State of Deseret]]. The [[Compromise of 1850]] instead carved out [[Utah Territory]], and Young was installed as governor. As governor and church president, Young directed both religious and economic matters. He encouraged independence and self-sufficiency. Many cities and towns in Utah, and some in neighboring states, were founded under Young's direction. Young's leadership style has been viewed as autocratic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555412/Brigham_Young.html Brigham Young]&quot;, MSN Encarta. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013355527844 Archived] October 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When federal officials received reports of widespread and systematic obstruction of federal officials in Utah (most notably judges), [[U.S. President]] [[James Buchanan]] decided to install a non-Mormon governor. Buchanan accepted the reports of the judges without any further investigation, and the new non-sectarian governor was accompanied by troops sent to garrison forts in the new territory. The troops passed by the [[Bleeding Kansas|bloody Kansas–Missouri war]] without intervening in it, as it was not open warfare and only isolated sporadic incidents. When Young received word that federal troops were headed to Utah with his replacement, he called out his militia to ambush the federal column. During the defense of Deseret, now called the [[Utah War]], Young held the [[U.S. Army]] at bay for a winter by taking their cattle and burning supply wagons. The Mormon forces were largely successful thanks to [[Lot Smith]]. Young made plans to burn [[Salt Lake City]] and move his followers to Mexico, but at the last minute he relented and agreed to step down as governor. He later received a [[pardon]] from Buchanan. Relations between Young and future governors and U.S. Presidents were mixed.

[[File:Brigham Young and company 1870.PNG|thumb|left|500px|Brigham Young (seated near the middle, wearing a tall [[beaver hat]]) and an exploring party camped at the [[Colorado River]] in 1870]]

A controversial issue is the extent of Young's involvement in the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Emily |last = Eakin |title = Reopening a Mormon Murder Mystery; New Accusations That Brigham Young Himself Ordered an 1857 Massacre of Pioneers |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10E17F6395E0C718DDDA90994DA404482&amp;showabstract=1 |work = [[New York Times]] |date = October 12, 2002 |edition = Late Edition-Final |page = Section B, Page 9, Column 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took place in [[Washington County, Utah|Washington County]] in 1857. [[Leonard J. Arrington]] reports that Brigham Young received a rider at his office on the same day. When he learned what was contemplated by the members of the LDS Church in Parowan and Cedar City, he sent back a letter that the Fancher party be allowed to pass through the territory unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young to Isaac C. Haight, Sept. 10, 1857, Letterpress Copybook 3:827–28, Brigham Young Office Files, LDS Church Archives&lt;/ref&gt; Young's letter supposedly arrived two days too late, on September 13, 1857. As governor, Young had promised the federal government he would protect immigrants passing through Utah Territory, but over 120 men, women and children were killed in this incident. There is still debate concerning the involvement of Mormons by scholars. However, Young did order that the party be allowed to pass &quot;unmolested.&quot;  Only children under the age of seven survived, the murdered members of the wagon train (known as the [[Fancher Party]]) were left unburied, and the surviving children were cared for by local Mormon families. The remains of about forty people were found and buried and Carleton had a large cross made from local trees, the transverse beam bearing the engraving, &quot;Vengeance Is Mine, Saith The Lord: I Will Repay&quot; and erected a cairn of rocks at the site. A large slab of granite was put up on which he had the following words engraved: &quot;HERE 120 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE MASSACRED IN COLD BLOOD EARLY IN SEPTEMBER, 1857. THEY WERE FROM ARKANSAS.&quot; For two years the monument stood as a warning to those travelling the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Spanish Trail]] through Mountain Meadow. Some claim that, In 1861, Young brought an entourage to Mountain Meadows and had the cairn and cross destroyed, while exclaiming, &quot;Vengeance is mine and I have taken a little&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Denton (2003). ''American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857'' (New York: [[Vintage Books]], ISBN 0-375-72636-5) p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young was a [[Polygamy#Mormon Polygamy|polygamist]], marrying a total of 55 wives, 54 of them after he converted to become a Latter Day Saint.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Odgen Johnson, [http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/dialogue,17879 “Determining and Defining ‘Wife’&amp;nbsp;— The Brigham Young Households”], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', vol. 20, no. 3 (Fall 1987), pp. 57–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was difficult for many in the church. Young stated that upon being taught about [[plural marriage]], &quot;It was the first time in my life that I desired the grave.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pbs.org/mormons/peopleevents/e_polygamy.html|title = Polygamy and the Church: A History|accessdate =May 29, 2007|date = April 30, 2007|work = The Mormons: People &amp; Events|publisher = [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death, Young had 56 children by 16 of his wives; 46 of his children reached adulthood.&lt;ref name = byubio&gt;{{cite web|url = http://unicomm.byu.edu/about/brigham.aspx?|title = Brigham Young Biography|accessdate =October 4, 2010|publisher = [[Brigham Young University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources have varied on the number of Young's wives, due to differences in what scholars have considered to be a &quot;wife&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; There were 55 women that Young was [[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]] to during his lifetime. While the majority of the sealings were [[Celestial marriage|&quot;for eternity&quot;]], some were &quot;for time only&quot;. Researchers believe that not all of the 55 marriages were [[Marriage#Rights_and_obligations|conjugal]].&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; Young did not live with a number of his wives or publicly hold them out as wives, which has led to confusion on the number and identities.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; This is in part due to the complexity of how wives were identified in the Mormon society at the time.

Of Young's 55 wives, 21 had never been married before; 16 were widows; six were divorced; six had living husbands; and the marital status of six others are unknown.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; In 1856, Young built the [[Lion House (Salt Lake City, Utah)|Lion House]] to accommodate his sizable family. This building remains a Salt Lake City landmark, together with the [[Beehive House]], another Brigham Young family home. A contemporary of Young wrote: &quot;It was amusing to walk by Brigham Young's big house, a long rambling building with innumerable doors. Each wife has an establishment of her own, consisting of parlor, bedroom, and a front door, the key of which she keeps in her pocket.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = DeHegermann-Lindencrone |first = Lillie |title = The Sunny Side of Diplomatic Life, 1875–1912 |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13955/13955-h/13955-h.htm |publisher = Project Gutenberg |accessdate =July 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Young's death, 19 of his wives had predeceased him, he was divorced from ten, and 23 survived him. The status of four was unknown.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt; In his [[will (law)|will]], Young shared his estate with the 16 surviving wives who had lived with him; the six surviving non-conjugal wives were not mentioned in the will.&lt;ref name = &quot;joj&quot;/&gt;

==Literature references and works==
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] based his first [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novel]], ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', on Mormon history, mentioning Young by name. When asked to comment on the story, which had &quot;provoked the animosity of the Mormon faithful&quot;, Conan Doyle noted, &quot;all I said about the [[Danite Band]] and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history.&quot; However, Doyle's daughter stated that &quot;You know father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/lit/article_Doyle.html Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan Doyle impressed by Mormons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence Claxton]]'s graphic novel ''The Adventures of a Woman in Search of her Rights'' (1872), satirises a would-be emancipated woman whose failure to establish an independent career results in her marriage to Brigham Young before she wakes to discover she's been dreaming. Mark Twain devoted a chapter and much of an appendix to Brigham Young in his book ''[[Roughing It]]''.

Brigham Young authored several books and discourses during his lifetime.
