'''Aten''' (also '''Aton''', [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|jtn}}'') is the disk of the sun in ancient [[Egyptian mythology]], and originally an aspect of [[Ra]]. The deified Aten is the focus of the  [[monolatrism|monolatristic]], [[henotheism|henotheistic]], or  [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]] of [[Atenism]] established by Amenhotep IV, who later took the name [[Akhenaten]] in worship and recognition of Aten. In his poem &quot;[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]&quot;, Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, and giver of life.
The worship of Aten was eradicated by [[Horemheb]].

==Overview==
The Aten, the sun-disk, is first referred to as a deity in [[The Story of Sinuhe]] from the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th dynasty]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson 2003&quot;&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt.'' Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 236–240&lt;/ref&gt; in which the deceased king is described as rising as god to the heavens and uniting ''with the sun-disk, the divine body merging with its maker.''&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Lichtheim]], ''Ancient Egyptian Literature,'' Vol.1, 1980, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, the term &quot;silver aten&quot; was sometimes used to refer to the moon.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Fergus, and Alan Lothian (1997). ''The Way to Eternity: Egyptian Myth.'' Duncan Baird Publishers. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The solar Aten was extensively worshipped as a god in the reign of [[Amenhotep III]], when it was depicted as a falcon-headed man much like [[Ra]]. In the reign of Amenhotep III's successor, Amenhotep IV, the Aten became the central god of Egyptian state religion, and Amenhotep IV changed his name to [[Akhenaten]] to reflect his close link with the new supreme deity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson 2003&quot;/&gt;

The full title of Akhenaten's god was &quot;The [[Ra-Horus]] who rejoices in the horizon, in his/her Name of the Light which is seen in the sun disc.&quot; (This is the title of the god as it appears on the numerous [[stelae]] which were placed to mark the boundaries of Akhenaten's new capital at [[Akhetaten]], modern [[Amarna]].) 
This lengthy name was often shortened to ''Ra-Horus-Aten'' or just ''Aten'' in many texts, but the god of Akhenaten raised to supremacy is considered a  [[Syncretism|synthesis]] of very ancient gods viewed in a new and different way. The god is also considered to be both masculine and feminine simultaneously. All creation  was thought to emanate from the god and to exist within the god. In particular, the god was not depicted in anthropomorphic (human) form, but as rays of light extending from the sun's disk.

Furthermore, the god's name came to be written within a [[cartouche]], along with the titles normally given to a [[Pharaoh]], another break with ancient tradition. Ra-Horus, more usually referred to as ''Ra-Horakhty'' (''Ra, who is Horus of the two horizons''), is a synthesis of two other gods, both of which are attested from very early on. During the [[Amarna]] period, this synthesis was seen as the invisible source of energy of the sun god, of which the visible manifestation was the Aten, the solar disk. Thus Ra-Horus-Aten was a development of old ideas which came gradually. The real change,  as some see it, was the apparent abandonment of all other gods, especially [[Amun]], and the debatable introduction of [[monotheism]] by Akhenaten.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press 2005, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;  The syncretism is readily apparent in the Great Hymn to the Aten in which Re-Herakhty, [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and Aten are merged into the creator god.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol.2, 1980, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten [[monolatry]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dominic Montserrat]], ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt,'' Routledge 2000, ISBN 0-415-18549-1, pp.36ff.&lt;/ref&gt; as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping any but the Aten.

==Royal Titulary==
During the Amarna Period, the Aten was given a Royal Titulary (as he was considered to be king of all), with his names drawn in a [[cartouche]]. There were two forms of this title, the first had the names of other gods, and the second later one which was more 'singular' and referred only to the Aten himself. The early form has [[Re-Horakhti]] who rejoices in the Horizon, in his name [[shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] which is the Aten. The later form has Re, ruler of the two horizons who rejoices in the Horizon, in his name of light which is the Aten.

===Variant translations===
*High relief and low relief illustrations of the Aten show it with a curved surface (see for example the photograph illustrating this article), therefore, the late scholar [[Hugh Nibley]] insisted that a more correct translation would be globe, orb or sphere, rather than disk. The three-dimensional spherical shape of the Aten is even more evident when such reliefs are viewed in person, rather than merely in photographs.
*There is a possibility that Aten's three-dimensional spherical shape depicts an eye of Horus/Ra. In the other early monotheistic religion [[Zoroastrianism]] the sun is called [[Ahura Mazda]]'s eye.
*These two theories are compatible with each other, since an eye is an orb

===Variant vocalizations===
Egyptologists have vocalized the word variously as Aten, Aton, Atonu, and Itn.

===Names derived from Aten===
