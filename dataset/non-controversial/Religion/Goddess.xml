[[File:Goddess Saraswati with Abhaya Mudra.JPG|thumb|right|175px|A statue of the [[Hindu]] Goddess [[Saraswati]]]]

[[File:クマリnepalネパールImg683.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A [[Nepal]]i girl being worshipped as a living Goddess, called a [[Kumari (children)|kumari]]]]

A '''Goddess''' is a female [[deity]]. In some cultures Goddesses are associated with [[Earth Goddess|Earth]], [[Mother Goddess|motherhood]], [[Love Goddess|love]], and the [[hearth Goddess|household]]. In other cultures, Goddesses also rule over [[List of war deities|war]], [[death]], and destruction as well as [[healing]]. They can be figureheads of [[religions]] and can be accessed in modern times by [[Religion|religious statues]].

In some religions, a sacred feminine archetype can occupy a very central place in [[prayer]] and [[worship]]. In Hinduism, [[Sacred Feminine]] or [[Shaktism]] is one of the three major Hindu denominations of worship along with [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]]. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the highest achievement any person can achieve is to become like the &quot;great&quot; female Buddhas (e.g. [[Arya Tara]]) who are depicted as being supreme protectors, fearless and filled with compassion for all beings.

The primacy of a monotheistic or near-monotheistic &quot;Great Goddess&quot; is advocated by some modern [[matriarchists]] as a female version of, preceding, or analogue to, the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]] associated with the historical rise of [[monotheism]] in the Mediterranean [[Axis Age]].

Some currents of [[Neopaganism]], in particular [[Wicca]], have a [[bitheism|bitheistic]] concept of a single Goddess and a single God, who in [[hieros gamos]] represent a united whole. [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Polytheistic reconstructionists]] focus on reconstructing polytheistic religions, including the various goddesses and figures associated with indigenous cultures.

The noun ''[[:wikt:goddess|goddess]]'' is a secondary formation, combining the Germanic ''[[god (word)|god]]'' with the Latinate ''[[:wikt:-ess|-ess]]'' suffix. It is first attested in [[Middle English]], from about 1350.&lt;ref name=BARNHART323&gt;Barnhart (1995:323).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Earth or mother Goddesses===
{{main|Earth Goddess|Mother Goddess}}
[[File:Ancient Egyptian Goddess.JPG|thumb|left|190px|The head of an Egyptian goddess. The gender is suggested by the lack of a beard, and the simple hairstyle points to the divine status of the subject.]]
[[Joseph Campbell]] in  ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', a 1988 interview with [[Bill Moyers]],&lt;ref&gt;first broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 1988 as a documentary, ''The Power of Myth'' was also released in the same year as a book created under the direction of the late [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]]&lt;/ref&gt;  links the image of the Earth or Mother Goddess to symbols of fertility and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6, &quot;The Gift of the Goddess&quot;  and Episode 5, &quot;Love and the Goddess&quot; [http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/love-and-the-goddess/episode/459330/summary.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, Campbell states that, &quot;There have been systems of religion where the mother is the prime parent, the source... We talk of Mother Earth. And in Egypt you have the Mother Heavens, the Goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], who is represented as the whole heavenly sphere&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p. 165, 1988, first edition&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell continues by stating that the correlation between fertility and the Goddess found its roots in  agriculture:
: '''Bill Moyers''': But what happened along the way to this reverence that in primitive societies was directed to the Goddess figure, the Great Goddess, the mother earth- what happened to that?
: '''Joseph Campbell''': Well that was associated primarily with [[agriculture]] and the agricultural societies. It has to do with the earth. The human woman gives birth just as the earth gives birth to the plants...so woman magic and earth magic are the same.  They are related.  And the personification of the energy that gives birth to forms and nourishes forms is properly female.  It is in the agricultural world of ancient [[Mesopotamia]], the Egyptian [[Nile]], and in the earlier planting-culture systems that the Goddess is the dominant mythic form.&lt;ref&gt;pp.166–7, (1988, first edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
Campbell also argues that the image of the [[Virgin Mary]] was derived from the image of [[Isis#Mother of Horus|Isis and her child Horus]]: &quot;The antique model for the [[The Madonna|Madonna]], is Isis with Horus at her breast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p. 176, 1988, first edition&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-Islamic Arabia====
In pre-Islamic [[Mecca]] the goddesses [[Uzza]], [[Manah|al-Manāt]] and [[Allat|al-Lāt]] were known as &quot;the daughters of god&quot;. Uzzā was worshipped by the [[Nabataean]]s, who equated her with the Graeco-Roman goddesses [[Aphrodite]], [[Urania]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and Caelestis. Each of the three goddesses had a separate shrine near [[Mecca]]. Uzzā, was called upon for protection by the pre-Islamic [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]. &quot;In 624 at the battle called &quot;[[Uhud]]&quot;, the war cry of the Qurayshites was, &quot;O people of Uzzā, people of [[Hubal]]!&quot; (Tawil 1993).

According to [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s controversial account of the [[Satanic Verses]] (''q.v.''), these verses had previously endorsed them as intercessors for [[Muslim]]s, but were abrogated. Most Muslim scholars have regarded the story as historically implausible, while opinion is divided among western scholars such as [[Leone Caetani]] and John Burton, who argue against, and [[William Muir]] and [[William Montgomery Watt]], who argue for its plausibility.

{{See|List_of_Germanic_deities_and_heroes#Goddesses}}
Surviving accounts of [[Continental Germanic mythology|Germanic mythology]] and later [[Norse mythology]] contain numerous tales and mentions of female goddesses, female [[Jötunn|giantesses]], and divine female figures. The [[Germanic peoples]] had altars erected to the [[Matres and Matrones|&quot;Mothers and Matrons&quot;]] and held celebrations specific to them (such as the Anglo-Saxon [[Mōdraniht|&quot;Mothers-night&quot;]]), and various other female deities are attested among the Germanic peoples, such as [[Nerthus]] attested in an early account of the Germanic peoples, [[Ēostre]] attested among the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Sinthgunt]] attested among the pagan continental Germanic peoples. Examples of goddesses attested in Norse mythology include [[Frigg]] (wife of [[Odin]], and the Anglo-Saxon version of whom is namesake of the modern English weekday [[Friday]]), [[Skaði]] (one time wife of [[Njörðr]]), Njerda (Scandinavian name of [[Nerthus]]), that also was married to [[Njörðr]] during Bronze Age, [[Freyja]] (wife of [[Óðr]]), [[Sif]] (wife of [[Thor]]), [[Gerðr]] (wife of [[Freyr]]), and personifications such as [[Jörð]] (earth), [[Sól (Sun)|Sól]] (the sun), and [[Nótt]] (night). Female deities also play heavily into the Norse concept of death, where half of those slain in battle enter Freyja's field [[Fólkvangr]], [[Hel (being)|Hel]] receives the dead in her realm [[Hel (location)|of the same name]], and [[Rán]] receives those who die at sea. Other female deities such as the [[valkyries]], the [[norns]], and the [[dís]]ir are associated with a Germanic concept of [[destiny|fate]] (Old Norse ''[[Wyrd|Ørlög]]'', Old English ''[[Wyrd]]''), and celebrations were held in their honor, such as the [[Dísablót]] and [[Disting]].

==Folk religion and animism==
{{See|Folk religion|Marian devotion}}

===African religions===
{{See|Traditional African religions|African diasporic religions}}
{{See|Mami Wata|Ala (mythology)|Asase Ya|Oshun|Oya|Yemaja}}
In African and African diasporic religions, goddesses are often syncretized with [[Marian devotion]], as in [[Ezili Dantor]] ([[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]]) and [[Erzulie Freda]] ([[Mater Dolorosa]]). There is also Buk, an Ethiopian goddess still worshipped in the southern regions. She represents the fertile aspect of women. So when a woman is having her period not only does it signify her submission to nature but also her union with the goddess. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Another Ethiopian goddess is Atete—the goddess of spring and fertility. Farmers traditionally leave some of their products at the end of each harvesting season as an offering while their women sing traditional songs.
A rare example of henotheism focused on a single Goddess is found  among the [[Nuba|Southern Nuba]] of Sudan.  The Nuba conceive of the creator Goddess as the &quot;Great Mother&quot; who gave birth to earth and to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Mbiti, J.S., ''Introduction to African Religion'', Oxford, 1975, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
[[Image:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG|thumb|right|The Hindu warrior goddess [[Durga]] killing the buffalo-demon [[Mahishasura]].]]
{{Main|God and gender in Hinduism}}
{{See|Devi|Shakti}}
Hinduism is a complex of various belief systems that sees many gods and goddesses as being representative of and/or emanative from a single source, [[Brahman]], understood either as a formless, infinite, impersonal monad in the [[Advaita]] tradition or as a dual god in the form of [[Lakshmi]]-[[Vishnu]], [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]], [[Shiva]]-[[Shakti]] in [[Dvaita]] traditions. [[Shaktas]], worshippers of the Goddess, equate this god with Devi, the mother goddess. Such aspects of one god as male god ([[Shaktiman]]) and female energy (Shakti), working as a pair are often envisioned as male gods and their wives or consorts and provide many analogues between passive male ground and dynamic female energy.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, [[Brahma]] pairs with [[Sarasvati]]. Shiva likewise pairs with [[Parvati]] who later is represented through a number of [[Avatar]]s (incarnations): [[Dakshayani|Sati]] and the warrior figures, [[Durga]] and [[Kali]]. All goddesses in Hinduism are sometimes grouped together as the great goddess, Devi.

A further step was taken by the idea of the ''Shaktis''. Their ideology based mainly on [[tantra]]s sees Shakti as the principle of energy through which all divinity functions, thus showing the masculine to be dependent on the feminine. Indeed, in the great shakta scripture known as the [[Devi Mahaamya]], all the goddesses are shown to be aspects of one presiding female force, one in truth and many in expression, giving the world and the cosmos the galvanic energy for motion. It is expressed through both philosophical tracts and metaphor that the potentiality of masculine being is given actuation by the feminine divine.
Local deities of different village regions in [[India]] were often identified with &quot;mainstream&quot; Hindu deities, a process that has been called &quot;Sanskritization&quot;. Others attribute it to the influence of [[monism]] or ''Advaita'' which discounts polytheist or monotheist categorization.

While the monist forces have led to a fusion between some of the goddesses (108 names are common for many goddesses), centrifugal forces have also resulted in new goddesses and rituals gaining ascendance among the laity in different parts of Hindu world. Thus, the immensely popular goddess [[Durga]] was a pre-Vedic goddess who was later fused with Parvati, a process that can be traced through texts such as Kalika Purana (10th century), Durgabhaktitarangini ([[Vidyapati]] 15th century), Chandimangal (16th century) etc.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Judaism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
{{See|The Hebrew Goddess|Shekhinah}}
[[Image:Collier-Lilith.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Lilith]], oil on canvas by carved by [[John Collier (artist)|John Collier]] (1887).]]
According to [[Zohar]], ''[[Lilith]]'' is the name of [[Adam]]'s first wife, who was created at the same time as Adam. She left [[Adam]] and refused to return to the [[Garden of Eden]] after she mated with [[archangel]] [[Samael]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://istina.rin.ru/eng/ufo/text/663.html Samael &amp; Lilith]&lt;/ref&gt; Her story was greatly developed, during the [[Middle Ages]], in the tradition of [[Aggadic midrashim]], the [[Zohar]] and [[Jewish mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tree of souls: the mythology of Judaism'', By Howard Schwartz, page 218&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zohar tradition has influenced [[Jewish mythology|Jewish folkore]], which postulates God created Adam to marry a woman named [[Lilith]]. Outside of Jewish tradition, Lilith was associated with the [[Mother Goddess]], [[Inanna]] – later known as both [[Ishtar]] and [[Asherah]]. In The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], Gilgamesh was said to have destroyed a tree that was in a sacred grove dedicated to the goddess Ishtar/Inanna/[[Asherah]]. Lilith ran into the wilderness in despair. She then is depicted in the Talmud and [[Kabbalah]] as first wife to God's first creation of man, [[Adam]]. In time, as stated in the Old Testament, the Hebrew followers continued to worship &quot;False Idols&quot;, like [[Asherah]], as being as powerful as God. [[Jeremiah]] speaks of his (and God's) displeasure at this behavior to the Hebrew people about the worship of the goddess in the Old Testament. Lilith is banished from Adam and God's presence when she is discovered to be a &quot;demon&quot; and Eve becomes Adam's wife. Lilith then takes the form of the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] in her jealous rage at being displaced as Adam's wife. Lilith as serpent then proceeds to trick Eve into eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge and in this way is responsible for the downfall of all of mankind. It is worthwhile to note here that in religions pre-dating Judaism, the serpent was known to be associated with wisdom and rebirth (with the shedding of its skin).

The following female deities are mentioned in prominent Hebrew texts:
* [[Agrat Bat Mahlat]]
* [[Anath]]
* [[Asherah]]
* [[Ashima]]
* [[Astarte]]
* [[Eisheth]]
* [[Lilith]]

===Christianity===
{{Main|Marian veneration|Sophia (wisdom)}}
In Christianity, worship of any other deity besides the [[Trinity]] was deemed [[heresy|heretical]], but veneration for [[Virgin Mary|Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus Christ]], as an especially privileged [[saint]]— though not as a deity— has continued since the beginning of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic faith]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Mary is venerated as the [[Mother of God]], [[Queen of Heaven]], [[Mother of the Church]], [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]], [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], and other lofty titles. Marian devotion similar to this kind is also found in Eastern Orthodoxy and sometimes in Anglicanism, though not in the majority of denominations of Protestantism.

[[Image:Sophia design.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sophia (wisdom)|Virgin Sophia]] design on a [[Harmony Society]] doorway in [[Harmony, Pennsylvania]], carved by Frederick Reichert Rapp (1775–1834).]]
In some Christian traditions (like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition), [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] is the personification of either divine wisdom (or of an archangel) which takes female form. She is mentioned in the first chapter of the [[Book of Proverbs]].

In [[Mysticism]], [[Gnosticism]], as well as some [[Hellenistic religion]]s, there is a [[female]] [[spirit]] or goddess named [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]] who is said to embody [[wisdom]] and who is sometimes described as a [[Virginity|virgin]].  In [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[mysticism]], [[Hildegard of Bingen]] celebrated  Sophia as a cosmic figure both in her writing and art.  Within the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] tradition in [[England]], 17th century [[mysticism|Mystic]], [[Universalism|Universalist]] and founder of the Philadelphian Society [[Jane Leade]] wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the &quot;Virgin Sophia&quot; who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the universe. Leade was hugely influenced by the theosophical writings of 16th century [[Germany|German]] Christian mystic [[Jakob Böhme]], who also speaks of the Sophia in works such as ''The Way to Christ''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Way&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Way to Christ| url=http://www.passtheword.org/DIALOGS-FROM-THE-PAST/waychrst.htm| last=Böhme| first=Jacob| authorlink=Jacob Böhme| coauthors=William Law, trans.| date=1622 (1764)| publisher=M. Richardson| location=Pater-noster Row, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jakob Böhme was very influential to a number of [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystics]] and religious leaders, including [[George Rapp]] and the [[Harmony Society]].

==Feminism and neopaganism==
{{Main|Feminist theology|Goddess movement}}

===Goddess movement===
{{Main|Feminist theology|Goddess movement}}
At least since [[first-wave feminism]] in the United States, there has been interest in analyzing religion to see if and how doctrines and practices treat women unfairly, as in [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]'s ''[[The Woman's Bible]]''. Again in [[second-wave feminism]] in the U.S., as well as in many European and other countries, religion became the focus of some feminist analysis in Judaism, Christianity, and other religions, and some women turned to ancient goddess religions as an alternative to Abrahamic religions (''Womanspirit Rising'' 1979; ''Weaving the Visions'' 1989). Today both women and men continue to be involved in the [[Goddess movement]] (Christ 1997).  The popularity of organizations such as the [[Fellowship of Isis]] attest to the continuing growth of the religion of the Goddess throughout the world.

While much of the attempt at gender equity in mainstream Christianity (Judaism never recognized any gender for God) is aimed at reinterpreting scripture and degenderizing language used to name and describe the divine (Ruether, 1984; Plaskow, 1991), there are a growing number of people who identify as Christians or Jews who are trying to integrate goddess imagery into their religions (Kien, 2000; Kidd 1996,&quot;Goddess Christians Yahoogroup&quot;).

===Sacred feminine===
The term &quot;sacred feminine&quot; was first coined in the 1970s, in [[New Age]] popularizations of the Hindu [[Shakti]].
It was further popularized during the 1990s by [[Andrew Harvey]] and others, and entered mainstream pop culture in 2003 with [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

===Wicca===
{{See|Goddess (Wicca)|Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)}}
In [[Wicca]] &quot;the Goddess&quot; is a deity of prime importance, along with her consort the [[Horned God]].
Within many forms of Wicca the Goddess has come to be considered as a universal deity, more in line with her description in the [[Charge of the Goddess]], a key Wiccan text. In this guise she is the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;, similar to [[Isis]]; she also encompasses and conceives all life, much like [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. Much like Isis and certain late Classical conceptions of [[Selene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Dieter Betz|Betz]] |first=[[Hans Dieter Betz|Hans Dieter]] (ed.) |title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation : Including the Demotic Spells : Texts |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is held to be the summation of all other goddesses, who represent her different names and aspects across the different cultures. The Goddess is often portrayed with strong lunar symbolism, drawing on various cultures and deities such as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Hecate]], and [[Isis]], and is often depicted as the Maiden, Mother and Crone triad popularised by [[Robert Graves]] (see [[#Triple Goddess|Triple Goddess]] below). Many depictions of her also draw strongly on [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] goddesses. Some Wiccans believe there are many goddesses, and in some forms of Wicca, notably [[Dianic Wicca]], the Goddess alone is worshipped, and the [[Horned God|God]] plays very little part in their worship and ritual.

[[Image:Triple-Goddess-Waxing-Full-Waning-Symbol.svg|thumb|right|212px|The lunar [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] symbol.]]
Goddesses or demi-goddesses appear in sets of three in a number of ancient European pagan mythologies; these include the Greek ''[[Erinyes]]'' (Furies) and ''[[Moirai]]'' (Fates); the Norse ''[[Norns]]''; [[Brighid]] and her two sisters, also called Brighid, from Irish or Keltoi mythology.

[[Robert Graves]]  popularised the triad of &quot;Maiden&quot; (or &quot;Virgin&quot;), &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Crone&quot;, and while this idea did not rest on sound scholarship, his poetic inspiration has gained a tenacious hold. Considerable variation in the precise conceptions of these figures exists, as typically occurs in Neopaganism and indeed in pagan religions in general. Some choose to interpret them as three stages in a woman's life, separated by [[menarche]] and [[menopause]]. Others find this too biologically based and rigid, and prefer a freer interpretation, with the Maiden as birth (independent, self-centred, seeking), the Mother as giving birth (interrelated, compassionate nurturing, creating), and the Crone as death and renewal (holistic, remote, unknowable)&amp;nbsp;— and all three erotic and wise.

==Metaphorical use==
The term &quot;goddess&quot; has also been adapted to poetic and secular use as a complimentary description of a non-mythological woman.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]: &quot;Applied to a woman. one's goddess: the woman whom one ‘worships’ or devotedly admires.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[OED]] notes 1579 as the date of the earliest  attestation of such figurative use, in ''[[Laura de Noves|Lauretta]] the diuine [[Petrarch]]es Goddesse''.

[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had several of his male characters address female characters as goddesses, including Demetrius to [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (&quot;O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!&quot;), Berowne to Rosaline in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' (&quot;A woman I forswore; but I will prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee&quot;), and Bertram to Diana in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]''. Pisanio also compares Imogen to a goddess to describe her composure under duress in ''[[Cymbeline]]''.
