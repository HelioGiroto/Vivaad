The '''Scottish Episcopal Church''' ({{lang-gd|Eaglais Easbaigeach na h-Alba}}) is a [[Christian]] church in [[Scotland]], consisting of seven [[dioceses]]. Since the 17th century, it has held an identity distinct from the ([[presbyterian]]) [[Church of Scotland]].

A continuation of Scotland's [[Jacobite Risings|Jacobite]]-era Church of Scotland, the Episcopal Church of Scotland is now a member of the [[Anglican Communion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittock&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pittock|first=Murray|title=Poetry and Jacobite politics in eighteenth-century Britain and Ireland|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1994|series=Cambridge studies in eighteenth-century English literature and thought|volume=23|page=237|isbn=978-0-521-41092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recognises the position of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] as president of the Anglican Instruments of Communion, but without jurisdiction in Scotland. The current [[Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church]] is the Most Reverend [[David Chillingworth]].

==Official name==
The Scottish Episcopal Church was previously called the Episcopal Church in Scotland, reflecting its role as the Scottish province of the Anglican Communion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Although not incorporated until 1712, the Scottish Episcopal Church traces its origins beyond the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and sees itself in continuity with the church established by [[St. Ninian]], [[St. Columba]], [[St. Kentigern]] and other Celtic saints. The established Church of Scotland claims the same continuity.

The church is sometimes [[pejorative]]ly referred to in Scotland as the &quot;English Kirk&quot;, but this is misleading and can cause offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on Friday 4 April 2008 15:08 |url=http://www.lanarkgazette.co.uk/news/local-headlines/we_re_not_english_kirk_1_375144 |title=We're NOT English Kirk! - Local Headlines |publisher=Lanark Gazette |date=2008-04-04 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/anglicanchurch/Church-fury-over-historic-mistakes.2792848.jp | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman | first=Murdo | last=Macleod | title=Church fury over historic mistakes on 'English kirk' | date=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is, nonetheless, a union of the non-juring Episcopalians with the &quot;[[Qualified Chapel|qualified congregations]]&quot; who worshipped according to the liturgy of the Church of England.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Scottish Episcopal Church}}

===Origins of Christianity in Scotland===
[[Saint Ninian]] conducted the first Christian mission to what is now southern Scotland.

In 563 [[St Columba]] travelled to Scotland with twelve companions, where according to legend he first landed at the southern tip of the [[Kintyre]] peninsula, near [[Southend, Kintyre|Southend]]. However, being still in sight of his native land he moved further north along the west coast of Scotland. He was granted land on the island of [[Iona]] off the [[Isle of Mull]] which became the centre of his [[evangelism|evangelising]] mission to the [[Picts]].  However, there is a sense in which he did not leave his native people, as the Irish [[Gaels]] had been colonising the west coast of Scotland for some time.&lt;ref name=Fletcher_23&gt;{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard|title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England|pages=23–24|year= 1989|publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn|isbn=0-85683-089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the services he provided guiding the only centre of [[literacy]] in the region,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} his reputation as a holy man led to his role as a [[diplomat]] among the tribes; there are also many stories of miracles which he performed during his work to [[religious conversion|convert]] the Picts. He visited the [[pagan]] king [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei]], king of [[Fortriu]], at his base in [[Inverness]], winning the king's respect and Columba subsequently played a major role in the politics of that country.  He was also very energetic in his evangelical work; in addition to founding several churches in the [[Hebrides]], he worked to turn his monastery at Iona into a school for missionaries.  He was a renowned man of letters, having written several [[hymns]] and being credited with having [[Calligraphy|transcribe]]d 300 books personally.  He died on Iona and was buried in the abbey he established.

The Scottish church  would continue to grow in the centuries that followed, and in the 11th century, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]] (Queen Consort of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]]) strengthened the church's ties with the [[Holy See]] as did successive monarchs such as Margaret's son, David, who invited several religious orders to establish monasteries.

===Reformation===
The [[Scottish Reformation]] was formalised in 1560, when the church in Scotland broke with the [[Holy See]], during a process of Protestant reform led, among others, by [[John Knox]]. It reformed its doctrines and government, drawing on the principles of [[John Calvin]] which Knox had been exposed to while living in [[Switzerland]]. In 1560, the Scottish Parliament abolished papal jurisdiction and approved Calvin's Confession of Faith, but did not accept many of the principles laid out in Knox's ''[[First Book of Discipline]]'', which argued, amongst other things, that all of the assets of the old church should pass to the new. The 1560 Reformation Settlement was not ratified by the crown for some years, and the question of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church government]] also remained largely unresolved. In 1572 the acts of 1560 were finally approved by the young James VI, but under pressure from many of the nobles the Concordat of Leith also allowed the crown to appoint bishops with the church's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Established Church of Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Knox himself had no clear views on the office of bishop, preferring to see them renamed as 'superintendents'; but in response to the new Concordat a Presbyterian party emerged headed by [[Andrew Melville]], the author of the ''[[Second Book of Discipline]]''.

The Scottish Episcopal Church began as a distinct church in 1582, when the [[Church of Scotland]] rejected episcopal government (by bishops) and adopted a [[presbyterian]] government by elders as well as [[reformed theology]]. Scottish monarchs made repeated efforts to introduce bishops and two ecclesiastical traditions competed.

===Episcopal government maintained===
[[File:Churches of Scotland timeline.png|thumb|right|500px|Timeline of the evolution of Scottish churches since 1560]]
[[File:James I, VI by John de Critz, c.1606..png|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of James VI by [[John de Critz]], circa 1606]]

In 1584 [[James VI of Scotland]] had the [[Parliament of Scotland]] pass the ''Black Acts'', appointing two bishops and bringing the Church of Scotland under royal control. This met vigorous opposition and he was forced to concede that the General Assembly should continue to run the church. Calvinists who disliked the more ceremonious style of liturgy were opposed by an Episcopalian faction. After ascending to the English throne in 1603 James stopped the General Assembly from meeting, increased the number of Scottish bishops and in 1618 held a General Assembly in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]; this gathering adopted ''Five Articles'' of Episcopalian practices.  Many Scottish church leaders, and their congregations, responded to the Five Articles with boycotts and disdain.

James' son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was crowned in [[Holyrood Abbey]], [[Edinburgh]], in 1633 with full [[Anglican]] rites. Subsequently, in 1637, Charles  attempted to introduce a version of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], written by a group of Scottish prelates, most notably the [[Archbishop of St Andrews]], [[John Spottiswood]], and the [[Bishop of Ross]], [[John Maxwell (archbishop)|John Maxwell]], and edited for printing by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Laud]]; it was a combination of Knox's Book of Common Order, which was in use before 1637, and English liturgy in hopes of further unifying the (Anglican) Church of England and the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. When the revised Book of Common Prayer was used for the first time during worship on 23 July 1637 in St Giles' Edinburgh, it [[Jenny Geddes|sparked a riot]] which became so uncontainable that it led to the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], beginning with the [[Bishops Wars]] and developing into the [[English Civil War]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

With the 1689 refusal of the Scottish bishops to swear allegiance to [[William III of England|William of Orange]] while [[King James VII]] (James II of England) lived and had not abdicated, the Presbyterian polity was finally re-established in the Church of Scotland. However, the [[Comprehension Act of 1690]] allowed Episcopalian incumbents, on taking the [[Oath of Allegiance]], to retain their benefices, though excluding them from any share in the government of the Church of Scotland without a further declaration of [[presbyterian]] principles. Many '[[nonjuring schism|non-jurors]]' also succeeded for a time in retaining the use of the parish churches.

The excluded Scottish bishops were slow to organise the Episcopalian remnant under a jurisdiction independent of the state, regarding the then arrangements as provisional, and looking forward to a reconstituted national Episcopal Church under a sovereign they regarded as legitimate (see [[Jacobitism]]). A few prelates, known as college bishops, were consecrated without sees, to preserve the succession rather than to exercise a defined authority. At length the hopelessness of the [[House of Stewart|Stuart]] cause and the growth of congregations outside the establishment forced the bishops to dissociate canonical jurisdiction from royal prerogative and to reconstitute for themselves a territorial episcopate.

The Scottish ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' came into general use at start of the reign of William and Mary. The Scottish Communion Office, compiled by the non-jurors in accordance with primitive models, has had a varying co-ordinate authority, and the modifications of the English liturgy that would be adopted by the American Church were mainly determined by its influence.

Among the clergy of post-Revolution days the most eminent are Bishop [[John Sage]], a well-known patristic scholar; Bishop Rattray, liturgiologist; [[John Skinner (poet)|John Skinner]], of Longside, author of ''Tullochgorum''; [[George Gleig|Bishop Gleig]], editor of the 3rd edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''; [[Edward Bannerman Ramsay|Dean Ramsay]], author of ''Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character''; [[Alexander Penrose Forbes|Bishop AP Forbes]]; GH Forbes, liturgiologist; and [[Charles Wordsworth|Bishop Charles Wordsworth]].

===From the birth of the United Kingdom===
[[File:Bonnie prince charlie.JPG|thumb|right|The death of Charles Stuart led to better conditions for church growth]]
The [[Scottish Episcopalians Act 1711|Scottish Episcopalians Act of 1711]] protected the Episcopal Church, which marked its virtual incorporation as a distinct society. However, matters were still complicated by a considerable, though declining, number of Episcopalian incumbents holding parish churches. Moreover, the [[Jacobitism]] of the non-jurors provoked a state policy of repression in 1715 and 1745, and fostered the growth of new Hanoverian congregations, using the English Prayer Book (served by clergy who had been ordained by a bishop but amenable to none), who qualified themselves under the act of 1712. This act was further modified in 1746 and 1748 to exclude clergy  ordained in Scotland.

These causes reduced the Episcopalians who, in 1689, had been a large section of the population, to a minority save in a few corners of the west and north-east of Scotland. Their official recognition of [[George III]], on the death of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] in 1788, removed the chief bar to progress.  In 1792 the penal laws were repealed, but clerical disabilities were only finally removed in 1864.  The qualified congregations were gradually absorbed in the early 19th century.

After the independence of the 13 colonies, the Scottish Episcopal Church also took the step of consecrating [[Samuel Seabury (1729-1796)|Samuel Seabury]] at Aberdeen in 1784. He became the first bishop of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|American Episcopal Church]] after being refused consecration by Church of England clergy. In this way, it can be said that the Episcopal Church in the United States owes as much of its origins to the Scottish Episcopal Church as to the Church of England.

The Theological College was founded in 1810, incorporated with [[Trinity College, Glenalmond]], in 1848, and re-established at Edinburgh in 1876. Theological training is now provided by the various dioceses and is supervised by the Theological Institute of the Scottish Episcopal Church (TISEC).

In 1900 the church had 356 congregations, with a total membership of 124,335 and 324 working clergy. Membership did not grow in the following decades as it was believed it would.

In 1989 there were approximately 200 stipendiary and 80 non-stipendiary clergy.  Membership was 65,000, with 31,000 communicants.&lt;ref&gt;Church of England Year Book 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past 30 years the Scottish Episcopal Church has taken a stand on various issues including economic justice, the ordination of women and inclusion.

==Membership==
In terms of official membership Episcopalians comprise a little over 1% of the population of Scotland, making them about 12% of the size of the Church of Scotland.   The Church has 310 parishes  with a total membership of 44,280&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/regions/europe/united-kingdom/scottish-episcopal-church.html |title=Scottish Episcopal Church |publisher=Oikoumene.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (about 54,000 including children).&lt;ref name=&quot;cofe&quot;/&gt; 

In 1995, the Scottish Episcopal Church began working through a process known as ''Mission 21''. Canon Alice Mann of the Alban Institute was invited to begin developing a missionary emphasis within the congregations of the church throughout Scotland. This led to the development of the ''Making Your Church More Inviting'' programme which has now been completed by many congregations. In addition to working on making churches more inviting, ''Mission 21'' emphasises reaching out to new populations which have previously not been contacted by the church. As ''Mission 21'' has developed, changing patterns of ministry have become part of its remit.

As for other churches in Scotland attendance has declined over recent years: the overall figures reflect rises in some dioceses and decline in others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurrankcentre.org.uk/media/k2/attachments/Scottish_Episcopal_Church___Membership__Attendance_1989_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
===Bishops and Primus===
{{seealso|List of Anglican dioceses in the United Kingdom and Ireland}}
[[File:Dioceses of the Scottish Episcopal Church.png|thumb|Map of the dioceses of the Scottish Episcopal Church]]
As an episcopal denomination, the church is governed by bishops, differentiating it from the national [[Church of Scotland]] which is [[presbyterian]] and governed by elders. However, unlike the Church of England, the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church are elected in a procedure involving clergy and laity of the vacant diocese voting at an electoral [[synod]].

The church is composed of seven dioceses, each with its own bishop:

All [[Episcopal See|sees]] except Edinburgh (founded by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) stem from sees of the Catholic Church in Scotland. The bishops of the Episcopal Church are direct successors of the prelates consecrated to Scottish sees at the Restoration. The bishops are addressed ''[[Right Reverend]]''.

The College of Bishops constitutes the episcopal synod, the supreme court of appeal.

This synod elects from among its own members a presiding Bishop who has the title of Primus (the title originates from the Latin phrase ''[[Primus inter pares]]'' — 'First among equals').

The [[Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church]], the presiding [[bishop]] of the Scottish Episcopal Church, is elected by the episcopal synod from among its members. His duties are:
* to preside at all Provincial Liturgical Functions
* to preside at all meetings of the General Synod of the Scottish Episcopal Church
* to preside at all meetings of the Episcopal Synod
* to declare and carry out the resolutions of the General Synod, the Episcopal Synod and the College of Bishops
* to represent the Scottish Episcopal Church in its relation to all other Churches of the Anglican Communion and other Communions
* to perform the functions and duties of Primus as specified in the Canons of the Scottish Episcopal Church
* to correspond on behalf of the Scottish Episcopal Church with Primates, Metropolitans and the Secretary General of the [[Anglican Consultative Council]].

The current incumbent is [[David Chillingworth]], who took this office on 13 June 2009.

The Primus does not have any [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] jurisdiction - the last to hold such jurisdiction was Archbishop [[Arthur Rose]] (of St Andrews) up to his death in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Short History of the Episcopal Church in Scotland&quot; by Frederick Goldie (revised edition - 1975) ISBN 0-7152-0315-0&lt;/ref&gt; The Primus is addressed ''[[Most Reverend]]''.

===Representative bodies===
The church is governed by the [[General Synod]]. This consists of the House of Bishops, the House of Clergy and the House of Laity. The General Synod makes [[canon law]], administers finance and monitors the work of the boards and committees of the Church. Most decisions are arrived at by a simple majority of members of the General Synod voting together. More complex legislation, such as changes to the Code of Canons requires each of the Houses to agree and to vote in favour by a two-thirds majority.

Each diocese has its synod of the clergy and laity. Its [[dean (religion)|dean]] (similar to an [[archdeacon]] in the Church of England) is appointed by the bishop, and, on the voidance of the [[Episcopal see|see]], summons the diocesan synod, at the instance of the primus, to choose a bishop. Each diocese has one or more (in the case of some united dioceses) [[cathedral]]s.  The senior [[priest]] of a Scottish Episcopal cathedral is styled as provost (as the title of 'dean' is given to the senior priest of the diocese as a whole, see above). The only exception in Scotland is the [[Cathedral of the Isles]] on the island of [[Great Cumbrae]] which has been led by a member of the clergy styled as [[Precentor]]. Diocesan deans and cathedral provosts are both addressed as ''[[Very Reverend]]''.

==Worship and liturgy==
The Scottish Episcopal Church embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest (referred to in the 1929 Scottish Prayer Book as presbyter) and bishop. Increasingly, an emphasis is being placed on these orders to work collaboratively within the wider ministry of the whole people of God.

===Liturgies===
In addition to the {{cite web | url = http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Scotland/Scotland.htm | title = Scottish Prayer Book 1929}}, the church has a number of other [[liturgy|liturgies]] available to it. In recent years, revised Funeral Rites have appeared, along with liturgies for Christian Initiation (e.g. [[Baptism]] and [[Confirmation|Affirmation]]) and [[Marriage]]. The modern [[Eucharist]]ic rite (Scottish Liturgy 1982) includes Eucharistic [[prayer]]s for the various seasons in the [[Liturgical Year]] and is commonly known as &quot;The Blue Book&quot; - a reference to the colour of its covers. A further Eucharistic prayer is provided in the Marriage liturgy.

==Doctrine and practice==
{{ReligionScotland}}
{{See also|Anglicanism|Anglican doctrine}}

The centre of teachings of the Scottish Episcopal Church is the life and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ]].  The basic teachings of the church, or [[catechism]], includes:
*Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead.
*Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe.
*The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people &quot;under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit&quot;.  The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine.
*The two great and necessary [[Anglican sacraments|sacraments]] are [[Baptism|Holy Baptism]] and [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]]
*Other [[Anglican sacraments|sacramental rites]] are [[confirmation]], [[ordination]], [[marriage]], [[Confession (religion)|reconciliation of a penitent]], and [[unction]].
*Belief in [[heaven]], [[hell]], and [[second coming|Jesus's return in glory]].

The threefold sources of authority in Anglicanism are scripture, tradition, and reason. These three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way.

This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of [[Richard Hooker]], a sixteenth century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicanlistening.org/anglican_listening_61766_ENG_HTM.htm Anglican Listening] goes into detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to &quot;uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues===
The Scottish Episcopal Church has been involved in [[Scottish politics]]. The Church is an opponent of [[nuclear weaponry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
