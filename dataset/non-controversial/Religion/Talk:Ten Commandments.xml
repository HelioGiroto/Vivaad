== Wait, what? ==

&quot;but is divided over exactly when the Ten Commandments were written and who wrote them.&quot;

Uh... Moses? 1500-ish BC? Though you could quibble that God wrote them the first time. If this is a criticism of the bible being accurate history, as opposed to being made up by random douchebags, could you make a distinction? As in, 'the biblical history/literal interpretation of the bible is (highly disputed)' etc. Something to that effect. Just for the sake of courtesy, and not confusing the hell out of me when I read it. 

Also, at least the rough date, should be the easiest thing in the world, unless again, you just assume the bible doesn't count as history, or it's ALL LIES. :D It makes it sound like Moses, and 1500-ish (can't remember off the top of my head), aren't even considered an option, like it's a matter of finding out how wrong it is. 
Just make it a bit clearer for those of us that do consider the bible authentic history. There can't be that few of us.

Please and thank you.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:SuperMudz|SuperMudz]] ([[User talk:SuperMudz|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/SuperMudz|contribs]]) 09:09, 13 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:Clearly there are two versions. The traditional view which accepts the Bible as historical, and the modern scholarly view which takes a different approach. Encyclopedias don't choose sides (see [[WP:NPOV]]); rather, they summarise human knowledge and belief that already exists. We're certainly not here to establish [[WP:TRUTH|the absolute truth]].

== Religious Text as Primary Source ==

I noticed that this tag was recenlty removed, and I'd like to discuss, to re-enstate the tag, and in the long run, reform the article so as to no longer need it.  First to the tag, which says that the article wrongly uses religous texts as primary sources, without critical secondary sources, and that the article could be improved if it were otherwise.

So, first, can some explain in what way the tag doesn't apply.  Is the claim that religous text isn't used as primary source? Is it that doing so is not improper? Is the claim that secondary sources are suficenalty contained?  Let me know what we're talking about, and lets go from there.

Also, a point of order, does anyone know, what is the standard for mantaining such tags and removing them.  It seems to me the stardard for mantaining would me much less than an ordinary edit, as it is a cirtiism of the article, and not making a claim about the subject itself.  But I ask those that know WP policy better that I. [[User:Steve kap|Steve kap]] ([[User talk:Steve kap|talk]]) 03:06, 8 September 2012 (UTC)

:First, thanks Steve, for starting a message on this issue, but I'm still not clear why you think this tag is needed. Let me put a copy of the tag itself here before further comment. I'm using the underlying code of the tag, rather than the template, so the parts of the tag can be seen in the edit window. Note that the first sentence is labeled &quot;issue&quot; and the second sentence is called &quot;fix&quot; &amp;ndash;

{{Ambox
| name  = Religious text primary
| type  = content
| issue = This {{{1|article}}} '''improperly uses one or more [[religious text]]s as [[WP:PSTS|primary source]]s without referring to secondary sources that critically analyze them'''.
| fix   = Please help [{{fullurl:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|action=edit}} improve this article] by adding references to [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable secondary sources]], with multiple points of view.

}}

:The tag is apparently intended for articles that are based only on primary source(s) without secondary source commentary or interpretation. Anyone can look at the table of contents and see that there are multiple viewpoints in this article, and looking at the ''references'' section &amp;ndash; there are certainly a lot of secondary sources. That alone is sufficient reason not to use this particular tag. The tag was placed in the revelation at Sinai section, which is the biblical narrative. It is not appropriate to intersperse secondary commentary with the narrative, because it breaks up the flow of the overview. My edit summary said: Religious template unneeded, interpretation and comments in other sections&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;br&gt;That about sums it up. Even if it were appropriate it would be unneeded because the editor would still need to come here to the talk page and be more specific about what in his/her view is the problem and propose a solution. Thanks for your attention to these things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;[[User:Telpardec|—Telpardec]] [[User talk:Telpardec|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;color:#ff6;background:#090;border:3px double;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;TALK&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:46, 16 September 2012 (UTC)

Thanks for the reply.  You say this this is intended for artical that are &quot;based ONLY on primary sources&quot;.,clearly this couldn't be the case.  That would mean that if an article had only ONE secondary source, it could avoid the charge of being based ONLY on primary sources. No, like most thinks, I think its a matter of degree.  This article gives the impression, on the whole, that the best understanding of the origin of the 10C is that it came as a revelation from God (Yahew, specificlly), during a perion that the Jews were traveling from Eygpt to Palistine.  That is a religous position, and it needs to be expressed.  But it needs to be put in historical and literarlly context by secondary sources.  That is what the tag calls for.  The article as is doesn't do that.

As to &quot;even if... the edtor would...&quot;, clearly that couldn't be true.  If that were the case, why have any tags at all? No, the tagger is NOT required to come up with the perfect solution, he is allowed to tag the deficit, in a call for other, perphaps more knowledgable, to help out.  

To that end, and as a point of order, should the tag not be re-instated while its being discussed, to bring others into the discussion?  [[User:Steve kap|Steve kap]] ([[User talk:Steve kap|talk]]) 16:35, 23 September 2012 (UTC)

:Got specifics? Sorry, Steve, but your general &quot;impression&quot; does not identify a specific problem that needs a specific fix AFAICT &amp;ndash; got a specific sentence or paragraph for starters? Thanks for your patience. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;[[User:Telpardec|—Telpardec]] [[User talk:Telpardec|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;color:#ff6;background:#090;border:3px double;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;TALK&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:47, 4 October 2012 (UTC)

::Specifics? Yes, as I said, the Revelation section tagged gives the impression that our best understanding is that the 10C were delivered to the Jews in their Exodus and were written by God. This with barely a word putting this story in hisotrical or literary context.. not in this section or any other.  Didn't you read that?   What part do you dispute? [[User:Steve kap|Steve kap]] ([[User talk:Steve kap|talk]]) 21:52, 5 October 2012 (UTC)

::I think this is a qualitative discussion, and its worth having.  I'm guessing that you believe info in the &quot;criticle&quot; section somehow balances this rather long section with strickly the religious narrative presented.  I'd be glad to talk that thru, I think we have an honest disagrement there.  But, as my you haven not disputed my point of order, I'm pointing the tag back in.  21:56, 5 October 2012 (UTC)

::JDW, rather than edit war, how about using the talk page!  I gave my reasons for the tag here, and invited discusiton about the standards required for a tag, if you objected, I would have liked to hear it here, so I can answer it!!  [[User:Steve kap|Steve kap]] ([[User talk:Steve kap|talk]]) 01:45, 11 October 2012 (UTC)

:::Could you suggest a secondary source that might be acceptable to you? Because I suspect you might not be satisfied with ISBN 161203618X (number 2 on Amazon when searching &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;), or the little book I have (ISBN 0899061796). Your assistance is much appreciated. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T@lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 18:40, 14 October 2012 (UTC)

::::Thanks for engaging. No, I don't have specific secondary sources in mind, the tag is a call for improvment, from material from other sources its not to say I have the answers.  Don't mistake me, I have no problem using the bible as a source; its just that you need secondary sources to put them in context. not just religous source, but rather more objective sources.  For an exmaple of what I'm talking about, please is the WP article &quot;Genesis creation narrative&quot;.  Notice, in the lede, that narative is told, but historical sources and literary critism put it in the context of our best understanding. In contrast, the 10C section in question give the narative, and little more.  No comment on what was happing in this point in history. No explanation on how a narrative is to be found by cobbling together (by WP editors, BTW) sentences from different books of the bible. This is the type of thing thats missing.    [[User:Steve kap|Steve kap]] ([[User talk:Steve kap|talk]]) 01:56, 18 October 2012 (UTC)

{{outdent}}Well, all articles are cobbled together by editors from various sources, chosen by the editors. The GCN article has no bearing on this article. I believe the narrative as it stands now needs no further support, since there are other sections dealing with the critical issues. We don't need any [[Poisoning the well]] additions. I am willing to discuss the option of an additional prefatory sentence. I'm sorry I have not been very helpful lately - a quick trip to the hospital emergency room turned into nearly a week stay and continued outpatient treatments, (and monster expenses.&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;[[User:Telpardec|—Telpardec]] [[User talk:Telpardec|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;color:#ff6;background:#090;border:3px double;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;TALK&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:33, 10 November 2012 (UTC)

The WP:COPYVIO cannot stay. Wikipedia is not just this article, but a complete encyclopedic work containing millions of articles. There are other issues being questioned also.
