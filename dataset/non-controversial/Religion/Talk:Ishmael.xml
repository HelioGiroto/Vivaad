== WTH? ==
At the start the article says:

&quot;Ishmael ('''The hebrew name cotton means all amazingness traped in a single form for eternity he will be the ultimate savior!'''; Greek: Ισμαήλ; Latin: Ismael; Arabic: إسماعيل‎, ’Ismā‘īl) is a figure&quot;

But when I try to edit it it says:

&quot;'''Ishmael ''' ({{Hebrew Name|יִשְׁמָעֵאל|Yišmaʿel|Yišmāʿêl}}; {{lang-el|Ισμαήλ}}; {{lang-la|Ismael}}; {{lang-ar|إسماعيل}}, ''{{unicode|’Ismā‘īl}}'')  is a figure &quot;

What's up with the Hebrew name?
Has the article been hacked?[[Special:Contributions/89.210.189.119|89.210.189.119]] ([[User talk:89.210.189.119|talk]]) 17:48, 23 October 2009 (UTC)
:Hmm that is strange. It looks like copying and pasting the template again fixed it though. I find it odd that it managed to slip under the radar like that though, it made it look like it was just part of the template, so I can't find anywhere it appears on any of the edit history.

== Ismail's own article? ==

Nearly every character in the Bible who also appears in the Qur'an has his own article. Can we make [[Islamic view of Ishmael]]? --[[User:Ephilei|Ephilei]] 21:38, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Bahá'í view==
Some updates to this treatment here:
*The Bahá'í view doesn't warrant mention in the opening paragraphs per [[WP:Undue weight]]. In the same vein, the treatment of the Bahá'í should be succinct in the body of the article itself.
*Ishmael isn't a &quot;[[Manifestation of God]]&quot; in that religion's theology.
*The &quot;two Ishmaels&quot; observation is not germane as it refers to two different people.
*The Bahá'í Faith takes largely the Islamic view with respect to Ishmael across the board.
Hope this is clear. [[User:MARussellPESE|MARussellPESE]] 13:41, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

: Thanks MARussellPESE for writing the section. --[[User:Aminz|Aminz]] 06:19, 28 April 2007 (UTC)

== Good article review ==

A few critiques of this article with respect to the good article review:

# Excellent use of citations.
# Excellent use of images
# Covers the topic very well from several different angels
# Article is relatively stable though a bit less then I would like

Now two minor problems

# references like [[Hagar (Bible)#Hagar in Jewish mysticism ]] are probably better handled via a rename like [[Hagar (Bible)#Hagar in Jewish mysticism  | Hagar in Jewish mysticism ]]
# Some of the sentences seem to mix discussion between references, for example under Jewish Tradition, ''In some Rabbinic traditions, Ishmael is said to have had two wives named Aisha and Fatima, the names of Muhammad's wife and daughter.[1] This is understood as a metaphoric representation of the Muslim world (first Arabs and then Turks) with Ishmael.''  Better would be something like ''In some Rabbinic traditions Ishmael is said to have had two wives named Aisha and Fatima.  Those names correspond to the Muslim tradition for the names of Muhammad's wife and daughter.'' Unless the article means to assert that there is a rabbinic tradition involving the names of Muhammad's wife. 

In my opinion this article satisfies [[Wikipedia:What is a good article?]] [[User:jbolden1517|jbolden1517]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;DarkGreen&quot;&gt;[[User talk:jbolden1517|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:01, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

== As ancestor of the Arabs ==

Are there written sources discussing Ishmael as the ancestor of the Arabs from before the time of Muhammad?  This should be explained in the article.  Thanks.--[[User:Pharos|Pharos]] 04:57, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

:Where is a direct quote from Arabs that they are the seed of Ishmael? 

:Frow New Advent.org about [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08192a.htm Ismael]

:''&quot;In his Epistle to the Galatians (4:21, sqq.) St. Paul expands allegorically the narrative of Ismael and Isaac, urging upon his readers the duty of not giving up their Christian freedom from the bondage of the Law. Of course, in so arguing, the Apostle of the Gentiles did not intend to detract in any way from the historical character of the narrative in Genesis. '''With regard to the various difficulties, literary and historical, suggested by a close study of the Biblical account of Ismael's life, suffice it to say that each and all will never cause a careful and unbiased scholar to regard that account otherwise than as portraying an ancient historical character, will never induce him to treat otherwise than as hypercritical every attempt, by whomsoever made, to resolve Ismael into a conjectural personality of the founder of a group of Arabic tribes.''' And this view of the matter will appear most certain to any one who compares the Biblical narrative with the legends concerning Ismael which are embodied in the Talmud, the Targum, and the other rabbinical works; while the latter are plainly the result of puerile imagination, the former is decidedly the description of an ancient historical figure. &quot;''

== Jahiliyyah? ==

I decided to be bold and change the description of Ismail as &quot;pre-Islamic&quot; (with link to [[Jahiliyyah]]) to &quot;pre-Muhammad&quot;.  Does Islam consider significant prophets such as Ibrahim and Ismail to be in Jahiliyyah just because they preceded Muhammad?  Since [[Ibrahim (sura)|Ibrahim]] ayah 39 records Ibrahim praying to God, he's not in the state of paganism that (if I remember right) is meant by &quot;Jahiliyyah&quot;.  Someone more knowledgeable please confirm or correct this!  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] 01:40, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

The term Jahaliyyah is used specifically to refer to Pagan Pre-islamic Arabia. Islam is defined in the Qur'an as the Religion of Abraham and considers all prophets in all times to be Muslims ie. those submitting to the will of God.[[User:Royalbengal100|Royalbengal100]] ([[User talk:Royalbengal100|talk]]) 17:53, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

The belief that Islam is a new religion brought by Muhammad is surely the most popular even by Muslims, but not islamo-theologically correct. Jah means ignorance and Jahiliyyah means time of ignorance. If there was no truth (islam according to the Qur'an) in that time, what should someone ignore?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/77.238.193.16|77.238.193.16]] ([[User talk:77.238.193.16|talk]]) 09:56, 31 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Sarah and Hagar==

The Penteteuch or the Book of the Law spends a lot of time discussing covenants, property rights and inheritances. As he travels south from Haran, through Syria Abram makes a covenant with El Shaddai lord of the land. As he enters the territory of Egypt Abraham makes a covenant with Yahwah the power of the air. Hagar is protected by El Roi the Power of the Well and after Sarah goes with AbiMelech we have Abraham building an alter and perforrming the ritual of Chemosh or the passing of the first born through the flame. What follows in Exodus is a covenant with the people to be law abiding.

The essence of the story is the comparison of the semitic Sharia law of Sarai, with the towrah  to·rä' law  of the Sons of Israel, and the Afroasiatic Egyptian hotep of Hagar as regards laws, decrees, commandments, ordinances, the rights of in laws by birth and by marriage
laws, judgements as to what is right and proper, decrees, commandments, manners, commissions, rules, norms, mores, and conventions.

In comparing the rules of Sharia, torah, dath, hotep, mishpat, nomos regarding inheritance we have on the one hand the common law and on the other the written law; both are taken in terms of having made a contract by establishing a meeting of the minds.

The question is posed as to whats the relative status of Abrams sister by another mother? Under which laws is she permitted to be his wife and under which laws is that prohibited? Under what circumstances can their offspring inherit? next come the question, well what if she has gone with another man?...what if her husband permits it?...what if he not only permits it but encourages it?...what if he decides its necessary to save their lives?... what if it happens again?...what if its necessary to have a child?...what if she can't have a childwith him ...what if he goes with another woman to have a child by her?...what if she goes with another man to have a child by him...
What if the eldest son doesn't survive?...

At the time of this story Hammurabbi has just codified the laws of Babylon and had the code of Hammurabi carved in stone.After the story of Abraham sets the stage the rest of the Pentetuch goes on to look at what we call mosaic law, and then we get that covenant to abide by the absolute power of the written law carved in stone, placed in an ark and the ark housed in a sanctuary in the Egyptian manner. The Egyptians carve their gods in stone, place the stone in an ark and place the ark in a sanctuary.

Then we learn that Yahwah has a consort called Asherah. Like the Egyptian goddess Maat she is a fertility goddess with an eros for wisdom. When judges are appointed the absolute power of the law is tempered with wisdom giving birth to justice.

The bottom line question is under what conditions is Isaacs birthright tsaddiyq  tsad·dēk'  righteous, just, and lawful and when is it krima or criminal? [[User:Rktect|Rktect]] ([[User talk:Rktect|talk]]) 23:15, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

== Etymology ==

Ishmael's name is from [[Old Persian]] ''asma dēla'' [asma dǣla] 'eighth son', cf. [[Old Prussian]] ''asmus'' 'eighth', [[Latvian]] ''dēls'' 'son' ([[Latin]] ''filius &lt; *dhēl-'') .

It is not clear which son was nearly sacrificed, Isaac or Ishmael. There seems to be both errors and confusion, especially regarding the mohammedan version?

==Rewording==

Can someone reword the term &quot;theory&quot; from the excerpt

However the belief that the son was Ishmael prevailed, and this view is continued to be endorsed by Muslim scholars.[5] The argument of those Muslims who believed in the Ishmael theory was that &quot;the promise to Sarah of Isaac followed by Jacob (Qur'an 11:71–74) excluded the possibility of a sacrifice of Isaac.&quot;[5] The other party held that the son of sacrifice was Isaac since &quot;God's perfecting his mercy on Abraham and Isaac (in Qur'an 12:6) referred to his making Abraham his friend and saving him from the burning bush and to his rescuing Isaac.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.80.104.208|24.80.104.208]] ([[User talk:24.80.104.208|talk]]) 06:14, 26 December 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== &quot;Blessings Given to Ishmael&quot; ==

OK, I can see how &quot;multiplying&quot; and &quot;being a populous nation&quot; is a blessing, but the rest?
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He will be a wild donkey of a man,
His hand will be against everyone,
And everyone's hand will be against him;
And he will live to the east of all his brothers.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Are these really all good things? Normally, I'd refer to such a thing with a more neutral word, such as &quot;determining someone's destiny&quot;.--[[Special:Contributions/91.148.159.4|91.148.159.4]] ([[User talk:91.148.159.4|talk]]) 18:53, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

==Binding of Isaac in Islam==

&quot;Please read this before u take any silly action&quot;


I have edited this article I dont think there is anything to say because the sources for that was the Quran and the verses of the Quran are mentioned in the edited article and Ive also kept a conclusion and literal proof for the editings I have made

One thing I deleted was the theory that some Muslim scholars say that Isaac and Jacob were both promised for Sarah so this means Ishmael was sacrificed. This Beleif and theory is false! because never does the Quran say in Arabic so? the verses that talk about Isaac and Jacob in arabic states that &quot;we gave her the good news of Isaac and after Isaac Jacob&quot; but what many english speakers don't know is that in Arabic grammer the letter BA was kept beside Isaac's name. the letter BA is a letter kept when someone wants to use the word 'with&quot; so the Quran said we gave her glad tidings with Isaac by using the letter BA but however after that the Quran clearly says and after him we gave good news of Jacob but it doesnt use the letter BA the letter BA was only used with Isaac meaning that the angels came to talk about Isaac but after Isaac grew and the sacrifice occured god told Abraham about the birth of Jacob because the style of the Quran tends to talk about something and then states the future act .. the Quran clearly says that the three angels only gave news of Isaac in many verses i mentioned in the article and there is no verse talking about Jacob and the three angels except this one and like i mentioned earlier this verse used the letter BA to say with &quot;we gave her glad tidings with Isaac'&quot; BUT IT DOESNT USE THE LETTER BA WITH JACOB so clearly this verse talks about Isaac and then states the future of when Jacob was born long after Isaac grew with his father TO WALK AND WORK .. nowhere in Islamic tradition or the Quran it states that Jacob had a relation with the tidings of Isaac.. so this is another proof as well as I MYSELF HAVE EDITED THE ARTICLE AND CLEARY MADE THE STORY CLEAR SO A READER WOULD DEFINATLY UNDERSTAND MY POINT WITHOUT HAVING A LOOK AT THIS TALK PAGE... there are many things i didnt mention AS PROVE OF THE BINDING OF ISAAC IN ISLAM like the birth of Isaac give to Abraham when Abraham left his people or when abraham was ordered to sacrifice the un-named son who grew up with him and was given to him miraculously and clearly every knows that Ishmael was taken away from Abraham when he was just a baby nor did Ishmael have a miraculous birth nor did he live with his father to work and walk ....the quranic verse are kept in the article! ... Il put some here to make it easier to see




037.083 YUSUFALI: Verily among those who followed his Way was Abraham.

037.084 YUSUFALI: Behold! he approached his Lord with a sound heart.

037.085 YUSUFALI: Behold! he said to his father and to his people, &quot;What is that which ye worship?

037.086 YUSUFALI: &quot;Is it a falsehood- gods other than Allah- that ye desire?


037.087 YUSUFALI: &quot;Then what is your idea about the Lord of the worlds?&quot;

037.088 YUSUFALI: Then did he cast a glance at the Stars.


037.089 YUSUFALI: And he said, &quot;I am indeed sick (at heart)!&quot;

037.090 YUSUFALI: So they turned away from him, and departed.

037.091 YUSUFALI: Then did he turn to their gods and said, &quot;will ye not eat (of the offerings before you)?...

037.092 YUSUFALI: &quot;What is the matter with you that ye speak not (intelligently)?&quot;

037.093 YUSUFALI: Then did he turn upon them, striking (them) with the right hand.

037.094 YUSUFALI: Then came (the worshippers) with hurried steps, and faced (him).

037.095 YUSUFALI: He said: &quot;Worship ye that which ye have (yourselves) carved?

037.096 YUSUFALI: &quot;But Allah has created you and your handwork!&quot;

037.097 YUSUFALI: They said, &quot;Build him a furnace, and throw him into the blazing fire!&quot;


037.098 YUSUFALI: (This failing), they then sought a stratagem against him, but We made them the ones most humiliated!


037.099 YUSUFALI: He said: &quot;I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me!

037.100 YUSUFALI: &quot;O my Lord! Grant me a righteous (son)!&quot;


037.101 YUSUFALI: So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear.

037.102 YUSUFALI: Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: &quot;O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!&quot; (The son) said: &quot;O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!&quot;

037.103 YUSUFALI: So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice),

037.104 YUSUFALI: We called out to him &quot;O Abraham!

037.105 YUSUFALI: &quot;Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!&quot; - thus indeed do We reward those who do right.

037.106 YUSUFALI: For this was obviously a trial-

037.107 YUSUFALI: And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice:

037.108 YUSUFALI: And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:

037.109 YUSUFALI: &quot;Peace and salutation to Abraham!&quot;


037.110 YUSUFALI: Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.

037.111 YUSUFALI: For he was one of our believing Servants.


This verse says the WHOLE STORY ... a son was given to Abraham after Abraham left his pagan people and THIS SON WAS UN NAMED BUT WHAT THE READER CAN TAKE AS A CLUE IS THAT THE UN-NAMED SON WAS A CHILD GIVEN TO ABRAHAM AFTER HE LEFT HIS PAGAN PEOPLE







019.041 YUSUFALI: (Also mention in the Book (the story of) Abraham: He was a man of Truth, a prophet.

019.042 YUSUFALI: Behold, he said to his father: &quot;O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing?

019.043 YUSUFALI: &quot;O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a way that is even and straight.


019.044 YUSUFALI: &quot;O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against (Allah) Most Gracious.

019.045 YUSUFALI: &quot;O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from (Allah) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend.&quot;

019.046 YUSUFALI: (The father) replied: &quot;Dost thou hate my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a good long while!&quot;

019.047 YUSUFALI: Abraham said: &quot;Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious.


LOOK AT THIS




019.048 YUSUFALI: &quot;And I will TURN away from YOU (ALL) and from those whom ye invoke besides Allah: I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest.&quot;

019.049 YUSUFALI: When he had TURNED away from THEM and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet.

these verses talk about ISAAC GIVEN TO ABRAHAM WHEN ABRAHAM LEFT HIS PAGAN PEOPLE SO THIS PROVES THAT THE UN-NAMED SACRIFICED SON WAS ISAAC BECAUSE THE EARLIER VERSE THAT MENTIONS THE SACRIFICE SAYS ABRAHAM WAS GIVEN A UN-NAMED SON ....... WHO WAS GIVEN TO HIM RIGHT AFTER HE LEFT HIS PAGAN PEOPLE AND LIKE I SAID .. THESE VERSES CLEARLY MENTIONS ISAAC BY NAME AS THE UN-NAMED SON WHO WAS GIVEN TO ABRAHAM WHEN HE LEFT HIS PAGAN PEOPLE.. so the conclsion is ... Isaac was binded  :)

Exgesis is interpretation and explanation ,.. i provided verses ... u know what ure doing what u claim u are doing ,..you are using GENESIS TO EXPLAIN THE QURAN SO I FIND IT IRONIC THAT URE CRITISIZING ME AND CALLING MY VERSES TAFSIR BUT ANYWAYS IL PROVIDE U WITH VERSES FROM ANOTHER CHAPTER OF THE QURAN WITHOUT ANY TAFSIR AND U SEE THE LOGIC .. :)

021.051 
YUSUFALI: We bestowed aforetime on Abraham his rectitude of conduct, and well were We acquainted with him. 
021.052 
YUSUFALI: Behold! he said to his father and his people, &quot;What are these images, to which ye are (so assiduously) devoted?&quot; 

(this is no exegesis iam just asking u to focus on Abraham;s father mentioned here ...)

021.068 
YUSUFALI: They said, &quot;Burn him and protect your gods, If ye do (anything at all)!&quot; 

(this is from the same sura .. it talks about Abraham;s people burning him and his father was obviously involved like i mentioned in the earlier verse)

021.072 
SHAKIR: And We gave him Ishaq and Yaqoub and We made (them) all good.

now take these two points with u ...:Abraham;s dad and the fire happened before the giving of Isaac


Now .. this chapter talks about the sacrifice after .. the two points (Abraham's dad and the fire) see for yoruself

037.085 
YUSUFALI: Behold! he said to his father and to his people, &quot;What is that which ye worship?  (ABRAHAM;S DAD)
037.097 
YUSUFALI: They said, &quot;Build him a furnace, and throw him into the blazing fire!&quot; (THE FIRE)
037.101 
YUSUFALI: So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear. (whos this boy? ... its Isaac because the earlier chapter says after Abraham left his father and the fire he was given Isaac ....) 


037.102 
YUSUFALI: Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: &quot;O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!&quot; (The son) said: &quot;O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!&quot; 

common sense ... ansewr me a question .. we both know that Ishmael and Hagar were taken out when Ishmael was a baby cariied in Hagar's shoulder and Abraham left them there ... so how in god;s green earth could this be Ishmael if it says the sacrificed son grew and walked and worked WITH his dad .. this is talking about Isaac growing WITH HIS FATHER IN CANAAN WHEN ISHMAEL WAS IN ARABAIA WITH HIS MOTHER ....

Iam not providing exegesis iam just guiding and helpin so understand my point  i cant just say  X=0 Y=9 ..iam not telling u my interpretation or opinion or imagination iam asking u to read these verses do research and see the common sense ..   i PROVIDED U WITH MANY VERSES FORM MANY CHAPTERS UP! this is extra info .. wt else sir?

please do not provide Gensis accounts because we dont belive in genesis and when u examine the Quran u examine itself alone u do not mix something with it .. thats not called assesment? and besides we dont belive in Gensis so all what it brings is confusion and corruption , thank you.[[User:Highdeeboy|Highdeeboy]] ([[User talk:Highdeeboy|talk]]) 12:46, 7 March 2010 (UTC)

:Again, TYPING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE SCREAMING ON THE INTERNET.  Cross referencing verses to clarify them is interpretting them.  I am not calling the verses Tafsir, I am saying that they are being used for Tafsir/Exegesis/interpretation.  I am not defending the Genesis account.  I have no problem with the article including [[WP:RS|properly sourced]] additions discussing how there are notable interpretations, but this site is not to be used to advocate any particular interpretation.  If you can provide some source that says that some people interpret the Quran that way, then that would be a good addition. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 01:00, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

there is no proof to state your point . i dont want to prove my point about Isaac I just want this page not to mention any thing supporting that Ishmael is the son of sacrifice becuase like i said .. what the article says is WRONG! in language and tradition so please clean it up or ask an Arabic speaker to look up that verse because its Wrong! and proveless ... 


&lt;nowiki&gt;=======&lt;/nowiki&gt;

019.048 
YUSUFALI: &quot;And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides Allah: I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest

019.049 
YUSUFALI: When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet. 

====== the story is mentiond in much detail in another chapter

037.099 
YUSUFALI: He said: &quot;I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me! 

037.102 
YUSUFALI: Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: &quot;O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!&quot; (The son) said: &quot;O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!&quot; 
&lt;nowiki&gt;======================&lt;/nowiki&gt;

i didnt add any interpretation all i kept was the same  SOURCE this page uses to prove its point read the verses and its clear ...

::The Quran is just says that it was &quot;Abraham's son&quot; that Abraham was called to sacrifice, without clarifying.  A number of Muslims believe that this refers to Ishmael, and the Quran is ambiguous.  You are presenting different verses to advocate the view that the Quran says it was Isaac, when the actual text is ambiguous.  That is interepretation.  I am not putting my interpretation, I am simply going with the sources that point out that most Muslims believe that it was Ishmael.  If a Christian tried to use ambiguously worded Bible verses that were crossreferenced to try to make a point that is not outright stated in those verses, I would revert their edits (and I have so a lot in the past, [[Special:Contributions/Jack.swanson|here is one example]]).  Secondary sources are what Wikipedia prefers.  You need to provide secondary sources for your claims. [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 02:14, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

But i already provided u a freaking secondary source and you said .. ITS EXEGESIS .. DUDE JUST LEAVE ME ALONE U MAKE NO SENSE SHEESH[[User:Highdeeboy|Highdeeboy]] ([[User talk:Highdeeboy|talk]]) 15:43, 4 April 2010 (UTC)!

== Pictures ==

There are three pictures all of the same incident. Is this necessary?

Also, though there's maybe no better ones, they are all inaccurate, as Ishmael was a teenager when they were sent to the desert. He was 14 when Isaac was born (Abraham was 86 when Ishmael was born, and 100 when Isaac was born), and they were sent to the desert after Isaac was weaned, which would be 2 or 3 years later.

== New Layout ==

This articles layout has been heavily modified, however, at this point, no textual content has been deleted... just moved around into their appropriate sections. The intro was burdened by world/religious views. A very short world view summary would suffice if wanted. [[User:Jasonasosa|Jasonasosa]] ([[User talk:Jasonasosa|talk]]) 15:27, 5 January 2011 (UTC)
:Original research from the section: ''Blessings given to Ishmael'' was removed. However, the bottom half concerning his brothers was merged into the ''World views'' at this point [[User:Jasonasosa|Jasonasosa]] ([[User talk:Jasonasosa|talk]]) 15:36, 5 January 2011 (UTC)

== play on words ==
&quot;reference to his &quot;making merry&quot; (Gen. 21:9), a translation of the Hebrew word 'Mitzachek'.&quot;  Isaac in Hebrew is 'Yitzchak', I will laugh or I laughed, from the same root, referring to Sarai's laughter when told she would deliver a child in old age.  So 'Mitzachek' can be read as a direct threat to 'Yitzchak'. [[User:Oneye1i|Oneye1i]] ([[User talk:Oneye1i|talk]]) 02:16, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

== Ishmael was indeed sacrificed according to the Torah ==   
Sending a child and his mother into the desert is a sacrifice by all measure. [[User:Oneye1i|Oneye1i]] ([[User talk:Oneye1i|talk]]) 02:16, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

== Abraham never heard of &quot;Yahweh&quot; ==
Even though the Torah, as collated and rewritten by Ezra the Scribe in the (Babylonian) vernacular upon the return of the tribe of Judah (with Benjamin and the Levites) to Zion under Cyrus the Great of Persia, uses &quot;Yahweh&quot; and derivatives and &quot;El&quot; and derivatives interchangeably, this is not historical.  Yahweh is the God of the Jews (tribe named &quot;Yehuda&quot; or more accurately &quot;Yehudat&quot;, worshipper of Yehu, and Abraham was a Hebrew, whose chief God was El or El Elohai (God highest in the pantheon).  So the Abrahamic covenant was with El, the only God he ever knew. [[User:Oneye1i|Oneye1i]] ([[User talk:Oneye1i|talk]]) 02:16, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

== Ismail ==

The usage of [[Ismail]] is under discussion, see [[Talk:Ismail]] and [[Talk:Ismail (name)]]. [[Special:Contributions/65.94.45.238|65.94.45.238]] ([[User talk:65.94.45.238|talk]]) 06:06, 8 February 2011 (UTC)

== Should Ishmaelites be merged with Arabs? ==

Since the term &quot;Ishmaelites&quot; is a Biblically-based name on [[Ishmael]] is it correct to merge it with [[Arab people]]? See discussion at [[Talk:Arab people#Merger proposal from Ishmaelites]]. Thanks, [[User:IZAK|IZAK]] ([[User talk:IZAK|talk]]) 06:39, 10 June 2011 (UTC)</text>
