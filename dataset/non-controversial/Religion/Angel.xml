An '''angel''' is a supernatural being or [[spirit]] found in various [[religion]]s and mythologies. In [[Abrahamic religions]] they are often depicted as servants of God and celestial beings who act as intermediaries between heaven and [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;The Free Dictionary [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/angel] retrieved 1 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Native American religion]]s angels are depicted as a guiding influence or a guardian spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Unseen World, Constance Victoria Briggs - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[English language|English]] word &quot;angel&quot; is derived from the Greek ''{{lang|gr|ἄγγελος}}'' (angelos), a translation of {{lang|he|מלאך}} (''[[mal'akh]]'') in the [[Tanakh]]; a similar term, {{lang|ar|ملائكة}} (''Malāīkah''), is used in the [[Qur'an]]. The Hebrew and Greek words in ancient times meant ''messenger'', and depending on the context may refer either to a ''human messenger'' or a ''supernatural messenger''.  The ''human messenger'' could possibly be a prophet or priest, such as [[Malachi]], &quot;my messenger&quot;, and the Greek superscription that the [[Book of Malachi]] was written &quot;by the hand of his messenger&quot; ''ἀγγήλου''. Examples of a ''supernatural messenger'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Lex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/hebrewenglishlex00browuoft#page/520/mode/2up |title=&quot;‏מַלְאָךְ,&quot; Francis Brown, S.R.

In the New Testament, there is no mention of the angel of the Lord; the Messiah himself is this person.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;angel&quot; has also been expanded to various notions of spirits found in many other religious traditions. Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings, and carrying out God's tasks.&lt;ref&gt;According also to [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[http://www.augustinus.it/latino/esposizioni_salmi/index2.htm Enarrationes in Psalmos {{Latin}}]'', 103, I, 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The theological study of angels is known as ''angelology''. [[Angels in art|In art, angels]] are often depicted with wings on their back, a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], robes and various forms of glowing [[light (theology)|light]].&lt;ref&gt;Angels and the New Race - Page 8, Geoffrey Hodson - 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Abraham-And-The-Three-Angels.jpg|thumb|right|Three angels hosted by [[Abraham]], [[Ludovico Carracci]] (1555–1619), Bologna, Pinacoteca Nazionale.]]
The word ''angel'' in [[English language|English]] is a fusion of the [[Old English]] word ''engel'' (with a hard g) and the [[Old French]] ''angele''. Both derive from the Latin ''angelus'' which in turn is the [[romanization]] of the [[ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|gr|ἄγγελος}}'' (''angelos''), &quot;messenger&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fggelos ἄγγελος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; which is related to the Greek verb ''{{lang|gr|ἀγγέλλω}}'' (''angellō''), meaning &quot;bear a message, announce, bring news of&quot; etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:3:7.LSJ.391269 Henry George Liddell; Robert Scott &amp;#91;1940&amp;#93;, ''A Greek-English Lexicon''; Machine readable text (Trustees of Tufts University, Oxford)] online, retrieved 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest form of the word is the [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean]] ''a-ke-ro'' attested in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=193 a-ke-ro],  Palaeolexicon (Word study tool of ancient languages)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorecrete.com/archaeology/linearB.pdf |title=Mycenaean (Linear b) - English Glossaryy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|Angel (Judaism)}}
The Bible uses the terms מלאך אלהים (''mal'akh [[Elohim]]''; messenger of God), מלאך יהוה (''mal'akh [[YHWH]]''; messenger of the Lord), בני אלהים (''b'nai Elohim''; sons of God) and הקודשים (''ha-qodeshim''; the holy ones) to refer to beings traditionally interpreted as angels. Later texts use other terms, such as העליונים (''ha'elyoneem''; the upper ones).

Scholar [[Michael D. Coogan]] notes that it is only in the late books that the terms &quot;come to mean the benevolent semidivine beings familiar from later mythology and art.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael D. 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Coogan |first=Michael D. |title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Daniel]] is the first biblical figure to refer to individual angels by name,&lt;ref name = &quot;jpmmbk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1521&amp;letter=A&amp;search=angels |The |title=Jewish Encyclopedia, accessed Feb. 15, 2008 |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning [[Gabriel]] (God's primary messenger) in Daniel 9:21 and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] (the holy fighter) in Daniel 10:13.  These angels are part of Daniel's apocalyptic visions and are an important part of all apocalyptic literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael D. 2009&quot;/&gt; Coogan explains the development of this concept of angels: &quot;In the postexilic period, with the development of explicit monotheism, these divine beings—the 'sons of God' who were members of the [[Divine Council]]— were in effect demoted to what are now known as 'angels', understood as beings created by God, but immortal and thus superior to humans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael D. 2009&quot;/&gt; This conception of angels is best understood in contrast to [[demon]]s and is often thought to be &quot;influenced by the ancient Persian religious tradition of [[Zoroastrianism]], which viewed the world as a battleground between forces of good and forces of evil, between light and darkness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael D. 2009&quot;/&gt; One of these &quot;[[sons of God]]&quot; is &quot;the [[satan]]&quot;, a figure depicted in (among other places) the [[Book of Job]].

[[Philo]] of Alexandria identifies the angel with the Logos as far as the angel is the immaterial voice of God. The angel is something different than God Himself, but is conceived just as a God's instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, Frederick Charles (2003). ''A history of philosophy, Volume 1''. Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 460. ISBN 0-8264-6895-0&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-Biblical Judaism, certain angels took on particular significance and developed unique personalities and roles. Though these [[archangels]] were believed to rank among the [[heavenly host]], no systematic hierarchy ever developed. [[Metatron]] is considered one of the highest of the angels in [[Merkabah]] and [[kabbalah|Kabbalist]] mysticism and often serves as a scribe; he is briefly mentioned in the [[Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;Sanhedrin 38b and Avodah Zerah 3b.&lt;/ref&gt; and figures prominently in Merkabah mystical texts. Michael, who serves as a warrior and advocate for Israel ({{bibleverse||Daniel|10:13|KJV}}), is looked upon particularly fondly. Gabriel is mentioned in the [[Book of Daniel]] ({{bibleverse||Daniel|8:15–17|KJV}}), the [[Book of Tobit]], and briefly in the Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;cf. Sanhedrin 95b&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in many Merkabah mystical texts. There is no evidence in Judaism for the [[worship of angels]], but there is evidence for the [[invocation]] and sometimes even [[conjuration]] of angels.&lt;ref&gt;Angels, Jewish Encyclopedia, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval [[Jewish philosopher]] [[Maimonides]] explained his view of angels in his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' II:4 and II:6:

{{quotation|...This leads [[Aristotle]] in turn to the demonstrated fact that God, glory and majesty to Him, does not do things by direct contact. God burns things by means of fire; fire is moved by the motion of the sphere; the sphere is moved by means of a disembodied intellect, these intellects being the 'angels which are near to Him', through whose mediation the spheres [planets] move... thus totally disembodied minds exist which emanate from God and are the intermediaries between God and all the bodies [objects] here in this world.|''Guide for the Perplexed'' II:4, Maimonides}}

According to [[Kabalah]], there are four worlds and our world is the last world: the world of action (Assiyah). Angels exist in the worlds above as a 'task' of God. They are an extension of God to produce effects in this world. After an angel has completed its task, it ceases to exist. The angel is in effect the task. This is derived from the [[book of Genesis]] when Abraham meets with three angels and Lot meets with two. The task of one of the angels was to inform Abraham of his coming child. The other two were to save Lot and to destroy [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&amp;artid=1521#4349 The Jewish Encyclopedia] Retrieved January 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Christians inherited Jewish understandings of angels, which in turn may have been partly inherited from the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;The development of Jewish ideas of angels : Egyptian and Hellenistic connections, ca. 600 BCE to ca. 200 CE Evans, Annette Henrietta Margaretha [http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/1398]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stage, the Christian concept of an angel characterized the angel as a messenger of God. Angels are creatures of good, spirits of love, and messengers of the savior Jesus Christ.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Later came identification of individual angelic messengers: [[Gabriel]], [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Raphael (angel)|Raphael]], [[Uriel]], and [[Lucifer]]. Then, in the space of little more than two centuries (from the third to the fifth) the image of angels took on definite characteristics both in theology and in art.&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 25-38; cf. summary in [http://www.hoepli.it/libro.asp?ib=9788887472691&amp;pc=000021001000000 Libreria Hoepli]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late fourth century, the [[Church Fathers]] agreed that there were different categories of angels, with appropriate missions and activities assigned to them. Some theologians had proposed that Jesus was not divine but on the level of immaterial beings subordinate to the [[Trinity]]. The resolution of this Trinitarian dispute included the development of doctrine about angels.&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 29-38; cf. summary in [http://www.hoepli.it/libro.asp?ib=9788887472691&amp;pc=000021001000000 Libreria Hoepli] and review in [[La Civiltà Cattolica]], 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The angels are represented throughout the Christian Bible as a body of spiritual beings intermediate between God and men: &quot;You have made him (man) a little less than the angels...&quot; ({{bibleverse||Psalms|8:4-5|KJV}}). Some Christians believe that angels are created beings, and use the following passage as evidence:  &quot;praise ye Him, all His angels: praise ye Him, all His hosts... for He spoke and they were made. He commanded and they were created...&quot; ({{bibleverse||Psalms|148:2-5|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:16|KJV}}). The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) declared that the angels were created beings. The Council's decree ''Firmiter credimus'' (issued against the [[Catharism|Albigenses]]) declared both that angels were created and that men were created after them. The [[First Vatican Council]] (1869) repeated this declaration in  ''[[Dei Filius]]'', the &quot;Dogmatic constitution on the Catholic faith&quot;. Of note is that the Bible describes the function of angels as &quot;messengers&quot; and does not indicate when the creation of angels occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/q-acb/acb-t005.html#2 |title=ANGELS - What does the Bible teach about angels? • |publisher=Christiananswers.net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/468 |title=When Did God Create Angels? |publisher=Apologetics Press |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (13th century) relates angels to Aristotle's metaphysics in his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Aquinas|title=[[Summa contra Gentiles]]|volume=2|chapter=46|url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles2.htm#46}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Summa Theologica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Aquinas]]|title=Summa Theologica |work=Treatise on Angels|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1050.htm |publisher=Newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[De substantiis separatis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Aquinas |title=De substantiis separatis|url=http://josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/SubstSepar.htm |publisher=Josephkenny.joyeurs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a treatise on angelology.

Many Christians regard angels as asexual and not belonging to either [[gender]] as they interpret Matthew 22:30 in this way. Angels are on the other hand usually described{{by whom|date=September 2012}} as looking like male human beings. Their names are also masculine. And although angels have greater knowledge than men, they are not [[omniscient]], as Matthew 24:36 points out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2024:36&amp;version=NASB |title=BibleGateway, Matthew 24:36 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian art perhaps reflects the descriptions in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 4:6–8 of the [[Living creatures (Bible)|Four Living Creatures]] ({{lang-gr|τὰ τέσσαρα ζῷα}}) and the descriptions in the Hebrew Bible of [[cherub]]im and [[seraph]]im (the [[chayot]] in [[Ezekiel]]'s [[Merkabah]] vision and the Seraphim of [[Isaiah]]). However, while cherubim and seraphim have wings in the Bible, no angel is mentioned as having wings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Angel,&quot; ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''  James Orr, editor, 1915 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction with angels===
[[File:Gethsemane Carl Bloch.jpg|thumb|210px|An angel comforting Jesus, by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], 1865-1890.]]
The [[New Testament]] includes many interactions and conversations between angels and humans. For instance, three separate cases of angelic interaction deal with the births of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus Christ]]. In Luke 1:11, an angel appears to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] to inform him that he will have a child despite his old age, thus proclaiming the birth of [[John the Baptist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%201:11&amp;version=NIV |title=BibleGateway, Luke 1:11 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in Luke 1:26 the [[archangel Gabriel]] visits the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Annunciation]] to foretell the birth of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%201:26&amp;version=NIV |title=BibleGateway, Luke 1:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels then proclaim the birth of Jesus in the [[Adoration of the shepherds]] in Luke 2:10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%202:10&amp;version=NASB |title=BibleGateway, Luke 2:10 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels also appear later in the New Testament. In Luke 22:43 an angel comforts [[Jesus Christ]] during the [[Agony in the Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2022:43&amp;version=NIV |title=BibleGateway, Luke 22:43 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Matthew 28:5 an angel speaks at the empty tomb, following the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] and the rolling back of the stone by angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2028:5&amp;version=NASB |title=BibleGateway, Matthew 28:5 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebrews 13:2 reminds the reader that they may &quot;entertain angels unaware&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews%2013:2&amp;version=ESV |title=BibleGateway, Hebrews 13:2 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the completion of the New Testament, the Christian tradition has continued to include a number of reported interactions with angels. For instance, in 1851 [[Pope Pius IX]] approved the [[Chaplet of Saint Michael]] based on the 1751 [[private revelation]] from [[archangel Michael]] to the [[Carmelite]] nun Antonia d'Astonac.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' ISBN 0-87973-910-X page 123&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Pope John Paul II]] emphasized the role of angels in Catholic teachings in his 1986 address titled &quot;''Angels Participate In History Of Salvation''&quot;, in which he suggested that modern mentality should come to see the importance of angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19860806en.html |title=Angels Participate In History Of Salvation |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1986-08-06 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as the 20th century, visionaries and mystics have reported interactions with, and indeed dictations from, angels. For instance, the bed-ridden Italian writer and mystic [[Maria Valtorta]] wrote ''[[The Book of Azariah]]'' based on &quot;dictations&quot; that she directly attributed to her guardian angel Azariah, discussing the [[Roman Missal]] used for Sunday Mass in 1946 and 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Valtorta]] 1972, ''[[The Book of Azariah]]'' ISBN 88-7987-013-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
[[File:Erzengel Michael und Gabriel.jpg|left|thumb|12th-century [[icon]] of the Archangels [[Michael (angel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] wearing the ''loros'' of the Imperial guards.]]
The earliest known Christian image of an angel—in the ''Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione'' in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]] (mid-third century)—is without wings. In that same period, representations of angels on [[sarcophagi]], lamps and [[reliquaries]] also show them without wings,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio (2007), pp. 81–89; cf. review in [[La Civiltà Cattolica]], 3795–3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327–328.&lt;/ref&gt; as for example the angel in the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' scene in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] (although the side view of the Sarcophagus shows winged angelic figures).

The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on the &quot;Prince's Sarcophagus&quot;, discovered in the 1930s at Sarigüzel, near [[Istanbul]], and attributed to the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379–395).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio (2007) p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; From that period on, Christian art has represented angels mostly with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Basilica of Saint Mary Major]] (432–440).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio (2007), pp. 90–95; cf. review in [[La Civiltà Cattolica]], 3795–3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327–328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four- and six-winged angels, drawn from the higher grades of angels (especially [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]]) and often showing only their faces and wings, are derived from Persian art and are usually shown only in [[Heaven (Christianity)|heavenly contexts]], as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the [[pendentive]]s of church [[dome]]s or [[semi-dome]]s. Prior of the Judeo-Christian tradition in the Greek world, the Greek goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] and the god [[Eros]] were also depicted in human-like form with wings.

Saint [[John Chrysostom]] explained the significance of angels' wings: {{quotation|&quot;They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio (2007) p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In terms of their clothing, angels, especially the Archangel Michael, were depicted as military-style agents of God and came to be shown wearing [[Late Antique]] military uniform.  This uniform could be the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, an armour breastplate and ''[[pteruges]]'', but was often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], with a long tunic and the ''loros'', the long gold and jewelled  ''[[pallium]]'' restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards.  The basic military dress was shown in Western art into the [[Baroque]] period and beyond (see Reni picture above), and up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s.  Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes, and in the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a [[deacon]], a [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]]; this costume was used especially for [[Gabriel]] in [[Annunciation]] scenes—for example the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation in Washington]] by [[Jan van Eyck]].

Adherents of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (generally referred to as &quot;Mormons&quot;) view angels as the messengers of God. They are sent to mankind to deliver messages, minister to humanity, teach doctrines of salvation, call mankind to repentance, give priesthood keys, save individuals in perilous times, and guide humankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;&gt;&quot;God's messengers, those individuals whom he sends (often from his personal presence in the eternal worlds), to deliver his messages ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:11–38|KJV}}); to minister to his children ({{bibleverse||Acts|10:1–8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Acts|10:30–32|KJV}}); to teach them the doctrines of salvation (Mosiah 3); to call them to repentance (Moro. 7:31); to give them priesthood and keys (D. &amp; C. 13; 128:20–21); to save them in perilous circumstances ({{bibleverse||Nehemiah|3:29–31|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Daniel|6:22|KJV}}); to guide them in the performance of his work ({{bibleverse||Genesis|24:7|KJV}}); to gather his elect in the last days ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:31|KJV}}); to perform all needful things relative to his work (Moro. 7:29–33)—such messengers are called angels.&quot;, {{Cite book

[[Latter Day Saints]] believe that angels either are the spirits of humans who are deceased or who [[Accounts of pre-mortal existence|have yet to be born]], or are humans who have been [[resurrection|resurrected]] or [[translation (Mormonism)|translated]] and have physical bodies of flesh and bones,&lt;ref name=LDS-BD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/a/84 |title=LDS Bible Dictionary-Angels |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accordingly Joseph Smith taught that &quot;there are no angels who minister to this earth but those that do belong or have belonged to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/130/dc/130/5#5 |title=D&amp;C 130:5 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Latter Day Saints also believe that [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] (the first man) is now the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=077a7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1 &quot;Chapter 6: The Fall of Adam and Eve,&quot; ''[[Gospel Principles]]'', 31], see also the entry for ''Adam'' in [http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=364b7befabc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;hideNav=1 “Glossary,” Gospel Principles, 376]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/107/54#54 |title=D&amp;C 107:24 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] lived on the earth as [[Noah]].&lt;ref name=LDS-BD/&gt; Likewise the [[Angel Moroni]] first lived in a [[Nephite|pre-Columbian American civilization]] as the 5th-century prophet-warrior named [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]].

[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] described his first angelic encounter thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/js_h/1/31-33#31 |title=Joseph Smith History 1:30-33 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.
&lt;p&gt;
He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant....&lt;p&gt;
Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon left me.}}

Most angelic visitations in the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]] were witnessed by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who  both claimed (prior to the establishment of the Church in 1830) to have been visited by the prophet [[Moroni (prophet)|Moroni]], [[John the Baptist]], and the Apostles [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Alphaeus|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]].  Later, at the dedication of the [[Kirtland Temple]], Smith and [[Sidney Rigdon]] claimed to have been visited by [[Jesus]], and subsequently by [[Moses]], [[Elias]], and [[Elijah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/110/ |title=D&amp;C 110 |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels are typically depicted in Mormon art as having no wings based on a quote from Joseph Smith (&quot;An angel of God never has wings&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://institute.lds.org/manuals/doctrine-and-covenants-institute-student-manual/dc-in-121-129.asp |title=History of the Church, 3:392 |publisher=Institute.lds.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who claimed to have received a visit by an angel include the other two of the [[Three Witnesses]]: [[David Whitmer]] and [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]]. Many other Latter Day Saints, both in the early and modern church, have claimed to have seen angels, though Smith posited that, except in extenuating circumstances such as the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]], mortals teach mortals, spirits teach spirits and resurrected beings teach other resurrected beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthews |first=Robert J. |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=2354fccf2b7db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=9b3c2150a447b010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;hideNav=1 |title=The Fulness of Times |publisher=Lds.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
[[File:Persian angel 1555.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of an angel in Islamic Persian miniature]]
{{Main|Islamic view of angels}}

'''Angels''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:&lt;font size=4&gt; ملائكة &lt;/font&gt;, ''Malāʾikah''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Melek'') are mentioned many times in the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]].  Islam is clear on the nature of angels in that they are messengers of God. They have no [[Free will in theology|free will]], and can do only what [[God in Islam|God]] orders them to do. An example of a task they carry out is that of testing individuals by granting them abundant wealth and curing their illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|56|670}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Believing in angels is one of the six [[Articles of Faith]] in [[Islam]].

Some examples of angels in Islam:

* [[Jibrail]]: the archangel Gabriel and Jibrail is an archangel who serves as a messenger from God.
* [[Michael]]: the angel of nature.
* [[Darda'il]]: the angels who travel in the earth searching out assemblies where people remember God’s name. [[Harut and Marut]] are two angels mentioned in Qur'an, who were sent down to test the people at Babylon.
* [[Kiraman Katibin]]: the two angels who record a person's good and bad deeds.
* [[Mu'aqqibat]]: a class of guardian angels who keep people from death until its decreed time.
* [[Malak Al-maut]]: the angel of death.
* [[Munkar and Nakir]]: the angels who test the faith of the dead in their graves. They ask the soul of the dead person questions. If the person fails the questions, the angels make the man suffer until the [[Day of Judgement]]. If the soul passes the questions, he will have a pleasant time in the grave until the Day of Judgement.
* [[Israfel]]: the angel that will blow the trumpet on the [[Day of Judgement]], or [[Al-Qiyama]].
* [[Ridwan]]: the angel in charge of maintaining [[Jannah]] or Paradise.
* [[Maalik]]: the angel who ''keeps'' or ''guards'' [[hell]]fire.

==Bahá'í Faith==
In his ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán|Book of Certitude]]'' [[Bahá’u’lláh]], founder of the Bahá’í Faith, describes angels as people who &quot;have consumed, with the fire of the love of God, all human traits and limitations&quot;, and have &quot;clothed themselves&quot; with angelic attributes and have become &quot;endowed with the attributes of the spiritual&quot;. [['Abdu’l-Bahá]] describes angels as the &quot;confirmations of God and His celestial powers&quot; and as &quot;blessed beings who have severed all ties with this nether world&quot; and &quot;been released from the chains of self&quot;, and &quot;revealers of God’s abounding grace&quot;. The Bahá’í writings also refer to the [[Concourse on High]], an angelic host, and the [[Maid of Heaven]] of Bahá’u’lláh's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= angels |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 38–39 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Abrahamic traditions==
&quot;Angel&quot; is sometimes used as a translation of related concepts in non-Abrahamic traditions.

===Neoplatonism===
In the commentaries of [[Proclus]] (4th C, under Christian rule) on the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] of [[Plato]], Proclus uses the terminology of &quot;angelic&quot; (''aggelikos'') and &quot;angel&quot; (''aggelos'') in relation to metaphysical beings. According to [[Aristotle]], just as there is a [[Primum movens#Aristotle's ontology|First Mover]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Aristotle]] |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0051:book=12:section=1072a|title=Metaphysics|at=1072a ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; so, too, must there be spiritual secondary movers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Aristotle]] |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0051:book=12:section=1073a |title=Metaphysics|at=1073a13 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
{{Main|Zoroastrian angelology}}
In [[Zoroastrianism]] there are different angel-like figures. For example, each person has one guardian angel, called [[Fravashi]]. They patronize human beings and other creatures, and also manifest God’s energy. The [[Amesha Spentas]] have often been regarded as angels, although there is no direct reference to them conveying messages,&lt;ref name = &quot;AZ&quot;&gt;Lewis, James R., Oliver, Evelyn Dorothy, Sisung Kelle S. (Editor) (1996), ''Angels A to Z'', Entry: ''Zoroastrianism'', pp. 425–427, [[Visible Ink Press]], ISBN 0-7876-0652-9&lt;/ref&gt; but are rather emanations of [[Ahura Mazda]] (&quot;Wise Lord&quot;, God); they initially appear in an abstract fashion and then later became personalized, associated with diverse aspects of the divine creation.&lt;ref&gt;Darmesteter, James (1880)(translator), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe04/sbe0405.htm ''The Zend Avesta, Part I]: Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 4'', pp. lx-lxxii, Oxford University Press, 1880, at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sikhism====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=November 2010}}
In [[Sikhism]], the references to angelic or divine deities is often objected as the religion focuses on the liberation of the soul and ultimately joining with [[Waheguru]]. However, in early scriptures written by [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] indicate specific heavenly deities to help in the judgment &lt;!-- Per Wiki, &quot;judgement&quot; is wrong in theological context.  &quot;In the context of law and theology, judgment is always preferred&quot; (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_(law)#Spelling) --&gt;of the soul.

[[Azrael]] (as Azraa-eel) is named as the angel of death in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the holy scripture and the final [[Guru#Classification of gurus|Guru]] of the [[Sikh]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Section 7, part 165 ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/skh/granth/gr07.htm Raag Gauree]), and section 25, part 31 ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/skh/granth/gr25.htm Raag Maaroo]). Hosted on the [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In So Dar and Raag Asa [[Satguru|Sat Guru]] Nanak mentions clearly two beings Chitar and Gupat who record the deeds of men. These beings are Angels assigned with this Divine task by the Creator. Chitar records the deeds that are visible to all and Gupat records that which is hidden in thought or secret action. Their names themselves allude to the tasks which the All Mighty has bestowed upon them. The celestial beings are often seen at the gates of heaven, dressed in the most adorned and decorated gowns, holding the records on the actions and feelings of the soul in the line for judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/skh/granth/gr02.htm |title=Shri Guru Granth Sahib: So Dar |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/skh/granth/gr08.htm |title=Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Aasaa |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahma Kumaris===
In [[Brahma Kumaris]], it is taught that every member becomes an angel of light (farishta in Hindi)&lt;ref&gt;Basava Journal, Volume 19. Basava Samiti, 1994  (Bangalore, India).&lt;/ref&gt; and that founder [[Dada Lekhraj]] has already become perfect man and angel [[Brahma]] through practise of Raja Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Peace &amp; purity: the story of the Brahma Kumaris : a spiritual revolution By Liz Hodgkinson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of incorporeal God into the human body of Brahma: a brief biographical account.

==New religious movements and occultism==

===Theosophy===
In the teachings of [[Theosophy]], ''[[Deva (New Age)|Devas]]'' are regarded as living either in the [[atmosphere]]s of the [[planet]]s of the [[solar system]] (''Planetary Angels'') or inside the [[Sun]] (''Solar Angels'') (presumably other [[planetary system]]s and [[star]]s have their own angels) and they help to guide the operation of the processes of [[nature]] such as the process of [[evolution]] and the growth of [[plants]]; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human.  It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the [[third eye]] is activated.  Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated as [[human being]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Geoffrey, ''Kingdom of the Gods'' ISBN 0-7661-8134-0—Has color pictures of what Devas supposedly look like when observed by the [[third eye]]—their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human. [http://web.archive.org/web/20040820064159/http://www.geocities.com/athens/Olympus/3987/devas2.html Paintings of some of the devas claimed to have been seen by Hodson from his book &quot;Kingdom of the Gods&quot;:]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Theosophists that [[nature spirit]]s, [[elementals]] ([[gnome]]s, [[undine (alchemy)|undine]]s, [[sylphs]], and [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamanders]]), and [[Fairy|fairies]] can be also be observed when the [[third eye]] is activated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/athens/Olympus/3987/devas4.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021121131124/http://geocities.com/athens/Olympus/3987/devas4.html |archivedate=2002-11-21 |title=Eskild Tjalve’s paintings of devas, nature spirits, elementals and fairies: |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2002-11-21 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have never been previously incarnated as humans; they are regarded as being on a separate line of spiritual evolution called the “deva evolution”; eventually, as their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s advance as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], it is believed they will incarnate as devas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powell&quot;&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See &quot;Lifewave&quot; chart (refer to index)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is asserted by Theosophists that all of the above mentioned beings possess [[Etheric body|etheric bodies]] that are composed of ''[[Etheric plane|etheric matter]]'', a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller particles than ordinary [[Matter|physical plane matter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Powell&quot; /&gt;

==Contemporary belief in angels==
[[File:Rome rione XI sant angelo logo.png|thumb|100px|right|Seal of [[Sant'Angelo (rione of Rome)]]]]

A 2002 study based on interviews with 350 people, mainly in the UK, who said they have had an experience of an angel, describes several types of such experiences: visions, sometimes with multiple witnesses present; auditions, e.g. to convey a warning; a sense of being touched, pushed, or lifted, typically to avert a dangerous situation; and pleasant fragrance, generally in the context of somebody's death. In the visual experiences, the angels described appear in various forms, either the &quot;classical&quot; one (human countenance with wings), in the form of extraordinarily beautiful or radiant human beings, or as beings of light.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Heathcote-James (2002): Seeing Angels. London: John Blake Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, a 2008 survey by [[Baylor University]]'s Institute for Studies of Religion, published by ''[[TIME]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1842179,00.html Guardian Angels Are Here, Say Most Americans] ''[[TIME]]'' Retrieved August 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=5833399&amp;page=1 Half of Americans believe in angels] ''[[ABC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which polled 1,700 respondents, found that 55 percent of Americans, including one in five of those who say they are not religious, believe that they have been protected by a guardian angel during their life.

According to the [[Gallup Youth Survey]], in a ''Teen Belief in the Supernatural'' poll in 1994, 76% of 508 teenagers (aged 13–17) believe in angels, a greater percentage than those who believe in astrology, ESP, ghosts, witchcraft, clairvoyance, Bigfoot, and vampires. In 1978, 64% of American young people believed in angels; in 1984, 69% of teenagers believed in angels; and by 1994, that number grew to 76%, while belief in other supernatural concepts, such as the [[Loch Ness monster]] and [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], have declined. In 1992, 80% of 502 surveyed teenage girls believe in angels, and 81% of Catholic teens and 82% of regular church attendees harbored beliefs in angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malcovitz |first= Hal |coauthors= George Gallup (Introduction) |title= The Gallup Youth Survey: Teens and the Supernatural and Paranormal |publisher= [[Mason Crest Publishers]] |year= 2005 |isbn= 1-59084-876-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.watchman.org/na/anglmani.htm |title= Angelmania: Close Encounters of the Celestial Kind |work= The Watchman Expositor |volume= 11 |issue= 6 |first= Clete |last= Hux |year= 1994 |publisher= [[Watchman Fellowship|Watchman Fellowship ministry]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another set of Gallup polls, designated towards all Americans, in 1994, 72% of Americans said they believed in angels, while in 2004, 78% of the surveyed Americans indicated belief in angels, with the percentage of Americans that did not believe in angels dropping from 15% to 10%, and the percentage of Americans that were &quot;not sure&quot; dropping from 13% to 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/27877/americans-more-likely-believe-god-than-devil-heaven-more-than-hell.aspx |title=Americans More Likely to Believe in God than the Devil |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/beliefs/angels_demons.htm |title=Angels and Demons in Christianity |publisher=Religionfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
