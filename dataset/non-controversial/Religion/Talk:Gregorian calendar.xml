== revision of table of differences between Gregorian and Julian calendars ==

In line with a change I requested (which has now been made) to the Julian Calendar article (Wikipedia), I have revised the subject table in THIS Wikipedia article.  Notice when the difference between Gregorian and Julian grows by 1 day: when the GREGORIAN calendar goes from end of February to March 1 (in &quot;00&quot; year which is not a multiple of 400).  I just pointed out in the Julian-Calendar article's Talk page that this is what will happen in 2100:

15 Feb. 2100 (Julian), which is 28 Feb. (Gregorian); 13 day difference.

The next day will then be:

16 Feb. 2100 (Julian), which is 1 March (Gregorian); 14 day difference.

2100 is not a Gregorian leap year, and that's why the Gregorian calendar jumps from 28 Feb. to 1 March.  But at that point, the Julian calendar will still have Feb. 29 ahead in the year 2100.  Do you see what I am saying?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/128.63.16.82|128.63.16.82]] ([[User talk:128.63.16.82|talk]]) 21:20, 27 April 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:It seems simplest to say that, from the Gregorian point of view, the difference increases by one day whenever the Gregorian Reform omits a February 29th which the Julian Calendar has included.  From the Julian point of view, the difference increases by one day whenever the Julian Calendar includes a February 29th which the Gregorian Reform will omit. In the short interval between those two corresponding events, the difference is uncertain. [[Special:Contributions/94.30.84.71|94.30.84.71]] ([[User talk:94.30.84.71|talk]]) 13:01, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

== The Calendar FAQ ==

Anyone intending to edit either the Article or this Talk should first become familiar with [http://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html The Calendar FAQ] - Frequently Asked Questions about Calendars. [[Special:Contributions/94.30.84.71|94.30.84.71]] ([[User talk:94.30.84.71|talk]]) 13:07, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

== Alaska ==

The article now claims there was a discontinuity in the week when Alaska adopted the Gregorian calendar. I have not been able to find documentation on the legal mechanism through which Alaska adopted the Gregorian calendar (details below). I suspect, but cannot confirm, that any &quot;discontinuity&quot; in the week was due to Alaska being moved across what we now call the [[International Date Line]], although then or now that imaginary line has no precise legal definition. I suspect it was not due to the change in calendar alone.

:Crossing the Date Line inevitably causes gain or loss of a date, give or take one or more hours (with, in principle, maybe a part of an hour).  Samoa (not American Samoa) did so in December 2011. Consider http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/eapoe/bl-eapoe-three.htm. [[Special:Contributions/94.30.84.71|94.30.84.71]] ([[User talk:94.30.84.71|talk]]) 15:03, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

'''Details:''' In the United States control over standards of weights and measures is given by the constitution to the Congress. The states have been content to allow the federal government to regulate time of day and time zones. It is unclear whether the federal government has the authority to adopt a calendar, or whether that power lies with the states. In any case, all the states use, and some, like New York, have explicitly adopted, the Gregorian calendar. The Congress has never passed a statute requiring general use of the Gregorian calendar, but all the federal organs of government use it for their own purposes.

Alaska did not become a state immediately; for many years it was a territory of the US. Ordinarily when territory passes from the jurisdiction of a foreign government to US federal jurisdiction, many of the existing laws continue in effect. I have been unable to locate any legal action that caused Alaska to change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]] ([[User talk:Jc3s5h|talk]]) 14:10, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

:That seems unimportant.  This page should at most be interested in when and how dating in Alaska changed; the formalities are not relevant. But the legal situation seems clear enough : the (British) Calendar Act of 1751 made Great Britain and colonies in various parts of the world Gregorian, implementing a religious decision of 1582; the USA inherited British law; the Second(?) Amendment seems to prohibit altering that particular law; and $4M made Alaska American, so that the &quot;British&quot; law applied.  No US legislation was needed.

::I agree this article is not the place for these details. But I think the statement &quot;the USA inherited British law&quot; is over-broad; it certainly isn't true for Louisiana or Puerto Rico. [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]] ([[User talk:Jc3s5h|talk]]) 15:12, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

::: The USA inherited British law at its formation.  Louisiana formed no part of that; it was purchased later.  The purchase did not alter its calendar; but it altered the legal foundation thereof.  AIUI, Puerto Rico declined the opportunity of becoming a United State; Federal law applies, but the Puerto Ricans cannot vote for those who make it. It is in effect a colony of an ex-colony, and the Calendar Act must apply there. [[Special:Contributions/94.30.84.71|94.30.84.71]] ([[User talk:94.30.84.71|talk]]) 17:55, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

== Adoption in Europe ==

This may be near enough the right section for dealing with the British Colonies in North America; but Alaska is surely out of place in it. [[Special:Contributions/94.30.84.71|94.30.84.71]] ([[User talk:94.30.84.71|talk]]) 21:38, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

It seems wrong to express the change from Julian to Gregorian in days.  No days were omitted; the sun continued to rise and set in the usual manner.  It was '''dates''' that were omitted. [[Special:Contributions/94.30.84.71|94.30.84.71]] ([[User talk:94.30.84.71|talk]]) 21:38, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

== Edits by Ewawer ==

Two edits by Ewawer have changed the order somewhat. Also, this passage was inserted:
&quot;The lunar part used the model proposed by [[Aloysius Lilius]] which involved a 10-day correction to revert the drift since Nicaea.&quot; There was indeed a lunar part, but the 10-day correction was associated with the solar reform, not the lunar reform.
The lunar reform is explained in the [[Gregorian calendar#Lunar calendar|&quot;Lunar calendar&quot;]] section.

I'm guessing the purpose of the edits were to make mention of the lunar reform in the history section, but I don't believe this attempt to explain the lunar reform is correct. [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]] ([[User talk:Jc3s5h|talk]]) 12:44, 28 September 2012 (UTC)

== October edits by Ewawer ==

The edits made on or near October 4 by Ewawer introduce errors and ambiguities. Specifically:

*&quot;The motivation for the Gregorian reform to the [[Julian calendar]] was to '''reverse''' the calendar drift since the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD...&quot; (emphasis added) can be read to understood that the drift between the calendar and some unnamed kind of year or astronomical event is the same magnitude after the Gregorian reform as before, but the direction of the drift is opposite.

*&quot;...the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD set the relationship between the Julian calendar and the dating of Easter.&quot; Not exactly. They council set some goals, but the exact computation was not settled upon until Dionysius Exiguus some 200 years later, and that computation took considerable additional time to spread throughout all Christendom. See [[Computus]].

*&quot;The length of the Julian calendar, the period between the [[vernal equinoxes]], is 365.25 days, while in fact it is almost 11 minutes shorter.&quot; No calendar has a length equal to the period between vernal equinoxes because that period is not an integer number of days. This sentence is just a mess from end to end. [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]] ([[User talk:Jc3s5h|talk]]) 04:18, 4 October 2012 (UTC)

:Of course the primary purpose was to &quot;restore&quot; the calendar to the Nicaean values, otherwise what was the purpose? Point taken re what was actually set down at Nicaea - I will revisit that at another time. However, the period of mean length of the year of 365.25 days is not mine. It was there before. I just tidied the wording up a bit by deleting repetitions of the same point.05:13, 4 October 2012 (UTC)

::With respect to the vernal equinox falling on March 21 as it did near 325, there were two actions. One was to '''restore''' the equinox to March 21, by dropping the 10 days by making Thursday, 4 October 1582 Julian be followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582 (or other dates in counties that adopted the new calendar later). The second action was, in every period of 400 years, to convert '''3''' leap years into common years. So the secular drift of the calendar with respect to the vernal equinox was, as far as the reformers could tell, eliminated. If they had '''reversed''' it they would have converted '''6''' leap years in each 400 year period to common years.

::As for the sentence &quot;The length of the Julian calendar, the period between the [[vernal equinoxes]], is 365.25 days, while in fact it is almost 11 minutes shorter&quot; the most glaring problem is that it does not say &quot;'''mean''' length, it just says &quot;length&quot;. Also, it would be better to say &quot;Julian calendar '''year'''&quot; because there are a number of lengths associated with a calendar, so it's best to be clear you're talking about the year length. Also, &quot;Julian year&quot; has a special meaning among astronomers, so it's best to specify calendar year. Finally, even Julius Caesar's advisers are thought to have known that the new mean calendar year length they advised was not exactly equal to the mean tropical year, so it would be more accurate to say that the mean length of the Julian calendar year was designed to better approximate the mean tropical year. Finally, the mean length of the tropical year changes over time and whether it is defined at the vernal equinox, autumnal equinox, or the modern definition. For the period 325 to 2012, the various varieties of tropical year are only different by a second or less, but some readers may be aware of the differences but not know the magnitude of the differences. Thus it would be best to cite a reliable source for &quot;almost 11 minutes shorter&quot; and the source should specify vernal equinox tropical year, and should specify that &quot;almost eleven minutes&quot; is equally applicable to 325 or 2012.
