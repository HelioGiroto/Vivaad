== 'Citation needed' tag for the opinion, DELETED! ==

In the criticism section, it's written: &quot;Many of these criticisms, particularly those by antisemitic critics, are based on quotations that are taken out of context, and thus misrepresent the meaning of the Talmud's text.&quot;

This is without any citation, and I tagged it {{Citation needed|It's who's opinion?}} several times, but it has been deleted!

BTW as it is disputed, it should be referred to its believers (Some scholars(who?) believe that...)

== Justinian I ==

{{User|Maryester}} has now twice inserted a long quote from Justinian I. In an exchange on our mutual talk pages the editor states that these quotes from the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' are highly representative and were highly influential. I am prepared to entertain the notion, but the addition made no attempts to support this with a secondary source. Without this, the addition is of no value to the reader. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T@lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 21:33, 12 August 2012 (UTC)

The quote beautifully stands on its own.

Secondary sources are POV.

I only put 2 paragraphs, that is hardly long. The ones pertaining to the Talmud and punishment only. I do not need to prove its importance, an Emperor in 529 AD is important enough. A successor to the ones who renamed Israel Palestine, ceremonially salted the earth of Jerusalem, censored any Greek texts of the name Jew or Hebrew, etc. etc. and all that other good stuff makes him important. The fact that the same Emperor is the author of the Codex Civilis may bear mentioning (just a little), but Justinian criticizing the Gemarah stands on its own. Why is any further explanation necessary he says he will kill you for owning a talmud that's not criticism? It's at least as important as any other criticism and I provided a source, a great one, and another one to you directly. And today provided 1 more below. the quote is an important part of criticism, as it happens just as the finishing touches on the Byzantine version of the Babylonian Talmud are being passed around to Jews.

I included THE ENTIRE novella below.[[User:Maryester|Maryester]] ([[User talk:Maryester|talk]]) 01:23, 15 August 2012 (UTC)
















First that the Novellas of the C.J. are important can not be argued! Secondly, many but not nearly enough, Catholic Preists have used the Pastor Parkes translations as a tool in ending antisemitic racism.

the 1849 - Codex Justinianus. Edited by, P. Krueger and T. Mommsen for German readers. 

Berlin, 1886. Third edition published by Appud Weidmannos published 1896, Novella 146, about the Hebrews. 

Translated into German in 1849 from Latin, translated from German by Oxford U. Press, translated again by R. Parkes and others in the early 20 Century into English.

R. Parkes:[http://www.archive.org/stream/conflictofthechu012717mbp/conflictofthechu012717mbp_djvu.txt] There is another edition I own which is longer. and just the original 529 AD law: Fordham.edu:[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/novel146.html]

HERE IS THIS SPECIFIC LAW ABOUT HEBREW SCRIPTURES AS THE ANCIENT TO MEDIEVAL ROMAN EMPIRES READ IT:

The first part should be understood as the law under Julian who was considered very pro-Jewish and removed many anti-Jewish laws that existed in Rome, so the pre-Justinian law is first quoted in the Novella, THEN ITS REPEAL:

&lt;QUOTE&gt;A Permission granted to the Hebrews to read the Sacred Scriptures according to Tradition, in Greek, Latin or any other Language, and an Order to expel from their community those who do not believe in the judgment, the Resurrection, and the Creation of Angels.&lt;/QUOTE&gt;

Now comes the first purely Christian extensive law, by Justinian, which is to revoke the linguistic rights graneted under Julian as follows:

&quot;Preface.

Necessity dictates that when the Hebrews listen to their sacred texts they should not confine themselves to the meaning of the letter, but should also devote their attention to those sacred prophecies which are hidden from them, and which announce the mighty Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And though, by surrendering themselves to senseless interpretations, they still err from the true doctrine, yet, learning that they disagree among themselves, we have not permitted this disagreement to continue without a ruling on our part. From their own complaints which have been brought to us, we have understood that some only speak Hebrew, and wish to use it for the sacred books, and others think that a Greek translation should be added, and that they have been disputing about this for a long time. Being apprised of the matter at issue, we give judgment in favour of those who wish to use Greek also for the reading of the sacred scriptures, or any other tongue which in any district allows the hearers better to understand the text.

Ch. I.

We therefore sanction that, wherever there is a Hebrew congregation, those who wish it may, in their synagogues, read the sacred books to those who are present in Greek, or even Latin, or any other tongue. For the language changes in different places, and the reading changes with it, so that all present may understand, and live and act according to what they hear. Thus there shall be no opportunity for their interpreters, who make use only of the Hebrew, to corrupt it in any way they like, since the ignorance of the public conceals their depravity. We make this proviso that those who use Greek shall use the text of the seventy interpreters, which is the most accurate translation, and the one most highly approved, since it happened that the translators, divided into two groups, and working in different places, all produced exactly the same text.

i. Moreover who can fail to admire those men, who, writing long before the saving revelation of our mighty Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, yet as though they saw its coming with their eyes completed the translation of the sacred books as if the prophetic grace was illuminating them. This therefore they shall primarily use, but that we may not seem to be forbidding all other texts we allow the use of that of Aquila, though he was not of their people, and his translation differs not slightly from that of the Septuagint.&quot;

Now the part I added to the Wiki article, Justinian referred to what we call today 'the Talmud' as just the Mishnah:


&quot;ii. But the Mishnah, or as they call it the second tradition, we prohibit entirely. For it is not part of the sacred books, nor is it handed down by divine inspiration through the prophets, but the handiwork of man, speaking only of earthly things, and having nothing of the divine in it. But let them read the holy words themselves, rejecting the commentaries, and not concealing what is said in the sacred writings, and disregarding the vain writings which do not form a part of them, which have been devised by them themselves for the destruction of the simple. By these instructions we ensure that no one shall be penalised or prohibited who reads the Greek or any other language. And their elders, Archiphericitae and presbyters, and those called magistrates, shall not by any machinations or anathemas have power to refuse this right, unless by chance they wish to suffer corporal punishment and the confiscation of their goods, before they yield to our will and to the commands which are better and clearer to God which we enjoin.




&quot;Ch.II.&quot;

Now the first penalty (death):

&quot;If any among them seek to introduce impious vanities, denying the resurrection or the judgment, or the work of God, or that angels are part of creation, we require them everywhere to be expelled forthwith; that no backslider raise his impious voice to contradict the evident purpose of God. Those who utter such sentiments shall be put to death, and thereby the Jewish people shall be purged of the errors which they introduced.

Ch. III.

We pray that when they hear the reading of the books in one or the other language, they may guard themselves against the depravity of the interpreters, and, not clinging to the literal words, come to the point of the matter, and perceive their diviner meaning, so that they may start afresh to learn the better way, and may cease to stray vainly, and to err in that which is most essential, we mean hope in God. For this reason we have opened the door for the reading of the scriptures in every language, that all may henceforth receive its teaching, and become fitter for learning better things. For it is acknowledged that he, who is nourished upon the sacred scriptures and has little need of direction, is much readier to discern the truth, and to choose the better path, than he who understands nothing of them, but clings to the name of his faith alone, and is held by it as by a sacred anchor, and believes that what can be called heresy in its purest form is divine teaching.

Epilogue.&quot;

Now the more common penalty an excuse to take away Jewish property:


'This is our sacred will and pleasure, and your Excellency and your present colleague and your staff shall see that it is carried out, and shall not allow the Hebrews to contravene it. Those who resist it or try to put any obstruction in its way, shall first suffer corporal punishment, and then be compelled to live in exile, forfeiting also their property, that they flaunt not their impudence against God and the empire. You shall also circulate our law to the provincial governors, that they learning its contents may enforce it in their several cities, knowing that it is to be strictly carried out under pain of our displeasure.&quot;

I strongly believe what I wrote is valid non-POV and sourced better than most sources on Wikipedia. I only wrote on his talk that law's influence not on the page itself. on the page i just explained that historically it is the most important law system of Western Europe, probably of all time, in terms of affect on the Talmud and likely all around (however that is not mentioned on the page though true).[[User:Maryester|Maryester]] ([[User talk:Maryester|talk]]) 01:23, 15 August 2012 (UTC)

:Your opening gambit, &quot;Secondary sources are POV&quot; shows exactly why we are in disagreement. Without such a secondary source, ideally a completely neutral, academic one, there is no way of knowing whether your claims about the &quot;most important law system in Western Europe&quot; have any merits. Please try to understand this simple point; it's not hard. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T@lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 06:07, 15 August 2012 (UTC)

::The difficulty with this is that the word used is &quot;deuterosis&quot;, which means &quot;doubling&quot;.  This does not necessarily mean &quot;Mishnah&quot;: in Patristic literature it sometimes has this meaning and sometimes means &quot;Targum&quot;.  In the context, which is obviously about public Torah reading, what I think Justinian is saying is that it is fine to read out a literal translation, but not fanciful Midrashic expansions of the kind sometimes found in the Targumim (not Onkelos, but pseudo-Jonathan and the like).  I don't think he was addressing people's private reading.  This is consistent with the fact that Jewish law mandates that the Torah should be read with its Targum but this is not now done in any European or Near Eastern country. --[[User:Sirmylesnagopaleentheda|Sir Myles na Gopaleen (the da)]] ([[User talk:Sirmylesnagopaleentheda|talk]]) 10:00, 15 August 2012 (UTC)

This edits are not just made up but for racist reasons but are  constituting  a clear case of vandalism.[[User:Tritomex|Tritomex]] ([[User talk:Tritomex|talk]]) 16:01, 2 September 2012 (UTC)

:I disagree that they are just vandalism or even racism. They are poisoning the well by suggesting that the Talmud positively advocates a number of heinous things including intercourse with small children. This is a classic tactics of antisemites, whose prime aim is to make Jews and Judaism look barbaric and prehistoric. With a minimum amount of effort these quotes can be put into context, but that would not serve the purpose of an encyclopedia. Only a high-quality secondary source (as pointed out above) can deal with this issue.
