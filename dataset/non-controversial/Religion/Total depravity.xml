'''Total depravity''' (also called '''absolute inability''', '''radical corruption''', '''total corruption''', or '''Augustinianism'''{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}) is a [[theology|theological]] [[doctrine]] derived from the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] concept of [[original sin]]. It is the teaching that, as a consequence of [[the Fall of Man]], every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of [[sin]] and, apart from the [[irresistible grace|efficacious]] or [[prevenient grace|prevenient]] [[divine grace|grace of God]], is utterly unable to choose to follow [[God]], refrain from [[evil]], or accept the gift of [[salvation]] as it is offered.

It is advocated to various degrees by many Protestant confessions of faith and catechisms, including those of [[Lutheranism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Andreä|first1=Jakob|author1-link=Jakob Andreä|last2=Chemnitz|first=Martin|author2-link=Martin Chemnitz|last3=Selnecker|first3=Nikolaus|author3-link=Nikolaus Selnecker|last4=Chytraeus|first4=David|author4-link=David Chytraeus|last5=Musculus|first5=Andreas|author5-link=Andreas Musculus|last6=Körner|first6=Christoph|title=Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord|year=1577|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds3.iii.iv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Augsburg Confession|editor-last=Melanchthon|editor-first=Philip|editor-link=Philip Melanchthon|year=1530|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Augsburg_Confession}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arminianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Arminius, James ''The Writings of James Arminius'' (three vols.), tr. [[James Nichols (printer)|James Nichols]] and W. R. Bagnall (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1956), I:252&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Canons of Dordrecht]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/canons_of_dordt.html &quot;The Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Westminster Assembly|title=Westminster Confession of Faith|authorlink=Westminster Assembly|year=1646|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Westminster_Confession_of_Faith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Larger Catechism]],[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wlc_w_proofs/WLC_001-050.html Question 25]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Heidelberg Catechism]],[http://www.reformed.org/documents/heidelberg.html question 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Total depravity is the fallen state of human beings as a result of original sin. The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are by nature not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather all are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and to reject the rule of God. Even religion and [[philanthropy]] are wicked to God to the extent that these originate from a human imagination, passion, and will, and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in [[Calvinism|Reformed theology]], if God is to save anyone God must [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestine]], call, or elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to, and is indeed incapable of choosing God.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'',[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_IX.html 9.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Total depravity does not mean, however, that people are as evil as possible. Rather, it means that even the good which a person may intend is faulty in its premise, false in its motive, and weak in its implementation; and there is no mere refinement of natural capacities that can correct this condition. Thus, even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact [[psychological egoism|egoist]] acts in disguise. All good, consequently, is derived from God alone, and in no way through humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ra McLaughlin |journal=Reformed Perspectives |title=Total Depravity, part 1 |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/ra_mclaughlin/TH.McLaughlin.Total_Depravity.1.html|accessdate=2008-07-14 |quote=[Any person] can do outwardly good works, but these works come from a heart that hates God, and therefore fail to meet God’s righteous standards.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea can be illustrated by a glass of wine with a few drops of deadly poison in it: Although not all the liquid is poison, all the liquid is ''poisoned''. In the same way, while not all of human nature is depraved, all human nature is totally affected by depravity.

Nonetheless, the doctrine teaches optimism concerning God's love for what he has made and God's ability to accomplish the ultimate good that God intends for creation. In particular, in the process of salvation, God overcomes a person's inability with divine grace, though the precise means of this overcoming varies between the theological systems. The differences between the solutions to the problem of total depravity revolve around the relation between divine grace and human [[free will]] &amp;ndash; namely, whether it is [[efficacious grace]] that human free will cannot resist, as in Calvinism, or [[prevenient grace]] enabling the human will to choose to follow God, as in [[Arminianism]] and [[Molinism]].

===Biblical support===
A number of passages in the [[Christian Bible|Bible]] are used to support the doctrine, including (quotations are from the [[English Standard Version]] except where noted):

* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 6:5: &quot;The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.&quot;
* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:21: &quot;And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, &quot;I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man’s heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.
* [[Book of Job|Job]]  15:14:  What is man, that he can be pure?   Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?
* Job 15:15: Behold, God puts no trust in his holy ones,   and the heavens are not pure in his sight;   how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks injustice like water!
* [[Book of Job|Job]]  25:4-6:  How then can man be in the right before God?   How can he who is born of woman be pure? 5 Behold, even the moon is not bright,   and the stars are not pure in his eyes; 6 how much less man, who is a maggot,  and the son of man, who is a worm!&quot;
* [[Psalms]] 51:5: &quot;Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.&quot;
* Psalms 58:3: &quot;The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.&quot;
* [[Ecclesiastes]] 7:20: &quot;Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.&quot;
* Ecclesiastes 9:3: &quot;This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.&quot;
* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 17:9: &quot;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?&quot;
* Jeremiah 13:23: ([[New International Version|NIV]]): &quot;Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.&quot;
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 64:6 &quot;We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away&quot;
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 64:7 &quot;There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you, for you have hidden your face from us and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities.&quot;
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 64:8 &quot;But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.&quot;
* [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 7:21-23: &quot;For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.&quot;
* [[Gospel of John|John]] 3:19: &quot;And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.&quot;
* John 6:44: &quot;[Jesus said,] 'No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.'&quot;
* John 6:64-65: &quot;[Jesus said,] 'But there are some of you who do not believe.' And he said, 'This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.'&quot;
* John 8:34: &quot;Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.'&quot;
* [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 3:10-11: &quot;None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God.&quot;
* Romans 3:23: &quot;For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God&quot;
* Romans 8:7-8: &quot;For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&quot;
* [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 2:14: &quot;The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;
* [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:1-3: &quot;And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience - among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.&quot; (our depravity being emphasized in the concept of being &quot;dead&quot;; only something external -i.e. God- can give a dead person life)
* [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:3: &quot;For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.&quot;

==Definition by the Catholic Church==

Many of the early Church Fathers affirmed the freedom of the will in human beings, laying the responsibility for whether any particular person followed virtue or vice on the individual, while also maintaining the need for grace from God in salvation.&lt;ref&gt;God's Strategy in Human History
Roger Forster (Author), Paul Marston (Author), Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers (July 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing against the [[monk]] [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]], whom Augustine understood as teaching that human nature was unaffected by the Fall, or at least was only weakened in the Fall, and that one was free to follow after God apart from divine intervention, Augustine expounded the doctrine of [[original sin]] and, Calvinists contend, the doctrine of total inability. Augustine's views prevailed in the controversy, and Pelagius' teaching was condemned as heretical at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431) and again condemned in the moderated form known as [[semi-Pelagianism]] at the second [[Councils of Orange|Council of Orange]] (529). Augustine's idea of &quot;original&quot; (or inherited) guilt was not shared by all of his contemporaries in the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking part of the church and is still not shared in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], in [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], or in the [[Church of the East]].

==Objections==

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] maintains that man cannot &quot;be justified before God by his own works,... without the grace of God through Jesus Christ,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct06.html Council of Trent, Session 6, canon 1].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby rejecting [[Pelagianism]] in accordance with the writings of Augustine and the [[Council of Orange#Second Council of Orange|Second Council of Orange]] (529).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reformed.org/documents/canons_of_orange.html Judgements of the Council of Orange]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Catholic Church disagrees with the [[Protestant]] doctrine of total depravity, because the Catholic Church maintains humans retained a free but wounded will after the Fall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] Item 407 in section 1.2.1.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Referring to Scripture and the Church Fathers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P5M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] Item 1730&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism views human free will as deriving from being made in God's image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P5G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] Items 1701-1709&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, the Catholic Church condemned as heresy any doctrine asserting &quot;since Adam's sin, the free will of man is lost and extinguished&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct06.html Council of Trent, Session 6, canon 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of total depravity was affirmed by the [[Five articles of Remonstrance]] and by [[Jacobus Arminius]] himself, and John Wesley, who strongly identified with Arminius through publication of his periodical ''The Arminian'', also advocated a strong doctrine of inability.&lt;ref&gt;Sermon 44, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/sermons.v.xliv.html#v.xliv-p0.2 &quot;Original Sin.&quot;]; compare verse 4 of [[Charles Wesley]]'s [[hymn]] [http://gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/hymns/umh363.stm &quot;And Can It Be&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Some Reformed theologians have mistakenly used the term &quot;[[Arminianism]]&quot; to include some who hold the [[Semipelagianism|Semipelagian]] doctrine of [[limited depravity]], which allows for an &quot;island of righteousness&quot; in human hearts that is uncorrupted by sin and able to accept God's offer of salvation without a special dispensation of grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Demarest | first = Bruce | title = The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, IL | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-58134-812-5 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Arminius and Wesley both vehemently rejected this view, it has sometimes inaccurately been lumped together with theirs (particularly by Calvinists) because of other similarities in their respective systems such as [[conditional election]], [[unlimited atonement]], and prevenient grace. In particular, prevenient grace is seen in many of these systems as giving humans back the freedom to follow God in one way or another.

One refutation of the doctrine is that it implicitly rejects either God's love or omnipotence. That is, it is argued that if God is both loving and omnipotent, then God would not have allowed humankind to become totally corrupt. Thus, total depravity would imply God is either not all-loving or not omnipotent.  This refutation relies, however, on an insistence that a human being can know God's thoughts and plans, and therefore judge God's actions.

Advocates of total depravity offer a variety of responses to this line of argumentation. Wesleyans suggest that God endowed human beings with the free will that allowed humanity to become depraved and God also provided a means of escape from the depravity. Calvinists note that the argument assumes that either God's love is necessarily incompatible with corruption or that God is constrained to follow the path that some men see as best, whereas they believe God's plans are not fully known to humans and God's reasons are God's own and not for human beings to question (compare [[Book of Romans|Rom.]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+9:18-24 9:18-24]; [[Book of Job|Job]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job+38:1-42:6 38:1-42:6]). Some particularly dislike the Calvinist response because it leaves the matter of God's motives and means largely unresolved, but the Calvinist sees it merely as following [[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s famous dictum that &quot;whenever the Lord shuts his sacred mouth, [the student of the Bible] also desists from inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iii.xxii.html?bcb=0 3.21.3]
