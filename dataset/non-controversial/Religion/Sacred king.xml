[[Image:God by eyck.JPG|thumb|200px|&quot;[[Christ King]]&quot;, a detail from [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Ghent Altarpiece]] (1432)]]
In many historical societies, the position of [[monarch|kingship]] carries a [[Sacred|sacral]] meaning, that is, it is identical with that of a [[high priest]] and of [[judge]]. The concept of [[theocracy]] is related, although a '''sacred king''' need not necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather, the temporal position itself has a religious significance.

== History ==
The notion has [[prehistoric religion|prehistoric roots]] and is found worldwide, on [[Java]] as in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], with [[shaman]]-kings credited with rain-making and assuring fertility and good fortune. On the other hand, the king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people, meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim of a [[human sacrifice]], either regularly killed at the end of his term in the position, or sacrificed in times of crisis (e.g. [[Domalde]]).

Among the [[The Ashanti|Ashanti]], a new king was flogged before being enthroned.

From the [[Ancient Near Eastern religion|Bronze Age Near East]], enthronement and [[anointment]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] is a central religious ritual, reflected in the titles [[Messiah]] or [[Christ]] which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus, [[Sargon of Akkad]] described himself as &quot;deputy of [[Ishtar]]&quot;, just as the [[Pope]] is considered the &quot;[[Vicar of Christ]]&quot;.

The king is styled as a [[shepherd]] from earliest times, e.g., the term was applied to [[ENSI|Sumerian princes]] such as [[Lugalbanda]] in the 3rd millennium BC. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of leadership and the responsibility to supply food and protection as well as superiority.

As the mediator between the people and the divine, the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. [[Solomon]]) or vision ([[oneiromancy]]).

Sacral kingship was carried into the [[Middle Ages]] by considering kings installed ''[[by the grace of god]]''
*[[Capetian Miracle]]
*[[Royal touch]], supernatural powers attributed to the Kings of England and France
*The [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[House of Árpád]] (known during the Medieval Times as the '' dynasty of the Holy Kings'')

== Study ==
Study of the concept was introduced by [[Sir James George Frazer]] in his influential book ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in [[Romanticism]] and [[Esotericism]] (e.g. [[Julius Evola]]) and some currents of [[Neopaganism]] ([[Theodism]]).
The school of [[Pan-Babylonianism]] derived much of the religion described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] from cults of sacral kingship in ancient [[Babylonia]].

The so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English &quot;myth and ritual school&quot; concentrated on anthropology and folklore, while the Scandinavian &quot;Uppsala school&quot; emphasized Semitological study.

=== Frazer's interpretation ===
A sacred king, according to the systematic interpretation of [[mythology]] developed by Frazer in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (published 1890), was a [[monarch|king]] who represented a [[solar deity]] in a periodically re-enacted [[fertility rite]]. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-[[Europe]]an, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the [[Goddess]] was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine [[John Barleycorn]]. He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the [[winter solstice]] to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a &quot;[[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]]&quot;. [[Osiris]], [[Adonis]], [[Dionysus]], [[Attis]] and many other familiar figures from [[Greek mythology]] and [[classical antiquity]] were re-interpreted in this mold. The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a [[sacrifice]], to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.

Especially in Europe during Frazer's early twentieth century heyday, it launched a [[cottage industry]] of amateurs looking for &quot;[[paganism|pagan]] survivals&quot; in such things as traditional [[fair]]s, [[maypole]]s, and folk arts like [[Morris dance|morris dancing]]. It was widely influential in [[literature]], being alluded to by [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound]], and in [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'', among other works.

[[Robert Graves]] used Frazer's work in ''The Greek Myths'' and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in ''[[The White Goddess]]''. Most curiously of all, [[Margaret Murray]], the principal theorist of [[witchcraft]] as a &quot;pagan survival,&quot; used Frazer's work to propose the thesis that many [[Kings of England]] who died as kings, most notably [[William II of England|William Rufus]], were secret pagans and [[witch]]es, and whose deaths were the re-enactment of the [[human sacrifice]] that stood at the centre of Frazer's myth, a speculation taken up by [[Katherine Kurtz]]' in her novel ''Lammas Night''.

== In fiction ==
Many of [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s novels are recognized as being directly influenced by Frazer, depicting individuals accepting the burden of leadership and the ultimate responsibility of personal sacrifice, including [[Sword at Sunset]], [[The Mark of the Horse Lord]], and [[Sun Horse, Moon Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.HistoricalNovels.info/Rosemary-Sutcliff.html Article about Rosemary Sutcliff at the Historical Novels Info website; paragraph 15]&lt;/ref&gt;
