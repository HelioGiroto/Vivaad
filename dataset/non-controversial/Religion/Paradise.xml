'''Paradise''' is a religious term for a place in which existence is positive, harmonious and [[eternity|timeless]]. It is conceptually a counter-image of the supposed miseries of human [[civilization]], and in paradise there is only [[peace]], [[prosperity]], and [[happiness]]. Paradise is a place of contentment, but it is not necessarily a land of luxury and idleness. Paradise is often described as a &quot;higher place&quot;, the holiest place, in contrast to [[Hell]].

Paradisaical notions are cross-cultural, often laden with [[pastoral]] imagery, and may be [[cosmogonical]] or [[eschatological]] or both. In eschatological contexts, paradise is imagined as an [[Realm of the dead|abode of the virtuous dead]]. In Christian and Islamic understanding, [[Heaven]] is a paradisaical relief, evident for example in the [[Gospel of Luke]] when [[Jesus]] tells a [[St Dismas|penitent criminal]] crucified alongside him that they will be together in paradise. In old Egyptian beliefs, the [[otherworld]] is [[Aaru]], the reed-fields of ideal hunting and fishing grounds where the dead lived after judgment. For the Celts, it was the [[Fortunate Isles|Fortunate Isle]] of [[Mag Mell]]. For the classical Greeks, the [[Elysium|Elysian fields]] was a paradisaical land of plenty where the heroic and righteous dead hoped to spend eternity. The [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Indians]] held that the physical body was destroyed by fire but recreated and reunited in the [[Third Heaven]] in a state of bliss. In the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]], the &quot;Best Existence&quot;&lt;!-- vahišta.ahu- --&gt; and the &quot;House of Song&quot;&lt;!-- garō.dəmāma- --&gt; are places of the righteous dead. On the other hand, in [[cosmological]] contexts 'paradise' describes the world before it was tainted by [[evil]]. So for example, the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic faiths]] associate paradise with the [[Garden of Eden]], that is, the perfect state of the [[World (theology)|world]] prior to the fall from grace, and the perfect state that will be restored in the [[World to Come]].

The concept is a topos' in art and literature, particularly of the pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], a well-known representative of which is [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. A paradise should not be confused with a [[utopia]], which is an alternative society.

==Etymology and semasiology==
[[Image:Nicolas Poussin 041.jpg|left|thumb|[[Nicolas Poussin]], Four seasons of paradise. 1660-64]]

The word &quot;paradise&quot; entered English from the [[French language|French]] ''paradis'', inherited from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''paradisus'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''parádeisos'' (''παράδεισος''), and ultimately from an [[Old Iranian]] root, attested in [[Avestan language|Avestan]] as ''pairi.daêza-''.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Oxford&quot;&gt;New Oxford American dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The literal meaning of this Eastern Old Iranian language word is &quot;walled (enclosure)&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;New Oxford&quot;/&gt; from ''pairi-'' &quot;around&quot; + ''-diz'' &quot;to create (a wall)&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=paradise Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is not attested in other Old Iranian languages (these may however be hypothetically reconstructed, for example as [[Old Persian]] ''*paridayda-'').

By the 6th/5th century BCE, the Old Iranian word had been adopted as [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''pardesu'' and [[Elamite language|Elamite]] ''partetas'', &quot;domain&quot;. It subsequently came to indicate walled estates, especially the carefully tended royal parks and [[menagerie]]s. The term eventually appeared in Greek as ''parádeisos'' &quot;park for animals&quot; in the ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' of the early 4th century BCE Athenian gentleman-scholar [[Xenophon]]. [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''pardaysa'' similarly reflects &quot;royal park&quot;.

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] פרדס (''pardes'') appears thrice in the [[Tanakh]]; in the [[Song of Solomon]] 4:13,  [[Ecclesiastes]] 2:5 and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 2:8.  In those contexts it could be interpreted as an &quot;orchard&quot; or a &quot;fruit garden&quot;. 

In the 3rd-1st century BCE ''[[Septuagint]]'', Greek παράδεισος (''parádeisos'') was used to translate both Hebrew ''pardes'' and Hebrew ''{{lang|he-Latn|gan}}'', &quot;garden&quot;: it is from this usage that the use of &quot;paradise&quot; to refer to the [[Garden of Eden]] derives. The same usage also appears in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and in the [[Quran]] itself as فردوس (''firdaws'').

The idea of a walled enclosure was not preserved in most Iranian usage, and generally came to refer to a plantation or other cultivated area, not necessarily walled. For example, the Old Iranian word survives in New Persian ''pālīz'' (or &quot;jālīz&quot;), which denotes a vegetable patch. However, the word [[park]], as well as the similar complex of words that have the same [[indoeuropean]] root: [[garden]], [[yard]], [[girdle]], [[orchard]], [[court]], etc., all refer simply to a deliberately ''enclosed'' area, but not necessarily an area enclosed by walls. 

For the connection between these ideas and that of the city, compare German [[Wiktionary:de:Zaun|''Zaun'']] (&quot;fence&quot;), English [[Wiktionary:town#Etymology|''town'']] and Dutch [[wiktionary:tuin#Dutch|''tuin'']] (&quot;garden&quot;), or [[wiktionary:yard#Etymology_1|''garden/yard'']] with Nordic [[Miklagard#Old_Norse|''garðr'']] and Slavic [[Grad (Slavic settlement)|''gard'']] (both &quot;city&quot;).

==Religious use==
===Judaism===
The word ''pardes'', borrowed from the Persian word, does not appear before the post-Exilic period (post-538 BCE); it occurs in the [[Song of Songs]] 4:13, [[Ecclesiastes]] 2:5, and [[Ezra-Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 2:8, in each case meaning &quot;park&quot; or &quot;garden&quot;, the original Persian meaning of the word, where it describes to the royal parks of [[Cyrus the Great]] by [[Xenophon]] in [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]].

Later in [[Second Temple]] era Judaism &quot;paradise&quot; came to be associated with the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[World to Come|prophesies of restoration of Eden]], and transferred to [[heaven]]. The [[Septuagint]] uses the word around 30 times, both of Eden, (Gen.2:7 etc.) and of Eden restored (Ezek. 28:13, 36:35) etc. In the [[Apocalypse of Moses]], [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from paradise (instead of Eden) after having been tricked by the serpent. Later after the death of Adam, the [[Archangel Michael]] carries the body of Adam to be buried in Paradise, which is in the [[Third Heaven]].

Later in [[Rabbinical Judaism]] the word 'Pardes' recurs, but less often in the Second Temple context of Eden or restored Eden. Tosefta [[Hagigah]]14b uses the word of the veil around mystic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=65&amp;letter=P#ixzz0ZWg2S0OP JewishEncyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zohar]] gives the word a mystical interpretation, and associates it with the four kinds of Biblical exegesis: ''peshat'' (literal meaning), ''remez'' (allusion), ''derash'' (anagogical), and ''sod'' (mystic). The initial letters of those four words then form  {{lang|he|פָּרְדֵּס}} &amp;ndash; ''[[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|p(a)rd(e)s]]'', which was in turn felt to represent the fourfold interpretation of the [[Torah]] (in which ''sod'' &amp;ndash; the mystical interpretation &amp;ndash; ranks highest).

===Christianity===
{{see also|World to Come}}

The New Testament use and understanding of paradise parallels that of contemporary Judaism. The word is used three times in the New Testament writings:
* Luke 23:43 - by Jesus on the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross]], in response to the thief's request that Jesus remember him when he came in his kingdom.
* 2 Cor.12:4 - in Paul's description of a man's description of a [[Third_Heaven#The_New_Testament|third heaven]] paradise, which may in fact be a vision Paul himself saw.
* Rev.2:7 - in a reference to the Gen.2:8 paradise and the [[Tree of life#Hebraic monotheism|tree of life]]

In the 2nd century AD, [[Irenaeus]] distinguished paradise from heaven. In ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', he wrote that only those deemed worthy would inherit a home in heaven, while others would enjoy paradise, and the rest live in the [[New Jerusalem|restored Jerusalem]] (which was mostly a ruin after the [[Jewish–Roman wars]] but was rebuilt beginning with [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine the Great]]). [[Origen]] likewise distinguished paradise from heaven, describing  paradise as the earthly &quot;school&quot; for souls of the righteous dead, preparing them for their ascent through the celestial spheres to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04122.htm Church fathers: De Principiis (Book II) Origen], newadvent.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Tension between these two competing Christian views of paradise may be responsible for a textual difference in one of the three New Testament verses using the word, Luke 23:43. For example the two early [[Syriac]] versions translate Luke 23:43 differently. The [[Curetonian Gospels]] read &quot;Today I tell you that you will be with me in paradise&quot;, whereas the [[Sinaitic Palimpsest]] reads &quot;I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise&quot;. Likewise the two earliest Greek codices with punctuation disagree: [[Codex Vaticanus]] has a pause mark in the original ink after 'today', whereas [[Codex Alexandrinus]] has the &quot;today in paradise&quot; reading. Today almost all translations follow the &quot;today in Paradise&quot;, although there is some support among classical Greek scholars for the reading &quot;today that&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/bgreek/test-archives/html4/2000-01/35098.html Ibiblio.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian art [[Fra Angelico]]'s ''[[Last Judgement]]'' painting shows Paradise on its left side. There is a [[tree of life]] (and another tree) and a [[circle dance]] of liberated [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s. In the middle is a hole. In Muslim art it similarly indicates the presence of the Prophet or divine beings. It visually says, 'Those here cannot be depicted.'

====Slavic Christianity====
{{main|Rai (paradise)}}
Slavic languages, and Romanian which is not Slavic but Slavic-influenced, have a distinct term for &quot;paradise&quot;, &quot;raj&quot; (read &quot;rai&quot;) which is generally agreed to derive from Persian ''ray'' and co-exists alongside terms deriving from the Persian word ''pardeis''.

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
{{See also|Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that Jehovah's purpose from the start was, and is, to have the earth filled with the offspring of [[Adam and Eve]] as caretakers of a global paradise. After God had designed this earth for human habitation, however, Adam and Eve rebelled against [[Jehovah]] and so they were banished from the Garden of Eden, or Paradise.

Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the wicked people will be destroyed at [[Armageddon]] and that many of the righteous (those faithful and obedient to Jehovah) will live eternally in an earthly Paradise. (Psalms 37:9, 10, 29; Prov. 2:21, 22). Joining the survivors will be resurrected righteous and unrighteous people who died prior to [[Armageddon]] (John 5:28, 29; Acts 24:15). The latter are brought back because they paid for their sins by their death, and/or also because they lacked opportunity to learn of Jehovah's requirements prior to dying (Rom. 6:23). These will be judged on the basis of their post-resurrection obedience to instructions revealed in new &quot;scrolls&quot; (Rev. 20:12). This provision does not apply to those that Jehovah deems to have sinned against his holy spirit (Matt. 12:31, Luke 12:5).&lt;ref&gt;''What Does the Bible Really Teach?'' (Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 2005), Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Insight on the Scriptures'' (Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1988), 783-92&lt;/ref&gt;

One of [[Sayings_of_Jesus_on_the_cross#Today_you_will_be_with_me_in_paradise|Jesus' last recorded statements before he died]] were the words to an evildoer hanging alongside him on a [[torture stake]], &quot;You will be with me in Paradise&quot;.—Luke 23:43. &lt;!--Notice the placement of the comma is after the word 'today', indicating that there are two separate phrases, 1. 'I tell you today' and 2. 'You will be with me in Paradise'. This distinction differs from other Christian understanding of this verse where they read it as 1. 'I tell you' and 2. 'Today you will be with me in Paradise'. Some scriptures that Jehovah's Witnesses use to support their belief are (John 3:13-15); (Acts 24:15). --&gt;Witnesses believe scriptures such as [http://bible.cc/matthew/12-40.htm Matthew 12:40] and [http://bible.cc/matthew/27-63.htm 27:63] and [http://bible.cc/mark/8-31.htm Mark 8:31] and [http://bible.cc/mark/9-31.htm 9:31] show that Jesus himself expected an interval of three days between his own death and resurrection, making impossible a reunion in Paradise on the same day as Jesus' ''&quot;you will be with me in Paradise&quot;'' statement. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Meeting the Challenge of Bible Translation&quot;, ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1974, page 362-363&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mormonism====
In [[Latter Day Saint]] theology, paradise usually refers to the [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]]. That is, the place where spirits dwell following death and awaiting the resurrection. In that context, &quot;paradise&quot; is the state of the righteous after death. In contrast, the wicked and those who have not yet learned the gospel of Jesus Christ await the resurrection in [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]]. After the universal resurrection, all persons will be assigned to a particular [[degrees of glory|kingdom or degree of glory]]. This may also be termed &quot;paradise&quot;.

===Islam===
{{Main|Jannah}}
In the [[Quran|Qur'an]], Paradise is denoted as ''jannah'' (garden), with the highest level being called ''firdaus''. The etymologically equivalent word is derived from the original [[Avestan language|Avestan]] counterpart, and used instead of Heaven to describe the ultimate pleasurable place after death, accessible by those who pray, donate to charity, read the Qur'an, believe in: God, the angels, his revealed books, his prophets and messengers, the Day of Judgement and the afterlife, and follow God's will in their life. Heaven in Islam is used to describe the [[Universe]]. It is also used in the Qur'an to describe skies in the literal sense, i.e., above earth. In Islam, the bounties and beauty of Heaven are immense, so much so that they are beyond the abilities of mankind’s worldly mind to comprehend.

===The Urantia Book===
[[The Urantia Book]] portrays Paradise as the &quot;[[Eternity|eternal]] center of the universe of universes,&quot; and as &quot;the abiding place of the [[God|Universal Father]], the [[God the Son|Eternal Son]], the [[Holy Spirit|Infinite Spirit]], and their [[Divinity|divine]] co-ordinates and associates.&quot; The book states that paradise is the primal origin and the final [[destiny]] for all spirit personalities, and for all the ascending creatures of the [[evolution]]ary worlds of [[time]] and [[space]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urantia.org/en/urantia-book-standardized/paper-11-eternal-isle-paradise&lt;/ref&gt;
