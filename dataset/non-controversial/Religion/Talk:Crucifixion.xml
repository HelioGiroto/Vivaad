== The Crucifix as a Symbol for Eastern Orthodox? ==

In the article it is asserted that &quot;A crucifix (an image of Christ crucified on a cross) is the main religious symbol for Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox&quot;.  As an Orthodox I disagree with this assertion. While there are of course Orthodox icons of the crucifixion, we would not say that it is the religious symbol of the Orthodox Church. While we believe that Christ's death on the Cross was necessary for our salvation, it is the Resurrection which makes our salvation possible (See St. Paul's argument in 1 Corinthians 15). Therefore we depict Christ on the Cross insofar as we want to depict the historical event of the Crucifixion; otherwise we usually depict the Cross without Christ, as Christ is risen. Ergo, the Crucifix per se does not have the same meaning to us as Orthodox nor does it carry the same spiritual weight as it does with Catholics. That is at least in part due to the varying theologies between the Christian East and the Christian West of Christ's work on the Cross. Whereas the the Roman Catholic Church tends to view Christ's work on the Cross as an atonement and salvation as a juridical transaction (i.e. &quot;Jesus paid the price for my sins), as Orthodox we tend to understand the work of Christ as healing and salvation as a restorative transaction. Hence the West emphasizes the Crucifixion (atonement, paying the penalty), and the East emphasizes the Resurrection (healing, medicinal, restoration of fallen human nature). Hence we do not consider the Crucifix as the symbol OF the Christian Faith but rather as an expression of a critically important historical event of the Christian Faith.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Tpkatsa|Tpkatsa]] ([[User talk:Tpkatsa|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tpkatsa|contribs]]) 20:50, 22 December 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Suspendere and Arbor Infelix ==

We  now have &quot;The hypothesis that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of arbori suspendere—hanging on an arbor infelix (unfortunate tree) dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the supplicium more maiorum, punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death.&quot; Oldfather [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/TAPA/39/Supplicium_de_More_Maiorum*.html] does show that arbori suspendere does not mean hanging, but rather fastening (&quot;It is obvious then that the technical meaning of the phrase here is not &quot;hang from&quot; but &quot;fasten to&quot; a tree.&quot;) and that the fatal act was flogging. He does not attempt to discredit the idea that the infelix arbor was dedicated to a nether world god. In fact, he even says &quot;Just what the arbor infelix was it is impossible to answer now with certainty.&quot; and a bit later &quot;Many other interesting questions arise as to the relative antiquity of this punishment compared with others in use at Rome, the religious significance of the '''consecrate''' dead tree-trunk or stake...&quot; In short, Oldfather shows that arbori suspendere was not the origin of Roman crucifixion because unlike crucifixion it was not reserved for slaves and it involved flogging to death. Oldfather does not come to a conclusion about the meaning of arbor infelix and in fact leaves open the possibility of consecration.
  
I propose that the above passage be changed to &quot;The hypothesis that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of an early custom of arbori suspendere—flogging on an arbor infelix (unfortunate tree)—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the supplicium more maiorum, punishment in accordance with the custom of our ancestors) consisted of fastening someone to a tree and flogging him to death.&quot; [[User:Whogue|Whogue]] ([[User talk:Whogue|talk]]) 11:26, 27 March 2012 (UTC)

== Roman Crucifixion ==

How about more images/examples of crucifixion that aren't of Jesus? The Romans crucified thousands of people, sometimes whole villages of people at once. This article is way too involved with the execution of Jesus. It should actually be a section dedicated to the subject, and the section linked to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] for a more complete article on the subject.[[User:JanderVK|JanderVK]] ([[User talk:JanderVK|talk]]) 22:25, 16 May 2012 (UTC)
:That's a reasonable point. It would be a good idea to look to see what's available at Commons. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 14:53, 17 May 2012 (UTC)

== Leg breaking and breathing ==

I wanted to know if it is fine to include info on how the practice of breaking legs would led to breathing difficulties, since it would prevent the victim from pushing himself upward.

:&quot;Being [[WP:BOLD|'''bold''']] is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia. No editor is more welcome to make a positive contribution than you are. When in doubt, edit! Similarly, if you used the article's talk page because you were unsure, and it has had no response for a few days, go ahead and make your edit. Sometimes other editors are busy, or nobody is watching the article. An edit will either help get the attention of interested editors, or you will simply improve the article —  '''''either one is good'''''.&quot;  This is a quotation from [[WP:BRD]].

::* It would be better to have references that were not primarily about the crucifixion of Jesus, as both of these are, since there is substantial disagreement about reliability of sources that in turn rely primarily upon biblical text.

::*If you see the section of the page that is about the cause of death, the issue is already discussed some there. However, it's important to be aware that, according to modern medical source material, the idea that death from crucifixion occurs via suffocation is now regarded as fringe science. There's no anatomical connection between the diaphragm and the other skeletal muscles. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 00:34, 24 October 2012 (UTC)
