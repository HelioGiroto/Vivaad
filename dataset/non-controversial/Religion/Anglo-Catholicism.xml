{{Anglicanism}}
The terms '''Anglo-Catholic''', '''Anglican Catholic''' and '''Catholic Anglican''' describe people, beliefs and practices within [[Anglicanism]] which affirm the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] heritage and identity of the various Anglican churches, rather than the churches' [[Protestantism|Protestant]] heritage.

The term &quot;Anglo-Catholic&quot; was coined in the early 19th century;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anglo-Catholic, adj. and n.&quot;. OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/7581 (accessed 11 Feb. 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; but, movements emphasising the Catholic nature of Anglicanism have existed throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Clutterbuck, Ivan (1993). ''Marginal Catholics''. Gracewing Publishing. p. 9. ISBN 978-0-85244-234-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh, Stephen (2011). ''Anglicans and the Roman Catholic Church: Reflections on Recent Developments''. Ignatius Press. ISBN 978-1-58617-499-6&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly influential in the history of Anglo-Catholicism were the [[Caroline Divines]] of the seventeenth century and, later, the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]], which began at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1833 and ushered in a period of Anglican history known as the &quot;Catholic Revival&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, John B., Wildman, Wesley J. (1998) ''Fidelity with Plausibility: Modest Christologies in the Twentieth Century''. State University of New York Press. p. 94. ISBN 978-0-7914-3595-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, members of the [[personal ordinariate]]s for former Anglicans in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] are also sometimes referred to as &quot;Anglican Catholics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Anglican Catholic Ordinariate to be Established in June 2012|url=http://www.catholicanada.com/2012/05/note-australian-anglican-catholic-ordinariate-to-be-established-in-june/|publisher=Catholic Canada|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anglican Catholic ordinariate for US formally established|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=12832|publisher=Catholic Culture|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Following the passing of the [[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Supremacy]] and [[Henry VIII]]'s break with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of England]] continued to adhere to traditional Catholic teachings and did not initially make any alterations to doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger (1996). ''A Dictionary of Political Thought''. Macmillan. p. 470. ISBN 978-0-333-64786-8&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ten Articles]]'' were published in 1536 and constitute the first official Anglican articles of faith.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, John (2006). ''Philip Melanchthon and the English Reformation'', Ashgate Publishing. p. 68. ISBN 978-0-7546-5567-1&lt;/ref&gt; The articles for the most part concurred with the pre-Reformation teachings of the Church in England and defended, among other things, the [[Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], the [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (religion)|confession]], the honouring and [[Intercession of saints|invocation]] of [[Christian saints|saints]] and [[prayer for the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Gerald L. (2004) ''Documents of the English Reformation''. James Clarke &amp; Co. p 164-174. ISBN 978-0-227-17239-1&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in [[purgatory]], however, was made non-essential.&lt;ref&gt;Article 10 states: &quot;but forasmuch as the place where they be, the name thereof, and kind of pains there, also be to us uncertain by Scripture; therefore this with all other things we remit to Almighty God, unto whose mercy it is meet and convenient for us to commend them, trusting that God accepteth our prayers for them&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the ''Bishops' Book'' in 1537, a combined effort by numerous clergy and theologians which, though not strongly Protestant in its inclinations, showed a slight move towards Reformed positions and was unpopular with conservative sections of the Church and quickly grew to be disliked by Henry also.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, Mark (1998). ''A History of the Modern British Isles, 1529-1603: The Two Kingdoms''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 56. ISBN 978-0-631-19334-0&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Six Articles]]'', released two years later, moved away from all Reformed ideas and strongly affirmed Catholic positions regarding matters such as [[transubstantiation]] and [[Mass for the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrington, C. E., Jackson, Hambden K. (2011). ''A History of England''. Cambridge University Press. p. 270. ISBN 978-1-107-64803-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hillerbrand, Hans J. (2002). ''The Division of Christendom''. Westminster/John Knox Press. p. 232. ISBN 978-0-664-22402-8&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[King's Book]]'', the official article of religion written by Henry  in 1543, likewise expressed Catholic sacramental theology and encouraged prayer for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel K. Richter|Richter, Daniel K.]] (2011). ''Before the Revolution: America's Ancient Pasts''. Harvard University Press. p. 89. ISBN 978-0-674-05580-3&lt;/ref&gt;

A major shift in Anglican doctrine came in the reign of Henry's son, [[Edward VI]], who repealed the ''Six Articles''&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Joan (1979). ''Education and Society in Tudor England''. Cambridge University Press. p. 215. ISBN 978-0-521-29679-3&lt;/ref&gt; and under whose rule the Church of England became more identifiably Protestant. Though the Church's practices and approach to the sacraments became strongly influenced by those of  [[Europe|continental]] reformers,&lt;ref&gt;Pavlac, Brian Alexander (2011). ''A Concise Survey of Western Civilization: Supremacies and Diversities Throughout History''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. p. 182. ISBN 978-1-4422-0555-0&lt;/ref&gt; it nevertheless retained [[episcopal polity|episcopal]] church structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bagchi, David V. N., Steinmetz, David C. (2004). ''The Cambridge Companion to Reformation Theology''. Cambridge University Press. p. 169. ISBN 978-0-521-77662-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of England was then briefly reunited with the Roman Catholic Church under [[Mary of England|Mary]], before separating again under [[Elizabeth I]]. The [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] was an attempt to end the religious divisions among Christians in England, and is often seen as an important event in Anglican history, ultimately laying the foundations for the &quot;''via media''&quot; concept of Anglicanism.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, A. G. (1991). ''The English Reformation''. Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 403. ISBN 978-0-271-00798-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of early Anglicanism was to be of great importance to the Anglo-Catholics of the 19th century, who would argue that their beliefs and practices were common during this period and were inoffensive to the earliest members of the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;Hein, David and Shattuck, Gardiner H. (2005). ''The Episcopalians''. Church Publishing Inc. p. 91. ISBN 978-0-89869-497-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caroline Divines===
The [[Caroline Divines]] were a group of influential Anglican theologians active in the 17th century who opposed [[Calvinism]] and [[Puritanism]]&lt;ref&gt;Betz, Hans Dieter et al. (2006). ''Religion Past and Present''. Brill. ISBN 978-90-04-14608-2&lt;/ref&gt; and stressed the importance of [[episcopal polity]], [[apostolic succession]]  and the [[sacraments]].&lt;ref&gt;Avis, Paul D. L. (2002). ''Anglicanism and the Christian Church''. Continuum International Publishing. p 353. ISBN 978-0-567-08745-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKim, Donald M. (2000). ''The Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms''. Westminster/John Knox Press. p. 39. ISBN 978-0-664-25511-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Caroline Divines also favoured elaborate liturgy (in some cases favouring the liturgy of the pre-Reformation church&lt;ref&gt;Harris, John Glyndwr (2001). ''Christian Theology: The Spiritual Tradition''. Sussex Academic Press. p. 199. ISBN 978-1-902210-22-3&lt;/ref&gt;) and aesthetics. Their influence saw a revival in the use of images and statues in churches.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Graham (1981). ''The Golden Age Restor'd: The Culture of the Stuart Court, 1603-42''. Manchester University Press. ISBN 978-0-7190-0825-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of the Anglo-Catholic revival in the 19th century would draw heavily from the works of the Caroline Divines.&lt;ref&gt;Katerberg, William (2001). ''Modernity and the Dilemma of North American Anglican Identities, 1880-1950''. McGill-Queen's University Press. p. 12. ISBN 978-0-7735-2160-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxford Movement===
The modern Anglo-Catholic movement can be traced to the [[Oxford Movement]] of the [[Victorian era]], sometimes termed ''Tractarianism''.

In the early 19th century, various factors caused misgivings among English church people, including the decline of church life and the spread of unconventional practices in the Church of England.  The British government's action in 1833 of beginning a reduction in the number of [[Church of Ireland]] bishoprics and archbishoprics inspired a sermon from [[John Keble]] in the University Church in Oxford on the subject of &quot;National Apostasy&quot;.  This sermon marked the inception of what became known as the Oxford Movement.

The principal objective of the Oxford Movement was the defence of the Church of England as a divinely-founded institution, of the doctrine of the [[Apostolic Succession]] and of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] as a &quot;rule of faith&quot;.  The key idea was that Anglicanism was not a [[Protestant]] denomination, but rather a [[Branch theory|branch]] of the historic Catholic Church, along with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches.  It was argued that Anglicanism had preserved the historical apostolic succession of priests and bishops and thus the Catholic [[sacrament]]s.  These ideas were promoted in a series of ninety ''[[Tracts for the Times]]''.

The principal leaders of the Oxford Movement were [[John Keble]], [[John Henry Newman]] and [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]].  The movement gained influential support, but it was also attacked by the [[latitudinarian]]s within the [[University of Oxford]] and by bishops of the church.  Within the movement there gradually arose a much smaller group which tended towards submission to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church.  In 1845 the university censured the ''Ideal of a Christian Church'', and its author, &quot;[[W. G. Ward|Ideal Ward]],&quot; i.e., the pro-Roman Catholic theologian, W. G. Ward.  1850 saw the victory of the Evangelical clergyman [[George Cornelius Gorham]] in a celebrated legal action against the church authorities.  A number of conversions to the Roman Catholic Church followed.  The majority of adherents of the movement, however, remained in the Church of England and, despite hostility in the press and in government, the movement spread. Its liturgical practices were influential, as were its social achievements (including its slum settlements) and its revival of male and female monasticism within Anglicanism.

===Recent developments===
Since at least the 1970s, Anglo-Catholicism has been dividing into two distinct camps, along a fault-line which can perhaps be traced back to Bishop [[Charles Gore]]'s work in the 19th century.

The Oxford Movement had been inspired in the first place by a rejection of [[liberalism]] and [[latitudinarianism]] in favour of the traditional faith of the &quot;Church Catholic&quot;, defined by the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] and the common doctrines of the historical [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western Christian churches]]. Until the 1970s, therefore, most Anglo-Catholics rejected liberalising development such as the conferral of [[holy orders]] on women. Present-day &quot;traditionalist&quot; Anglo-Catholics seek to maintain tradition and to keep Anglican doctrine in line with that of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. They often ally themselves with Evangelicals to defend traditional teachings on [[Fornication#Christianity|sexual morality]].  The main organisation in the Church of England that opposes the ordination of women, [[Forward in Faith]], is largely composed of Anglo-Catholics.

Gore's work, however, bearing the mark of liberal Protestant [[higher criticism]], paved the way for an alternative form of Anglo-Catholicism influenced by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]].  Thus in recent years many Anglo-Catholics have accepted the [[ordination of women]], the use of [[inclusive language]] in Bible translations and the liturgy, and progressive attitudes towards homosexuality. Such Anglicans often refer to themselves as &quot;Liberal Catholics&quot;.  The more &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; style of Anglo-Catholicism is represented by [[Affirming Catholicism]].

A third strand of Anglican Catholicism criticizes elements of both liberalism and conservatism, drawing instead on the 20th century Roman Catholic ''[[Nouvelle Théologie]]'', especially [[Henri de Lubac]]. [[John Milbank]] and others within this strand have been instrumental in the creation of the ecumenical (though predominantly Anglican and Roman Catholic) movement known as [[Radical Orthodoxy]].

Some traditionalist Anglo-Catholics have left official Anglicanism to form &quot;[[Continuing Anglican Movement|continuing Anglican churches]]&quot; such as those in the [[Anglican Catholic Church]] and [[Traditional Anglican Communion]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Others have left Anglicanism altogether for the Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches, in the belief that liberal doctrinal innovations in the Anglican churches have resulted in Anglicanism no longer being a true branch of the &quot;Church Catholic&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Anglican ordinariates===
{{main|Anglican Ordinariate}}
In late 2009 with the publication of the apostolic constitution ''[[Anglicanorum Coetibus]]'', traditionalist Anglicans were invited into unity with the Holy See.  This action was in response to requests from various groups of Anglicans around the world to be received into full communion with the Holy See while retaining liturgical, musical, theological and other aspects of the Anglican patrimony.

An [[apostolic constitution]] is the highest level of papal legislation and is not time-limited.  In other words, groups of Anglicans may apply for reception by the Holy See at any time and enter into what are termed &quot;Anglican ordinariates&quot; i.e. regional groupings of Anglican Catholics which come under the jurisdiction of an &quot;[[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]&quot;, i.e. a bishop or priest&lt;ref&gt;In the catholic church in general, ordinaries are supposed to be bishops, or at least episcopal vicars, but this condition was relaxed for Anglican ordinariates so as to allow married former Anglican bishops to become Ordinaries: while priests in Anglican ordinariates may be married, bishops may not, as this is the general rule in both Catholic and Orthodox churches. Therefore, married Anglican bishops or priests converting to catholicism receive the priestly ordination, and may not become Catholic bishops afterwards.&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by Rome to oversee the community, which, while being in a country or region which is part of the [[Latin Rite]] of the Roman Catholic Church, retains aspects of the Anglican patrimony, e.g. married priests, traditional English choral music and liturgy.

Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} have drawn parallels with the Eastern Catholic churches, but though there are some commonalities, Anglican ordinariates are intended to be part of the Western or Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, as they had been before the breach with Rome following the reign of Mary I of England.

The first Anglican ordinariate, known as the [[Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham]], was established on 15 January 2011 in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Arco, [http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2011/01/15/priests-ordained-to-the-worlds-first-ordinariate &quot;Priests ordained to the world's first ordinariate&quot;], ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'', 15 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The second Anglican ordinariate, known as the [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter]], was established on 1 January 2012 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Official Website, &quot;Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter&quot; http://www.usordinariate.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The already existing [[Anglican Use]] parishes in the United States, which have existed since the 1980s, will form a portion of the first American Anglican ordinariate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CWN|title=US ordinariate receives first priest, parish|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=14255|publisher=CatholicCulture.org|date=09 May 2012|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These parishes are already in communion with Rome and use modified Anglican liturgies approved by the Holy See. They will be joined by other groups and parishes of [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] and some other Anglicans.

==Practices and beliefs==
===Theology===
What Anglo-Catholics believe is fiercely debated, sometimes even among Anglo-Catholics themselves.

In agreement with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], Anglo-Catholics — along with [[Old-Catholic]]s and [[Lutheran]]s — generally appeal to the &quot;canon&quot; (or rule) of [[Vincent of Lerins|St Vincent of Lerins]]: &quot;What everywhere, what always, and what by all has been believed, that is truly and properly Catholic.&quot;

The Anglican [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] make distinctions between Anglican and [[Roman Catholic]] understandings of doctrine. As the Articles were intentionally written in such a way as to be open to a range of interpretations,&lt;ref&gt;Martz, Louis L. (1991). ''From Renaissance to Baroque: Essays on Literature and Art''. University of Missouri Press. p. 65. ISBN 978-0-8262-0796-8&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Catholics have defended Catholic practices and beliefs as being consistent with them. Because of the Articles' harsh tone, however, they have generally not been held in high regard by most Anglo-Catholics.  A recent trend in Anglo-Catholic thought related to the Thirty-Nine Articles has included the [[New Perspective on Paul]].

Anglo-Catholic [[priest]]s often hear private [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s and [[Anointing of the Sick|anoint the sick]], regarding these practices, as do Roman Catholics, as sacraments. The classic Anglican aphorism regarding private confession is: &quot;All may, some should, none must.&quot;

Anglo-Catholics are more likely to offer prayers for the departed and the intercession of the saints than [[low church]] Anglicans.  [[C.S. Lewis]], often considered an Anglo-Catholic in his theological sensibilities, was once quoted as stating that, &quot;Of course I pray for the dead. The action is so spontaneous, so all but inevitable, that only the most compulsive theological case against it would deter me. And I hardly know how the rest of my prayers would survive if those for the dead were forbidden. At our age, the majority of those we love best are dead. What sort of intercourse with God could I have if what I love best were unmentionable to him?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CSLewis&quot; /&gt;

Anglo-Catholics share with Roman Catholics a belief in the sacramental nature of the priesthood, the sacrificial character of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and, in some cases, the doctrine of [[Transubstantiation]], the Roman Catholic version of the doctrine of the [[Real Presence]]. A minority of Anglo-Catholics also encourage priestly [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]]. Most Anglo-Catholics encourage devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], particularly under her title of [[Our Lady of Walsingham]], but not all Anglo-Catholics adhere to a high doctrine of [[Mariology]].

A minority of Anglo-Catholics, sometimes called [[Anglo-Papalism|Anglo-Papalists]], consider themselves under papal supremacy even though they are not in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. Such Anglo-Catholics, especially in England, often celebrate Mass according to the [[Mass of Paul VI|contemporary Roman Catholic rite]] and are concerned with seeking reunion with the Roman Catholic Church.

===Liturgical practices===
Anglo-Catholics are usually identified by their liturgical practices and ornaments. These may be characterised by the &quot;six points&quot; of the Oxford Movement's eucharistic practice:
* eucharistic [[vestment]]s
* eastward-facing orientation of the priest at the altar (not standing at the north side, the evangelical Anglican practice)
* unleavened bread for the eucharist
* mixing of water with the eucharistic wine
* incense and candles.

Many other traditional Catholic practices are observed within Anglo-Catholicism, including [[eucharistic adoration]]. Most of these Anglo-Catholic &quot;innovations&quot; (or, rather, revivals of dormant practices) have since been accepted by mainstream Anglican churches, if not by Evangelical or [[Low Church]] Anglicans.

Various liturgical strands exist within Anglo-Catholicism:
* Some, such as the original members of the Oxford Movement, use official Anglican liturgical texts such as the [[Book of Common Prayer]].
* Some use the modern [[Mass of Paul VI|Roman Catholic rite of Mass]].
* Some use the [[Tridentine Mass|older &quot;Tridentine&quot;]] Catholic rite of Mass, in English or Latin, or liturgies based on it, such as the  [[English Missal]] or [[Anglican Missal]].
* Some occasionally use the mediaeval English [[Sarum Rite]], which is broadly similar to the Tridentine Mass, in English or Latin.

Preferences for Elizabethan English and modern English texts vary within the movement.

In the United States a group of Anglo-Catholics in the [[The Episcopal Church|Episcopal Church]] published, under the rubrics of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, an [[Anglican Service Book]] which is &quot;a traditional language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and additional devotions.&quot;  This book is based on the 1979 Book of Common Prayer but includes offices and devotions in the traditional language of the 1928 Prayer Book that are not in the 1979 edition.  The book also draws from sources such as the [[Anglican Missal]].
