==About schismatic note on Rome==
Quote: ''[[Ghirlandajo]] (why one schismatic patriarch of Rome should be listed before the Ecumenical patriarch and three other original patriarchates??)''

First of all your note is offensive in the history section and please note that the [[Council of Chalcedon]] gives the [[Pope]] the first place in the order of precedence in Canon 28.

Also I would like to point out that the mutual excommunication made in 1054 was lifted in the 1960's by the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church of Constantinople so in a way one of the original reasons for ''schism'' has been solved.

:Whom &quot;Orthodox Church of Constantinople&quot; recognizes as patriarch is the private affair of that church. This church cannot speak for the Eastern Orthodoxy in general. I revert the schysmatic bishop to the end of the list. --[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirlandajo]] 17:52, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

You are right about that (also, i may point that full communion between constantinople and rome has also never been really established, not even in 1960), and that's why, if this was a paragraph listing the patriarchs in the orthodox church now, rome not even would not be at the first ranking, but it would not even be in the list not even at the last place.
But this is a list of &quot;ancient pentarchy&quot;, BEFORE the schism, and, when we speak about that, history says us that rome HAD the first ranking at that moment (it has rightly been spoken about the council of chalcedon), and the ecumenical patriarch, that was already named ecumenical before the schism, still was in the second place after rome until 1054. And also some of the roman pontiffs of the period are still venerated as saints by orthodoxy, like, for example, saint clemens, pope of rome.

==Rearranging==

I'm leaning towards turning [[patriarch]] into a disambiguation page, and moving the material from this page to [[patriarch (Christianity)]] or something like that. The dab page would link to the main senses of the word such as the Christian title, [[Biblical patriarchs]], and [[patriarchy]], as well as less common uses like [[presiding patriarch]] and [[Sangharaja]]. Opinions?

:Object. Start [[patriarch (disambiguation)]] if you have nothing better to do. --[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirla]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Ghirlandajo|-трёп-]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:08, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

::Duly noted, but one must also note that you have not mentioned any particular reason. In the interest of even-handedness, I didn't really explain my reasoning either. My reasoning is that &quot;patriarch&quot; has several meanings, and the Christian church title is not outstandingly more common, although it's an interesting subject that deserves it's own article. The introduction to this article is presently a bit awkward as it tries to cover several subjects, while the body of the article is just a list of Christian church patriarchs. - [[User:Nat Krause|Nat Krause]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nat Krause|Talk!]])&lt;/sup&gt; 21:04, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

It might also be interesting to try to incorporate large or small portions of the lengthy and interesting Catholic Encyclopedia article on &quot;patriarch&quot;.

:Object. We don't need more Papist propaganda. --[[User:Ghirlandajo|Ghirla]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Ghirlandajo|-трёп-]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:08, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

::Well, obviously it would have to be well de-propagandised before we could use it. - [[User:Nat Krause|Nat Krause]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nat Krause|Talk!]])&lt;/sup&gt; 21:04, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

Incidentally, what's up with this &quot;[[One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church]]&quot;, etc., business? That links to an article which begins &quot;In Christian theology, One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church is a phrase describing ...&quot; and contains a section called &quot;conflicting boundaries and definitions&quot;. It doesn't seem quite fair to attribute these patriarchs to Christendom in general: for one thing, I suspect that the ancestors of today's Oriental Orthodox churches never recognised a patriarch of Constantinople or of Jerusalem. And then, [[patriarch]] goes on to use constructions like &quot;Holy Catholic and Orthodox Church&quot; and &quot;One Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church&quot; which apparently means Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism respectively? If that's what we mean, why don't we just go ahead and say it in terms that normal laymen will be able to understand? - [[User:Nat Krause|Nat Krause]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Nat Krause|Talk!]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:57, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

*Without commenting on this discussion of where they should go, I have consolidated the other uses into [[Patriarch (disambiguation)]], based on the contents of the German page [[:de:Patriarch (Begriffsklärung)]]. [[User:Rigadoun|Rigadoun]] 20:21, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

==[[Links between Popes]]==

I have started the above page: links with and between patriarchs would be welcome (in which case the article title would have to be changed - Links between Christian religious heads probably.)

[[User:Jackiespeel|Jackiespeel]] 16:19, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

== Kiev etc.? ==
What about some of the smaller churches with patriarchs, such as the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate]]? I'm sure there are others as well. Do they deserve a mention in this article? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
*They certainly do -it would be most un-encyclopedic to censorise less 'notable' churches; it's one of the few ways they can express how distinct they consider themselves- with this obvious proviso: please make sure they are properly identified and classified, especially as some are 'cohabiting' at nominal and real 'addresses' (episcopal sees, that is), which can easily lead to desparate confusion [[User:Fastifex|Fastifex]] 13:07, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

== Buddhist Patriarchs ==

The wiki on patriarchs focused only on the patriarchs of Judaic religions (Judaism and Christianity.)

In Mahayana Buddhism, patriarchs played an important historical role.  While Theravada (The Way of the Elders) records that the Buddha explicitly did not leave a successor, Mahayana Buddhism believes that the Buddha did select a monk to be a successor, and that there was a series of at least 28 Buddhist patriarchs.  The Chan/Zen branch of the Mahayana adds another 10, and the Chogye  and Kwan Um (both Korean) subbranches of Zen believe that the patriarchy contains unbroken to this day, though they have different people in mind.  For the Chogye, the 85th is now alive.  The Pure Land branch of the Mahayana also believes that they have the living Buddhist patriarch.

==Patriarchs in the OT==

The newly-added section on OT patriarchs is a mess. Should it be cleaned up or spun off into another article? [[User:Majoreditor|Majoreditor]] 04:42, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

::Silly me. I see that there is already an article named [[Patriarchs (Bible)]] which covers this material. [[User:Majoreditor|Majoreditor]] 04:45, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

== Reunification ==

in the sub-section on Catholicism it says: &quot;Disputes about papal authority were not initially a major factor in the split between Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, but are now one of the few remaining issues holding back re-unification.&quot; I am quite interested in this idea and I'd like to know if there is a WP article that goes into greater detail about these &quot;few remaining issues&quot; and the process/idea of reunification in general. [[User:witty lama|Witty]] [[User talk:witty lama|Lama]] 01:27, 3 May 2011 (UTC)

== England (Church of) ==
The Church of England has two primates; the Primate of England (Archbishop of York) and Primate of All England (Archbishop of Canturbury).  I know these are established by law; but don't know enough to add them to the article accurately.  Can anyone help with this?  It's clearly a failing not to include these as they are both long-established and directly successive to the latin patriachy. [[Special:Contributions/118.107.229.34|118.107.229.34]] ([[User talk:118.107.229.34|talk]]) 14:31, 3 March 2012 (UTC)

:No failing here as this is the Patriarch page. That bit is discussed on it's own page: [[Primate_(religion)#Anglican_Communion|Primate]] [[User:Caisson 06|Caisson 06]] ([[User talk:Caisson 06|talk]]) 15:05, 21 April 2012 (UTC)

== POV ==

Hello. This appears to be another article devoted to Christianity. I will mark it POV until it is fixed, just like the article for [[abbot]]. [[Keizan]] is known, for example, as the Greatest Patriarch, but isn't mentioned. Thank you. -[[User:SusanLesch|SusanLesch]] ([[User talk:SusanLesch|talk]]) 17:10, 16 March 2012 (UTC)
:The article is about a meaning of &quot;patriarch&quot; better known than its application to Keizan, which is covered in [[Patriarch (disambiguation)|another page]].  It is like the article on, e.g., [[Trinity]].</text>
