The '''Ten Commandments''', also known as the '''Decalogue''', are a set of [[biblical]] principles relating to [[ethics]] and [[worship]], which play a fundamental role in [[Judaism]] and most forms of [[Christianity]]. They include instructions to worship only [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] and to keep the [[Biblical Sabbath|sabbath]], and prohibitions against [[idolatry]], [[blasphemy]], [[You shall not murder|murder]], [[You shall not steal|theft]], and [[adultery]]. Different groups follow slightly different traditions for interpreting and numbering them.

The Ten Commandments appear twice in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]. According to the story in Exodus, God inscribed them on two stone tablets, which he gave to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. Modern scholarship has found likely influences in [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Mesopotamian]] laws and treaties, but is divided over exactly when the Ten Commandments were written and who wrote them.

==Terminology==
In [[Biblical Hebrew language|biblical Hebrew]], the Ten Commandments are called {{lang|he|עשרת הדברים}} ([[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] {{lang|he-Latn|''Asereth ha-D'bharîm''}}) and in [[Mishnaic Hebrew language|Rabbinical Hebrew]] {{lang|he|עשרת הדברות}} (transliterated {{lang|he-Latn|''Asereth ha-Dibroth''}}), both translatable as &quot;the ten words&quot;, &quot;the ten sayings&quot; or &quot;the ten matters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=1WUzUAdWRVUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= The Ten Commandments: Ethics for the Twenty-First Century|first= Mark|last= Rooker|year= 2010|publisher= B&amp;H Publishing Group|location= Nashville, Tennessee|page= 3|isbn= 0-8054-4716-4|accessdate= 2011-10-02|quote=The Ten Commandments are literally the &quot;Ten Words&quot; (ăśeret hadděbārîm) in Hebrew. The use of the term ''dābār'', &quot;word,&quot; in this phrase distinguishes these laws from the rest of the commandments (''mişwâ''), statutes (''hōq''), and regulations (''mišpāţ'') in the Old Testament.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale]] and [[Coverdale Bible|Coverdale]] English translations used &quot;ten verses&quot;. The [[Geneva Bible]] appears to be the first to use &quot;tenne commandements&quot;, which was followed by the [[Bishops' Bible]] and the [[Authorized King James Version]] as &quot;ten commandments&quot;. Most major English versions follow the Authorized Version.&lt;ref name=&quot;ex34-28&quot;&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Exodus%2034:28 Exodus 34:28 &amp;ndash; multiple versions and languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

The English name &quot;Decalogue&quot; is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] translation {{lang|grc|δέκα λόγους}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|deka logous}}'' &quot;ten terms&quot;, found in the [[Septuagint]] (or LXX) at [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:28&lt;ref name=&quot;ex34-28&quot; /&gt; and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 10:4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Deuteronomy%2010:4 Deuteronomy 10:4 &amp;ndash; multiple versions and languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tablets of Stone|stone tablets]], as opposed to the commandments inscribed on them, are called  לוחות הברית: ''Luchot HaBrit'', meaning &quot;the tablets of the covenant&quot;.

==The Revelation at Sinai==

The biblical narrative of the revelation at Sinai begins in {{Bibleref|Exodus|19|HE}} after the arrival of the children of Israel at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], also called [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]]. In the morning of the &quot;third day&quot; of their encampment, &quot;there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud&quot;, and the people assembled at the base of the mount. After &quot;the {{LORD}} came down upon mount Sinai&quot;, Moses went up briefly and returned and prepared the people, and then in {{Bibleref|Exodus|20|HE}} &quot;God spake&quot; to all the people the words of the covenant, &quot;''even'' ten commandments&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy.4:13;5:22||9|Deuteronomy 4:13, 5:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is written. The people were afraid to hear more and moved &quot;afar off&quot; and even Moses said, &quot;I exceedingly fear and quake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Hebrews|12:20-21|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he drew near the &quot;thick darkness&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|20:21|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hear the additional statutes and &quot;judgments&quot;, ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|21-23|9|Exodus 21&amp;ndash;23}}) all which he &quot;wrote&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the &quot;[[Covenant code|book of the covenant]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he read to the people the next morning, and they agreed to be obedient and do all that the {{LORD}} had said. Moses escorted a select group consisting of [[Aaron]], [[Nadab and Abihu]], and &quot;seventy of the elders of Israel&quot; to a location on the mount where they worshipped &quot;afar off&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:1,9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they &quot;saw the God of Israel&quot; above a &quot;paved work&quot; like clear sapphire stone. ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:1-11|9}})

{{quotation|1=&lt;font face=Verdana&gt;And the {{LORD}} said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.&lt;/font&gt;|2=First mention of the tables in Exodus 24:12,13}}

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=This is an image of an oil on canvas picture by Rembrandt (1659) of a bearded man representing Moses with two tables of stone of the ten commandments held high in both hands.|[[Moses]] with the Ten Commandments by [[Rembrandt]] (1659)]]

The mount was covered by the cloud for six days, after which Moses went into the midst of the cloud and was &quot;in the mount forty days and forty nights.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:16-18|9}}) And Moses said, &quot;the {{LORD}} delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the {{LORD}} spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|9:10|9}}) Before the full forty days expired, the children of Israel decided that something happened to Moses, and compelled Aaron to fashion a [[golden calf]], and he &quot;built an altar before it&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:1-5|9|Ex.32:1–5}}) and the people &quot;worshipped&quot; the calf. ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:6-8|9|Ex.32:6–8}}) After the full forty days, Moses and Joshua came down from the mountain with the [[Tablets of Stone|tables of stone]]: &quot;And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:19|9|Ex.32:19}}) After the events in chapters 32 and 33, the {{LORD}} told Moses, &quot;Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|34:1|9|Ex.34:1}}) &quot;And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the {{LORD}} spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the {{LORD}} gave them unto me.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|10:4|9}})

According to Jewish tradition, {{Bibleref2|Exodus|20:1-17|9|Exodus 20:1&amp;ndash;17}} constitutes God's first recitation and inscription of the ten commandments on the two tables,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus.20:1;Exodus.32:15-19||9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were broken in pieces by Moses, and later rewritten on replacement stones and placed in the [[ark of the covenant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Deuteronomy.4:10-13;Deut.5:22;Deut.9:17;Deut.10:1-5||9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|5:4-20|9|Deuteronomy 5:4&amp;ndash;20}} consists of God's re-telling of the ten commandments to the younger generation who were to enter the promised land. The passages in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 contain more than ten imperative statements, totalling 14 or 15 in all.

== Two texts with numbering schemes{{anchor|Numbering schemes}} ==

The two texts commonly known as the Ten Commandments are given in two books of the Bible: {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:1–17|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:4–21|HE}}. While the Bible itself assigns the count of &quot;ten&quot;, using the Hebrew phrase ''asereth ha-d&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;barim'' ('the ten words', 'statements' or 'sayings'), the phrase does not appear in Exodus 20 or Deuteronomy 5.&lt;ref&gt;3 verses with the phrase ''ten commandments'': {{bibleref2|Exodus.34:28;Deuteronomy.4:13;Deuteronomy.10:4||9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious groups use one of three historical divisions of Exodus 20:1–17 into ten parts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/decalogue.html What Are the Ten Commandments]&lt;/ref&gt; tabulated below:

* '''Phi'''. The Philonic division is the oldest, from the writings of [[Philo]] and [[Josephus]] (first century), which labels verse 3 as number 1, verses 4–6 as number 2, and so on. Groups that generally follow this scheme include Hellenistic Jews, Greek Orthodox and Protestants except Lutherans. Most representations of the commandments include the prologue of verse 2 as either part of the first commandment or as a preface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book26.html The Works of Philo Judaeus — The Decalogue] Περι των Δέκα Λογίων&lt;br&gt;[http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7115/ The Ten Commandments — Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America] Has Ex.20:1–3 as 1st commandment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book 3, Chapter 5, Section 5: &quot;The first commandment teaches us, That there is but one God, and that we ought to worship him only;—the second commands us not to make the image of any living creature to worship it;—the third, That we must not swear by God in a false matter;—the fourth, That we must keep the seventh day, by resting from all sorts of work;—the fifth, That we must honor our parents;—the sixth, That we must abstain from murder;—the seventh, That we must not commit adultery;—the eighth, That we must not be guilty of theft;—the ninth, That we must not bear false witness;—the tenth, That we must not admit of the desire of any thing that is another's.&quot; —Josephus, Antiq.B.3,C.5,S.8, last sentence: &quot;When he had said this, he showed them the two tables, with the ten commandments engraven upon them, five upon each table; and the writing was by the hand of God.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tal'''. The Talmudic division, from the third-century Jewish [[Talmud]], makes verses 1–2 as the first &quot;saying&quot; or &quot;declaration&quot; (rather than &quot;commandment&quot;), and combines verses 3–6 as number 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/10.htm Judaism 101: Aseret ha-Dibrot: The &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Aug'''. The [[Augustine|Augustinian]] division (fifth century) starts with number 2 of the Talmudic division, and makes an extra commandment by dividing the prohibition on coveting into two. Both Roman Catholics and [[Martin Luther]] adopted the Augustinian method. Roman Catholics use Deuteronomy by default when quoting the Ten Commandments whereas Luther used the Exodus version.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, &quot;Questions of Exodus:&quot; Quæstionum in Heptateuchum libri VII, Book II, Question lxxi.&lt;br&gt;[http://bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.php Luther's small catechism] — ten commandments&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance within Judaism and Christianity ==
The Ten Commandments concern only matters of fundamental importance: the greatest obligation (to worship only God), the greatest injury to a person (murder), the greatest injury to family bonds (adultery), the greatest injury to commerce and law (bearing false witness), the greatest intergenerational obligation (honor to parents), the greatest obligation to community (truthfulness), the greatest injury to moveable property (theft).&lt;ref name=Huffmon&gt;Herbert Huffmon, &quot;The Fundamental Code Illustrated: The Third Commandment,&quot; in ''The Ten Commandments: The Reciprocity of Faithfulness,'' ed. William P. Brown., [http://books.google.com/books?id=87hQ2AjcttEC&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q=fundamental&amp;f=false pp. 205–212]. Westminster John Knox Press (2004). ISBN 0-664-22323-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Because they are fundamental, the Ten Commandments are written with room for varying interpretation.&lt;ref name=Huffmon/&gt; They are not as explicit&lt;ref name=Huffmon/&gt; or detailed as rules and regulations&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;[[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=jlwiXdFnaQEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q=principles&amp;f=false ''The Ten Commandments.''] Westminster John Knox Press (2001), originally ''The Plain Man's Guide to Ethics'' (1973). ISBN 0-664-22346-X&lt;/ref&gt; or many other biblical laws and commandments, because they provide guiding principles that apply universally, across changing circumstances. They do not specify punishments for their violation. Their precise import must be worked out in each separate situation.&lt;ref name=Barclay/&gt;

The Bible indicates the special status of the Ten Commandments among all other Old Testament laws in several ways. They have a uniquely terse style.&lt;ref name=ODay/&gt; Of all the biblical laws and commandments, the Ten Commandments alone&lt;ref name=ODay&gt;Gail R. O'Day and David L. Petersen, ''Theological Bible Commentary,'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=rQWknj4ORJkC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q=%22finger%20of%20God%22&amp;f=false p. 34].

In Judaism, the Ten Commandments provide God's universal and timeless standard of right and wrong, unlike [[613 mitzvot|the other 603 commandments]] in the [[Torah]], which describe various duties and ceremonies such as the [[kashrut]] dietary laws and now unobservable rituals to be performed by priests in the [[Holy Temple]].&lt;ref name=dosick&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the [[Second Temple]], the Ten Commandments were recited daily.&lt;ref name=Glustrom/&gt; They were removed from daily liturgy to dispute a claim by early Christians that ''only'' the Ten Commandments were handed down at Mount Sinai rather than the whole Torah.&lt;ref name=Glustrom/&gt; In later centuries, rabbis continued to omit the Ten Commandments from daily liturgy in order to prevent a confusion among Jews that they are ''only'' bound by the Ten Commandments, and not also by many other biblical and talmudic laws, such as the requirement to observe holy days other than the sabbath.&lt;ref name=Glustrom/&gt; Today, the Ten Commandments are heard in the synagogue three times a year: as they come up during the readings of Exodus and Deuteronomy, and during the festival of [[Shavuot]].&lt;ref name=Glustrom/&gt; In some traditions the worshippers rise for their reading to highlight their special significance.&lt;ref name=Glustrom&gt;Simon Glustrom, ''The Myth and Reality of Judaism,'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=y8nR8e7FzY0C&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp 113–114].

The Eastern Orthodox Church holds its moral truths to be chiefly contained in the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref name=Dabovich&gt;Sebastian Dabovich, ''Preaching in the Russian Church,'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=RsJFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 65].

J. Parker and Co. (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Roman Catholicism, Jesus freed Christians from the Jewish obligation to keep the [[613 mitzvot]], but not from their obligation to keep the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref name=Kreeft&gt;Jan Kreeft, ''Catholic Christianity: A Complete Catechism of Catholic Beliefs based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=VZ-xgfJkNNgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA202#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ch. 5]. Ignatius Press (2001). ISBN 0-89870-798-6&lt;/ref&gt; They are to the moral order what the creation story is to the natural order.&lt;ref name=Kreeft/&gt;

Even after rejecting the Roman Catholic moral theology, giving [[Law and Gospel|less importance to biblical law]] in order to better hear and be moved by the [[gospel]], early Protestant theologians still took the Ten Commandments to be the starting point of Christian moral life.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick&gt;[[Timothy Sedgwick]], ''The Christian Moral Life: Practices of Piety,'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=HFVg2jBgL3IC&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 9–20]. Church Publishing (2008). ISBN 1-59627-100-0&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of Christianity have varied in how they have translated the bare principles into the specifics that make up a full [[Christian ethic]].&lt;ref name=Sedgwick/&gt; Where Catholicism emphasizes taking action to fulfill the Ten Commandments, Protestantism uses the Ten Commandments for two purposes: to outline the Christian life to each person, and to make each person realize, through their failure to live that life, that they lack the ability to do it on their own.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick/&gt; Thus for Protestant Christianity, the Ten Commandments primarily serve to lead each Christian to the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace of God]].

==Religious interpretations==

===Judaism===
&lt;!-- Judaism footer, instead of overly large sidebar --&gt;

====The Two Tablets====
The arrangement of the commandments on the two tablets is interpreted in different ways in the classical Jewish tradition. Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says that each tablet contained five commandments, &quot;but the Sages say ten on one tablet and ten on the other&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Mekhilta#Mekilta of R. Ishmael|Mekhilta]] |author=Rabbi Ishmael |editor=Horowitz-Rabin (ed.) |pages=233, Tractate ''de-ba-Hodesh'', 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the commandments establish a covenant, it is likely that they were duplicated on both tablets. This can be compared to diplomatic treaties of [[Ancient Egypt]], in which a copy was made for each party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What was Written on the Two Tablets? |url=http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/kitisa/mar.html |last=Margaliot |first=Dr. Meshulam |year=2004 |month=July |publisher=Bar-Ilan University |accessdate=2006-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Talmud]], the compendium of traditional [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic Jewish]] law, tradition, and interpretation, the biblical verse &quot;the tablets were written on both their sides&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus||32:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; implies that the carving went through the full thickness of the tablets. The stones in the center part of some letters were not connected to the rest of the tablet, but they did not fall out. Moreover, the writing was also legible from both sides; it was not a mirror image of the text on the other side. The Talmud regards both phenomena as miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]'', tractate [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 104a.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Medieval [[Sefer ha-Chinuch]], the first four statements concern the relationship between God and humans, while the next six statements concern the relationships between people.

====Significance of the Decalogue====
The Ten Commandments are not given any greater significance in observance or special status. In fact, when undue emphasis was being placed on them, their daily communal recitation was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud''. tractate Berachot 12a.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish tradition does, however, recognize them as the theological basis for the rest of the commandments; a number of works (starting with Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]]) have made groupings of the commandments according to their links with the Ten Commandments.

The traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people, and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide Laws]] (several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments). In the era of the [[Sanhedrin]] transgressing any one of six of the Ten Commandments theoretically carried the [[death penalty]], the exceptions being the First Commandment, honoring your father and mother, saying God's name in vain, and coveting, though this was rarely enforced due to a large number of stringent [[rules of evidence|evidentiary requirements]] imposed by the [[Oral Torah|oral law]].

====Use in Jewish ritual====
The [[Mishnah]] records that it was the practice, in the Temple, to recite the Ten Commandments every day before the reading of the [[Shema]] (as preserved, for example, in the [[Nash Papyrus]] from c. 150 BCE); but that this practice was abolished in the synagogues so as not to give ammunition to heretics who claimed that they were the only important part of Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;Yerushalmi Berakhot, Chapter 1, fol. 3c. See also Rabbi David Golinkin, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Shavuot/In_the_Community/Torah_Reading_and_Haftarah/The_Ten_Commandments/In_Liturgy.shtml Whatever Happened to the Ten Commandments?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the normal course of the reading of the Torah, the Ten Commandments are read twice a year: the Exodus version in ''parashat [[Yitro (parsha)|Yitro]]'' around late January–February, and the Deuteronomy version in ''parashat [[Va'etchanan]]'' in August–September. In addition, the Exodus version constitutes the main Torah reading for the festival of [[Shavuot]]. It is widespread custom for the congregation to stand while they are being read even though many Rabbis, including [[Maimonides]], have come out against this custom since one may come to think that the Ten Commandments are more important than the rest of the [[Mitzvot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadArtical.aspx?id=1872&lt;/ref&gt;

In printed Bibles the Ten Commandments carry two sets of [[cantillation]] marks. The ''ta'am 'elyon'' (upper accentuation), which makes each Commandment into a separate verse, is used for public Torah reading, while the ''ta'am tachton'' (lower accentuation), which divides the text into verses of more even length, is used for private reading or study. The verse numbering in Christian Bibles follows the ''ta'am elyon'' while that in Jewish Bibles follows the ''ta'am tachton''. In Jewish Bibles the references to the Ten Commandments are therefore Exodus 20:2–14&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus||20:2–14|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Deuteronomy 5:6–18.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Deuteronomy||5:6–18|JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samaritan===
The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] varies in the Ten Commandments passages, both in that the Samaritan Deuteronomical version of the passage is much closer to that in Exodus, and in the addition of a commandment on the sanctity of [[Mount Gerizim]].

The text of the commandment follows:

:And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land of the Canaanites whither thou goest to take possession of it, thou shalt erect unto thee large stones, and thou shalt cover them with lime, and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this Law, and it shall come to pass when ye cross the Jordan, ye shall erect these stones which I command thee upon ''Mount Gerizim'', and thou shalt build there an altar unto the Lord thy God, an altar of stones, and thou shalt not lift upon them iron, of perfect stones shalt thou build thine altar, and thou shalt bring upon it burnt offerings to the Lord thy God, and thou shalt sacrifice peace offerings, and thou shalt eat there and rejoice before the Lord thy God. That mountain is on the other side of the Jordan at the end of the road towards the going down of the sun in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah facing Gilgal close by Elon Moreh facing Shechem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Samaritan Tenth Commandment |url=http://shomron0.tripod.com/update12.19.2002o.html|last=Gaster |first=Moses |work=The Samaritans, Their History, Doctrines and Literature |publisher=The [[Schweich Lectures]] |year=1923 |authorlink=Moses Gaster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reference by Jesus====
{{See also|Expounding of the Law}}
In the [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|19:16-19|9|19:16–19}}, [[Jesus]] repeated five of the Ten Commandments, followed by that commandment called &quot;the second&quot; ({{bibleref2|Matthew|22:34-40|9|Mat.22:34–40}}) after the [[Great Commandment|first and great commandment]].

{{Quotation|1=&lt;font face=Verdana&gt;Matthew 19:16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?&lt;BR&gt;17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? ''there is'' none good but one, ''that is'', God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.&lt;BR&gt;18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,&lt;BR&gt;19 Honour thy father and ''thy'' mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&lt;/font&gt;|2=Matthew 19:16-19 [[Authorized King James Version|KJV]]&lt;BR&gt;{{bibleref2|Matt.19:16-19;Mark.10:17-19;Luke.18:18-20||9|Compare with Mark &amp;amp; Luke}}. }}

====Reference by Paul====
In his [[epistle to the Romans]], the apostle [[Paul the apostle|Paul]] also mentioned five of the Ten Commandments and associated them with the neighbourly love commandment.

{{Quotation|1=&lt;font face=Verdana&gt;Romans 13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.&lt;br&gt;9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if ''there be'' any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&lt;br&gt;10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love ''is'' the fulfilling of the law.&lt;/font&gt;|2={{bibleref|Romans|13:8-10|9}} KJV}}

====Lutheranism====
{{see also|Law and Gospel}}
The Lutheran division of the commandments follows the one established by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the then current synagogue scribal division. The first three commandments govern the relationship between God and humans, the fourth through eighth govern public relationships between people, and the last two govern private thoughts. See Luther's Small Catechism&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.php#tencommandments Luther's Small Catechism] (1529)&lt;/ref&gt; and Large Catechism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.bookofconcord.org/lc-3-tencommandments.php Luther's Large Catechism] (1529)&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Covenant Theology====
{{main|New Covenant Theology}}
''New Covenant Theology'' (''NCT'') is a recently expressed [[Christian theological]] view of [[Redemptive-Historical Preaching|redemptive history]] which claims that all [[Old Covenant]] laws have been [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|cancelled]]&lt;ref&gt;''ALL Old Testament Laws Cancelled: 24 Reasons Why All Old Testament Laws Are Cancelled and All New Testament Laws Are for Our Obedience'', Greg Gibson, 2008, page 7: &quot;New Covenant Theology ... [has]... a better priest, better sacrifice, and better covenant (containing a better law).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of the [[Law of Christ]] or [[New Covenant]] law of the [[New Testament]]. This can be summarized as the ethical expectation found in the [[New Testament]]. New Covenant Theology does not reject all [[religious law]], they only reject Old Covenant law. NCT is in contrast with other views on [[Biblical law in Christianity|biblical law]] in that most others do not believe the ''Ten Commandments'' and [[Divine law]]s of the Old Covenant have been cancelled and prefer the term &quot;[[Supersessionism]]&quot; (rather than &quot;cancelled&quot; or &quot;abrogated&quot;) for the rest. In 2001, Richard Barcellos, an associate professor and pastor of a [[Reformed Baptist]] Church in California, published a critique of ''NCT'' for proposing that the Ten Commandments have been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;''In Defense of the Decalogue : A Critique of New Covenant Theology'', Richard Barcellos, Founder's Press, 2001. Barcellos is an associate professor of New Testament Studies at the Midwest Center for Theological Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic ethics#Moral commandments}}

The Qur'an states that &quot;tablets&quot; were given to Moses, without quoting their contents explicitly:
:&quot;And We ordained laws for him in the tablets in all matters, both commanding and explaining all things, (and said): 'Take and hold these with firmness, and enjoin thy people to hold fast by the best in the precepts: soon shall I show you the homes of the wicked,- (How they lie desolate).'&quot; ({{cite quran|7|145|style=ref}})

These tablets are not broken in the Qur'an, but picked up later:
:&quot;When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: 'Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?' He put down the tablets, seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him...&quot; ({{cite quran|7|150|style=ref}}). &quot;When the anger of Moses was appeased, he took up the tablets: in the writing thereon was guidance and Mercy for such as fear their Lord.&quot; ({{cite quran|7|154|style=ref}}).

===Main points of interpretative difference===

====Sabbath day====
{{Main|Sabbath in Christianity|Shabbat}}

'''[[Sabbath in Christianity]]''' is a weekly day of [[leisure|rest]] or religious observance, derived from the [[Biblical Sabbath|sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;({{lang-he|[[wikt:שַׁבָּת|שַׁבָּת]]}}, ''shabbâth'', {{StrongHebrew|7676}}, meaning intensive &quot;repose&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Non-Sabbatarianism]]''' is the principle of [[Christian liberty]] from being bound to physical sabbath observance. Most dictionaries provide both first-day and seventh-day definitions for &quot;sabbath&quot; and &quot;Sabbatarian&quot;, among other related uses.

Until the 2nd and 3rd century Christians kept the [[Jewish Sabbath]], with the practice of Sunday, the day of resurrection, gradually becoming the dominant day of observance from the [[Jewish-Roman wars]] onward; until this Christianity was predominantly still a Jewish sect. The Catholic Church's general repudiation of Jewish practices during this period is apparent in the [[Council of Laodicea]] (4th Century AD) where Canons 37–38 state: &quot;It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them&quot; and &quot;It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3806.htm Synod of Laodicea (4th Century)] – New Advent&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 29 of the Laodicean council specificially refers to the sabbath: &quot;Christians must not judaize by resting on the [Jewish] Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honoring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians. But if any shall be found to be [[judaizers]], let them be [[anathema]] ([[excommunication|excommunicated]]) from Christ.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;/&gt;

====Killing or murder====
{{Main|You shall not kill}}

[[File:Sixth Commandment (Temple Church, London).jpg|right|thumb|The Sixth Commandment, as translated by the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (1549). &lt;br /&gt;The image is from the altar screen of the [[Temple Church]] near the Law Courts in London.]]

Multiple translations exist of the fifth/sixth commandment; the Hebrew words לא תרצח (lo tirtzach) are variously translated as &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot; or &quot;thou shalt not murder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Exodus%2020:13 Exodus 20:13] Multiple versions and languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The imperative is against unlawful killing resulting in bloodguilt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_03145.html Bloodguilt, Jewish Virtual Library], Genesis 4:10, Genesis 9:6, Genesis 42:22, Exodus 22:2-2, Leviticus 17:4, Leviticus 20, Numbers 20, Deuteronomy 19, Deuteronomy 32:43, Joshua 2:19, Judges 9:24, 1 Samuel 25, 2 Samuel 1, 2 Samuel 21, 1 Kings 2, 1 Kings 21:19, 2 Kings 24:4, Psalm 9:12, Psalm 51:14, Psalm 106:38, Proverbs 6:17, Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 26:21, Jeremiah 22:17, Lamentations 4:13, Ezekiel 9:9, Ezekiel 36:18, Hosea 4:2, Joel 3:19, Habakkuk 2:8, Matthew 23:30-35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50-51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible contains numerous prohibitions against unlawful killing, but also allows for justified killing in the context of [[warfare]] ({{bibleref2|1Kings|2:5-6|9|1Kings 2:5–6}}), [[capital punishment]] ({{bibleref2|Leviticus|20:9-16|9|Leviticus 20:9–16}}) and [[self-defence]] ({{bibleref2|Exodus|22:2-3|9|Exodus 22:2–3}}). The New Testament is in agreement that murder is a grave moral evil,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:21, Matthew 15:19, Matthew 19:19, Matthew 22:7, Mark 10:19, Luke 18:20, Romans 13:9, 1 Timothy 1:9, James 2:11, Revelation 21:8&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains the Old Testament view of bloodguilt.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 23:30-35, Matthew 27:4, Luke 11:50-51, Romans 3:15, Revelation 6:10, Revelation 18:24&lt;/ref&gt;

====You shall not steal====
{{Main|You shall not steal}}
Significant voices among academic theologians (such as German Old Testament scholar [[Albrecht Alt]]: ''Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog'' (1953)) suggest that commandment &quot;you shall not steal&quot; was originally intended against stealing people—against abductions and slavery, in agreement with the Talmudic interpretation of the statement as &quot;you shall not kidnap&quot; (Sanhedrin 86a).

====Idolatry====
{{Main|Idolatry|Idolatry in Judaism|Idolatry in Christianity}}

In Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, while some thought it inappropriate; no church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons. In 726, [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730, a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787, the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815, [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843, [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt; This mostly settled the matter until the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council &quot;emanated from Satan&quot;.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt; Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt; Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible. To emphasize the theological importance of the incarnation, the Orthodox Church encourages the use of icons in church and private devotions, but prefers a two-dimensional depiction&lt;ref name=Hore&gt;
Alexander Hugh Hore, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Oz68qcjV3MQC&amp;dq=%22orthodox%20church%22%20%22statues%22&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flat%20pictures%22&amp;f=false ''Eighteen Centuries of the Orthodox Church''], J. Parker and co. (1899)&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;The images or Icons, as they are called, of the Greek Church are not, it must be remarked, sculptured images, but flat pictures or mosaics; not even the Crucifix is sanctioned; and herein consists the difference between the Greek and Roman Churches, in the latter of which both pictures and statues are allowed, and venerated with equal honour.&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=Oz68qcjV3MQC&amp;dq=%22orthodox%20church%22%20%22statues%22&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.353]
&lt;/ref&gt; as a reminder of this theological aspect. Icons depict the spiritual dimension of their subject rather than attempting a naturalistic portrayal.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;
Archpriest John W. Morris, ''The Historic Church: An Orthodox View of Christian History,'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=KdEgOBdJqxEC&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage chapter 7]. AuthorHouse (2011) ISBN 1-4567-3492-X
&lt;/ref&gt; In modern use (usually as a result of Roman Catholic influence), more naturalistic images and images of the Father, however, also appear occasionally in Orthodox churches, but statues, i.e. three-dimensional depictions, continue to be banned.&lt;ref name=Hore /&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] holds that one may build and use &quot;likenesses&quot;, as long as the object is not worshipped. Many Roman Catholic Churches and services feature images; some feature statues. For Roman Catholics, this practice is understood as fulfilling the Second Commandment, as they understand that these images are not being worshipped.

For Jews and Muslims, veneration violates the Second Commandment. Jews and Muslims read this commandment as prohibiting the use of idols and images in any way.

Some Protestants will picture Jesus in his human form, while refusing to make any image of God or Jesus in Heaven.

Strict [[Amish]] people forbid any sort of image, such as photographs.

==Critical historical analysis==

===Early theories===
Critical scholarship is divided over its interpretation of the ten commandment texts.

The classic form of higher criticism was [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s documentary hypothesis (see [[JEDP]]), first published in 1878. According to his scheme, Exodus 20-23 and 34 were composed by the J or Jehovist writer and &quot;might be regarded as the document which formed the starting point of the religious history of Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Wellhausen 1973 ''Prolegomena to the history of Israel'' Glouster, MA: Peter Smith. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 5 would then reflect Josiah's attempt to link the document produced by his court to the older Mosaic tradition.

In a 2002 analysis of the history of this position, Dr. [[Bernard M. Levinson]] has argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more ritualistic to the more ethical. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at Mt. Sinai would have emphasized rituals, and that the &quot;ethical&quot; Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the messiah, Jesus Christ. Dr. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of this polemic that the supersession of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). &quot;Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: The Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis&quot;. Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 114 (2): 212–223&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, historians who accepted the basic premises of multiple authorship had come to reject the idea of an orderly evolution of Israelite religion. Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times.  This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20: 2-17 and Exodus 34: 10-28 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that &quot;had already been normalized in the period of the Judges&quot; (i.e. of the tribal alliance).&lt;ref&gt;John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition. Philadelphia: the Westminster Press. 142-143&lt;br&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q=%22normalized%22&amp;f=false 4th edition p.146-147] ISBN 0-664-22068-1&lt;/ref&gt; He concurs about the importance of the decalogue as &quot;a central feature in the covenant that brought together Israel into being as a people&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q=%22central%20feature%22&amp;f=false Bright, John, 2000, ''A History of Israel'' 4th ed. p.146]&lt;/ref&gt; but views the parallels between Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, along with other evidence, as reason to believe that it is relatively close to its original form and Mosaic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition. Philadelphia: the Westminster Press. 142 [http://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4th ed. p.146+]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hittite treaties===
According to John Bright, however, there is an important distinction between the Decalogue and the &quot;book of the covenant&quot; (Exodus 21-23 and 34:10–24). The Decalogue, he argues, was modeled on the suzerainty treaties of the [[Hittites]] (and other Mesopotamian Empires), that is, represents the relationship between God and Israel as a relationship between king and vassal, and enacts that bond.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition. Philadelphia: the Westminster Press. 146-147 [http://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4th ed. p.150-151]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The prologue of the Hittite treaty reminds his vassals of his benevolent acts.. (compare with Exodus 20:2 &quot;I am the {{LORD}} your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.&quot;)  The Hittite treaty also stipulated the obligations imposed by the ruler on his vassals, which included a prohibition of relations with peoples outside the empire, or enmity between those within.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Cornfeld, Gaalyahu Ed Pictorial Biblical Encyclopedia, MacMillan 1964 p 237&lt;/ref&gt;(Exodus 20:3 &quot;You shall have no other gods before Me.&quot;)  Viewed as a treaty rather than a law code, its purpose is not so much to regulate human affairs as to define the scope of the king's power.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition. Philadelphia: the Westminster Press. 165 [http://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4th ed. p.169-170]&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Morgenstern argued that Exodus 34 is distinct from the Jahwist document, identifying it with king Asa's reforms in 899 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{citation | first = Julius | last = Morgenstern | year = 1927 | title = The Oldest Document of the [[Hexateuch]] | publisher = HUAC | volume = IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bright, however, believes that like the Decalogue this text has its origins in the time of the tribal alliance. The book of the covenant, he notes, bears a greater similarity to Mesopotamian law codes (e.g. the [[Code of Hammurabi]] which was inscribed on a stone [[stele]]). He argues that the function of this &quot;book&quot; is to move from the realm of treaty to the realm of law: &quot;The Book of the Covenant (Ex., chs. 21 to 23; cf. ch. 34), which is no official state law, but a description of normative Israelite judicial procedure in the days of the Judges, is the best example of this process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Book%20of%20the%20Covenant%22&amp;f=false Bright, John, 2000, ''A History of Israel'' 4th ed. p.173]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bright, then, this body of law too predates the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition. Philadelphia: the Westminster Press. 166 [http://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 4th ed. p.170+]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
If the Ten Commandments are based on [[Hittites|Hittite]] forms that would date it somewhere between the 14th-12th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Finkelstein, Neil Asher Silberman (2002). [http://books.google.com/books?id=lu6ywyJr0CMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Bible%20Unearthed.&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Exodus%20did%20not%20happen%22&amp;f=false ''The Bible Unearthed'']. p 63. ISBN 0-7432-2338-1&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] argue that &quot;the astonishing composition came together... in the seventh century BCE&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Finkelstein, Neil Asher Silberman (2002). ''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical scholar [[Yehezkel Kaufmann]] (1960) dates the oral form of the covenant to the time of [[Josiah]].&lt;ref name=Kaufmann1960&gt;Yehezkal Kaufmann 1960 ''The Religion of Israel: From its beginnings to the Babylonian Exile'' trans. and Abridged by Moshe Greenberg. New York: Schocken Books 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; An even later date (after 586 BCE) is suggested by David H. Aaron.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://huc.edu/chronicle/68/articles/EtchedInStone.pdf &quot;Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue&quot;]|99.8&amp;nbsp;KB}}, ''The Chronicle'', Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, Issue 68, 2006, p. 42. &quot;a critical survey of biblical literature demonstrates no cognizance of the ten commandments prior to the post-exilic period (after 586 B.C.E.)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ritual Decalogue===
{{Main|Ritual Decalogue}}

Some proponents of the [[Documentary hypothesis]] have argued that the biblical text in Exodus 34:28&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:28|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a different list as the ten commandments, that of Exodus 34:11–27.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|34:11–27|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this passage does not prohibit murder, adultery, theft, etc., but instead deals with the proper worship of [[Yahweh]], some scholars call it the &quot;[[Ritual Decalogue]]&quot;, and disambiguate the ten commandments of traditional understanding as the &quot;Ethical Decalogue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha.'' Augmented Third Edition, New Revised Standard Version, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hebrew Bible: A Brief Socio-Literary Introduction.'' Norman Gottwald, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch.'' T. Desmond Alexander and David Weston Baker, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary on the Torah.'' Richard Elliott Friedman, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these scholars the Bible includes multiple versions of events.  On the basis of many points of analysis including linguistic it is shown as a patchwork of sources sometimes with bridging comments by the editor (Redactor) but otherwise left intact from the original, frequently side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott [[The Bible with Sources Revealed]] 2003 p 7&lt;/ref&gt;
 		
[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] argues that the Ten Commandments at Exodus 20:1-17 &quot;does not appear to belong to any of the major sources.  It is likely to be an independent document, which was inserted here by the Redactor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott [[The Bible with Sources Revealed]] 2003 page 153&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the [[Covenant Code]] follows that version of the Ten Commandments in the northern Israel E narrative. In the J narrative in Exodus 34 the editor of the combined story known as the Redactor (or RJE), adds in an explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets which were shattered. &quot;In the combined JE text, it would be awkward to picture God just commanding Moses to make some tablets, as if there were no history to this matter, so RJE adds the explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets that were shattered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott &quot;The Bible with Sources Revealed 2003 page 177&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that Exodus 34:14-26 is the J text of the Ten Commandments: &quot;The first two commandments and the sabbath commandment have parallels in the other versions of the Ten Commandments. (Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5)... The other seven commandments here are completely different.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott [[The Bible with Sources Revealed]] 2003 page 179&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that differences in the J and E versions of the Ten Commandments story are a result of power struggles in the priesthood.  The writer has Moses smash the tablets &quot;because this raised doubts about the Judah's central religious shrine&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott &quot;Who Wrote The Bible?&quot; 1987 pp 73-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Kaufmann, the Decalogue and the book of the covenant represent two ways of manifesting God's presence in Israel: the Ten Commandments taking the archaic and material form of stone tablets kept in the [[ark of the covenant]], while the book of the covenant took oral form to be recited to the people.&lt;ref name=Kaufmann1960/&gt;

==United States debate over display on public property==
{{See also|Roy Moore|Van Orden v. Perry|Separation of church and state in the United States}}
[[File:TenCommandmentsAustinStateCapitol.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a large stone monument displaying the ten commandments with the Texas State Capitol in Austin in the background. The picture was part of a news release Wednesday, March second, 2005, by then Attorney General Abbott.|Ten Commandments display at the [[Texas State Capitol]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].]]
There have been recurring disputes in the [[United States]] concerning the posting of the ten commandments on [[public property]]. Certain conservative religious groups{{Who|date=March 2010}} have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings. Posting the Decalogue on a public building can take a sectarian stance, if numbered. Protestants and Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and Jews number the commandments differently. However, this problem can be circumnavigated by simply not numbering the commandments, as was done at the Texas capitol (shown here). Hundreds of these monuments—including some of those causing dispute—were originally placed by [[film director|director]] [[Cecil B. DeMille]] as a [[publicity stunt]] to promote his 1956 [[film]] ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 movie)|The Ten Commandments]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200109/10_schmitzr_laxten-m/ MPR: The Ten Commandments: Religious or historical symbol?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property, arguing that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]].

In contrast, groups supporting the public display of the ten commandments{{Who|date=April 2010}} claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present day legal codes. Also, some{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].

U.S. legislators counter that the ten commandments are derived from Judeo-Christian religions. The statement &quot;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&quot; excludes Hinduism and Zoroastrianism for example, which are not Judeo-Christian, monotheistic religions. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The perception that a US state church has been established is viewed as repugnant, the impression being that the intent of the establishment clause regarding freedom of religion is undermined.

In addition, it has been argued {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} if the Commandments are posted, it would require that members of other religions be allowed to post the particular tenets of their religions as well. For example, an organization by the name of [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in Utah for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.

Some religious Jews{{Who|date=April 2010}} oppose the posting of the ten commandments in public schools, as they feel it is wrong for public schools to teach their children Judaism. The argument is that if a Jewish parent wishes to teach their child to be a Jew, then this education should come only from practicing Jews. This position is based on the demographic fact that the vast majority of public school teachers in the United States are not Jews; the same is true for the students. This same reasoning and position is also held by many believers in other religions. Many Christians have some concerns about this as well; for example, can Catholic parents count on Protestant or Orthodox Christian teachers to tell their children their particular understanding of the commandments? Differences in the interpretation and translation of these commandments, as noted above, can sometimes be significant.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) have launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. Opponents of these displays include a number of religious groups, including some Christian denominations{{Who|date=April 2010}}, both because they don't want government to be issuing religious doctrine, and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation.
