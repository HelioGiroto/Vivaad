An '''altar server''' is a [[laity|lay]] assistant to a member of the [[clergy]] during a [[Christianity|Christian]] religious [[church service|service]]. An altar server attends to supporting tasks at the [[altar]] such as fetching and carrying, ringing the altar bell and so on.

==Altar servers in the Catholic Church==
[[Image:Misdienaar.jpg|thumb|200px|50 Altar servers, during a celebration of a 50-year-old church, [[Gennep]], The Netherlands]]
Formerly, only men and boys could serve at the altar, but canon 230 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] promulgated in 1983 allowed local ordinaries to permit girls and women to do so (see [[Female altar servers]]). In the United States, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lincoln|Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska]] has not granted permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2006-03-22-altar-girls_x.htm USATODAY.com - Neb. diocese is lone U.S. holdout on allowing altar girls]&lt;/ref&gt; The priest in charge of a church is not obliged to avail of the permission, where granted. [[Traditionalist Catholic]] groups such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter|FSSP]] and the [[Institute of Christ the King]] and some individual priests do not. The practice is also not accepted by those who act independently of the diocesan bishops, as is the case with the [[SSPX]].

The term &quot;[[acolyte]]&quot; is sometimes applied to altar servers, but in the proper sense means someone who has been received the ministry of that name, usually reserved for those who are to be promoted to the permanent or transitory [[diaconate]]. These must receive the ministry of acolyte, which historically was classified as a [[minor order]], at least six months before being ordained as deacons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3R.HTM canon 1035 of the Code of Canon Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duties at Mass (ordinary form of the Roman Rite)===
In the ordinary (normal) form of the Roman Rite of the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], provided no instituted [[acolyte]] is participating,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 100]&lt;/ref&gt; altar servers have the following responsibilities during
*Entrance: Servers are to act as [[thurible|thurifer]] with burning incense (if incense is used at the Mass), as bearers of lighted candles flanking another carrying the [[cross]] and as other participants in the entrance procession.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 120&lt;/ref&gt;
*Servers hold the liturgical books for the celebrant when he is not at the altar and is proclaiming the presidential prayers with outstretched hands. They bring and hold such things as books, thuribles, water and towel, plates, and microphones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/CTM.pdf Catholic Bishops' Conference of England &amp; Wales, ''Celebrating the Mass: A Pastoral Introduction'' (Catholic Truth Society 2005), p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Proclamation of the Gospel: At the preceding [[Alleluia]] or other chant, the thurible is presented to the priest for him to put incense in it,&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and then for the proclamation of the Gospel servers precede the priest or deacon to the [[ambo (liturgy)|ambo]], perhaps carrying candles and incense.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, nos. 133, 175]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Beginning of the Liturgy of the Eucharist: Servers arrange the corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on the altar,&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 139&lt;/ref&gt; and then assist the priest in receiving the bread and wine and perhaps other gifts that are presented to him.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 140&lt;/ref&gt; They present the [[cruet]]s of wine and water for the priest or deacon to pour some into the chalice.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no 142&lt;/ref&gt; If incense is used, the thurible and incense are presented to the priest and, at least if there is no deacon, a server then incenses the priest and the people.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, nos. 144, 178&lt;/ref&gt; When the priest then washes his hands standing at the side of the altar, a server pours the water over them.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 145&lt;/ref&gt;
*Consecration: A server rings a bell as a signal to the people shortly before the consecration and, where it is the local custom, rings the bell also when the priest displays the consecrated host and chalice to the people. If incense is used, a server incenses the host and the chalice while these are being shown.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 150&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sign of Peace: The servers receive the sign of peace from the priest or deacon within the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, nos. 154, 181&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recessional: The servers accompany the priest as at the entrance procession.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

If a bishop celebrates Mass solemnly, two servers, wearing vimpas, hold the [[mitre]] and the [[crosier]], and present them at the appropriate times.

===Duties in the 1962 form===
[[File:Priest or seminarian with censor.jpg|right|80px|thumb|A Catholic priest or seminarian serving as a [[thurifer]].]]

In Mass as in the 1962 [[Roman Missal]], which is an authorized [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] ([[Tridentine Mass|Mass]]), altar servers have the following responsibilities at [[Low Mass]] and [[Missa Cantata]].
*Mass of the Catechumens
**Processional: Servers carry the [[thurible]], incense boat, processional [[cross]] and candles (flambeaux) in a [[Missa Cantata]].
**After the sacristy bells are rung and first genuflection at the [[high altar]], the server takes the priest's biretta, kisses it, and places on the Presidential Chair.
**Post-Epistle: Servers move [[Missal]] from [[Epistle]] side of the altar to the Gospel side of the altar.

*Mass of the Faithful
**Servers ring the [[altar bell]] once as the priest unveils chalice and places veil on altar.
**Preparation of the chalice: Servers present the cruets of water and wine for the deacon or priest to pour in the [[chalice (cup)|chalice]].
**Lavabo: A server administers the water to the Priest as he ritually washes his hands.
**Beginning of the Sanctus: Altar bell is rung thrice.
**Canon of Mass: When the priest extends his hands over the chalice, serverds ring altar bell once, stand, take the bell, without genuflecting kneel on either side of the priest.
**Consecration: At each consecration servers make a deep bow at the priest's first genuflection, and ring the bell once. During each major elevation, servers kneel erect, raising the back of the [[chasuble]] and ringing the bell thrice. During the priest's second genuflection, servers release chasuble, make a deep bow and ring the bell once. After the consecration, holding the bell, servers return to their posts and kneel.
**Post [[Agnus Dei]]: Servers get patens from [[credence table]] and go back to posts with genuflections and kneeling. When the priest genuflects and says the triple &quot;Domine, non sum dignus...&quot; servers ring the bell thrice.
**Communion: Follow priest with [[paten]] in hand and hand over breast for the Communion.
**[[Ablution in Christianity|Ablutions]]: Get the water and wine cruets from credence table. For the first ablution at center of the altar, the server with the wine approaches as the priest tips the chalice toward the server. The server pours a little wine into the chalice, he bows and turns to his right and returns to the [[Epistle]] corner and wait for the priest. When the priest approaches for the second ablution, the server makes a moderate bow, pours a little wine over his fingers and then as much water as he desires. Then, with genuflections, switch the [[chalice veil]] from the Gospel side to the Epistle side with the Missal at the same time.
**Ending procession: Same as Processional.

===Vestments===
While ordained and instituted ministers must wear an [[alb]] (with [[cincture]] and [[amice]] unless the form of the alb makes these unnecessary), albs or any other appropriate attire, such as a [[cassock]] and [[surplice]], may be worn by servers.&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, nos. 119, 336&lt;/ref&gt; Black and red are the most common colours for a server's cassock, if used.

==Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches==
[[File:Me in church with bishop.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ukrainian Catholic]] bishop and priests during the [[Divine Liturgy]], with altar servers in front (note the crossed [[oraria]] the servers are wearing).]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], altar servers assist the higher clergy during services. They might carry the cross, candles or [[Flabellum|liturgical fans]] in [[Crucession|processions]] and [[Entrance (Liturgical)|entrances]]; maintain the [[thurible|censer]], ensuring it has enough live charcoal, loading it with [[incense]] and handing it to the priest or deacon when required; preparing the hot water (''[[Zeon (liturgy)|zeon]]'') in time for it to be added to the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] at the [[Divine Liturgy]]; prepare the [[antidoron]] for the people to receive after [[Holy Communion]]; and any other necessary tasks so that the celebrant need not be distracted during the service. An altar server is vested in the [[sticharion]] only.

In the [[early Church]], before someone could be a server he had to be [[Tonsure#Eastern Christianity|tonsured]]. Nowadays, in many places it is not necessary to be tonsured before one is allowed to serve (since the tonsure must be done by a bishop or higher-ranking priest). The rites of &quot;Setting Aside a Taper-bearer&quot; and &quot;Tonsuring a [[Reader (liturgy)#Orthodoxy|Reader]]&quot; have now been combined into one service. It is the custom in some traditions, such as the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] or [[Melkite]] Catholic, to allow tonsured altar servers to also vest in the [[orarion]], worn crossed over the back like that of a [[subdeacon]] but with the ends hanging parallel in front. Among the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russians]], however, the orarion is not usually worn by servers, but only by duly ordained subdeacons and deacons, with the exception that laymen who are blessed to perform some of the functions of subdeacons may sometimes be blessed to wear the orar.

Before vesting, the server must fold his sticharion and bring it to the priest for him to bless. The priest blesses and lays his hand on the folded sticharion. The server kisses the priest's hand and the Cross on the vestment, and then withdraws to vest. Any server who has not been tonsured must remove the sticharion when he receives [[Holy Communion]], because communicants receive the Mysteries according to their order within the Church (so tonsured clergy vest while laymen remove their vestments). Before divesting at the end of the service, the server must receive the priest's blessing.

The minimum age varies by local circumstance, but boys must be mature enough to carry out their duties without disrupting the sanctity of the altar. Although it is common in North America for boys to act as altar servers, in some places this practice is virtually unknown and these duties are always carried out by adult men. In other places where altar servers are normally boys, adult men will not vest if called upon to serve. In yet other places, boys are not permitted to serve in the Altar on reaching their teens on the grounds that the young man is no longer innocent enough to serve in the altar. &lt;!-- This last sounds like BS to me, but am preserving the information for reasons of AGF on the part of the editor who added it. I'd delete it as OR if this article were at all referenced. --&gt;

Altar servers, regardless of age, are subject to all the normal restrictions for those not of higher clerical position. Anyone who is bleeding, or has an open sore, is not permitted to enter the altar. They may not touch the altar table or anything on it under any circumstances, nor the [[prothesis (liturgy)#Architecture|prothesis]] without a blessing. They may not touch the sacred vessels, the chalice and [[paten|diskos]] (paten) at any time. They may not stand directly in front of the altar table or pass between the front of it and the [[iconostasis]], but must cross between the altar and the [[High Place]] if they need to move to the opposite side.

Women may not serve in the altar except in women's [[monastery|monasteries]]. In that case they do not receive the clerical tonsure (though they must be tonsured [[nun]]s), and do not vest in the sticharion, but wear their normal [[religious habit]] for attending services, and serve at a certain distance from the actual altar table. Normally, only older nuns may serve in the altar; but the [[Hegumen]]ia ([[Abbess]]) is permitted to enter even if she is younger.

==Other churches==
{{Main|Acolyte}}
In lower [[Anglican]] churches, most [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Churches, and in the [[Methodist Church]], all who serve in the above positions are called [[acolyte]]s.

In [[Anglo-Catholic]] and some [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] Churches however, the vast majority of roles associated with an altar server are the same as those in the Catholic Church, and the same titles for each individual role are retained from Catholic tradition – mostly restored during the [[Oxford Movement]] in the 19th century.
