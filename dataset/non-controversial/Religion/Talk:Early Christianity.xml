==Protestants and Baptism==
The section on baptism states (speaking of baptism by sprinkling vs. immersion) that, &quot;This interpretation is debated between Protestants (who believe in baptism by immersion) and Roman Catholics (who believe in sprinkling instead of baptism by immersion).&quot; This would falsely lead the reader to conclude that all Protestants practice baptism by immersion, while in reality most do not and have not historically. I am going to revise this for clarity.

== Shortening the page ==

I'd be happy to shorten the page, as long as we do so by condensing the information rather than by removing it. We can take a section that's longish, bust it out as its own page, and then condense the information on this page. What section would make a good start? How about we take the &quot;beliefs&quot; and &quot;orthodoxy/heterodoxy&quot; sections and use them as the basis for an article called &quot;Early Christian beliefs&quot;?

By the way, a lead that actually summarizes the topic really helps a long article because it allows the reader to get the gist easily without wading through a lot of text. Of course, if an editor doesn't want a reader to easily learn what historians know about early Christianity, then their goal would obviously be to make it more difficult, not less, for the reader to get the gist. [[User:Leadwind|Leadwind]] ([[User talk:Leadwind|talk]]) 18:03, 9 May 2010 (UTC)

:I am glad to see information condensed.





there were many men to believed to be called THE RED DEVIL who organized a group called F10.





 
:I agree the orthodoxy/heterodoxy section is too long. Splitting it out (as I have done with a couple other sections already just to get it down to this size) sounds like a good idea. The material may not be balance for lenght, but it could serve as a good start. I am not sure yet if it would be better to have the article about ''all'' early Christian beliefs, including orthodox ones, or not.

::Let's include orthodoxy and heterodoxy within early Christian beliefs as a separate page.

== Re. length of this article ==

In my opinion, the note at the beginning of the article saying it &quot;may be too long to read and navigate comfortably&quot; is ridiculous.  There are thousands of fine wikipedia articles that are longer than this one.  As this article is now, I don't have to look in five different places to get the information.  To break it up would make navigation considerably more difficult.  It's all in one place here, and that's preferable.

== Divinity of Christ gone wrong?==

I guess that or someone got confused or there had been some bad editing. 
Now somewhere in the middle of the second paragraph is written:

''The book has many other images, in particular that of a fearsome beast whose worshippers and those who receive its mark &quot;will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb&quot; (Revelation 14:9-11), an effect not attributed to the Lamb itself. The book speaks of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God as reigning with him for a thousand years[40] before the final defeat of Satan[41] and the Judgement at the Great White Throne.[42]''

I'm no Bible expert, but I don't think that the beast mentioned in the first sentence (cited from Revelations) is Jesus and the second sentence seems at least missing a first part.
--[[User:Dia^|Dia^]] ([[User talk:Dia^|talk]]) 20:52, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
:I'm sorry, I can find in the text no indication that the beast is Jesus or that anything is missing from the sentence that begins &quot;The book speaks of those...&quot;  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 05:53, 10 August 2010 (UTC)

::Sorry Esogolou, maybe I didn't express myself clearly enough. 
::The paragraph before and after the here cited sentences is a long list of how Jesus is described in the different texts in the Bible. Than suddenly the beast is mentioned. So it seemed to me to a first reading that the cited beast should be a description of Jesus. But if you read the text in the book of Revelations is clearly not the case. Moreover I find the following sentences (an effect not attributed to the Lamb itself. The book speaks of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God as reigning with him for a thousand years[40] before the final defeat of Satan[41] and the Judgement at the Great White Throne.) equally unclear.
--[[User:Dia^|Dia^]] ([[User talk:Dia^|talk]]) 10:21, 10 August 2010 (UTC)

It should probably be removed. It's just describing Revelation in extra detail, which seems to me extraneous to belief about Christ's divinity.

== Heresy and heterodoxy ==

Heresy and heterodoxy are not the same thing, as that section seems to imply. Heresy is incorrect ''doctrine'' (EG The idea that Christ was only divine after the Resurrection, or that he only went into what we would now call a coma while on the cross [Both of which are actual Early Church heresies, by the way]). Heterodoxy is incorrect ''praise'' (EG Worshipping God half-heartedly). This should be clarified. [[User:The Mysterious El Willstro|The Mysterious El Willstro]] ([[User talk:The Mysterious El Willstro|talk]]) 08:08, 11 December 2010 (UTC)
:I'm unconvinced of this distinction that you draw.  As far as I can tell, heresy is what you call heterodox beliefs that you decide are unorthodox.  Can you provide [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that support your definition of heterodoxy? --[[User:Richardshusr|Richard S]] ([[User talk:Richardshusr|talk]]) 10:08, 11 December 2010 (UTC)
::I could do a lengthy pouring-over of the Catechism and find it. Alternatively, I could email Father Paul (the Priest who taught my RCIA class) and find it in his Seminary notes. (The latter is probably what I'll do.) [[User:The Mysterious El Willstro|The Mysterious El Willstro]] ([[User talk:The Mysterious El Willstro|talk]]) 06:27, 2 May 2011 (UTC)

:::I think Richard is right, given that the ''New and enlarged handbook of Christian theology'' by Donald W. Musser, Joseph L. Price page 230 says: &quot;HERESY/HETERODOXY: Heresy or heterodoxy is an opinion or doctrine considered to be at variance with established religious beliefs&quot;. So it would be either heresy or heterodoxy to assume they are different, which ever way is preferred. [[User:History2007|History2007]] ([[User talk:History2007|talk]]) 23:40, 3 December 2011 (UTC)

==Pliny?==
The word Pliny does not seem to appear on this page. I noted in the edit summary that [[Pliny the Younger on Christians]] needs much help. So let this be as SOS call for that page and perhaps a mention of his references to early Christian practices that deserve to show up on this page.

==First Christians were all Jews?==

That's not true. They were Judeans. --[[User:ChristianHistory|ChristianHistory]] ([[User talk:ChristianHistory|talk]]) 12:29, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

:::Huh? And just what do you think &quot;Judean&quot; basically means?  It means &quot;Jew&quot;, because &quot;Jew&quot; linguistically and historically ALSO came from the word Judah.   But the term &quot;Jew&quot; was then expanded broadly to mean Israelites in general.   All the Apostles were &quot;Jews&quot;.   &quot;Jew&quot; vs &quot;Judean&quot; is really a distinction without a difference, in this overall context. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 02:14, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

::::Wait a minute.  I acknowledge that it is an oft-stated truism that &quot;the first Christians were Jews&quot; but, in truth, it is only partly true unless you want to focus on the 12 apostles only.  After all, weren't there Samaritan followers of Jesus?  There was a Roman centurion who came to get his son healed.  And, I think there are a few other nationalities mentioned in the New Testament.  So, to be precise, we would have to say something like &quot;The first Christians were primarily Jews, although Jesus had followers from various other nations including Romans and Samaritans.&quot; or &quot;Initially, Christianity was a Jewish sect which required that its members be Jews.&quot;  (note the careful wording, you could become a Christian if and only if you were or became a Jew)  Pauline Christianity opened membership to the Gentiles but, before the Council of Jerusalem, there was much controversy over this issue. --[[User:Pseudo-Richard|Pseudo-Richard]] ([[User talk:Pseudo-Richard|talk]]) 18:34, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::Exactly, it depends on what is precisely meant.   In other words, if you say the VERY first Christians were &quot;all Jews&quot;, that is Biblically and Historically correct.   (The 12 Apostles, the 120 Disciples in the upper room, etc.)  But if you say that the ''first-century'' Christians were &quot;all Jews&quot;, that, of course, is incorrect.   It went like this:  Jews first, then Samaritans, then Gentiles. (&quot;Samaritans&quot; were considered neither &quot;Jew&quot; ''nor'' &quot;Gentile&quot;, but somewhere in between.)  Peter was given (according to some churches) THREE symbolic &quot;keys of the Kingdom&quot;, while on earth.  As leader of the Apostolic band.   The first &quot;key&quot; was to open up to fellow Israelites (Acts 2); the second key was to open up to the Samaritans (Acts 8); and the third &quot;key&quot; was to open up Kingdom opportunities and salvation to &quot;Gentiles&quot; (Acts 10).   (So it wasn't actually &quot;Pauline Christianity&quot; that first opened it up to Gentiles.  Paul helped advance it of course, but was not the first to open it up per se.  Peter was, in Acts 10, with the Italian centurion Cornelius.)  But you're right, the &quot;first Christians&quot; were NOT &quot;all Jews&quot; ''if you mean the first-century Christians in general.''  If you mean the very very first, the Apostles, and the 120 Disciples at Pentecost, etc, then yeah, the very first, in the very beginning, were all &quot;Jews&quot; or &quot;Israelites&quot;.  And then not too long later it was opened up to others of other nations. Regards. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 21:08, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

== Not all derive &quot;priest&quot; from the word &quot;presbyter&quot; ==

Esoglou is at it again.  I made a modification the other night that he rudely reverted, because he thinks (wrongly) that there &quot;is no dispute&quot; about the etymology of the word &quot;priest&quot; ''from the word &quot;presbyter&quot;''.  The point though is that there is &quot;dispute&quot; and &quot;disagreement&quot; in a very real sense.  So the modification to make it a bit more clear.  So as to NOT give the wrong impression that &quot;presbyter&quot; actually means &quot;priest&quot; when it doesn't.   Minor point since the word &quot;elder&quot; is there too. But the simple linguistic fact is that &quot;presbyter&quot; simply does ''not'' mean &quot;priest.&quot;   But rather means &quot;elder&quot;.   &quot;No dispute&quot;?  Ask any Baptist minister, and he'll tell you different.  Ask most Protestant authorities, and they'll say there's big-time dispute, in that specific regard.  Esoglous is just plain wrong here, about that.  Sorry to say. The fact is that yes there is &quot;dispute&quot;.  With translation or verbal usage.  Because, again, the fact is that &quot;presbyter&quot; does NOT mean &quot;priest&quot;, but rather means &quot;elder&quot;. The Greek word for priest in the NT is &quot;eireis&quot;, NOT &quot;presbyter&quot;.  (Check Revelation 20:6 for example.)  So there IS &quot;dispute&quot;. Stop your usual edit-warring and Roman Catholic bias, or discuss it here in Talk.  Thank you. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 20:38, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
:Please accept what the reliable sources say: the English word &quot;priest&quot; is derived from Greek πρεσβύτερος (''presbyteros'').  Πρεσβύτερος means &quot;elder&quot;, but it is the origin of the English words &quot;priest&quot; and &quot;presbyter&quot;, as ἐπίσκοπος (''episkopos'') means &quot;overseer&quot;, but is the origin of the English word &quot;bishop&quot;.  There is no Greek word &quot;Ereis&quot; or &quot;eireis&quot; meaning &quot;priest&quot;: the Greek word for &quot;priest&quot; is ἱερεύς (''hiereus''), and from this Greek word are derived English words such as &quot;hierarchy&quot;, &quot;hieratic&quot;, &quot;hieroglyph&quot;.  You have [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Early_Christianity&amp;diff=485392092&amp;oldid=485120745 deleted] a reliable source that stated that the English word &quot;priest&quot; is derived from Greek πρεσβύτερος and have replaced it with your own unsourced idea that the etymological origin of the word is disputed.  You should know by now that Wikipedia does not admit that kind of editing: please read [[WP:V]].  [[User:Esoglou|Esoglou]] ([[User talk:Esoglou|talk]]) 06:49, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
::To address a couple of things you said here.  
::One: no need to nit-pick about my little mis-spelling of the Greek word (which Greek words sometimes have variations anyway) of &quot;&quot;hiereus&quot;. I wrote &quot;Eireis&quot; quickly or maybe as an alternate.  No biggie.  
::Number two, that reference that you put LATER was ''not'' what was there originally, but only after you reverted me.  And just because a &quot;source&quot; dogmatically says something, that does not mean it ipso facto is infallibly true or law. Or is so &quot;reliable&quot; necessarily. And even what's maybe ''considered'' &quot;reliable sources&quot;, by some people, are sometimes just flat-out wrong.  There are other sources that have problems with translating or &quot;deriving&quot; the English word &quot;priest&quot; from the Greek word &quot;presbyter&quot;.  Though I'm sure you'll consider them somehow all of them &quot;unreliable&quot; (in circular reasoning fashion.)
  
::Number three (and the most important) is that, in your edit comment, you (wrongly) said &quot;it's not in dispute&quot;.  Well, the problem with that is that it's simply not true.  The notion that you should derive &quot;priest&quot; from the Greek word &quot;presbyter&quot; IS in &quot;dispute&quot;, and many authorities DO have problems with that. The point is there IS &quot;dispute&quot;.  And it's weird and dishonest to say that there isn't.  
::&quot;Presbyter&quot; may be the Greek word where the word &quot;priest&quot; comes from for SOME people and churches, but definitely not correctly for all.

::Is presbyter the Greek word where the word “priest” comes for ''all'' churches and groups?  Absolutely and clearly not.
   
::Ask yourself this:   Is presbyter where the word “priest” comes from for Baptists?    Is presbyter where the word “priest” comes from for Presbyterians?   Is presbyter where the word “priest” comes from for Seventh Day Adventists?  Is presbyter where the word “priest” comes from for Jehovah’s Witnesses?    Is presbyter where the word “priest” comes from for Pentecostals?   Is presbyter where the word &quot;priest&quot; comes from for Methodists?     The Living Church of God?    Assemblies of God?     The answer is an emphatic “no”.     They don’t derive the word “priest” from the Greek word “presbyter”, being that all that word literally and accurately means is &quot;elder&quot;.   Only the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches somehow get &quot;priest&quot; from &quot;presbyter&quot;.   And the fact is that many Protestant (maybe not all, but most Protestant) authorities don't agree with that practice and notion at all. 

::Also, does this website right [http://www.bible.ca/cath-apostolic-succession.htm here] indicate &quot;no dispute&quot;?  

::It reads: ''&quot;The Greek word &quot;presbyter&quot; does not mean &quot;priest&quot; and no reputable Greek scholar has ever rendered it as such. The word simply means &quot;an old man, an elder.&quot; He had to have &quot;believing children&quot; (Titus 1:6), and, thus, only older men were qualified.  Catholic officials in their translations of Scripture insert the word &quot;priest&quot; into verses where it does not belong.&quot;'' 

::And the point is that even if that is not considered a &quot;reliable source&quot; per se, it proves the clear point that this notion that it's correct to get &quot;priest&quot; from &quot;presbyter&quot; ''is in dispute''. By many Protestants and Protestant authorities.  That's simply an observable documented fact.

::Also, what settles the fact that my edit and modification was correct in saying &quot;some&quot; etc, is this reliable source here...

::This dictionary here does NOT say that &quot;presbyter&quot; means &quot;priest&quot; ''for everyone'' or that it is dogmatically no question.  But only for some &quot;various hierarchical&quot; type churches.   Meaning, it's not saying that that's actually the objective definition per se of the Greek word &quot;presbyter&quot; as a settled and all-encompassing linguistic fact.  But is only considered such by some churches.   It says clearly that the Presbyterian Church (for example) does NOT consider it as &quot;priest&quot;, but only as &quot;elder&quot;.

::So again, the main point is that it's simply incorrect to say that it's &quot;not in dispute&quot;, when it's common knowledge (the sky is blue) that it ''is'' in dispute by many scholars, historians, linguists, biblicists, ministers, churches, etc.  Regards.

:::Do you perhaps imagine that &quot;derived from&quot; is the same as &quot;meaning&quot;?  The article has not in fact said that the Greek word ''presbyteros'' in the New Testament ''meant'' priest, as you seem to imagine.  You have been given time to cite any source that disagrees with the sourced statement that the English word &quot;priest&quot; is derived etymologically (not, of course, entomologically, as first written by an amusing but understandable slip) from the Greek word πρεσβύτερος.  You have failed to produce any.  In Wikipedia you cannot insert personal conclusions that contradict sourced information.

::::What are you talking about?  I never removed that per se. If you notice.  I never deleted the point &quot;derived&quot; (even though that word was not actually there but rather it said &quot;where the origin of priest&quot; comes from, which is only true for SOME churches, not all)...I simply added &quot;by some&quot;.  Which is true, and a sourced fact.  It's ONLY BY SOME...''not all.''   Which is what YOU did not like.   The way it was written before is that it was &quot;priest&quot; was from the origin of&quot;presbyter&quot; PERIOD...end of discussion.  As if by everyone and is just a linguistic fact.  Which is simply not the case.  I merely added the modification that it is by some.  Which is simply a fact, cited, verified.  The Dictionary that I quoted indicates that clearly.  That &quot;priest&quot; is from &quot;presbyter&quot; BY SOME CHURCHES...not all.  So your whole thing here is a straw-man and not even what took place.  You can't claim that &quot;it's not in dispute&quot; simply because you wrongly think that no &quot;reliable source&quot; says that, or because you think all RS indicate &quot;derived&quot; as if by everyone.  Clearly it's not.  And I never removed &quot;derived&quot;, or whatever was there, but simply added &quot;by some&quot; etc...to make it clear that it's NOT by every church or group, that that &quot;etymology&quot; is believed to be.  It simply aint.   I already &quot;cited sources&quot; that show that the Presbyterians DO NOT get &quot;priest&quot; from &quot;presbyter&quot;, but only get &quot;elder&quot; from that.   Re-read what I wrote above.  And this is not &quot;personal conclusions&quot;.  What's wrong with you?   There's no guessing or opinion that Protestant authorities (you act as if this even debatable) &quot;dispute&quot; the idea that it's ok to get &quot;priest&quot; from &quot;presbyter&quot;.  Many dispute that Roman Catholic notion, and some vehemently.  There's no &quot;personal conclusion&quot; in that.  Did you even see the citations above, and points?

::::Full paragraph:

::::In the post-Apostolic church, bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations, and a hierarchy of clergy gradually took on the form of  ''[[bishops|episkopos]]'' (overseers; and the origin of the term [[bishop]]) and ''[[presbyter]]s'' ([[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]; where some hierarchical churches derive the term [[Priest#Christianity|priest]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/presbyter &quot;Presbyter&quot;] - Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged © HarperCollins Publishers 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and then ''[[deacons]]'' (ministerial servants). But this emerged slowly and at different times for different locations. Clement, a 1st century bishop of Rome, refers to the leaders of the Corinthian church in [[First Epistle of Clement|his epistle to Corinthians]] as bishops and presbyters interchangeably. The New Testament writers also use the terms overseer and elders interchangeably and as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Carrington, ''The Early Christian Church'' (2 vol. 1957) [http://www.questia.com/read/13569586?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%201) online edition vol 1]; [http://www.questia.com/read/23514152?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%202) online edition vol 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Didache]] (dated by most scholars to the early 2nd century),&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger|Metzger, Bruce]]. ''The canon of the New Testament''. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;) speaks of &quot;appointing for yourself bishops and deacons&quot; and also speaks about teachers and [[prophet]]s and [[false prophet]]s.

::::::Note the weasel words &quot;perhaps&quot; and &quot;apparently&quot;.  These two dictionaries, at least, are hedging the etymology.  I think Hashem Sfarim has a point that there is at least some uncertainty about the etymology of the word priest.  However, because our focus in this article is religion, not language, we need not resolve this problem.  It is sufficient to say that some churches (e.g. Catholic and Orthodox) point to the concept of the presbyter as the origin of the role of priest and other churches reject this linkage. --[[User:Pseudo-Richard|Pseudo-Richard]] ([[User talk:Pseudo-Richard|talk]]) 15:29, 4 April 2012 (UTC)

I have attempted to resolve this issue by rewriting the paragraph to state what I think we all agree on (i.e. that the interpretation of the roles of bishop and elder are radically different in different churches and that this difference is the a major contributor to division in Christianity).  While it is &quot;probably&quot; true that priest is derived from presbyter, I left it out of my text.  I'm not opposed to putting it back in although I would point out that the Free Dictionary Online says that &quot;priest&quot; is &quot;probably&quot; derived from &quot;presbyter&quot;.  I think it is adequate to assert that the ''role'' of presbyter evolved into the ''role'' of priest in some churches.  Focusing on etymology risk falling into the [[etymological fallacy]].  The arguments of various churches over leadership roles is not primarily etymological.  The fact that there is also an etymological link is really a side issue.  After all, I doubt the Catholic Church uses the word &quot;priest&quot; in Church Latin.  I assume the Orthodox use the word &quot;hiereus&quot; or something similar for priest.  Thus, etymology is not the primary driver of the concept of priest.  What's important is that these churches link their words and concepts to the original concept of presbyter in early Christianity.  And other churches, mostly the Protestant and Restorationist ones, reject this interpretation of the role. (Side note: For what it's worth, the Mormons have both priests and elders.  But, they are really a different kind of Christianity and some wouldn't even characterize them as Christian at all.). --[[User:Pseudo-Richard|Pseudo-Richard]] ([[User talk:Pseudo-Richard|talk]]) 14:25, 4 April 2012 (UTC)
:My request for a citation in support of the previously unsourced claim has been answered.  I agree that there is really no need whatever, and that instead it is out of place, to mention the etymology of the English words, which did not come into existence until many centuries after early Christianity.  It is quite enough to mention the appearance in early Christianity of the threefold order of [[bishop]], [[presbyter]] and [[deacon]].  But in view of the unsubstantiated personal accusations insistently made against me, I prefer not to touch the article for now.  
:Some more by-the-way remarks. There is no need to say anything either about an alleged development of presbyteral to priestly role, unless you mean (and show) that such a development occurred in the period this article is about.  Regarding &quot;Church Latin&quot;, &quot;priest&quot;, not being Latin, is of course not used, but &quot;sacerdos&quot; is.  For about a thousand years, this word was applied only to bishops, but is now applied in the first place to those of the presbyteral order, while being still applied also to bishops.  Much the same holds for the Greek word ἱερεύς.  In English too, as in present-day Church Latin, &quot;bishops and priests&quot; are understood as two distinct orders, and yet at the same time bishops are also considered to be priests.  Another curiosity: my non-recent printed copy of the American Heritage Dictionary and [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/priest the online version of it] that I cited above do not contain the West Germanic alternative derivation of &quot;priest&quot; that Pseudo-Richard found in his (presumably online?) source.  Both Richard's source and the [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/priest online source] that I cited claim to be quoting from the same 2000 edition updated in 2009.  That is curious.

::The problem here is that there is both history and ecclesiastical evolution and interpretation of that history and evolution.  We must work hard to develop an NPOV treatment of these.  What's indisputable is that there were presbyters, bishops (episkopos) and deacons (diakonos).  What's less clear is what the distinction was in early Christianity between presbyters and episkopos.  There is no categorical list of what the duties of a presbyter were (just specifications of what the requirements were to become one).  This leaves open the possibility of evolving that role into that of a Catholic or Orthodox priest or that of an elder in a Presbyterian church.  There are several ecclesiastical models that all claim to be founded on the early Christian model.  We should not represent any of these as being better or more faithful than the others.  What we should do is present what is incontrovertible and what is subject to dispute.  In presenting what is subject to dispute, we should simply state what the different positions are without taking sides.  While the etymology of &quot;priest&quot; is not very important to this article, the linkage between Catholic/Orthodox/Anglican priests and early Christian presbyters is, IMO, worth mentioning.  So, too, is the fact that Protestant churches and Restorationist churches such as the Jehovah's Witnesses do not utilize and even reject the concept of priest.  I think my edit accomplished that and, if all agree, we should let it rest there and move on to other tasks. --[[User:Pseudo-Richard|Pseudo-Richard]] ([[User talk:Pseudo-Richard|talk]]) 18:24, 5 April 2012 (UTC)
:::I am far from enthusiastic about the idea of including under &quot;early Christianity&quot; a discussion of how ''any'' of its aspects developed ''later''.  It is certain that in the second century there begins to be seen a clear tripartite distinction between [[bishop]]s, [[presbyter]]s and [[deacon]]s, while in the first it can be argued that there was at most a bipartite distinction between bishops/presbyters and deacons.  (If you want to use the New Testament Greek terms, they should surely be uniform and plural: ''episkopoi, presbyteroi, diakonoi''.)  That is amply dealt with in the article, more amply than necessary in my opinion.  There is no need to add information on later developments.  After all, the Greek and Latin words corresponding to English &quot;priest&quot; (ἱερεύς, ''sacerdos''), while sometimes used of bishops, were never applied to presbyters in early Christianity, nor were they for many centuries later.  However, since these later developments continue to be under discussion here, I have decided to refrain no longer from editing the mentions of them in the article.
:::Thank God, the article (unless I am mistaken) has dropped all mention of the etymology of the English word &quot;priest&quot;. But there remains the puzzle of what in fact the latest edition of the American Heritage Dictionary says: does it say, as in earlier editions, that the word comes ultimately from Greek πρεσβύτερος, as [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/priest the source I cited] maintains, or does it say that it comes ultimately either from that Greek word or from Latin ''praepositus'', as the unspecified source Richard referred to declares?
