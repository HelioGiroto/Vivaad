'''Ash Wednesday''', in the [[calendar]] of [[Western Christianity]], is the first day of [[Lent]] and occurs 46 days before [[Easter]]. It is a [[moveable &lt;!-- Note: Yes, it is definitely a &quot;fast&quot;, not a &quot;feast&quot;--&gt;fast]], falling on a different date each year because it is dependent on the [[Computus|date of Easter]]. It can occur as early as February 4 or as late as March 10.

According to the [[canonical gospels]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]; [[Jesus]] spent 40 days fasting in the desert before the beginning of his [[Ministry of Jesus|public ministry]], during which he [[Temptation of Christ|endured temptation]] by [[Satan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC – Lent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=2870| title = What is Lent and why does it last forty days? |publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 24 August 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071007102320/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=2870| archivedate= 7 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Anglican Catholic Church&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.anglicancatholic.org/dmas/litdescp.html| title = The Liturgical Year|publisher = The Anglican Catholic Church|accessdate = 24 August 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070824050748/http://www.anglicancatholic.org/dmas/litdescp.html| archivedate= 24 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of this 40-day liturgical period of prayer and fasting.

Ash Wednesday derives its name from the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads of adherents as a sign of mourning and [[Repentance (theology)|repentance]] to [[God of Christianity|God]]. The ashes used are typically gathered after the palms from the previous year's [[Palm Sunday]] are burned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Description&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=QQpXwIt3ihAC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=ash+wednesday&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OdV2TfXYHcyArQH4oNCHCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=ash%20wednesday&amp;f=false| title = Preaching the Calendar: Celebrating Holidays and Holy Days |publisher = [[Westminster John Knox Press]]|quote=We are wise, therefore to explain, whether in the course of the homily or in the church bulletin or newsletter, something of the meaning of the day: of ashes as an ancient symbol of loss and repentance; of the historic words spoken during the imposition of the ashes, &quot;Remember that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return&quot;; of the practice in many religious communions of using ashes made from the palms of the previous year's Palm Sunday; and, of course, that the imposition of ashes is a sign of mourning and repentance.|author=Ellsworth Kalas|accessdate = 8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice is common in much of [[Christendom]], being celebrated by [[Catholic]]s, [[Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s, and some [[Baptist]] denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denominations 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=oTtcFiGbW2kC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=lent+lutheran+catholic+methodist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4NF2Tf3LLsL_rAGmtoBf&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=lent%20lutheran%20catholic%20methodist&amp;f=false| title = Comparative Religion For Dummies|author=William P.

==Ritual==
At [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es and [[Service of worship|services of worship]] on this day, ashes are imposed on the foreheads of the faithful (or on the [[tonsure]] spots, in the case of some clergy). The [[priest]], [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], or in some cases officiating [[layperson]], marks the forehead of each participant with black ashes in the sign of the cross, which the worshipper traditionally retains until it wears off. The act echoes the ancient [[Middle East|Near Eastern]] tradition of throwing ashes over one's head to signify [[repentance]] before [[God]] (as related in the [[Bible]]). The priest or minister says one or both of the following when applying the ashes:

{{Quote|Remember that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return. |[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|3:19|HE}}}}

{{Quote|Turn away from sin and be faithful to the Gospel.|[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:15|KJV}}}}

The liturgical imposition of ashes on Ash Wednesday is a [[Sacramentals|sacramental]], not a [[sacrament]], and in the Catholic understanding of the term the ashes themselves are also a sacramental. The ashes are blessed according to various rites proper to each liturgical tradition, sometimes involving the use of Holy Water. In some churches, they are mixed with a small amount of water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lent 101 |work=Upper Room Ministries |author=Ford, Penny |url=http://www.upperroom.org/methodx/thelife/articles/lent101.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[olive oil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lent and Easter |work=The Diocese of London |date=17 March 2004 |url=http://www.london.anglican.org/NewsShow_2653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which serve as a fixative. In most liturgies for Ash Wednesday, the [[Penitential psalms]] are read; [[Psalm 51]] ([[LXX]] Psalm 50) is especially associated with this day.&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 51 is the Ash Wednesday reading in both the [[Revised Common Lectionary]] and The Catholic Lectionary.&lt;/ref&gt; The service also often includes a corporate [[Confession (religion)|confession]] rite.

In some of the [[low church]] traditions, other practices are sometimes added or substituted, as other ways of symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day. For example, in one common variation, small cards are distributed to the congregation on which people are invited to write a sin they wish to confess. These small cards are brought forth to the [[altar|altar table]] where they are burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the significance of ashes being placed on the forehead on Ash Wednesday? |work=The United Methodist Church |url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=2871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Catholic Church, ashes, being sacramentals, may be given to anyone who wishes to receive them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Catholics United for the Faith |title=Responses to frequently asked questions regarding Lenten practices |url=http://www.cuf.org/news/newsdetail.asp?newID=30#ash2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Canon law|Code of Canon Law]], canon 1170''&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to Catholic [[sacraments]], which are generally reserved for church members, except in cases of grave necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communion of Non-Catholics or Intercommunion |work=Eternal Word Television Network |author=Donovan, Colin B. |url=http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/intercommunion.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''1983 [[Canon law|Code of Canon Law]], canon 844''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in other [[Christian denominations]] ashes may be received by all who profess the Christian faith and are baptized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=First United Methodist Church |title=Pastor's Message: Ash Wednesday, An Invitation To Lent |date=28 February 2001 |url=http://www.gbgm-umc.org/fumc-wallingford/sermons/sermons01/2001_02_28.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Catholic Church, Ash Wednesday is observed by [[fasting]], [[abstinence]] from meat, and [[repentance]]—a day of contemplating one's transgressions. The [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Book of Common Prayer]] also designates Ash Wednesday as a day of fasting. In the medieval period, Ash Wednesday was the required annual day of penitential confession occurring after fasting and the remittance of the [[Tithe#Christian practice today|tithe]]. In other [[Christian denominations]] these practices are optional, with the main focus being on [[repentance]]. On Ash Wednesday and [[Good Friday]], Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59 (whose health enables them to do so) are permitted to consume only one full meal, which may be supplemented by two smaller meals, which together should not equal the full meal. Some Catholics will go beyond the minimum obligations demanded by the Church and undertake a complete fast or a bread and water fast. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also days of abstinence from meat (mammals and fowl), as are all Fridays during Lent.&lt;ref&gt;''1983 [[Canon law|Code of Canon Law]], canon 1251''&lt;/ref&gt; Some Catholics continue fasting throughout Lent,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} as was the Church's traditional requirement,&lt;ref&gt;''1917 [[Canon law|Code of Canon Law]], canon 1252 §§2–3&lt;/ref&gt; concluding only after the celebration of the [[Easter Vigil]].

As the first day of Lent, Ash Wednesday comes the day after [[Shrove Tuesday]] or [[Mardi Gras]] (Fat Tuesday), the last day of the [[Carnival]] season.

==Biblical significance==
[[File:Carl Spitzweg 003.jpg|left|thumb|150px|&quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; by [[Carl Spitzweg]]: the end of [[Carnival]].]]
Ash Wednesday is a day of repentance and it marks the beginning of Lent. Ashes were used in ancient times, according to the Bible, to express [[mourning]]. Dusting oneself with ashes was the penitent's way of expressing sorrow for sins and faults. An ancient example of one expressing one's penitence is found in [[Book of Job|Job]] {{bibleverse-nb||Job|42:3–6|HE}}. Job says to God: &quot;I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. The other eye wandereth of its own accord. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.&quot; (vv. 5–6, [[KJV]]) The prophet Jeremiah, for example, calls for repentance this way: &quot;O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth, roll in the ashes&quot; (Jer 6:26). The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God this way: &quot;I turned to the Lord God, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes&quot; (Daniel 9:3). Just prior to the New Testament period, the rebels fighting for Jewish independence, the [[Maccabees]], prepared for battle using ashes: &quot;That day they fasted and wore sackcloth; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes&quot; (1 Maccabees 3:47; see also 4:39).

Other examples are found in several other [[books of the Bible]] including, [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|19:9|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|19:17|HE}}, [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Jonah|3:6|HE}}, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|11:21|KJV}}, and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|10:13|KJV}}, and [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|9:13|KJV}}. Ezekiel 9 also speaks of a linen-clad messenger marking the forehead of the city inhabitants that have sorrow over the sins of the people. All those without the mark are destroyed.

It marks the start of a 43-day period which is an allusion to the separation of Jesus in the desert to [[fasting|fast]] and [[prayer|pray]]. During this time he was [[Temptation of Christ|tempted]]. {{bibleref|Matthew|4:1–11}}, {{bibleref|Mark|1:12–13}}, and {{bibleref|Luke|4:1–13}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?art=5554&amp;l=en | publisher=Asia News.it | date= 3 May 2006 | title=Lent with Jesus in the desert to fight the spirit of evil| quote=Turning to the gospel of the day, which is about Jesus' 40 days in the desert, &quot;where he overcame the temptations of Satan&quot; (cfr Mk 1:12–13), [[Pope Benedict XVI]] exhorted Christians to follow &quot;their Teacher and Lord to face together with Him 'the struggle against the spirit of evil'.&quot; He said: &quot;The desert is rather an eloquent metaphor of the human condition.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically instituted in the Bible text, the 40-day period of repentance is also analogous to the 40 days during which [[Moses]] repented and fasted in response to the making of the [[Golden calf]]. (Jews today follow a 40-day period of repenting during the [[High Holy Days]] from [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Elul]] to [[Yom Kippur]].)

In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, theatres refrained from presenting costumed shows on Ash Wednesday, so they provided other entertainments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Dates==
Ash Wednesday is a [[moveable fast]], occurring 46 days before Easter. It fell on February 17 in 2010, March 9 in 2011 and February 22 in 2012. In future years Ash Wednesday will occur on these dates:
{{MultiCol}}
* 2013 – February 13
* 2014 – March 5
* 2015 – February 18
* 2016 – February 10
* 2017 – March 1
* 2018 – February 14
{{ColBreak}}
* 2019 – March 6
* 2020 – February 26
* 2021 – February 17
* 2022 – March 2
* 2023 – February 22
{{EndMultiCol}}

The earliest date Ash Wednesday can occur is February 4 (in a [[common year]] with Easter on March 22), which happened in 1573, 1668, 1761 and 1818 and will next occur in 2285. The latest date is March 10 (when Easter Day falls on April 25) which occurred in 1546, 1641, 1736, 1886 and 1943 and will next occur in 2038. Ash Wednesday has never occurred on Leap Year Day (February 29), and it will not occur as such until 2096. The only other years of the third millennium that will have Ash Wednesday on February 29 are 2468, 2688, 2840 and 2992. (Ash Wednesday falls on February 29 only if Easter is on April 15 in a [[leap year]].)

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] does not, in general, observe Ash Wednesday; instead, Orthodox [[Great Lent]] begins on [[Clean Monday]]. There are, however, a relatively small number of Orthodox Christians who follow the [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite]]; these do observe Ash Wednesday, although often on a different day from the previously mentioned denominations, as its date is determined from the Orthodox calculation of [[Easter|Pascha]], which may be as much as a month later than the Western observance of Easter.

==National No Smoking Day==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], Ash Wednesday is National No Smoking Day.&lt;ref&gt;
