[[File:A woman makes a cursing ritual ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A woman makes a cursing ritual ceremony, by [[Hokusai]]]]

A '''curse''' (also called a '''jinx''', or '''execration''') is any expressed [[wish]] that some form of [[adversity]] or misfortune will befall or attach to some other [[entity]]—one or more persons, a place, or an object. In particular, &quot;curse&quot; may refer to a wish that harm or hurt will be inflicted by any [[supernatural]] powers, such as a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], a [[prayer]], an imprecation, an execration, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[witchcraft]],  [[God]], a [[Natural phenomenon|natural force]], or a [[spirit]]. In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying [[ritual]]) is considered to have some causative force in the result.

==Overview==
The word &quot;curse&quot; may also refer to the resulting adversity; for example, [[menstruation]]  has been described as the &quot;curse of [[Eve]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Sexual Terms [http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/curse%20of%20Eve,%20the Curse of Eve, the]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study of the forms of curses comprise a significant proportion of the study of both [[folk religion]] and [[folklore]]. The deliberate attempt to levy curses is often part of the practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. In [[Hindu]] [[culture]] the Sage or [[Rishi]] is believed to have the power to [[blessing|bless]] and curse. Examples include the curse placed by Rishi Bhrigu on king Nahusha&lt;ref name=&quot;author&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=author|title=The Mahabharata, Book 13 of 18: Anusasana Parva|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4YdaEN-kM5wC&amp;pg=PA408|accessdate=4 September 2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1-60506-623-3|page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the one placed by Rishi Devala.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buddhaghosha1870&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Buddhaghosha|title=Buddhaghosha's Parables: translated from Burmese by Captain T. Rogers: With an Introduction, containing Buddha's Dhammapada, or &quot;Path of Virtue&quot;, translated from Pâli by F. Max Müller|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xeJRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=4 September 2012|year=1870|publisher=Trübner|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Special names for specific types of curses can be found in various cultures:
* [[African American]] [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] presents us with the [[jinx]] and crossed conditions, as well as a form of foot track magic which was used by Ramandeep, whereby cursed objects are laid in the paths of victims and activated when walked over.
* Middle Eastern and Mediterranean culture is the source of the belief in the [[evil eye]], which may be the result of envy but, more rarely, is said to be the result of a deliberate curse. In order to be protected from the evil eye, a protection item is made from dark blue circular glass, with a circle of white around the black dot in the middle, which is reminiscent of a human eye. The size of the protective eye item may vary.
* German people, including the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] speak in terms of [[pow-wow (folk magic)|hexing]] (from the German word for witchcraft), and a common hex in days past was that laid by a stable-witch who caused milk cows to go dry and horses to go lame.--[[User:Monalove123|Monalove123]] ([[User talk:Monalove123|talk]]) 16:45, 21 September 2012 (UTC)

==Curse to the United States presidency==
[[Tecumseh's curse]] was reputed to cause the deaths in office of [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]] elected in years divisible by 20, beginning in 1840. This alleged curse appears to have fallen dormant, since [[Ronald Reagan]], (elected in 1980) survived an assassination attempt and [[George W. Bush]] (elected in 2000) survived his eight-year presidency.

==Sports-related curses==
{{Main|Sports-related curses}}
A number of curses are used to explain the failures or misfortunes of specific sports teams, players, or even cities. For example:
* No first-time winner of the [[World Snooker Championship]] has successfully defended his title since the event was first held at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]] in [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]]. This has been widely attributed to a '''&quot;[[Crucible Curse]]&quot;'''.
* The '''[[Curse of the Goat]]''' is used to explain the failures of the [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball team, who have not won a World Series championship since 1908, and a National League pennant since 1945.
* There was a famous curse called the '''[[Curse of the Bambino]]''' on the [[Boston Red Sox]] Major League Baseball team. After the Red Sox sold [[Babe Ruth]], who had won 3 of the 5 Red Sox World Series titles at the time, to the [[New York Yankees]] where he won his final 4 titles, it took the Red Sox 86 years to win another World Series (1918-2004). In 2004 the Red Sox made history in the [[American League Championship Series]] (ALCS) coming back from 0 games to 3, winning 4 games in a row against their arch rivals the New York Yankees blowing out game 7 in the Bronx 10 to 3, this is cited as one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. The Red Sox secured the AL Pennant and then went on to sweep the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]], 4 games to 0 ending the curse once and for all. Three years later they would win sweep again in the [[2007 World Series]] against the [[Colorado Rockies]].
* The '''&quot;Krukow Kurse&quot;''' was used to explain the [[San Francisco Giants]]' failure to ever win the [[World Series]] until 2010. It is attributed to [[Mike Krukow]] (a former [[pitcher]] for the Giants and a current [[presenter|broadcaster]] for the team) based upon his yearly [[pre-season]] predictions that the Giants &quot;have a chance&quot; to win the [[World Series]]. Once Krukow stops making such predictions—says the [[legend]]—the Giants will, in fact, win the [[World Series]]. However, the Giants went on to win the World Series in 2010. Ironically, it was during the same year that Krukow's partner, Giant's broadcaster, Duane Kuiper stated &quot;Giant's  Baseball, it's Torture&quot; due to the large amount of close games that they played.  This phrase was adopted by fans and became a rallying cry throughout the second half of the season and the playoff run.
* Marketing experts have highlighted '''&quot;the curse of [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]]&quot;''', given the mishaps that happen to sports stars associated with the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/international/article/2009/nov/29/shaven-but-stirred-the-gillette-curse/|title=Shaven but stirred: the Gillette curse|last=Mesure|first=Susie|date=November 29, 2009|work=Tribune News|publisher=Tribune.ie|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/henry-woods-federer-the-curse-of-gillette-1830663.html|title=Henry, Woods, Federer: The curse of Gillette|last=Mesure|first=Susie|date=29 November 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cursed objects==
Cursed objects are generally supposed to have been stolen from their rightful owners or looted from a sanctuary. The [[Hope Diamond]] is supposed to bear such a curse, and bring misfortune to its owner. The stories behind why these items are cursed vary, but they usually are said to bring bad luck or to manifest unusual phenomena related to their presence. [[Busby's stoop chair]] was reportedly cursed by the murderer Thomas Busby shortly before his execution so that everyone who would sit in it would die.

==Egyptian curses and mummies==
[[File:Donation stele with curse inscription.jpg|right|225px|thumb|[[Limestone]] donation-[[stele]] from [[Mendes]], [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|3rd Intermediate Period]], [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XXII]]. The inscription celebrates a donation of land to an Egyptian temple, and places a curse on anyone who would misuse or appropriate the land.]]
There is a broad popular belief in curses being associated with the violation of the tombs of [[mummy|mummified]] corpses, or of the mummies themselves. The idea became so widespread as to become a pop-culture mainstay, especially in [[horror film]]s (though originally the curse was invisible, a series of mysterious deaths, rather than the walking-dead mummies of later fiction). The &quot;[[Curse of the Pharaohs]]&quot; is supposed to have haunted the [[archeologist]]s who excavated the tomb of [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]], whereby an imprecation was supposedly pronounced from the grave by the [[ancient Egypt]]ian priests, on anyone who violated its precincts. Similar dubious suspicions have surrounded the excavation and examination of the (natural, not embalmed) [[Ötztal Alps|Alpine]] mummy, &quot;[[Ötzi the Iceman]]&quot;. While such curses are generally considered to have been popularized and sensationalized by British journalists of the 19th century, ancient Egyptians were in fact known to place curse inscriptions on markers protecting temple or tomb goods or property.

==Curses in politics==

===In Israel===
In modern [[Israel]], the [[Pulsa diNura]] (a controversial [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] prayer taken to request God to block any further forgiveness of sin for an individual, causing death or some long-term misfortune to shut the individual out from functioning in society) has allegedly been used against politicians by religious conservative opponents: one was claimed to have been used against [[Yitzhak Rabin]] one month prior to his 1995 assassination, and another was reportedly performed against [[Ariel Sharon]] six months prior to a catastrophic 2006 stroke that placed him into a [[persistent vegetative state]].

===In the United States===
In the United States, California Baptist pastor [[Wiley Drake]] achieved notoriety for boasting that he had prayed for the death of current president [[Barack Obama]]; he had previously used such prayers against employees of the [[Internal Revenue Service]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Roth, Theologian's Mission: Interpret Violence in the Bible, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, March 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], and [[George Tiller]]; while serving as a party for the plaintiff in a [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories#Barnett v. Obama|2009 case regarding Obama's citizenship]], he later retracted his prayer, and called for other Christians to abstain from similar action &quot;until [Barack Obama] can be tried for treason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4588&amp;Itemid=53 ''Wiley Drake lifts call for 'imprecatory prayer' against President Obama''], [[Associated Baptist Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar prayers requesting a divinely sanctioned death for Obama were publicly pronounced by [[Tempe, Arizona]] pastor [[Steven L. Anderson]] and [[Laporte, Colorado]] Church of Christ pastor [[Pete Peters]].

==Biblical curses==
According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article on ''Cursing'', 
the Bible depicts [[God in Christianity|God]] cursing the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]], the earth and [[Cain]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|3:14|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|3:17|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|4:11|NIV}}). Similarly [[Noah]] curses [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|9:25|NIV}}), and [[Joshua]] curses the man who should build the city of [[Jericho]] ({{bibleref|Joshua|6:26-27|NIV}}). In various books of the [[Old Testament]] there are long lists of curses against transgressors of [[Mosaic Law|the Law]] ({{bibleref|Leviticus|26:14-25|NIV}}, {{bibleref|Deuteronomy|27:15|NIV}}, etc.). So, too, in the [[New Testament]], Christ [[Cursing the fig tree|curses the barren fig-tree]] ({{bibleref|Mark|11:14|NIV}}), pronounces his denunciation of woe against the [[Rejection of Jesus#Chorazin.2C Bethsaida and Capernaum|incredulous cities]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|11:21|NIV}}), against [[Jesus and the rich young man|the rich]], the worldling, [[Woes of the Pharisees|the scribes and the Pharisees]], and [[The Sheep and the Goats|foretells the awful malediction that is to come upon the damned]] ({{bibleref|Matthew|25:41|NIV}}). The word curse is also applied to the victim of [[expiation]] for [[sin]] ({{bibleref|Galatians|3:13|NIV}}), to sins [[Venial sin|temporal]] and [[Eternal sin|eternal]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|2:17|NIV}}; {{bibleref|Matthew|25:41|NIV}}).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy| wstitle = Cursing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
