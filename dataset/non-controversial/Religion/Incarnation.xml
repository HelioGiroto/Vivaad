'''Incarnation''' literally means ''embodied in flesh'' or ''taking on flesh''. It refers to the [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and birth of a [[Sentience|sentient]] creature (generally a human) who is the material manifestation of an [[entity]], [[god]] or force whose original nature is immaterial. In its religious context the word is used to mean the descent from [[Heaven]] of a god, or divine being in human/animal form on Earth.

==Ancient Egypt==
The [[Pharaoh]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]] were sometimes said to be incarnations of the gods [[Horus]] and [[Ra]].

==Bahá'í==
{{further2|[[God in the Bahá'í Faith]]}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], God is described as a single, imperishable God, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. The connection between God and the world is that of the creator to his [[Genesis creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SmithGod&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= God |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |page= 116 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God is understood to be independent of his creation, and that creation is dependent and contingent on God.  God, however, is not seen to be incarnated into this world and is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures. Instead, in the [[Bahá'í teachings|Bahá'í understanding]], the world of creation [[wiktionary:emanate|emanates]] from God, in that all things have been realized by him and have attained to existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;saq&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1981 |title = Some Answered Questions |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-190-6 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-53.html.iso8859-1#gr5 | pages = 202–203 |origyear = 1904-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í concept of the intermediary between [[God]] and [[human]]ity is expressed in the term [[Manifestation of God]], which are a series of personages, such as [[Jesus]] and [[Bahá'u'lláh]], who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish [[religion]] in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot;/&gt; The Manifestations of God are also not seen as an incarnation of God, but are instead understood to be like a perfect mirror reflecting the attributes of God onto this material world.&lt;ref name=&quot;manifestation&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hatcher118&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author = Hatcher, W.S. |coauthors = &amp; Martin, J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = San Francisco |isbn = 0-87743-264-3 | page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
[[File:Ashoka Chakra.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of the Ashoka Chakra, as depicted on the [[Flag of India|National flag of the Republic of India]].]]
{{see also|Rebirth (Buddhism)}}

In the teaching of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] sentient beings incarnate due to the psychological factors of [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]], [[Taṇhā|craving]] and [[Upādāna|clinging]] which results in the phenomenon of [[bhava|becoming]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. To be born human is considered a great privilege because unlike other mammals even a person of average intelligence with sufficient effort and proper guidance can walk the path of [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]] and become [[moksha|liberated]] from the [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]]. The motive force in the process of material incarnation and becoming (popularly known as 'life') is attachment to and identification with matter. This ignorance gives rise to the volitional factors which are called [[Saṅkhāra|sankharas]]. These sankharas through the infinite possibilities of worldly desires propel the human being through the pattern of repeated birth and death until the dawning of [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (awakening) brings about the desire for liberation.

According to Buddha's teaching the soul (as that structure of sankharas that gives rise to incarnation and animates the body during 'life') is not a fixed entity but in a state of constant flux - being modified over time by actions of body, speech and mind. The constant transmutation and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|interdependence of phenomena]] mean that nothing can be said in terms of [[Two truths doctrine|ultimate truth]] to have a fixed identity. This is the doctrine of ''[[anatta]]'', the no-self doctrine applying to all phenomena (''see'' ''[[Three marks of existence]]'').

Liberation in Buddhism is achieved when the stock of accumulated sankharas buried in [[Unconscious mind|the unconscious]] have been dissolved through the practise of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], a path leading to the experience called [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] (''[[Bodhi]]'' in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]]). At enlightenment all the causes for future rebirth have been deleted and the sage abides in a state of being called ''deathlessness'' ([[Nirvana|Amaravati]] or Amrta). Such a one - called an [[Arahant (Buddhism)|arahant]] or [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] is no longer destined for reincarnation after death.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], an enlightened spiritual teacher ([[lama]]) may choose to reincarnate after death in order to continue to help people. Such a teacher is called a ''[[tulku]]''.

==Christianity==

{{main|Incarnation (Christianity)|}}

The Incarnation of [[Christ]] is a central Christian doctrine that God became flesh, assumed a human nature, and became a man in the form of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the second person of the Trinity. This foundational Christian position holds that the divine nature of the Son of God was perfectly united with human nature in one divine Person, [[Jesus]], making him both truly God and truly man. The theological term for this is [[hypostatic union]]: the Second Person of the [[Holy Trinity]], God the Son, became flesh when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of [[the Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Incarnation.&quot; ''Encyclopædia Britannica.'' 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 17 Nov. 2010 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/284611/Incarnation&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical passages traditionally referenced in connection with the doctrine of the Incarnation include {{Bibleref2|John|1:14}}, Colossians 2:9, and {{Bibleref2|Philippians|2:7-8}}.

==Hinduism==
[[File:Varaha avtar, killing a demon to protect Bhu, c1740.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Varaha]], the boar avatar of Vishnu]]
{{main|Avatar}}

In Hinduism, incarnation generally refers to an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], the preserver in the [[Trimurti]].  Collectively, the 10 avatars of Vishnu are known as the [[dashavatara]].  [[Ganesha]] and [[Shiva]] also have avatars.

==Islam==

===Mainstream Islam===
Mainstream [[Islam]] completely rejects the doctrine of the incarnation of God in any form, as the concept is defined as [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]. In mainstream Islam God is one and &quot;neither begets nor is begotten&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, (112:1-4).&lt;/ref&gt; Islam specifically rejects the Christian idea of Jesus as a divine incarnation, but rather Jesus is seen as a prophet (''[[nabi|nabī]]'') and messenger (''[[rasul|rasūl]]'') of God. The Qur'anic text itself seems to fully reject this concept according to mainstream interpretations. [[Sunnism]] is the most prominent sect to hold this belief.

===Shia===
Although most Shiites do not hold the view that Muhammad's son-in-law [[Imam Ali]] was God incarnate,  a variety of heterodox Shiite sects collectively called [[Ghulat]] (for &quot;exagerated&quot;) - such as the [[Alevi]], [[Alawi]], [[Ahl-e Haqq]], and more arguably the [[Bektashi]] - believe that [[Imam Ali]] was God. 
This view is vigorously rejected by both Sunnis and non-Ghulati Shiites.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} The major conflict source between Sunnis and Shias is the Shias' believing Imam Ali to be the real caliph after Muhammad and accepting [[Twelve Imans|12 &quot;imans&quot;]] as heirs of his &quot;''[[Wilayah|welayah]]''&quot; (rule). However, the [[Wahabi]] Muslims defend that some tales about shias incarnation create division between Shias and sunnis (both of whom they call brothers in the Quran). They also accuse the Shias of worshiping metals and woods (in fact the Shias only use them as &quot;''[[Tabarok|tabarrok]]''&quot; (&quot;blesseds&quot;/&quot;blessed things&quot;), just like &quot;[[Fatima Zahra|Hazrate Zahra]]&quot; had used &quot;tabarrok&quot; first. In Shia philosophy, tabarrok is for showing your love to &quot;''[[ahle beit]]''&quot; (&quot;household&quot;, the community of the devotees of Ali and Fatima) and requesting &quot;''[[shafa'at]]''&quot; (healing) from them because they believe that ''ahle beyt'' where the best God created and they use this method to have a better connection to Allah or to request &quot;''[[maghferat]]''&quot; (forgiveness) from God when they want to atone for sins and believe its an easier approach.

====Ismailism====
The [[Aga Khan]] is the [[Imam]] (spiritual leader) of the [[Ismaili]]s who believe that he possesses the Light Of God (''Noor'') within him and is therefore God's designated repository of His Word, the [[Quran]]. As such only he fully '''knows''' the Quran in its complete '''context''' in which it was revealed to Prophet Mohammad over a span of 22 long and hard years. The Ismailis contend that to read the Quran without knowing the context (circumstance) under which each and every Ayat (verse) was delivered to Prophet Mohammed, is simply to be lead astray.

There is a Hadith of the Prophet stating, &quot;Ali and I are from the same ''Noor''&quot;. The Aga Khan being the direct descendant of Prophet Mohammad through Imam Ali and Fatima-taz-Zahara (the daughter of Prophet Mohammad and wife of Imam Ali), the Noor has been passed down through them to him.

The Noor is an aspect of the Ismaili belief in the concept of '''God's incarnation''' as a human being living ''incognito'' among human beings on this earth. See [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)]] for a complete and referenced article on Ismaili beliefs.

====Nation of Islam====
The founder of the US-based [[black nationalist]] [[Nation of Islam]], [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], is believed by followers to be an incarnation of God, also considered to be the [[Messiah]] of Christianity and [[Mahdi]] of Islam.

==Judaism==
{{main|God in Judaism|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies}}

Mainstream [[Judaism]] totally rejects any doctrine of an incarnation of God and absolutely rejects any concept of an incarnation of God in any form.&lt;ref&gt;L. Jacobs 1973 ''A Jewish Theology'' p. 24.  N.Y.: Berman House&lt;/ref&gt;  Jews especially rejected vehemently - even under penalty of death or threats of torture - the Christian idea of Jesus as a divine incarnation of God, and neither see Jesus as a [[Prophet]] nor [[Messiah]].

However, some [[Hasidism|Hasidim]] believe in a somewhat similar concept. Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], a prominent [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] leader, said that the [[Rebbe]] is God's essence itself put into a body of a [[Tzaddik]].&lt;ref&gt;''Likkutei Sichos'', Vol. 2, pp. 510-511.&lt;/ref&gt; While many other Jews find this idea highly controversial, [[panentheism]], i.e. considering everything and everyone as manifestations of God, is the accepted mainstream Hasidic and Kabbalistic doctrine.

The [[Kabbalah]] has an idea of ''[[gilgul]]'' (reincarnation) as part of the soul's journey to achieve perfection.

==Rastafari==
The [[Rastafari movement]] views [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie I]] as God incarnate, who has come the second time as a [[messiah|deliverer]].

==Serer religion==
[[Serer religion]] rejects any notion of an incarnation or manifestation of ''[[Roog (Serer deity)|Roog]]'' (the supreme deity in [[Serer religion]]), called [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]. However, the [[reincarnation]] (''ciiɗ'')&lt;ref name=faye&gt;Faye, Louis Diène, ''Mort et Naissance Le Monde Sereer'', Les Nouvelles Edition Africaines (1983), pp 9-10, ISBN 2-7236-0868-9&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[reincarnation#Serer religion|ancient Serer saints and ancestral spirits]], called ''[[Pangool]]'', is a well held principle in Serer religion. These Pangool (singular : ''Fangool'') act as intermediaries between the living world and the Devine. When the Serers speak of incarnation, it is these Pangool they refer to, who are themselves holy by virtue of their intercession with the Divine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Religio&quot;&gt;{{fr}} [[Issa Laye Thiaw|Thaiw, Issa Laye]], « La religiosité des Seereer, avant et pendant leur islamisation », in ''Éthiopiques, no. 54, volume 7, 2e semestre 1991 [http://ethiopiques.refer.sn/spip.php?article1248]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation sereer, Cosaan:  les origines'', vol.1, Nouvelles Editions africaines (1983), p 33, ISBN 2-7236-0877-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faye/&gt;
