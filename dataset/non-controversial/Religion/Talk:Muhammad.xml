== Muhammad's Noble Character ==

I think there should be a section on our holy prophet's noble and sublime character. An example can be : The most unique aspect of Prophet Muhammad’s life is his noble character. Almighty Allah himself testifies to this in the holy Quran: And thou (standest) on an exalted standard of character --Sura 68 (Al - Qalam), ayah 4.

Both Muslim and non-Muslim biography writers have discussed his noble character in their books in detail. They portray him as being generous, just, strong-minded, God-fearing, conscious, patient, caring to others, a loving father, a loving husband, and many other qualities.[[User:Imtiazuddin|Imtiazuddin]] ([[User talk:Imtiazuddin|talk]]) 17:07, 19 October 2012 (UTC)

:Please point out a religion that doesn't claim that its founder did not have a sublime character. If a section was created about his apparently &quot;noble character&quot;, there would have to be a section claiming that he wasn't noble. Just to keep the article in a Neutral Point of view. 
:People must understand that wikipedia is a encyclopedia, not a 21st century way of worshipping. [[User:Brough87|Brough87]] ([[User talk:Brough87|talk]]) 17:51, 19 October 2012 (UTC)

:(ec) You do understand that this is an encyclopedia, right?
:What Allah may be alleged to have said has no bearing on historical fact. That's a religious viewpoint, not a viewpoint from an independent reliable source.
:If you have any examples of independent biographers who can make such claims on an historical basis rather than person opinion or belief, then by all means present those sources. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:55, 19 October 2012 (UTC)

:&quot;Conscious&quot;? [[User:Rivertorch|Rivertorch]] ([[User talk:Rivertorch|talk]]) 18:43, 19 October 2012 (UTC)
::Seems like it'd have been hard for him ''not'' to be.  I'd guess he meant conscientious but didn't carefully check what he was typing as he copied something.  [[User:The Blade of the Northern Lights|The Blade of the Northern Lights]]  ([[User talk:The Blade of the Northern Lights|&lt;font face=&quot;MS Mincho&quot; color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;話して下さい&lt;/font&gt;]]) 20:13, 20 October 2012 (UTC)
:::Presumably so. I have to admit I found it a bit droll, consciousness being something of a prerequisite for those other qualities. [[User:Rivertorch|Rivertorch]] ([[User talk:Rivertorch|talk]]) 06:57, 21 October 2012 (UTC)
::::We cannot state that Muhammad had a &quot;noble character&quot; - that is an opinion and inclusion of such statement would be against rules regarding a neutral point of view. What can be included however is a statement that someone said that he had a &quot;noble character&quot;, or that certain sources portrayed him as such. [[User:BeŻet|BeŻet]] ([[User talk:BeŻet|talk]]) 12:30, 29 October 2012 (UTC)

::::Can we add that section? I think it would be very relevant since Muhammad preached a religion and the main business of religion is moral behavior and character. Its the subject of an extensive body of work both in the Muslim and non Muslim world.&lt;i style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;&quot;&gt;[[User: ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#1000&quot;&gt; Iβn Mᾱsῡɖ &lt;/b&gt;]][[User talk:ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#902&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;τᾱℓк&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/i&gt; 09:04, 9 November 2012 (UTC)

== Aftermath ==

Regarding the section title &quot;Aftermath&quot; in the article;

Definition of AFTERMATH

:-the period immediately following a usually ruinous event &lt;in the aftermath of the war&gt; [Merriam Webster]
:-A consequence, especially of a disaster or misfortune: famine as an aftermath of drought. [free online dictionary]
:-A period of time following a disastrous event: in the aftermath of war.[free online dictionary]

This is a non neutral term and against wiki policy as it sums up the life of Muhammad as a &quot;ruinus event&quot; or &quot;misfortune&quot;, I think it should be changed to something like &quot;post Muhammad&quot;.

I would also like to change the term Rashidun Empire [in the same paragraph] to Rashidun Caliphate the same title used in the link, it was an elected leadership not a hereditary one, similar to how the U.S is a nation with a Government not an Empire.
&lt;i style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;&quot;&gt;[[User: ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#1000&quot;&gt; Iβn Mᾱsῡɖ &lt;/b&gt;]][[User talk:ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#902&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;τᾱℓк&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/i&gt; 03:06, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

:I have no objection to changing &quot;Aftermath&quot; to something else; perhaps &quot;Legacy&quot; because &quot;Post Muhammad&quot; just sounds awkward.
:Also I agree [[Rashidun empire]] should be changed to [[Rashidun Caliphate]] because that's the actual title of the article ([[Rashidun empire]] is a redirect).
:I'll do both now. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:23, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

::Legacy is used in another section what about &quot;Heritage&quot;&lt;i style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;&quot;&gt;[[User: ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#1000&quot;&gt; Iβn Mᾱsῡɖ &lt;/b&gt;]][[User talk:ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#902&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;τᾱℓк&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/i&gt; 05:02, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

:::Ah, you are correct. Hmmm. The word &quot;heritage&quot; has overtones of family traditions, but the section is really about aftereffects of Muhammad's life, events that came to pass because of his existence, like the ripples left in a pond after a stone falls through the surface. That is what was originally intended by the term &quot;aftermath&quot;. I changed it to &quot;Post Muhammad&quot; as you originally suggested although somewhere in a corner of my mind I am sure there's a better term to describe the events that transpired after Muhammad's death. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 05:33, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

== Other corrections ==

In the criticisms section it reads &quot;when he was attacked by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism, his marriages, and military expeditions.&quot; His non muslim arab contemporaries didn't criticize him for his marriages it was a cultural norm, the point should be removed, it only redirects to a page on his marriage.

This line is also inaccurate and doesn't quote anyone; &quot;In modern times, his sincerity in claiming to be a prophet has been questioned, and the laws he established, such as those concerning slavery have been criticised.&quot; he didn't establish the slave trade it predates islam itself to the time of moses and before, he established laws giving slaves basic human rights who criticized him for that?&lt;i style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;&quot;&gt;[[User: ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#1000&quot;&gt; Iβn Mᾱsῡɖ &lt;/b&gt;]][[User talk:ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#902&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;τᾱℓк&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/i&gt; 05:30, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

:That section is intended to summarize the main article about criticism of Muhammad, and it seems that some ambiguity resulted in the attempt to summarize. He ''was'' criticized for all those things, but I think the sentence meant to say that his contemporaries criticized him for preaching monotheism, and later critics focused on marriages and military expeditions. The phrase &quot;by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries&quot; could probably be removed to eliminate the ambiguity.

:Also the section doesn't say he established a slave trade. It says he established laws regarding slavery, which is true. Laws he established ''have'' been criticized, even if slavery is a bad example to single out. This sentence could be corrected simply by removing the phrase &quot;such as those concerning slavery&quot;. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 05:48, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

::I agree with what you said, regarding slavery i haven't seen anyone criticize the laws specifically as they are only laws giving slaves human rights what has been criticized is that he didn't abolish slavery an entirely different issue, its like that quote was saying they appose the rights of slaves be treated fairly. If you want to change the sentences go ahead.&lt;i style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;&quot;&gt;[[User: ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#1000&quot;&gt; Iβn Mᾱsῡɖ &lt;/b&gt;]][[User talk:ibn.masud |&lt;b style=&quot;color:#902&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;τᾱℓк&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]]&lt;/i&gt; 06:00, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

{{edit semi-protected|answered=yes}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;

1. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_of_the_moon

2. The image on the right side is not real.

3. It hurts the religious sentiments of the people in society and creates disturbances to churches, temples all over the world specially if anyone sees it.

4. Any one does not have the caricatures or cartoons of Muhammed so its absurd to use that image on the above page.

5. Requesting you to remove the image from the above page.

6. Thanks in advance

== The restorer of an uncorrupted original monotheistic faith ==

The article describes Mo as &quot;...the restorer of an uncorrupted original monotheistic faith...&quot;

If the faith was uncorrupted, why did it need restoring?

[And, on a side note, I've never seen some many people tiptoe so carefully around issues that would be considered innocuous on, say, the Buddha or Moses pages. You think you're all being politically correct, but it's really stomach-turning behaviour.]  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/58.122.237.201|58.122.237.201]] ([[User talk:58.122.237.201|talk]]) 01:14, 8 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:The article does not describe Muhammad as the &quot;restorer of an uncorrupted original montheistic faith&quot;.  What the article actually says is: &quot;Non-Muslims regard Muhammad as the founder of Islam. Muslims consider him to be the restorer of an uncorrupted original monotheistic faith of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and other prophets.&quot;  That it, it says that Muslims do not consider him to be the founder of Islam, as Muslims believe their religion existed before Muhammad.  Non-Muslims consider Muhmmad to be the founder of Islam.  I can't see anything controversial about either statement.{{unsigned|Singularity42}}
::Right.  To state ''what Muslims believe'' as ''their beliefs'' is not being politically correct, it's being accurate.  Further, the sentence (unless misinterpreted) means that they believe he restored the faith to its original uncorrupted state.
