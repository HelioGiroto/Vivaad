      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19852">Many [[religions|religious traditions]] have taken a stance on [[abortion]], and these stances span a broad spectrum as highlighted below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/religion/religion.shtml BBC &quot;Religion and Ethics&quot;] Be aware that these BBC pages do not cover all Protestant, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist beliefs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html Patheos Public Square Topic] Including Buddhist, Muslim, Mormon, and Pagan perspectives in addition to Catholic, Evangelical, Protestant, and Jewish perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{main|Buddhism and abortion}}
There is no single [[Buddhist]] view concerning abortion.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Abortion: Buddhism].&quot; ''BBC Religion &amp; Ethics.'' Retrieved January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional sources, such as the Buddhist monastic code, hold that life begins at conception and that abortion, which would then involve the deliberate destruction of life, should be rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvey&quot;&gt;Harvey, Peter.  Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (2000). Cambridge University Press. pg. 311–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Buddhists also subscribe to this view.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=PewForum&gt;The Pew Forum. September 30, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 ''Religious Groups’ Official Positions on Abortion''], Retrieved on April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating the issue is the Buddhist belief that &quot;life is a continuum with no discernible starting point&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html Buddhism and Abortion on Patheos]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is &quot;negative,&quot; but there are exceptions. He said, &quot;I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |work=New York Times |date= 28 November 1993 |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |title= New York Times Interview with the Dalai Lama |accessdate= 31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inducing or otherwise causing an abortion is regarded as a serious matter in the monastic rules followed by both [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] monks; monks can be expelled for assisting a woman in procuring an abortion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvey&quot;/&gt;  Traditional sources do not recognize a distinction between early- and late-term abortion, but in Sri Lanka and Thailand the &quot;moral stigma&quot; associated with an abortion grows with the development of the fetus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvey&quot;/&gt;  While traditional sources do not seem to be aware of the possibility of abortion as relevant to the health of the mother, modern Buddhist teachers from many traditions&amp;nbsp;– and abortion laws in many Buddhist countries&amp;nbsp;– recognize a threat to the life or physical health of the mother as an acceptable justification for abortion as a practical matter, though it may still be seen as a deed with negative moral or karmic consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvey&quot;/&gt;

== Christianity ==
{{main|Christianity and abortion}}
Christianity and abortion has a long and complex history though there is no mention of abortion in the [[Christian Bible]], and there is scholarly disagreement on how early Christians felt about abortion. Some scholars have concluded that early Christians took a nuanced stance on what is now called abortion, and that at different and in separate places early Christians have taken different stances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=VBN6r3cC6v0C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=early+christianity+and+abortion&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Ew-3l3eEYS&amp;sig=JWPvHb7VXPN37YXN4GeiVL2iKNI When Children Became People: the birth of childhood in early Christianity] by Odd Magne Bakke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm &quot;Abortion and Catholic Thought: The Little-Told History&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=universityofcalifornia&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=-SZnZTSQV9EC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=history+of+abortion+christianity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CAAxiKZDWx&amp;sig=KpHR-MM8mMV1Ab8M2aOnDtwnDhk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jo2LSqbnIIX2Nc7axL0P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood] by Kristin Luker, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; though there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was&lt;ref name=&quot;prejudices&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=VXGkAhyNGAEC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=Iltis+Cherry+%22contraception+and+early+abortion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=R3dATaTtFtS0hAe0h9TACA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ana S.

Early Christian texts nonetheless condemned abortion without distinction: Luker mentions the [[Didache]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], Tertullian, and [[Saint Basil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Luker&quot;/&gt; Early church councils punished women for abortions that were combined with other sexual crimes, as well as makers of abortifacient drugs.&lt;ref name=Luker&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=-SZnZTSQV9EC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=history+of+abortion+christianity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CAAxiKZDWx&amp;sig=KpHR-MM8mMV1Ab8M2aOnDtwnDhk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jo2LSqbnIIX2Nc7axL0P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood] by Kristin Luker, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Christian philosophers such as Father of the Church [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and Doctor of the Church [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]].

This would be the Catholic Church's position until 1869, when the limitation of automatic excommunication to abortion of a ''formed'' fetus was removed, a change that has been interpreted as an implicit declaration that conception was the moment of ensoulment.&lt;ref name=&quot;harpercollins&quot;/&gt; Consequently, in the Middle Ages, a less severe penance was imposed for the sin of abortion &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;before [the foetus] has life&quot;.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [http://books.google.com/books?id=oixC8quZYIkC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=medieval+penance+abortion+forty&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I3LZTav2KIi7hAeR6eHPBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Patrick J.

Contemporary [[Christian denomination]]s have nuanced positions, thoughts and teachings about abortion, especially in extenuating circumstances.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 &quot;Religious Groups’ Official Positions on Abortion&quot;] Pew Forum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=where&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm &quot;Where does God stand on abortion?&quot;] USA Today&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/library/Abortion.asp |title=Abortion |work=Catholic Answers |publisher=Catholic.com |date=2004-08-10 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicapologetics.info/morality/abortion/abortion.htm The Catholic Teaching on Abortion], ''Allocution to Large Families, Nov. 26, 1951'', [[Pope Pius XII]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serborth.org/01222009.html |title=The Orthodox Perspective on Abortion at the occasion of the National Sanctity of Human Life Day 2009 |first=Vasilije |last=Vranic |publisher=Serbian Orthodox Church in North and South America |month=January |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7101 |title=The Stand of the Orthodox Church on Controversial Issues |work=Our Faith |first=Stanley S. |last=Harakas |publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and most [[Evangelical|evangelical Protestants]] oppose deliberate abortion as immoral, while allowing what is sometimes called indirect abortion, namely, an action that does not seek the death of the fetus as an end or a means but that is followed by the death as a side effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Kaczor+%22side+effect+and%22&amp;btnG= Christopher Robert Kaczor, ''The Ethics of Abortion'' (Taylor &amp; Francis 2010 ISBN 978-0-415-88468-6), p. 187]&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[mainline Protestant]] denominations such as the [[Methodist Church]], [[United Church of Christ]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]], among others, are more permissive of abortion. More generally, some Christian denominations can be considered [[pro-life]] while others may be considered [[pro-choice]]. Additionally, there are sizable minorities in all denominations that disagree with their denomination's stance on abortion, an example of which is the group [[Catholics for a Free Choice]].&lt;ref name=where /&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism and abortion}}
Classical Hindu texts strongly condemn abortion. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] writes, &quot;When considering abortion, the Hindu way is to choose the action that will do least harm to all involved: the mother and father, the foetus and society.&quot;  The BBC goes on to state, &quot;In practice, however, abortion is practiced in Hindu culture in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to [[Sex-selective abortion|abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies]], which is called 'female foeticide'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC] &quot;Hinduism and abortion&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions. Some Hindus support abortion in cases where the mother's life is at imminent risk or when the fetus has a life threatening developmental anomaly.

Some Hindu theologians and [[Brahma Kumaris]] believe personhood begins at three months and develops through to five months of gestation, possibly implying permitting abortion up to the third month and considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul's current incarnate body.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1: Dilemmas of Life and Death: Hindu Ethics in a North American Context | Date: 1995 | Author: Crawford, S. Cromwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/30/stories/2009073060530400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=A warning for doctors doing sex selection | date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Islam and abortion}}
Although there are different opinions among Islamic scholars about when life begins and when abortion is permissible, most agree that the termination of a pregnancy after 120 days&amp;nbsp;– the point at which, in Islam, a fetus is thought to become a living soul&amp;nbsp;– is not permissible.&lt;ref name=PewForum/&gt; Several Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.&lt;ref name=PewForum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
{{main|Judaism and abortion}}
Orthodox Jewish teachings sanction abortion as a means of safeguarding the life of the woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml Judaism and Abortion], BBC (2005-02-08).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bank, Richard. [http://books.google.com/books?id=XQrs25E4IwYC&amp;pg=PT203&amp;dq=judaism+abortion&amp;ei=vd33SbnMGKLuMpLR1JEB The Everything Judaism Book], page 186 (Everything Books, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; While the Reform, Reconstructionist and Conservative movements openly advocate for the right to a safe and accessible abortion, the Orthodox movement is less unified on the issue.&lt;ref name=PewForum/&gt;

In Judaism, views on abortion draw primarily upon the legal and ethical teachings of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Talmud]], the case-by-case decisions of [[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]], and other rabbinic literature. In the modern period, moreover, Jewish thinking on abortion has responded both to [[Liberalism|liberal]] understandings of personal autonomy as well as Christian opposition to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobovits, Sinclair&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, orthodox Jews oppose abortion after the 40th day&lt;ref&gt; Talmud, Yevomot 69a states that prior to the 40th day a fetus is &quot;considered to be mere water&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Grodzenski, Achiezer Vol. 3, 65:14&lt;/ref&gt; with health-related exceptions, and reform and conservative Jews tend to allow greater latitude for abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Articles published by the [[Schlesinger institute]] on [[Judaism and abortion|abortion in Judaism]]: articles [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/jmeResults.asp?title=abortion&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in English] and [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/AsiaResults.asp?title=&amp;keywords=20&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in Hebrew], and the [http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/tora/subject18.asp entry on abortion] from the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; There are rulings that often appear conflicting on the matter. The Talmud states that a fetus is not legally a person until it is delivered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Getting-off-the-Bus.html Jewish Abortion perspective 1 on Patheos]&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah contains the law that &quot;when men fight and one of them pushes a pregnant woman and a miscarriage results but no other misfortune, the one responsible shall be fined...but if other misfortune ensues, the penalty shall be life (nefesh) for life (nefesh).&quot; (Ex.21:22-25); causing an abortion on an unwilling woman is thus a crime, but not because the fetus is considered a person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Responsibility-Not-Rights.html Jewish Abortion perspective 2 on Patheos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Biomedical ethics and Jewish law |first=Fred |last=Rosner |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=T7w2oAmohpEC&amp;pg=PA178 |page=178 |publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
Although the [[Sikh]] code of conduct does not deal directly with abortion (or indeed many other bioethical issues), it is generally forbidden in Sikhism because it is said to interfere with the creative work of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this theoretical viewpoint, abortion is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India, and there is growing concern that [[Sex-selective abortion|female fetuses are being aborted]] because of the cultural preference for sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

==Unitarian Universalism==
The [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] strongly supports abortion rights. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Church passed a resolution that declared, &quot;...&lt;nowiki&gt;[the]&lt;/nowiki&gt; right to choice on contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of privacy, respect for human life and freedom of conscience of women and their families.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml Right to Choose]&lt;/ref&gt; The Church had released earlier statements in 1963 and 1968 favoring the reform of restrictive abortion laws.

==Wicca==
Although views differ, most Wiccans consider abortion to be a spiritual decision that shouldbe free from inteference by the state or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of women and religion in North America: Volume 1 - Page 811, Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
