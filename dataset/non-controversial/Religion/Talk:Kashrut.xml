== Kashrut vs Kosher? ==
Since &quot;Kosher&quot; is the english version of &quot;Kashrut&quot;, and since this is the &quot;english&quot; Wikipedia, and since everyone and their mother knows the word Kosher, what are the compelling reasons to list this article under &quot;Kashrut&quot;? For example, we talk about &quot;Germany&quot; in english Wikipedia, not &quot;Deutschland&quot;.--[[User:Axcelis555|Axcelis555]] ([[User talk:Axcelis555|talk]]) 21:08, 2 November 2010 (UTC)
: It's not. Kashrut is a noun and Kosher is an adjective. You could say that kashrut is the practice of keeping things kosher, but not the other way around. Kashrut laws tell us which foods are kosher, and not the other way around.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.64.134.207|85.64.134.207]] ([[User talk:85.64.134.207|talk]]) 07:33, 11 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::So? ''Kosher'' is the [[WP:Common names|most common word]] for it in English. Plenty of articles are at adjectives—''[[halal]]'', for one. It can easily be said the other way around: Kosher foods are those that adhere to kashrus. —[[User talk:Wiki Wikardo|Wiki Wikardo]] 22:44, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

:::Yeah, according to Wiki conventions the article SHOULD be called &quot;Kosher&quot; but I don't expect it to ever be changed and if you try people will complain for no reason. Honestly, how many people search for Kashrut instead of Kosher when looking for this page. I would say not even a tenth. English Wikipedia so it should use the most common word in English.[[Special:Contributions/72.89.142.185|72.89.142.185]] ([[User talk:72.89.142.185|talk]]) 14:09, 11 April 2011 (UTC)

== Junk Food and Soft Drinks? ==
If one of the reasons for having Kashrut is to preserve health, why haven't the Biblical rules been updated for living in the 21st century? Soft drinks such as Coke, Pepsi and Sprite are full of sugar or corn syrup, many with caffeine and some with stimulants such as denatured cocaine. These drinks cause obesity, diabetes, tooth-decay, hyperactivity and are habit forming, and no mention of their deleterious effects is ever mentioned by the rabbis - why not? In fact, Coca Cola even makes a version of their product suitable for Passover. Junk foods full of hydrogenated oils should also be declared un-kosher due to their health risks.
Also, if another reason for having Kashrut is to reach the laws of G-d, then why do the rules make no mention of products which oppress human beings in their manufacture? Coca Cola for example exploits workers and pollutes the environment in some countries (please see [[Criticism of Coca Cola]], and yet Jews continue to buy and drink it.[[User:Horsechestnut|Horsechestnut]] ([[User talk:Horsechestnut|talk]]) 01:20, 7 July 2010 (UTC)
== What about mixing eggs with meat? ==
Is it also unkosher to mix eggs and meat, specially poultry?
If so, should eggs and meat be cooked separately? In different pans? With different utensils?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/202.175.46.27|202.175.46.27]] ([[User talk:202.175.46.27|talk]]) 10:16, 9 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Non Mixing of Dairy and Meat is Non, Repeat Not a Kosher Rule ==
Now that I have gotten your attention I recant that statement.  But only partially.  I was raised Jewish and to respect and honor Kosher rules.  However this is Rabbinic Kosher rules, not Torah (Biblical) Kosher.  It is true that Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy all state basically that we are not to &quot;boil a kid in it's mother's milk,&quot; however the context of the statement is not within the confides of the dietary requirements found in Levitcus 11th chapter.  The rules for separating dairy &amp; meat come from a section of text where one would find the sacrificail rules (not dietary).  The Talmud (or Oral Torah) is what expands upon those text about dairy and meat which make them non-kosher, not the Torah itself.  After all the passage is not really clear that is dietary or not because it does not say specifically.  It is therefore nothing more than an opinion.  I therefore do not follow this text as I believe it to be the opinion of mankind and not a direct dictate from Ha Shem himself.  I may be wrong but for the sake of argument I believe that letting those who read about Kosher here in Wikipedia that it is more a tradition or a part of the Talmud (Oral Torah) would be more appropriate than an outright dictate that it is a Kosher rule.
&lt;br&gt;([[User:Jcsrauch|JCSR]] ([[User talk:Jcsrauch|talk]]) 18:00, 28 November 2009 (UTC))

Sorry but I see no valid point, since HASHEM gave the jews the right to transform his laws into something that they could apply and have use off. The only jewish (some people whouldn't call them that) group i know of that feels this way about halacha is the [[Karaite_Judaism|karaites]]. (probably some reform might see it like this but that would be odd..). I think wikipedia &lt;b&gt;have&lt;/b&gt; to select a grounding that is able to teach and help people learn, that is ortodox and then make comparsions from that, or write subs that tell the view point of any other movement or group. [[User:Blambi|blambi]] ([[User talk:Blambi|talk]]) 16:37, 10 December 2009 (UTC)


You have very false information Blambi.  The Karites do NOT believe in changing G-d's laws, and no REAL Jew believes that G-d gave him the right to alter G-d's laws....

== Restrictions on non diatary use ==
this text is wrong, it says there are NO restrictions on non-diatery use. it should read there are SOME. for example one can not benifit from cooked meat and milk mixtures even for non-food use
== History section is needed ==

This article would benefit tremendously from a history section. How did the dietary laws evolve? For example, were they already in place at the time of the Roman empire?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/159.134.212.135|159.134.212.135]] ([[User talk:159.134.212.135|talk]]) 15:24, 25 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:You give us good source, we try to write good section. If you have to believe the Bible, [[Daniel]] kept kosher at the Babylonian emperor's palace. But then the Bible itself states that the laws of Kashrut were given to Moses about 3,300 years ago. I am not personally aware of secondary/secular sources documenting adherence to the dietary laws in antiquity.

:Related to the history section, I think a section detailing the implications of the laws on the modern food industry should be included.

== Wild game? ==

Under the [[Kashrut#Principles|principles]] section of the article it states the following:

:''Many wild game would be kosher if they could be '''shechted''' but as they are wild and cannot be tamed it would be impossible to '''shecht''' without desacrating one of the requirements as well as giving a misconception that all wild game are kosher.''

Actually, I would suggest asking a Rav about this, there is a body of halachic literture about hunting that practically no one looks at, because practically no kosher keeping Jewish people live in rural areas where hunting is popular for both sport and table.  It's come up in my hillel that it might be tchnically permissible to hunt for table but not for sport.  The problem is that animalds are large (freezers, sharing?), and that most Jes in the US have never been exposed to guns ever, both at a shooting range, let alone in a forest.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.122.249.74|69.122.249.74]] ([[User talk:69.122.249.74|talk]]) 17:59, 18 August 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Can someone fix the article, or just respond here, to explain why a wild or untamed animal can't be ''shechted''?  That text from the article is very confusing.  [[User:Gh5046|Gh5046]] ([[User talk:Gh5046|talk]]) 06:49, 5 March 2008 (UTC)

:Wild animals are [[hunting|hunted]].  With the exception of [[animal trapping|trapping]], hunting means killing the animal in the wild, ruining the opportunity for [[shechita]].  (I agree that the wording is unclear.)  [[User:MagnesianPhoenix|MagnesianPhoenix]] ([[User talk:MagnesianPhoenix|talk]]) 16:04, 18 April 2008 (UTC)

== Is Kosher Halal? ==

There are less restrictions for [[Halal]] than for [[Kosher]]. When it comes to meat, a proper method is to be followed (the same in Kosher as it is in Halal). So is it safe to say that all Kosher food (except alcoholic wine) is permissible for muslims (or in other words, is Halal) ?
--[[User:Zybez|Zybez]] ([[User talk:Zybez|talk]]) 14:41, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

:According to the [[Halal]] article, it's &quot;an ongoing debate&quot;, with &quot;most Muslim authorities&quot; effectively disagreeing with you.  See also [[Islamic and Jewish dietary laws compared]].  [[User:MagnesianPhoenix|MagnesianPhoenix]] ([[User talk:MagnesianPhoenix|talk]]) 16:04, 18 April 2008 (UTC)


Yeah, it is NOT Halal nor visa versa....  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/129.82.238.95|129.82.238.95]] ([[User talk:129.82.238.95|talk]]) 20:21, 8 March 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Zybek didn't ask whether kosher and halal are the same. Zybek asked whether meat that is kosher is also halal. The answer is that in almost all cases yes kosher meat is also halal meat. It is also true that halal and kosher are not the same, but, again, that wasn't Zybek's question. The Wiki article cited by MangesianPhoenix gives details but you'll see that most points of disagreement are 1) cases where kosher is more restrictive, 2) involve products other than meat (alcohol for example) and 3) often involve parts of dietary law that only extremely strict followers of halal worry about.

==Giraffe==
Someone kindly added a ''Daily Telegraph'' link that the [[giraffe]] has now been declared kosher. The article is internally inconsistent though. The principle of ''chalav tamei eino ma'amid'' doesn't work the other way round, i.e. one cannot declare an animal kosher because its milk exhibits certain properties! Does anyone have a better source on this - which beth din decided on it? [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T@lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 11:35, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

Did read earlier in a comment on the word zamer (זמר) Parshas Re'eh 14:5 (ArtScroll Chumash) that both R' Saadyah and Radak belived that the zamer was the giraffe, but they also point out in the same comment space that Chullin 80a seems says its a wild goat.

== Kashmiri Muslims Call Halall as Kash ==

Kashmiri Muslims call Halal as Kash (Abbr of Kashrut). This is perhaps because of a longstanding jewish influence in Kashmir(Probably coming from Persia) noted by travellers including Alberuni(ca 1000 A.D)[[User:Taffazull|scribe]] ([[User talk:Taffazull|talk]]) 15:04, 11 September 2008 (UTC)


Actually that is because most Kashmiri Muslims are descended from the tribes of Israel that fled to Afghanistan and further East after the first destruction.  Afghanistan history documents this fact, and the 47th generational descendant of King Saul attempted to return the people to Israel just after the second Temple was built but he was denied entry by the Babylonians who ruled Israel at that time.

== In comparison and contrast to nearby cultures ==

Can someone please explain this recent edit to me? I don't know what it's the inverse of or what sense it makes, or why it should be in the article. Does &quot;original bible&quot; mean Old Testament, re-definitions of what?

::Inversely, the abandoning of Kashrut food practices that are detailed in the Torah (original bible) during the re-definitions of the new testament, is a signifyer of mainstream divergence from the Jewish practice, way of life, and creed.

== Temple Grandin ==

Prof. Temple Grandin is recognized throughout the industry as &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;expert on behavior of animals at slaughter.

:There are several issues. There is substantial criticism of this research, and therefore the &quot;external links&quot; section is not the place to present one viewpoint but not the other. Please see [[WP:NPOV]] if this is unclear. Those defending kosher slaughter also claim that shechita is a humane method of slaughter and aimed at reducing stress. If you want to present all viewpoints, it might be more appropriate to leave the [[kashrut]] article alone (which is about ''all'' aspects of kosher food, not just slaughter) and take this to [[shechita]], where you will find this link again.

I disagree with your implication that Prof. Grandin opposes kosher slaughter or believes that it is not humane. One of the papers on the previously linked site [http://www.grandin.com/ritual/kosher.slaugh.html] makes it clear that she is simply recommending how to ensure that shechita is done in a humane way – by using a sharp knife, by keeping the animal upright especially avoiding shackling and hoisting (discussed more completely at  [http://www.grandin.com/ritual/conservative.jewish.law.html]).

==Vegetarianism and Dr. Katz's opinion==


Okay, let's get this perfectly clear before you read any of the drivel below:

Vegetarianism is NOT Kosher, by default!  There are VERY strict laws governing plants for Kashrut, that the typical American Jew refuses to learn, and thus mistakenly believes they are &quot;eating Kosher&quot; when they are not.  I say, &quot;American Jew&quot; because this is where this nonsense started, in the US.  Well trained Jews know better.




I have several  times to insert the following this in the &quot;Vegetarianism&quot; section 

As noted by the [[Israel]]i scholar Dr. Ya'akov Katz, &quot;(...) Strictly refraining from eating any meat whatsoever technically fulfils the criteria of Kashrut, not to mix meat and milk. However, it does not fulfil the unofficial social function which many people assign to Kashrut - i.e., to set up a daily way of life which sets Jews apart from non-Jews. Being a vegetarian does not fulfil this function, Rather, it sets vegetarians apart from non-vegetarians. Jewish vegetarians have no problem in sharing a table with non-Jewish vegetarians - but they have considerable difficulty in sharing a table with Jewish non-vegetarians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ya'akov Katz, &quot;To be a Jewish Vegetarian&quot; in Avraham Drori (ed.) &quot;Round table on Late Twentieth Century Judaism&quot;, Tel Aviv, 1987 (In Hebrew) - noting some difficulties he encountered as a vegetarian, in congregations in both [[New York City]] and [[Petach Tikva]], Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

It was repeatedly reverted by [[User:Jfdwolff | Jfdwolff]]. on the grounds that this is &quot;a single person's POV&quot; and afterwards &quot;I know Katz is a scholar but he is describing personal experiences and views that are not necessarily highly notable&quot;. I want to point out again that Dr. Katz is a scholar, and that he said these things in the context of a serious panel discussion on Judaism and how it interacts with the social norms of the modern Western World in which Jews live. He pointed to personal experiences of his own life to illustrate the point - which is a long-established and perfectly legitimate academic method - but the point itself is highly relevant to the subject and belongs on this page. If [[User:Jfdwolff|  Jfdwolff]] finds it objectionable (which is his privilege) he is at liberty to locate and place on the page an opposing view. That is the Wikipedia way, as I venture to understand it. [[Special:Contributions/79.177.75.195|79.177.75.195]] ([[User talk:79.177.75.195|talk]]) 13:35, 14 September 2009 (UTC)

: He is an outspoken vegetarian and Animal Rights advocate, whose concern for animals is deeply rooted in his being a devout Orthodox Jew, and he has expressed this opinion in writing quite often. As he said and wrote, both in the sepcific debate which I quoted and on other occasions, he would like other Orthodox Jews to become vegetarians and other Jewish vegetarians to become Orthodox, and has made efforts over many years to convince members of both groups of why they it is in interest of both Judaism and Vegetarianism that they should do so - both when he lived in the US and since he came to Israel. I think all this gives his view on the matter enough significance to have one paragraph mentioning it in the specific section of the specific Wikipedia page dealing with this specific subject.

Here are some:

* [http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports.htm FAWC]

These are some of the most well known animal welfare organisations.

Unless someone can present evidence of animal welfare groups that have no problem with ritual slaughter, then I maintain it is perfectly acccurate and acceptable to say that &quot;many&quot;, or &quot;most&quot; (if not indeed &quot;all&quot;) such organisations oppose these methods.

''Incidentally I am also of the view that &quot;welfare&quot; is a more appropriate expression here than &quot;rights&quot; because it is less loaded.''

[[User:Grorland|Gavin]] ([[User talk:Grorland|talk]]) 18:24, 30 October 2009 (UTC)

:The above groups have a problem with every means of slaughter. 

::''&quot;Viva! opposes all slaughter and we promote vegetarianism as the only truly effective way to prevent animal suffering. Viva!’s investigations show that millions of animals slaughtered by conventional means are ineffectively, painfully or incompletely stunned – and the overwhelming majority of the 850 million killed each year lead lives of deprivation and suffering. To find out more about slaughter, click&quot;''

:The above is from Viva!'s web site. 

:In some statements they seem to be favoring stunning as a first step to slaughter. Is &quot;stunning&quot; humane? They are talking about religious slaughter and citing pigs. Pigs are not animals slaughtered for Jewish food.

::&lt;strike&gt;''&quot;In both forums I declared that religious slaughter is a vile and merciless way to treat animals, but that I also have concerns about the way bigots jump on the 'ritual slaughter' bandwagon. As to 'humane' British killing, I have personally visited six slaughterhouses and seen, for instance, pigs shackled upside down by one leg, their throats slashed and gushing blood. I've seen them slip from their shackles and crash head first on to the concrete, thrashing desperately and with blood pouring from their throat wounds. This is 'humane slaughter'. At one slaughterhouse I saw a man with a stick mindlessly beat every animal he unloaded from a transporter. At another, I saw a crippled pig kneed and kicked along an aisle to the place where she was subjected to electrical stunning.&quot;''&lt;/strike&gt;

:The above is from Animal Aid's web site.

:Do you have a source other than these web sites asserting what you wish to say? 

:I find this at [[wp:rs|WP:Reliable Sources]]:

::''&quot;Articles should rely on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.

::: Above you state that &quot;The above groups have a problem with every means of slaughter&quot; but this is not true. While some do have a problem with all animal slaughter - ''and therefore are indeed opposed to kosher'' - the FAWC, for example, are not opposed to all slaughter. Neither, I think, are the RSPCA. Nonetheless both are opposed to ritual slaughter on the basis of scientific evidence.

:::I have quoted enough sources. The only questions pertinent to the change are whether these groups are opposed to ritual slaughter, which I have shown they are, and whether you can cite other animal rights organisations who are not opposed to it.

::::Do I understand you correctly that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kashrut&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=322896434 this] is the change you wish to make?

:::::Yes, that is the change I'd like to make - the same one I made in the first place. It seems to me these organisations' own statements count as &quot;primary sources&quot;. Please simply present an animal welfare group that is not opposed to ritual slaughter, with your source, and you have some counter-evidence.

:::::Also, the quotation you give from Animal Aid, above, though emotive, is irrelevant, because if these practices were really witnessed, they are unnecessary malpractices for which the slaughterhouse could lose its licence, whereas ritual slaughter is judged by these organisations to be unnecessarily painful even when carried out &quot;correctly&quot;.

::::::Grorland, you are trying to change from &quot;Some&quot; to &quot;Many&quot; in the statement, ''&quot;Some animal rights groups object to kosher slaughter…&quot;'' The problem is you have not brought a source to support that change. Your argument has been that you have looked at animal right's group sites and have found them to be opposed to kosher slaughter. But I think that is [[wp:or|original research]]. I think what is called for is a [[WP:THIRDPARTY|third party]] source that comments on this. The change that you are proposing making is only exacerbating an already existing problem. Though I have not come across Wikipedia policy on this, my reasoning is as follows: Terms like &quot;some,&quot; &quot;many,&quot; and &quot;few&quot; serve to quantify. The word &quot;some&quot; is a moderate term in this respect. But terms such as &quot;many&quot; and &quot;few&quot; tend to express either extremely large or extremely small quantities.

:::::::That's precisely the point, the word &quot;some&quot; is moderate, implying that just a few groups are against ritual slaughter, while others (possibly a majority) have no problem with it.

:::::::''&quot;To demonstrate that you are not presenting original research, you must cite reliable sources that are directly related to the topic of the article, and that directly support the information as it is presented.&quot;''

:::::::While it is true that it is hard to find a third party source saying that many animal rights groups are against ritual slaughter (no doubt because the statement is self-evidently true), there is no need for such a source when sufficient primary sources for the claim are available.

:::::::You seem very resistant to this edit despite all the evidence presented. Do you honestly believe there exist animal rights groups who have no problem with ritual slaughter?

:::::::Regarding the quantative issue, would you be happier with &quot;most&quot; rather than &quot;many&quot;? This claim is also clearly substantiated by the primary sources.

== Gelatin fix ==

Under Ethical Eating, in the Vegetarianism section, the article states the following:
On the other hand, kashrut does recognize some processes as capable of converting a meat or dairy product into a pareve one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese,[48]  but such cheeses might not be acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, which is an animal product, despite its pareve status. Eggs are another food that is considered pareve despite being unsuitable for many vegetarians; Mayonnaise, for instance, is usually marked &quot;pareve&quot; despite nearly always containing egg.
Gelatin derived from swine is prohibited. [[Special:Contributions/195.234.27.10|195.234.27.10]] ([[User talk:195.234.27.10|talk]]) 12:48, 28 July 2010 (UTC)

== {“Update”} request in 'Animal Welfare' section, and other [[WP:MEDRS]] issues ==

This article contains 1978 research, regarding a controversial subject. I'm a biological researcher, and there are improvements in technology to measure animals' neurological reactions, and methodologies of WHAT to measure and HOW were most likely refined, during the past 3 decades LOL; compare to the recommendation of what is considered 'recent' research in the [[WP:MEDRS]] guidelines (&quot;Look for reviews published in the last 5 years or so&quot;). The next paragraph exposes even more faults besides the age of this study.  The cited study may or may not be outdated...but is likely to be and therefore should be '''reviewed by someone with expertise _in this field_ (and who can show whether newer, and larger-scale, studies have confirmed or refuted this single study), please'''. I focus on a different area of bioscience, so I can notice the flaws but not repair them as time-efficiently as anyone who keeps current in this area of research.

This article also fails to mention that the researchers themselves noted: “...critical essays on the effectiveness of current methods of stunning animals for slaughter are on the increase,” which is essentially the authors' acknowledgment that, in 1978, their conclusions were not strongly supported by others. (They did cite a few researchers who said one thing, but also a few researchers who had the opposite conclusion, suggesting a consensus wasn't clearly for nor against them). '''This source fails the tests of 2.2, 2.3, aaaaaand 2.4 of [[WP:MEDRS]]'''; but the question that's even more important is: Do its conclusions support the scientific consensus _''today''_? (MEDRS says it should, to be considered a worthy source.) If so, [[WP:Proveit|please prove it]]), and '''if the strength of results of their research were disputed by other experts, let alone from the researchers themselves, that should be noted in the article'''.

'''It's probably more worthwhile to just start over with a recent [[meta-study]], rather than this single, 1978 research-group's study, as [[WP:MEDRS]] deprecates the latter...'''  Unless someone wants to re-add this &amp; address the above failure to meet several WP guidelines, the rest of my blathering is less important:

This 1978 study was published in a respectable, peer-reviewed journal...but the point of peer-reviewed research is not to just say “hey, peer-reviewed research said so” but rather to look at the peers' reviews (the whole point of the peer review process is to read that feedback &amp; adjust one's view of the initial research's validity, accordingly.), and then one needs to look at similar studies, esp more recent ones that have adjusted the methodology to correct for flaws that often are pointed out by peer-reviewers (i.e. look at the whole corpus from the scientific community, esp newer research...and this is best done by a Wikipedian whose area of expertise this is, rather than the religious website that takes a clear POV and is translating --perhaps with religious bias (another source of WP:RS problems?)-- this 1978 study. '''The 2nd paragraph of 2.2. of [[WP:MEDRS]] agrees with the basic contentions I'm making in this paragraph, but I'll just expand upon some of the reasons WHY it's good for WP to have that policy:''' (1.) I'll often see a layman's website which cites such outdated studies if the study supports the bias of the webmaster or group, who are laymen and desperately want to believe that their personal practices are great [as this was pulled from a religious/pro-Halal website, I suspect the worst. I say the same about some of their opposition (PeTA) and deprecate their reliability accordingly; i.e. I make sure the readers of WP realize that it's an activist/POV &amp; non-scientific source unless I find independent confirmation of their claims.], and such groups are often tempted, subconsciously or not, to [[cherry pick]] a certain study which reinforces their worldview, even if (2.) the study has been proven to be misleading by 5 or 10 newer, larger-scale, peer-reviewed-and-universally-approved studies, and (3.) sometimes, even the original researcher will update his own work --from, e.g., a 1978 study-- based on the feedback he received in the peer-review process which can cause him to re-publish a different conclusion, 2 or 3 years later...these are just a few of the reasons that it's crucial for someone with '''related''' research-experience to review, and {update} the whole paragraph if needed.  ''Even most middle aged laypeople today remember the big scare about the dietary-cholesterol in eggs, so let's use that as an example: consider that anyone on teh interwebs could cite the old studies which 'proved' dietary-cholesterol, not saturated fat, is the most dangerous and caused the most 'bad' BLOOD-cholesterol, and thus they'd regenerate the panic about eggs from decades ago...except that that one was so well-publicized that people today know eggs --and DIETARY-cholesterol, more generally-- isn't '''that''' bad for you (not that I'm saying you should eat 6 eggs each day, here... ;) but '''more healthy''' than previously believed).''  Even if a study was peer-reviewed, in 3 decades it's likely to have been either confirmed by other researchers or else updated (refuted by heavy contrary evidence).

''Deutsche Tierärztliche Wochenschrift'' 1978 Feb 5;85(2):62–6. [http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/halalstudy.htm English translation by Dr Sahib M. Bleher]&lt;/ref&gt;{{MEDRS|See “MEDRS” on Talk page}} &quot;For sheep, there were in part severe reactions both in bloodletting cut and the pain stimuli.&quot;

N.B.: The researchers cite the 1972 animal (&quot;Tier&quot;) law and noted that animals must be stunned; Germany today allows slaughter without stunning, for ritual slaughter only, as a good citation shows in the &quot;Germany&quot; section of [[Legal aspects of ritual slaughter]]. This most likely creates another fault, because In this study the animals appear to have been stunned before the aforementioned “ritual cut” and kosher butchers throughout Europe may be exempted from that precaution in REAL-WORLD kashrut practice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/references/slaughter/jour137_en.pdf Official Journal of the European Union L 137 , 02/06/1988 p. 0027 – 0038] &quot;European Convention for the Protection of Animals for Slaughter&quot;: &quot;Each Contracting Party may authorize derogations from the provisions concerning prior stunning in the following cases: – slaughtering in accordance with religious rituals ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; '''&lt;--The same &quot;painless&quot; results achieved in this study are not necessarily achieved in pragmatic, real-world practice by Rabbis. This fact should also be noted in the article, even if this citation's other short-comings can be addressed and it is re-added.--&gt;''' The failure to stun the animals is an issue that provokes accusations of cruelty in and of itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2977086.stm BBC, 10 Jun 2003: “FAWC said it wanted an end to the exemption currently allowed for Kosher and Halal meat from the legal requirement to stun animals first.”]&lt;/ref&gt;  (I'd need to read it more fully before I'd put my word on the following; sorry but this study doesn't report its results nearly so well as most research reports I've read; not sure if it's a bad translation or what.)  The researchers appear to suggest that the &quot;reformed&quot; law should ban stun-less slaughter (and the last 2 citations show that is not banned today): &quot;This binding general provision of the TierSchG must equally be the basis of the reformed Law on slaughter.&quot; As the third and final critique in this paragraph: Study doesn't appear to attempt to measure pain during the stunning process, only during the death process? (Again, I wouldn't put my word on the 3 critiques IN THIS PARAGRAPH, but this source doesn't meet WP content policies due to the other reasons, above this paragraph.) The actual &quot;ritual cut&quot; (death) may be &quot;painless,&quot; but this study does not address the Animal Welfare concerns if the animal is in severe pain as he's being stunned and they don't measure the animal's pain as he's being stunned, only after he is stunned (i.e. as he's being killed). (I'd need to read it more before saying that I'd put my word on that...but first, several other issues, identified above this paragraph, need to be addressed for it to simply even meet WP's content guidelines).

==  External Link – “Laws of Judaism” ==

The external link, “Laws of Judaism Concerning Food” at  [http://www.religiousrules.com/Judaismfood00table.htm http://www.religiousrules.com/Judaismfood00table.htm] is a thoroughly documented, detailed and useful reference site. It has apparently been listed on this page as an external link for years at its previous location, [http://religion.atspace.com/Judaismfood00table.htm http://religion.atspace.com/Judaismfood00table.htm], which was labeled “Dietary laws from the &lt;i&gt;Torah &lt;/i&gt;and the Code of Maimonides (&lt;i&gt;Mishneh Torah&lt;/i&gt;).” The URL was updated to its new location and that caused it to be immediately deleted as a “personal website.” I have reversed the deletion for these reasons. Please do not delete it again without further discussion.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/170.170.59.139|170.170.59.139]] ([[User talk:170.170.59.139|talk]]) 20:58, 26 May 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Regarding vegetarian/vegan and kosher foods ==

This statement is errant: &quot;Strict vegetarians, Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods, often consider the kosher-parve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives.&quot;

Kosher foods are NOT necessarily animal-free as they can contain fish (and possibly egg) ingredients. Thus, strict vegetarians (which I assume means vegan?) cannot rely on the kosher-parve label to be sure a product has no animal-derived ingredients. An example is marshmallows made with fish gelatin that contains no dairy or egg products.  [[User:Sam metal|Sam metal]] ([[User talk:Sam metal|talk]]) 15:17, 31 May 2011 (UTC)

:The statement does not assert that Kosher foods are necessarily animal-free. It asserts that strict vegetarians often consider the kosher-parve designation as an assurance this is the case. The cited source supports that, saying, &quot;Only two million of the kosher consumers are Jewish. The other eight-plus million are people who choose to eat kosher for religious (Moslems), idealistic (Vegans and Vegetarians), and health reasons.&quot; [[User:Wtmitchell|Wtmitchell]]  [[User talk:Wtmitchell|(talk)]] &lt;small&gt;(earlier ''Boracay Bill'')&lt;/small&gt; 05:38, 1 June 2011 (UTC)

ISBN 0899061036 ([http://www.artscroll.com/Products/LOKH.html index here]) seems to be a good secondary source to support the slightly more technical aspects. It also has a good list of all forbidden foods and mixtures in its introduction.

== Some updating ==

I have finally found the time to provide a general list of ''all'' kashrut prohibitions, which is quite effectively summed up in the first chapter of Forst's 1994 &quot;Pischei Halacha&quot; published by ArtScroll/Mesorah. Some of the laws could benefit from more direct sourcing to Biblical laws whereever possible to clarify beyond doubt what the origin of each law is.

I have also reshuffled a lot of the other content without modifying the text. Some time ago someone shuffled everything around and made all sections level 2. This led to complete chaos. I have now tried to arrange everything conceptually (e.g. everything relating to supervision and marketing into one section).

With regards to sourcing, we still have a long way to go. Forst is a pretty good secondary source, and once I get my hands on a copy of Grunfeld's work we can use that also. Other suggestions for secondary sources are welcomed. [[User:Jfdwolff|JFW]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Jfdwolff|&lt;small&gt;T@lk&lt;/small&gt;]] 12:43, 29 January 2012 (UTC)

== traif? ==

So, why does &quot;[[traif]]&quot; redirect here, when this article doesn't even have the word in it anywhere??  I saw it mentioned in an article elsewhere, and wiktionary was useless, so I tried wikipedia to find out what it is.  It redirects here, which is another dead end, because unless you already know what it is, you can't tell what part of this article relates to it.

This article is missing this section while the Halal article has the section which mentions both Kosher as well as Halal.

:I agree. Animal advocates have engaged frequently with the issue of ritual slaughter (in both Kashrut and Dhabihah forms) and are a major factor in how these slaughter methods are perceived by society. Users &quot;Gavin&quot; and [[User:Bus_stop|Bus stop]] argued above in 2009 about the proper way to characterize the perspective of animal rights (or animal welfare) advocates in this article; it appears that this perspective is no longer represented at all in the current version of the article. However, because shechita has its own page, I think this could be settled by giving a clear &quot;main article&quot; link under the &quot;Kosher slaughter&quot; heading.
