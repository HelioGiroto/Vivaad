== Deuterocanonical means SecondCanonical - The opposite of what catholics mean. Rename Article? ==

:''The word deuterocanonical is from Greek deuteros meaning '''second'''.'' It means second canon. Catholics claim that the christian canon included the deuterocanonical books even before the Protestant Reformation. That they are in the ''original'' canon, and that Martin Luther just removed them in the Reformation. 
:Are they sure they want to use this word when it's a tricky way of saying the canon Catholics tacked on later? 
:The title deuterocanon was probably either coin by Protestants or ignorant Catholics.
:Perhaps when people type in deuterocanonical it should just be a redirection to this article. The article should be renamed Catholic Canon not Included in Protestant Canon? [[Special:Contributions/74.78.201.42|74.78.201.42]] ([[User talk:74.78.201.42|talk]]) 20:29, 27 April 2012 (UTC)
::No, that rename is not acceptable and is blatantly POV. It also ignores the fact that most of these books predate the Catholic Church, and the fact that they have always used by various Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches.  'Deuterocanonical books', while it does indeed mean 'second canon', is the most common name that is actually used for them per our naming conventions. [[User:Til Eulenspiegel|Til Eulenspiegel]] ([[User talk:Til Eulenspiegel|talk]]) 20:43, 27 April 2012 (UTC)

:::What about making the current title redirect to this content and call it Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Canon not Included in Protestant Canon. I know it's long but it's less false. And we can accept canon that came before Christ if we want to. [[User:ThePepel-Eterni|ThePepel-Eterni]] ([[User talk:ThePepel-Eterni|talk]]) 20:51, 27 April 2012 (UTC)
::::No, I think that proposal also fails our naming conventions for going with the most widely used term. [[User:Til Eulenspiegel|Til Eulenspiegel]] ([[User talk:Til Eulenspiegel|talk]]) 21:41, 27 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::Don't confuse the etymology of the term with its meaning. When the term was coined by Sixtus of Sienna it meant the books of the Old Testament considered canonical by the council of Trent but not considered canonical by Jews, which is the exact same thing it means today. You can criticize Sixtus' coinage all you want, but you can't say that the term hasn't been widely adopted.

:::::I would caution against using the term anachronistically in an encyclopedia article, however common it may be on polemical websites. It is a post-Tridentine term that refers to a post-Tridentine concept. [[User:Rwflammang|Rwflammang]] ([[User talk:Rwflammang|talk]]) 23:02, 27 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::'''Oppose to rename'''. The general reader of Wikipedia arrives to this Article because he had known about &quot;deuterocanical&quot; but he doesn't know what exactly it means. For this reason we shall leave this title. There are many other articles about the canon. This article to explain what is the term &quot;deuterocanonical&quot; used for, its history, and briefly the different POVs about the inclusion of such books.[[User:A ntv|A ntv]] ([[User talk:A ntv|talk]]) 12:28, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

== Article mis-states Eastern Orthodox position ==

I am led to believe that the following statement:
:When Orthodox theologians use the term &quot;deuterocanonical,&quot; it is important to note that the meaning is not identical to the Roman Catholic usage. In Orthodox Christianity, deuterocanonical means that a book is part of the corpus of the Old Testament (i.e. is read during the services) but has secondary authority. In other words, deutero (second) applies to authority or witnessing power, whereas in Roman Catholicism, deutero applies to chronology (the fact that these books were confirmed later), not to authority.
Is not one which many Eastern Orthodox would agree with. See [http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/otcanon.aspx Joel Kalvesmaki, &quot;All Scripture Is Inspired by God: Thoughts on the Old Testament Canon&quot;], see also [http://books.google.com/books?id=q-vhwjamOioC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=anagignoskomena#v=onepage&amp;q=anagignoskomena&amp;f=false S. T. Kimbrough, Orthodox and Wesleyan Scriptural Understanding and Practice (2005), p. 23] (which we already cite.) I am left with the impression that [http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/ Fr. Laurent]'s views are ones that many Eastern Orthodox would disagree with. I'm hesitant about relying on this very brief &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;-style page for anything unless it can be confirmed by a more serious source.

:Yes, this notion was also inserted in the lede paragraph of [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in my memory, and I remember thinking that it was suspect at the time, but it was added with a reference I could not check: 'Pomazansky, Michael, Orthodox Dogmatic Theology, pp. 33-34', so I permitted the edit to stand. The Kimbrough reference given directly afterwards refutes this idea neatly, though. [[User:Elizium23|Elizium23]] ([[User talk:Elizium23|talk]]) 19:39, 31 July 2012 (UTC)</text>
