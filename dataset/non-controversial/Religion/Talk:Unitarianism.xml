::Moved here following mark with rewrite/dispute tags. Probably doesn't belong in the lede in any case.
From the 18th Century onwards English-speaking{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Unitarianism has also been known for the rejection of several [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Protestant doctrines besides the Trinity, ''ref Joseph Priestley, one of the founders of the Unitarian movement, defined Unitarianism as the belief of primitive Christianity before later corruptions set in. Among these corruptions, he included not only the doctrine of the Trinity, but also various other orthodox doctrines and usages ([[Earl Morse Wilbur]], ''A History of Unitarianism'', Harvard University Press 1952, pp. 302-303). /ref ------ '''probably true but this doesn't read like Wilbur's style. Are we sure this ref isn't a paraphrase?'''
* including the [[Soteriology|soteriological]] doctrines of [[original sin]] {{cn}}
* and [[Predestination in Christianity|predestination]], ref From ''The Catechism of the Hungarian Unitarian Church in Transylvanian Romania'': &quot;Unitarians do not teach original sin. We do not believe that through the sin of the first human couple we all became corrupted. It would contradict the love and justice of God to attribute to us the sin of others, because sin is one's own personal action&quot; ([[Ferencz Jozsef]], 20th ed., 1991. Translated from Hungarian by Gyorgy Andrasi, published in ''The Unitarian Universalist Christian,'' FALL/WINTER, 1994, Volume 49, Nos.3-4; VII:107). ref ref In his history of the Unitarians, David Robinson writes: &quot;At their inception, both Unitarians and Universalists shared a common theological enemy: Calvinism.&quot; He explains that they &quot;consistently attacked Calvinism on the related issues of original sin and election to salvation, doctrines that in their view undermined human moral exertion.&quot; (D. Robinson, ''The Unitarians and the Universalists'', Greenwood Press, 1985, pp. 3, 17).
* and [[biblical inerrancy]]. ref &quot;Although considering it, on the whole, an inspired book, Unitarians also regard the Bible as coming not only from God, but also from humans.... Unitarians therefore do not believe in the infallibility of the Bible, as some other Christians do.&quot; (D. Miano, ''An Explanation of Unitarian Christianity,'' AUC, 2003, 2007) /ref --- '''Problem: Present tense ref for past tense statement'''

::::The statements about the doctrines of original sin, predestination, and biblical inerrancy ARE in the main article and therefore it is justifiable, even necessary, to put it in the lede. This cannot be said about the section YOU have included in the lede. And as regard your reasons for dispute, they are no reasons at all: 1) You THINK?? that it is a paraphrase from Wilbur and that is why you have removed it? Why don't you go check it first? I can assure you it is an exact quote. Don't remove a section based on suspicion. 2) The citations for original sin are the same citations for predestination, so the proper references are there, even though the footnote does not immediate follow the words &quot;original sin.&quot; This can be seen immediately if a person takes the time to actually read the references. 3) The statement is: &quot;Unitarians ARE known...&quot; That, my friend, is present tense. This article is about what Unitarianism IS. --[[User:Donbodo|Donbodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 22:10, 5 August 2011 (UTC) 
:Donbodo
:I'm sorry but (i) I have read Wilbur's book, I'm familiar with his style and I don't believe that is an exact quote from Wilbur, (ii) as the lack of a page number confirms, (iii) in fact the editing history suggests it has slipped from content to ref box. (iv) Moreover there are 2 editions of Wilbur on Google books and neither of them shows the phrase. Plus (v) the adjacent spurious quotes from J. G. Dunn, suggests fakery in this section.
:Re the second point - in that case we can specify &quot;modern Unitarians&quot; not &quot;Unitarianism.&quot;

::Give me your email address, and I will send you an image of the page from Wilbur's book that contains those words exactly as stated. And you may need to get glasses, because the page numbers are listed in the citation (pages 302-303). As far as the quotation from Dunn goes, that was not added by me, but if you feel any quotation is a false quotation, then please show your evidence, and as soon as you show it to be spurious, we can remove it. Until then, leave it alone. Also, the expression &quot;Unitarianism is&quot; automatically denotes present-day Unitarianism, just as &quot;Unitarianism was&quot; would denote past Unitarianism. If one wrote: &quot;Modern Unitarianism is,&quot; that would be a redundancy. And again (this is the third time now), you have not provided an explanation as to why you included in the lede something not found in the rest of the article. Lastly, it is inappropriate for you to remove the disputed lead box, as you have done twice now. I dispute what you have included. --[[User:Donbodo|Donbodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 04:15, 6 August 2011 (UTC)

::::I never said otherwise. I simply said that the word &quot;is&quot; is present tense and the word &quot;was&quot; is past tense. Changing the tense changes the meaning. Feel free to add whatever verifiable historical material you want either in the history section of this article or on the History of Unitarianism page. But the Wikipedia guidelines are that the lead is supposed to summarize what is in the article, and so no material should be in the lead that isn't in the article. So please move it to the proper location, or, if it is all right with you, I can do it. --[[User:Donbodo|Donbodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 21:41, 6 August 2011 (UTC)
::::I can't find your email address on your user page. However, I realize I spoke in error above. I did paraphrase Wilbur (that is why there are no quotation marks). His exact words are: &quot;The thesis of Priestly's work...was that the belief of primitive Christianity was Unitarian and that all departures from the faith must be regarded as later 'corruptions.' This thesis he sought to sustain by appealing to the works of early Christian literature, and he applied it not only to the doctrine of Christ and the Trinity, but also to various other orthodox doctrines and usages.&quot; My paraphrase, therefore, is accurate.--[[User:Donbodo|Donbodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 21:49, 6 August 2011 (UTC)

:::::But as regards putting things in the lede which we know are not true of all Unitarians 1540-2010, and claiming that they are, that's a no-no. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 11:29, 7 August 2011 (UTC)
::::::The statement says, &quot;Unitarians are known for...&quot; rather than &quot;All Unitarians believe....&quot; Keep that in mind. Also, the rejection of the doctrines of original sin and predestination were characteristics of Unitarians in Poland and Transylvania, just as much as England and America. And the rejection of biblical inerrancy was later embraced by Unitarians in all four countries. Nevertheless, because you (one person) dispute this, I will leave the box up that says the point is disputed. --[[User:Donbodo|Donbodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 16:34, 7 August 2011 (UTC)

:::Actually you are also &quot;(one person)&quot; and judging by Charles' comments above he shares my view that historical Unitarian positions should be given weight. As regards the citation for the third view, well same thing, historically Unitarians weren't known for the third view, for which the source is the webpage of David Miano of the [[American Unitarian Conference]]. There are better sources than this, I can think of 2 or 3 which describe in detail the gradual rejection of biblical inerrancy in the Thomas Belsham era. Since this is a historical developement taking palce midway in Unitarian history it shouldn't be placed without qualification in the lede. Do you agree? Is there any reason why this should be misrepresented in the lede?[[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 22:49, 7 August 2011 (UTC)
::::First of all, I am in agreement that the history of Unitarianism should be given weight, so there is no disagreement there. I am fully supportive of that position and always have been. That is why I have never removed the History section from this article, nor have I tried to get the History of Unitarianism article removed, but instead have been promoting it. You, however, are taking this matter to an extreme, because you want to eliminate any references to the beliefs of Unitarians today. The fact of the matter is, Unitarians ARE known for rejecting the doctrine of biblical inerrancy, and they have been known for this for at least 150 years. It is a factual statement, and it would be inappropriate, according to Wikipedia guidelines, to place the entire history of Unitarian doctrine in the lead. That should go in the History section, and I am sure Charles will back me up on this. The lead is simply a brief summary of what is in the article.--[[User:Donbodo|Donbodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 02:13, 8 August 2011 (UTC)
:::::Please, everyone, follow the principle &quot;discuss the article not the editor&quot;. What is in the lead section should follow [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (lead section)#relative emphasis]]. Normally this means boiling down a lengthy article, such as this one, to a three-paragraph &quot;executive summary&quot;. I should say that, for any religion, information about its founding, when available, is very much salient information; as is a summary of the teaching, and information about the organizational side. That gives plenty to fill up three paras. What exactly those three paras should contain is easier to say when in possession of a worked-out treatment in the rest of the article. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] ([[User talk:Charles Matthews|talk]]) 10:16, 8 August 2011 (UTC)
::But the summary should not misrepresent what is in the article. The two statements about two of characteristic beliefs are broadly correct (it isn't quite so simply given the ongoing debates among Hungarians and Poles but more or less its true), but the inerrancy thing clearly isn't correct - this is a well documented controversy around Belsham's time, and doesn't '''have''' to be in the lede if it can't be expressed accurately. It isn't even true of the first generation of the Essex St chapel, nor for many Scottish and Welsh congregations in generations afterward. NB&gt;&gt; you want to eliminate any references to the beliefs of Unitarians today&lt;&lt; Inserting &quot;today&quot; &quot;from 1800&quot; etc. in front of references references to the beliefs of Unitarians today is not eliminating them. On the contrary, this article is weak on the beliefs of Unitarians today, since (apart from in UK) there is not much in the way of sources.

== Recent edits ==

Donbodo, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unitarianism&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=446877515&amp;oldid=443820416 these seem basically okay], but I'm a little concerned with the speed and confidence of some of the edits to related history pages [[Socinianism]], [[Polish Brethren]] etc. I just reverted an edit per [[Talk:Ferenc Dávid]] which imposed 1920s Unitarian belief over a Latin source text. If in doubt, discuss on Talk first please before &quot;modernizing&quot; the beliefs of 16th-17thC individuals. Thanks 02:31, 30 August 2011 (UTC)
== Person vs Being ==

Recently there have been a couple of edits that expressed disagreement with the word &quot;person&quot; to describe what there are three of in the Trinity or what there is one of in the Unity. The Trinity says that there are three ''hypostases'' (persons) in one ''ousia'' (being). I am perfectly aware that in the minds of many, there really isn't a difference between a person and a being, but in the Trinity there is. Unitarians have rejected the idea that there are three persons in one being and instead argue that God is one person and one being. Hence the &quot;unit&quot; in the word &quot;Unitarian.&quot; Because Unitarians developed their Christology in contradistinction to the Trinity, they always have, and could only, use the words &quot;person&quot; and &quot;being&quot; when comparing their beliefs to those of Trinitarians. So if these terms are rejected, then a contrast between Trinitarianism and Unitarianism is no longer possible. I am also aware that in the minds of some a &quot;person&quot; must necessarily be a ''human''. So they have expressed a preference for &quot;being.&quot; But if that word is used, then Unitarians are now in agreement with Trinitarians, because Trinitarians also believe that God is one being. No more difference between the two. Anyway, a person does not have to be a human. If we ever meet an intelligent life form from another planet, I am certain we will apply the word &quot;person&quot; to them just as much as to us. --[[User:Donbodo|Donbodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 03:07, 14 December 2011 (UTC)

Since Unitarianism does not believe in the Trintarian belief of three persons in one God, and that they do not believe that Jesus Christ is God.  Shouldn't the definition stating they are under the Christian banner be deleted??  If Unitiarianism doesn't believe in Jesus Christ as True God and Trud Man, then they are not Christian.  [[User:Betrue2011|Betrue2011]] ([[User talk:Betrue2011|talk]]) 23:15, 28 December 2011 (UTC)Betrue2011

:A Christian is a disciple or follower of Christ. Unitarians are such. --[[User:Donbodo|Donbodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 21:12, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

== Thomas Jefferson ==

Thomas Jefferson was recently removed from the list of American Presidents. His inclusion is controversial because he was never a member of a Unitarian congregation, but he did express sympathies in his writings. Unitarians frequently claim him as one of them.

== Creed ==

The creed is referenced to [[Summa Universae Theologiae Christianae secundum Unitarios]] but that article doesn't depict the content of the document.

As I understand from this and some other articles Unitarianism holds the beliefs below:

* There is only one god.
* Jesus is not a god.
* Jesus is a human being.
* Jesus is a prophet.

What I can't find are those below:

# Jesus was born via virgin birth (he doesn't have a biological human father) (?)
# Jesus is not the son of god (?)

Could someone please confirm if the first 4 are true and please indicate the position of Unitarianism for 1 and 2?

It is also necessary to put those information in the article to make it clear about the beliefs of Unitariansim.--[[Special:Contributions/98.196.232.128|98.196.232.128]] ([[User talk:98.196.232.128|talk]]) 07:46, 16 March 2012 (UTC)

:Unitarianism was simpler when it was strictly Socinian, but once American Unitarians came into the picture, Arian belief became a part of Unitarianism. So this means that some Unitarians believe in Jesus as a powerful spirit before and after his human life. Also most Unitarians accept that Jesus was the &quot;Son of God,&quot; but they have different opinions as to what that means. Some of them do accept the virgin birth, but I think most do not. --[[User:Donbodo|Don Bodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 22:50, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

If 4 is right, shouldn't Islam also be included as a branch of Unitarianism, probably historically related with Arianism? [[Special:Contributions/41.139.185.58|41.139.185.58]] ([[User talk:41.139.185.58|talk]]) 01:09, 12 May 2012 (UTC) Mortran

:Of course not. No one classifies Islam as a branch of Unitarianism or vice versa. [[User:Good Olfactory|Good Ol’factory]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Good Olfactory|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:42, 14 May 2012 (UTC)

:Unitarianism is Christian, so Jesus, as prophet, is the prophet par excellence, and not Muhammad, as Muslims believe. --[[User:Donbodo|Don Bodo]] ([[User talk:Donbodo|talk]]) 16:07, 22 May 2012 (UTC)

== Unitarianism, and its meaning ==

There have been a number of edits recently to change the lede, one to eliminate the adjective &quot;Christian&quot; and twice now to change the &quot;bolded name&quot; (which is always the article title) to '''Unitarian Christianity'''. I would like to address these edits.

This article is specifically about the set of Christian theological doctrines distinct from [[Trinitarianism]]. It is not about the beliefs or doctrines of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], nor is it about the broader pan-theological body of thought which has grown out from the UUA. Those other topics are addressed adequately in other articles. We can certainly link to those other articles, but the article itself should retain its current, narrow focus.

Added: I went back to look at this article, and saw that there is a link to the disambiguation page already, right at the top of the article, between the page title and the lede. I would think this is sufficient.
